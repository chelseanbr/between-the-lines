This is was not the staffs fault what so ever though! My card was being declined because of the purchase being too great, and there wasn't much I could do because my bank was already closed at this point (I live in SC, it was like Midnight there by the time we arrived for check in). I have major anxiety and after the 15 hour flight day, I was exhausted and an a panic attack was bound to happen at the smallest inconvenience. The staff there was extremely patient with me through my breathing exercises and though I felt like the worst kind of guest to have they never once treated me as such (and I know just how ""fun"" it is to work with a crying customer lol). Once all of that was done and we were finally checked in the room itself was very nice! It was a pretty standard hotel room. Two Queen beds, mini fridge, bathroom ect. But the VIEW was amazing! From our room we would see both the Diamond Head AND Waikiki Beach! Since our clocks were way off we were awake to see the sunrise almost every single day we were there. It was honestly breathtaking. Every day the beds were made, towels replaced, and some goodies left of us on the counter. The house keepers even went as far as to fold some of the cloths we'd left laying around! A bit unusual, but appreciated none the less as I'd never had a place fold our clothes before!We got breakfast vouchers with our room for each morning. The breakfast buffet was a favorite of ours! Each morning we'd go down and be seated with a fresh cup of coffee ready for us. There was just something really nice about sitting in the fresh air with a nice cup of joe to start the day. The buffet had a wide variety of fruits, soups (Yes, SOUP), rice, fish, eggs, bacon, sausage, cereal, juice bar, and even an omelet and waffle OR pancake station. Really it had all the works.The Splash Bar was a good place to relax after our days. The drinks they served were *chefs kiss* (this is internet slang for amazing). The Lava Flow was my go to. It was basically just a sugar slushie with some coconut rum in it but dang it was good. They also served food at the Splash Bar too, my favorite of which was the coconut shrimp. I must have had that shrimp at least 4 times while we were staying there. It was so tasty it stopped me from wanting to to other restaurants!Our check out was at 10am but we weren't going to be picked up to leave the island until around 3pm. The front desk let us check our bags for free so we didn't have to carry them around. Since we didn't have our bags we were able to roam the shopping centers and beach for a while longer before saying goodbye. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to the island for the first time.","Summerville, South Carolina",1,4.0

We were offered to change to balcony room when we arrived but as it cost a lot more we decided to stay as is. Glad that we did. Our room was a reasonable size overlooking car parking but nice and quiet. Bed very comfortable with good linens and soft pillows. Looks to have been updated in last few years. All neat and tidy. Did not look worn at all. Great location. 5 minutes walk to Cheesecake Factory. Beach 2 minutes walk. Parking not cheap $35Usd per night.

Not on the beach, but easy stroll across the street to Waikiki Beach, Kuhio Beach (the same stretch of beach) or Fort Derussy Beach Park (personal favorite). It's not flashy, it's pretty standard Sheraton, but that's all you really need. It's comfortable, clean, very Hawaiian in decor of the open-air reception and public areas, friendly reception staff. Bathrooms are on the smaller side, but do the job. They have proper dresser drawers, which I like, as it's a pet peeve when some of the modern properties don't have enough proper storage space. Pool is nothing special, but I don't hang at the pool when in Waikiki (unless it's the amazing infinity pool at the Sheraton Waikiki!). Room types on the website are pretty clear about which room types have the best views. If in the Tower Ocean King (as I'm in now), request an odd number room, as you can just lazily lay in bed and watch the ocean...it is vacation, after all. That said, I've stayed many times at this property, and even a partial ocean is good.For a hotel not specifically on the beach, and having stayed at so many Waikiki properties over the years, I definitely have no issue recommending the property.","Los Angeles, California",21,4.0

It was my 5th or 6th stay there and it was excellent as always. Perhaps due to my Marriott Bonvoy silver elite status, even though silver is not a high tier, I was upgraded to a ""Premier Oceanview King"" room in the Ainahau Tower, which had been renovated and had a great lanai with an absolutely stunning view of the ocean. You could sit on the lanai and watch surfers, catamarans and outrigger canoes all day. I find the service at the Princess Kailuani is always exemplary. From the General Manager to the front desk to the room attendants and breakfast buffet staff, they are all hospitality professionals, many of who have worked there for decades, and they provide a friendly and welcoming environment and courteous service. The hotel has a lot of history and has a nice Hawaiian vibe. I know some reviews are not great because of the age of the hotel, and I think the hotel acknowledges that it can be a challenge to keep everything up to standards when they are anticipating closing the hotel in a couple of years for a full makeover.... but they certainly try. Other notes: -The gym is decent and well used and has a nice outlook over the pool.-You get 15% off food bills with Bonvoy membership (any level)Overall, Hawaii hotels are expensive and I find this one to be great value. It's right in the heart of Waikiki and although it's not on the beach, on average you save at least $100US per night compared to even the least expensive beachfront hotel. And the pool desk will lend you beach chairs as well as towels for when you head across to the beach, and they bring bottled water to a designated spot on the beach three times a day. I would recommend the place for sure.",,1,5.0

We were on the 15th Floor with a balcony and ocean view. The rooms are a little tired looking but for the amount of time we spent in the room, it was fine. Because we stayed 8 nights, a complimentary plate of fruit, snacks and drinks was in our room. There was no note it was complimentary but we confirmed it was complimentary when we asked staff. We also had to ask staff for the daily activities available, there was no info on this in the room. We are used to staying in a hotel room that supplies body wash (only had soap), ceramic cups (only had takeaway paper cups), spoons (only had plastic straw stirrers), wine glasses and bottle opener. These little extras make life easier when staying in a hotel. The staff were polite and helpful. I feel communication could be improved either when checking in or in the room to explain the activities/amenities available (no info in room), as well as how the resort charge is applied to your credit card (new charge every day for a different amount). This would have meant us spending less time checking with staff. Overall we enjoyed our stay at SPK.","Robina, Australia",1,4.0

We are a family of 6, we have 2 rooms with 2 double beds each room. The beds are so small that our feet stick out of the bed and not comfortable to sleep in. None of us have had a decent night sleep since we got here. From day 1, we got here at 9.30 asked for early check in and got told to go sleep on a banana chair by the pool, till the rooms were ready. I asked if they could please contact me when our rooms are ready as my children were asleep on the banana chairs. We hadn't slept for over 30 hrs as we had an evening flight from australia and had been awake since the day before. They said they could not guarentee it would be ready before 3.00. However I kept going back to fromt desk and at 1.45 1 room was ready. The other not until just after 3. Since then we get woken up most mornings cause housekeeping want to clean our rooms. Why not clean the rooms that want early check in, I don't understand? The toilet has been blocked, they took the shower screen and didn't return it, we had to ask for it back. We have plastic glasses in our bathroom no soaps ect on arrival,the coffee cups are paper cups, what happened to glass? I plugged in the hotel hairdryer and smoke was coming out it's so old, it went red but there was no air coming out. I had to take it outside. What happen to 3.5 star and customer service. I did go down to concierge and ask for queen beds, apparently this hotel only have double or king. $80 extra per room per night for a rollaway. After paying a fortune to stay here and resort fees, I am questioning for what? I don't see anything special about the ""resort"" Nothing is included for the bonvoy marriott members, no breakfast, only a discounted price which is still $23.00 from $28.us dollar $35 Aud, due to the current exchange. I did ask what is the point of being a member when i joined in Fiji 3 years ago and they said breakfast included for adults children 12 yrs under pay child prices. I stayed at the Fiji resort and they were amazing. I have stayed at the sheraton on the park in Sydney a gift to my husband, from friends for his 50th birthday. They were both fantastic service and inclusions, here in waikiki however, I'm finding that their member get no benifits. I would have booked else where had i read the reviews. They take advantage of being under the sheraton umbrella, but they don't seem to have the quality the sheraton is known for.

Imagine the scent of 25 year old carpet, this is the aroma here. Boyfriend and I were in Hawaii for a total of 2 weeks, but decided we were going to adventure around different parts of the island and not stay in one place so we had tried out a handful of resorts each for a few nights. These included: Hyatt Regency Waikiki, Ritz Carlton Residences Waikiki, Marriott Ko’Olina, Turtle Bay North Shore, some were certainly better value / service then others, all of these properties were within range of what I had initially imagined/expected. After searching availability in Waikiki across the Marriott website, for the next 2 nights and finding that most standard rooms in any of the beach front hotels (westin Moana Surfrider, Royal Hawaiian, Sheraton Waikiki) were a 1 queen bed 274 sf ft room facing the back of the building.I am Marriott Platinum, but in the event an upgrade at checkin wasn’t offered to us we really did not wish to be stuck in any of those rooms. Instead we opt to book a slightly larger King room with a balcony in what stated was the newer tower at the Sheraton Princess Kaulani (Marriott category 6). Sheraton is a trusted brand under the Marriott chain that sets high standards for properties representing their brand and holding their name. Marriott category 6 properties for example are the W Hollywood or Lexington NYC to give you an idea for comparison as to what I was expecting this hotel to be like. Booked a KING bed for a 2 night stay as we were in Hawaii on a romantic getaway not teenage backpackers trying to squeeze into the same room and each sleep on our own Twin bed. As a Platinum Elite member , I go to elite checkin desk and she’s claiming she can’t find my reservation , so she’ll go ahead and make a new one. I pulled up the confirmation for her on My phone and she said oh sometimes our systems take awhile (I had booked this Atleast 1.5h prior). Oh well , I let her do her thing and all of w sudden I get a notification on my phone that a new reso has been added which is when I open up the app and realize I now have 2 reservations for the same nights. She says no worries I’m gonna delete one of them and then let’s me know she has us in a 2 twin bed room instead of the king I had actually Booked and on top of that no platinum upgrade to a suite. At this point had the presidential suite been available they should’ve rather put us in that VS this front desk agent sneaking around trying to rebook my reservation into a different bed number because they messed up. While all of this was happening another associate was laying out room keys in envelopes with names on them at least 20 ready to hand out , as a ANA flight had just landed on which they had a handful of guests who were gonna be arriving right away. So hold on, there’s guests that are not even present that you are holding rooms for ? And I am a platinum member , booked an upgraded room and am here present right not But you’re not gonna give me the guaranteed bed options / upgrade I’m entitled to? Tired and realizing it wasn’t going anywhere I just took the 2 twins and we proceeded to go up to our room thinking we were would just push them together or something. My boyfriend laid down on his bed for a total of 5 minutes prior to telling me we were leaving because this place was just not what we expected or had agreed to pay for. So he takes our bags back to the car and tells me he doesn’t even care if we don’t get refunded he’s not staying it’s that bad lol so I go back to the front desk politely let her know we won’t be staying as the 2 twin bed option simply won’t work for us. Instead of apologizing or looking in the system and trying to sort out something or even looking the least bit like she cared would’ve been better then her shoulder shrug and cheerful ok no problem I’ll uncheck you in and not charge, bye now LOL. WTFAs per Marriott’s guaranteed reservation program Platinum members that can’t be accommodated are entitled to a $200usd compensation AND 90000 points and the hotel is supposed to pay for your accommodations that night at a nearby property. She didn’t offer any of that and we were left to search for places ourselves drove around for an hour prior to finally finding the Laylow autograph collection, another Marriott. As soon as we arrived the agent was so cheerful and pleasant and just genuinely thankful for our business and welcoming. Such nice staff at Laylow , all marriotts actually. This whole Sheraton behaviour really shocked me. Which is why I do not believe this property deserves to be a Sheraton or be a part of Marriott’s chain. I hope someone from head office sees this and can address the issues with them personally / send in a site audit. ","Edmonton, Canada",10,1.0

Parking was $25 US a day, which you paid at the end once you’ve checked out of the hotel. Beautifully located on the Waikiki strip. Everything was within walking distance (beach, malls, restaurants). It was very busy with lots of tourists during the day and was safe to walk alone at night. Room- we stayed in a city view double room. The furniture seemed a little dated but the room itself was very clean. Bathroom was simple, a little small but clean. The balcony over looked the strip with a partial view of the ocean. Pool was a little small and would be quite busy with lots of families/little kids, very limited seating/lounge chairs were available. The pool closed a little earlier than I had hoped for, around 6pm. There’s a cocktail bar/restaurant by the pool.

And instead of getting bonus points if you are a loyalty member you can choose to get breakfast which is a $28 Buffet. The good deal. Let's start with the buffet it is a good mix of your normal hot breakfast items as well as some of the local items. They do have an omelet bar. All of this is included in the price or free if you chose to get the breakfast instead of the points. They do have waitresses that will serve you drinks. Is a very nice little restaurant in area 2 that opens up to the pool it is kind of indoor outdoor. The service here is second to none. Whether it's the front desk the cleaning crew or the people in the bars and restaurants they are all very professional but also very friendly.

This hotel is old and the rooms need updating but it is clean and comfortable. The staff are friendly and helpful. The best attraction about this hotel is the location, it is fantastic, short walking distance to all the good restaurants, shops and the beach. If breakfast isn't included it was $30 per person a day which is incredibly expensive but there are many places to get a good cheap breakfast just a few minutes walk away. The Splash Bar located in between the lobby and the pool is awesome and so easy to grab good quality, not too expensive meals and drinks especially in their happy hours. There is nearly always some form of music or live entertainment going on around the Spash Bar and pool which can be nice but can also be annoying if you are trying to rest in your room as the sound travels up and is quite loud but it does add to the Hawaiian atmosphere so you tolerate it. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere with walking distance to everything and aren't worried about it being modern and luxurious.","Melbourne, Australia",30,4.0

When we arrived to check in at roughly 630 pm there was no line at the desk. Two staff members were working with two customers though. We wait for roughly 15 minutes. At this point there were roughly 8 people waiting in line behind me. A third staff member came out from behind the counter asked if we were trying to check in then apologized for the long wait and said we would be helped shortly. At this point one customer was finishing up. A new customer walked up in the important person line. As the first customer finished I walked up to the counter. I was told she could not help me she had to help the person that just walked up. I pointed out how long I had been waiting and one staff member had apologized. I was told I would not be helped and I had to wait in line. I returned to line and was finally checked in after roughly 45 minutes total wait time.Upon check in I asked for two wine glasses could be sent to my room. I was told they could not help me with that and I needed to call from my room to the operator and request them. Getting to the room everything was clean from what we could see however the AC was not turned on and the room must have been close to 80 degrees. Before leaving for dinner I called like I was directed and asked for wine glasses to be sent up. I informed them we were going out to dinner. They asked permission to leave them in my room which I gave them. When we return from dinner the room had cooled off but there were no wine glasses left in the room. We were gone for roughly two hours. I called again and was told the staff is busy and they would be up as soon as they could. We planned to sit on the balcony, which we paid to have a nice view from, and enjoy a very nice $100 bottle of wine for our anniversary. We were forced to drink the wine out of either the bottle or the cheap paper coffee cups they leave in the rooms. Needless to say neither was a good choice and we choose to save the bottle. Over all my point is the customer service of the hotel is extremely lacking and needs to be fixed. There are dozens of hotels in the same price range in Waikiki. We clearly chose the wrong one.

I should have written this down. Both of these wonderful women have such a good vibe about them and truly stood out!! They made sure to it that our stay was amazing and it sure did work. And a shout out to Gingerlee, at the egg station, who accommodated my strange request of cheese with a little bit of egg. Lol. She’s awesome and she knows egg-xactly how to prep your eggs/omelettes just the way you like them! The hotel itself isn’t as pretty or fancy as the other ones. It’s pretty basic and tucked away off a side street. It’s still within walking distance to everything so that wasn’t a problem. The view wasn’t great and the rooms were a bit outdated. I felt like I was in the Brady Bunch episode where they went to Hawaii. But I hear they’re going to upgrade the rooms so that should be nice. If you’re okay with a decent room, come here. The customer service from beginning to end is great and they know how to make you feel like royalty. ",,0,5.0

Check in person was rude, one of my room was only going to be ready 15 minutes later and I requested for them to send the key up to my room when it's ready, he rolled his eyes and said no sir, they don't do that. I asked for a late check out at 2pm, normally as a Platinum Elite, I get 4pm easily, the lady at the front desk insisted that they can do nothing for me. My advise STAY AWAY!

Upon getting to the room it was of decent size for what we paid. The furniture definitely needs a retouch of sanding and paint or needs to be replaced. The cabinet containing the mini fridge was too difficult to open. It got stuck every time I tried to open it and then open the fridge.One of my main concerns came when I sat on the bed and the mattress popped up (rm 811). I am a man of size, 6'2"" 300 lbs to be exact but I have never had a bed mattress pop in the air to my recollection (It certainly did not at the Westin LAX where we stayed the night before coming to you. The beds were amazing. I chose them because of the great stay I had at the Westin ATL Airport a few months back). After I assessed, the bed frame is actually a double or a full and the queen mattress hangs over the bed on both sides. I did not make a big deal because we were only there for 2 days but we had to make sure not even to lean on the bed’s edge while sleeping or we would have slid off and I am not exaggerating. I ask that you really take care of that issue because someone could get hurt.Moreover, the bathroom in the room was the nicest/newest thing. As for how to turn on the shower, I had to call the front desk to receive instructions on how turn on the shower. I travel extensively. Not a great design choice. The lady that serviced our room was so nice. Shout out to Miss Helen! Thank you.The second concern I had was with the amenity fee. I have no problem paying a resort/amenity fee if what is listed is provided. There were no activities listed for Saturday and Sunday which makes people who book for the weekend feel less appreciated. There was no time listed for ukele and Lai making lessons. When I asked the agent said it happens at the other Sheraton property down the road. I should not have to walk to another hotel unless I have a room to recline in at that hotel in addition to my room at your property. I asked about the fruit at the pool and at the beach. I was told that they bring fruit out at 11, 1 and 2, that was also not on the paper. I looked for fruit at the pool when we went out for the day on Saturday at 11am, none was present, only fruit infused water (not the same as fruit). I was at Waikiki beach and nobody from the hotel was out there with towels, fruit or water asking for Sheraton guests in the section where they said they are supposed to be. It just does not happen and the hotel knows that. The pool concierge were friendly though.Upon check in I was not offered a go pro or the wireless device but I saw them in the display case. What is the stipulation to use them, must a card be swiped for that as a deposit? Never got an answer from management.I want to emphasize that I DID NOT ask for a room move, an upgrade, dinner or breakfast, I am not that kind of person. I just want to get what I am paying for. I EMAILED THE this same statement to a Brian Hashimoto 4 days ago as a courtesy, but he has not responded. Perhaps he was on vacation. I give this property a 2.9 star rating because the carpet in public areas and in the room needs to be replaced. The staff members are all friendly and they outshine the sketchy amenity fee.","Queens , New York, United States",1,3.0

Let’s start with the positives... The hotel is very close to the beach, and is a short walk from probably over 100 restaurants. The view from our room on the 20th floor was wonderful (we were fortunate enough to have the corner room). The hotel offers a large continental breakfast which is free if you have a high enough status with Marriott. The check in process was terrific, as was the entire staff during our 10-day stay. The room was plenty spacious and the bed was comfortable. There is a pool and a poolside bar/restaurant on site which many people seem to like. Pretty much everything is clean. The WiFi has been reliable throughout our stay. And now for the neutral facts... The hotel has a parking garage connected to it, which is $35/day. The hotel also charges a daily resort fee of over $30/day as well, which includes several amenities (including the ability to check out towels to take to the beach), though is not quite worth the cost. They also offer a dinner buffet every night for $35/adult. They have a Polynesian-themed dinner show onsite for $100+, which is a pretty standard rate, it seems. And now the negatives... the four elevators were slow. I often had to wait more than a minute for an elevator, and a couple times I waited for five minutes. Maybe I’m spoiled, but I’m used to getting elevators in seconds, not minutes. The hotel itself could use some renovation; it clearly shows some wear and tear from the years of business.

The hotel staff were so polite and accommodating and stopped at nothing to ensure my dad and I had nothing but excellent and professional service. As our flight arrived early in the morning and check-in wasn't for at least 5 hours, the gentlemen at the front desk arranged our bags to be taken and provided us with a temporary key to access hotel amenities while we waited. Not only did he ensure we were notified every step of the way, but he placed us on a priority list to arrange my dad and I a room ASAP. As a result, we got a room at 12:30 pm instead of 3pm, which made the start of the trip so much easier, especially after 10 hours of flying. The Pool staff and staff at Splash bar were such a treat, my dad and I looked forward to going to splash bar every day of our trip for a happy hour drink and meal. It was such a nice place to hide from the sun and refresh ourselves. What made it even better was the professionalism and service of the staff. They were so friendly and loved to chat. A special mention to Herbert, and his awesome bartending skills. The boys and girls running the pool desk were so friendly and helpful during our staff and offered us amazing tips and places to visit while on Waikiki beach.The housekeeping staff did an amazing job every day, making sure coffee and bottled water were replenished as well as making sure we came back to a cleanroom. A major feature we loved about staying at the Sheraton is the Bonvoy discounts and ability to room charge at other Marriot hotel chains nearby. It saved me bringing credit cards and cash to the beach when I could instead go straight to Moana Surfrider and charge to my room. The only criticism I have is the $35 a day parking rate. As my dad and I stayed in a room each and was both paying a $33 a day resort charge, the added cost of parking did manage to eat into our travel budget and prevent us from partaking in some activities. We were wondering why parking wouldn't be included in the resort charge or at least a little cheaper, as renting a car in itself is already a significant investment.Other than the parking charges, the stay was really amazing and a huge thank you to all the staff for their excellent service and friendliness.","Melbourne, Australia",31,5.0

I told her several things about my personal life while checking in and she remembered each and everyone one of them and sent a card to my room that night and mentioned them all in her card.

I have to say, the Princess Kaiulani really won me over! Are the rooms tired? Yes, absolutely. And I don't see that improving in the next couple of years, because while I was there, Marriott had posted a sign indicating they intend to apply for a permit to tear down the Princess Kaiulani in the next couple of years to build a huge tower hotel complex on the site. (An employee there said they had been told it would be closing in two years for that project.) But if that happens, I for one will miss the old-school, mid-century vibe of the SPK as it is! The location is unbeatable, right on Kalakaua Ave, a half block from the public park where the Duke Kahanamoku statue stands on Waikiki beach. The pool is fantastic -- one of the bigger pools we saw in Waikiki, and saltwater too! Lots of seating around the pool, and live music and entertainment during happy hour. We loved it! The Splash bar was great for post-dinner drinks: more live music, good bar lighting (some of the Waikiki bars seemed TOO brightly lit!) and a great vibe.The service was spectacular. All the employees I interacted with were friendly, attentive to detail and helpful. I so appreciated the upgrade to a partial ocean view room, the birthday cheesecake they left in the room, and the lei I was given upon check-in! Pros: *Great location*Large saltwater pool with lots of seating*Friendly, attentive service*Live music and entertainment at happy hour and post-dinner*Great value for Waikiki*Comfy bedsCons:*Dated rooms*Poolside rooms can be a little loud (pool closes at 7, but live music near the pool happens until 11)","Chicago, Illinois",49,4.0

Prior to our stay, I had spoken with several of the hotel staff about a specific room type as we were celebrating our 19 year anniversary. After checking in, we were informed that our request could not be honored because the hotel was sold out. The manager Brian, was very dismissive and curtly stated that: "" I should have booked directly with the hotel and that we can move you to another room but it will be in the same booking category."" The toilet in the room (525) was dirty and malfunctioning. To their credit, housekeeping did come up to clean the toilet, but we were exhausted and declined their gesture. The manager Robert, was very helpful in submitting a work order the next morning to have our toilet repaired. I was very disappointed that a member of their guest services team did not proactively contact us to improve our experience. My perception was that; because I used a thirty party booking system (Priceline) that my request was not a priority. I literally had to go down to the front desk the first 4 days of our vacation to inquire if a room with a view/balcony had become available.

Was a business trip, not vacation. We've also stayed at other Honolulu properties in the Marriott family and reviewed those on this site. We had a very good stay, based upon what we paid. For context, our rate included the breakfast buffet each morning and waived the resort fee.Pro's: - Friendly staff. All staff we encountered were very friendly and positive. Front desk as especially welcoming, including a complementary lei. - Room was nicely clean and orderly. Everything worked just fine. - Was part of our room rate...the breakfast buffet was quite impressive. A very large variety of foods, well-prepared. Omelet station, eggs, bacon, sausage, waffle, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, Asian breakfast items...and I'm sure we missed things. Quite a large spread. Our guess is it would retail at about $25 a head on Waikiki. - WiFi worked fine too. - Location is great. Across the street from Mona Surf Rider, diagonally across the street from Waikiki Beach. Nicely, not on Kaulakau Ave, so there is some buffer from all the street noise. Other notes, which some may find a bit of a detractor: - For us, the $35/night resort fee would have been a deal breaker. The photos tell the story about the pool. Frankly, we didn't see anything we'd term ""resort"". It's a nice Waikiki Beach hotel.  - The rooms are about due for a refresh. Everything was clean and functional, yet if one seeks bright and sparkling, marble countertops, new furniture, etc, that's not SPK. For us, it was fine. - We read the comments on noise. We were in the original/shorter tower (building that contains the front desk). We found the sliding door to the lanai did a good job minimizing noise from the pool area, including the live music in the evening. Yet, the walls are a bit thin; we could hear the guys next door pretty clearly. We usually have business in Honolulu about once a year.

The bar man practically threw our cocktail together and slid them across the bar. We only had one each day and the same thing happened for 5 days. We decided to have dinner at the pool bar on the last night and my friend got told by the waitress with her hand on her hip that Aussies are difficult and we got a lecture about ordering things from menu's and this was all because she wanted the whole wheat bread option that was on a different sandwich on the menu. She did get the bread but the waitress made out she was doing some very big special request to the chef. And then after being offended and feeling like you want to cry they expect a tip. No Hawaiian welcome at this place. We didn't expect anything and got nothing. We had plenty of money and were happy to tip so they lost out with us. The other restaurants around were happy for our custom.","Port Macquarie, Australia",6,3.0

A great member of staff during both my visits was Floyd, a bellman. Does the hotel proud.The bad on both stays. The exorbitant resort fee. Honestly giving me 2 bottles of water a day and the promise of maybe getting some service at the beach does not come to +$30. A big rip-off in my view. The lack of “greenness” of this property. Plastic cups everywhere, toiletries still in small individual containers ( and new containers provided every day despite me still having plenty in the open ones). I would honestly prefer toiletries in dispensers and only paper cups if. They cannot provide glass/ceramic.My first stay I had a partial ocean facing room in the second wing. The room was large with two “king” beds and a lovely balcony. The issue I had with this stay was the staff. My checkin and checkout were awful ( checkin probably a lot worse).On my second stay I was allocated a city view room in the Princess tower. Elevators were slow ( appears only 2 of the 3 were working) and the room was TINY! This time I only had a single “king” bed ( two people cannot comfortably fit into this bed so am glad I was travelling on my own). The TV blocked my access to the window and honestly was not worth the money charged ( cost me more than the first room!). This time again had an awful checkin with the young man telling me “ you are lucky we are letting you have the room early”, 1.5 hours before the official checkin.

My boyfriend and I arrived a little early before check in time and they were still able to check us in. The room itself once we got there was very clean. The hotel also gives 2 free water bottles per day and a water station where you can refill your water so that definitely saved us some money! By the pool you can find more water bottles and some fruits as well! The hotel also offered free beach towels and beach chairs which really came in handy! Right next to the pool was a small little coffee shop that was nice to go to in the morning. Every worker was always smiling and so welcoming at the hotel! Another great thing about this hotel was the amazing buffet! We ate at the dinner buffet on a Saturday night and who can say no to all you can eat crab and prime rib!? Amazing! One main reason I’m giving this place 4 stars is because of the time the pool closes. I’m not sure how late other pools are open until around the area, but I just personally feel that 7:00pm is a little early to be closing the pool especially since the sun is barely setting at that time during Spring. I would’ve loved to end my nights by the pool like I did in past hotels on other islands, but I missed that experience here. Unfortunately, I didn’t step in the pool once in my week long stay since my boyfriend and I were constantly exploring the island and shopping outlets until it was dark. And although the beach chairs are free, returning by 6pm is super early since sunset is around 6:30-7pm during spring time. Keep in mind that parking can also be a bit pricey at $35/day, and sometimes the lot can get full. Fortunately my boyfriend and I got lucky with parking every night but there were some nights where we only saw a couple spots left!Other than that, I had a wonderful stay! Thank you!

Nice pace, pool not crowded...they offer free beach chairs and free fruit and bottles of water at the pool. Nicest staff ever.

Let's talk about the location first, it's close to the main road, loads of resturtant and bars around, beach is by walking distance, airport is like 20-30 mintues around, depends on the traffic. And if you been to Guam, this Sheraton is exactly the same, there's big balcony in every room. As a platimum member, you may expect a room upgrade to suite, but during Christmas period, I think it's impossible. So I got a basic room with a partly ocean view, not exactly the corner room though. So for the room itself, I won't say it speciaous unless you count the balcony as well. The decoration is very old-fanshioned and basic, nothing fancy, so if you are here for a honeymoon, you better pick another Sheraton that located at the beach, surly the time is two times higher during holiday. And there's not much amienty in toliet, you may ask them though. And I'd say the breakfast is the highlight for first few days, but the last day totally ruin our impression. We still here til boxing day and everybody looks so upset and grumpy that morning, we try to ask for coffee, but all the staff just keep ignoring us or pretend they didnt notice us. After 20 mintues we finally get the coffee. For the breakfast, it's baisc western choices, bacon, egg and sausage. And like every corner in Hawaii, you would find rice and soup as well.In short, if you coming here in the peak season like Christmas, don't expect quick service and don't expect much. The only best thing here is the location. So if you just want a hotel close to everything and your budget is tight, here you go.","Cape Town Central, South Africa",64,3.0

After quickly getting us checked in they went into the back and came back with flower lei's for us all. Special treat for my nieces, as this was their first time to Hawaii. Later that evening after we went out to explore and grab some dinner we came back to a mini chocolate cake with chocolate covered strawberries that said Happy Birthday, box of chocolates and iced tea. How delightful was this for my niece who felt so special !! Our stay for 6 nights was wonderful, beds were very comfortable, everyone including the housekeepers met us with a smile and warm greeting. I feel that the hotel on a whole contributed to make our stay as best as possible. The men at the concierge desk helped us plan our day excursion to the North Shore and mapped out places of interest as well as lunch options. They did a great job in doing so. We stayed a few days poolside and Kelsey the server for the Splash Bar was very kind and friendly. Everyday she kept us well hydrated with our favorite drinks and snacks.

The property is clearly aged (aging would have been 15 years ago). Elevators, corridors and bedrooms looked great 30 years ago...but in 2019, It is a disgrace from Starwood now Marriott! (Please check the two pictures I am attaching). The location of the hotel is great, and the people working there are doing their best to make their customer feel special. The owner is probably making so much money (the room was not cheap), that he has not reason to tear down the property and build a new one (I am afraid that given the state of the hotel, this is all they can do). So the location is good, and the staff is up to par. But they are many other hotels in the area, the other Sheraton is not far, and there is a Westin managed property accross the street...so if you are a fan of Starwood or Marriott hotels, treat yourself to an experience you deserve. (I have not visited nor checked any other property in the area, so you might want to do some homework before hand). Last but not least, the breakfast 'buffet' is a total riff off! Over $30 for this?

I was also incredibly relieved to hear that I could get a room at 11:00 AM, which is a bit earlier than the normal check-in time. However, I did make this request known to the hotel several days in advance via e-mail, and also via the Marriott web-check-in service. As usual, the front desk has no record of this communication.The room:I booked an ocean view king room, and received exactly the same thing. I was expecting something better as a Platinum elite, but didn't receive any upgrades. Perhaps I should be happy because I was allowed to check-in early? I don't know... would have been nice to be given the choice.Parking:I had parking charged to the room, and the front desk issued a parking permit to show upon exiting the parking garage. Nobody told me I was supposed to have kept the original parking ticket issued by the machine, and I was royally chewed out by the ridiculous parking staff lady upon my first exit from the garage. She demanded my drivers license and recorded down all of my information. I wonder where all of that went?The Bill:The rate that I reserved included a $25 credit that could be used for anything at the hotel (with the exception of the resort fee, which of course, is absolutely ridiculous and should be waived for elite members, but that's another story...)Upon check-out, I was told that the $25.06 charge I had at the bar had not posted to my account, but not to worry, once it did, they would automatically waive the $25.00 leaving me with a $0.06 balance charged to my card.No surprise, the next day I see a revised bill with the ENTIRE $25.06 charged to my room, and also this charge posted to my credit card account.Post Service:My bad, I left a cell phone charger in the room. Let my mistake be notice to anyone staying at this hotel: it is a HUGE hassle to get anything back, so please be careful and do not leave anything behind.This hotel has a lost and found department that has banker's hours, e.g. they are only available during weekdays, during bank hours. You will not get your stuff back during the weekend.I reported my loss in person at the hotel the next day, and was told to simply pick up the ""house phone"" and ask for lost and found. Seriously.. I went physically back to the hotel during business hours and had to pick up a phone! How ridiculous is that!The guy took my info. and said he would call me back if they found anything.

We stayed at Sheraton Princess in Waikiki and although it’s not ocean front it is approximately a 3 minute walk across the street to the Waikiki public beach access! The hotel itself is okay, nothing too spectacular but for the price it’s all we needed. The pool is underwhelming so if you are looking for a pool I’d look elsewhere. Overall the location is prime! In the heart of downtown Waikiki, shopping galor and bars and restaurants as far as the eye can see. Also, we rented a car so paying for parking was anticipated so when I found out we could come and go as we pleased in our lot for $25 a Day was a major bonus!

The location is superb, directly across the street from the Westin Moana Surfrider and Outrigger on the Beach. Yes, it is an older property and many of the rooms are in need of renovation but the rooms are spotless and well maintained. Being Marriott Platinum did get me upgraded to an oceanview room and what a view that was! The pool area is lovely with live music every night. Of all the places that I have stayed, this felt the most like I was in Hawaii. If you are looking for a sleek, modern hotel, this place is probably not for you but if what you want is something that is clean, in the most perfect location and feels like a throwback to old Hawaii, then give this place a try. The staff is fabulous. From the gentleman at the check in counter, to the Bell Desk to Colleen at Pikake Terrace and Shanna, Rick and Eric in the bar, I was treated like a valued customer.

Many of them are old and lack the amenities/polish of newer hotels, but they charge insanely high prices due to their location. The SPK is an old hotel, and if you go to most major cities, you wouldn't consider it a ""4 star"" hotel relative to other 4-star hotels. But for hotels on Waikiki Beach, the SPK is pretty comparable to everything else out there, and it costs WAY less than most of its competition.So here are the details from my early January 2019 trip - rooms are pretty old and small. No real way around it. The swimming pool is tiny compared to the pool at the nearby Sheraton Waikiki. Unlike some other hotels, it's not directly on the beach but you have to cross the street and go half a block to reach the sand. But, everything is reasonably clean and neat. The hotel buffet is pretty good and less expensive compared to other hotels in the area. The location is fantastic - there are lots of great restaurants and stores in the immediate vicinity. The hotel lobby is also pretty spacious, so there's a lot of room for little kids to run around and amuse themselves while their tired parents sip on a tropical drink.For Marriot/SPG elite members, know that there's no club on the property. Platinum members will get breakfast buffet vouchers for 2 people each day, which saves you $60 on food. Not a bad deal.","San Francisco, California",13,4.0

We didn't know it at the time but this was a great deal in the Waikiki area. Kids get breakfast for free, 2 bottles of water and a fruit everyday are complimentary with the resort fee which was waived.CHECKIN: Very pleasant, Jason thank you! Gave us a great room with no neighbors on the 22nd floor in the Tower. Fumbled with waiving the resort fee but got the job done with some young manager. Sent a person to help with the luggage, who delivered all our 9 bags to the room! Kids were given a candy necklace which they enjoyedROOM: 22nd floor with a view of waikiki beach, the pool and the road, good but not as good as the Moana or the other Sheraton. Big enough to fit a family of four, central AC works good. Glass sliding door allows some road noise, need some ear putty for a good sleep. We had no immediate neighbors and could not hear any noise from within the hotel!! TV had netflix (that was all we needed), WiFi was fast. The fridge was standard beverage cooler, small but fit a couple wine bottles, food and some milk.RESTROOM/BATHROOM: There was a leak in the tub which was not fixed, no fans and the floor was not very clean. The person that has remodeled the bathroom has done a very poor job. BREAKFAST: Pretty good. Scrambled eggs, omlette station, potates, meats, Asian options and regular bread and other baked goodies. Coffee served at your table. There were a bunch of birds picking up leftovers and another bunch of rude employees chatting at the front and doing nothing. You had to present two coupons for two adults if you booked the room with breakfast, else you pay $30 per adultKIDS: Couldn't eat breakfast without the coupoun or use the pool without adults. The staff is also quite grumpy with children, this hotel is not a good option if you have high energy kids. ROOM SERVICE AND PERKS: Very good, you get extra blankets, hair products, curling irons etc. We also got the gopro camera for free but make sure you have an SD card (we used our phone SD card) else it costs $30 to buy an SD card. You get free beach towels and chairsPARKING: $35 a day which has to be paid upon checkin and spots are always available, if you are in the tower, park higher and you can access the elevator from the 4th floor. There are no elevators in the parking lot. You do have to keep your payment receipt for parking else you get charged $50 and this receipt has to be presented each time you leave, irritating but understandable. Parkling lot access is through a very small road, so it works if you have a subcompact or a small car. LAUNDRY: $5 to was $5 to dry 45 minutes, $3 for detergent. Very expensive but does a decent job. No laundry bags provided. MICROWAVE: $10 per day to rent, but we were not chargedCONCLUSION: This is a very good option if you are staying in Waikiki. Great value if you can escape the resort fee and get a breakfast option. Behind the scenes, management is working hard to improve your experience",,12,4.0

I will get that out of the way first then I can actually review the properly on its merits.So most of the food venues were closed, housekeeping was intermittant and a lot of the usual services were not in operation. This I could deal with, everything was avaliable such as amenities, towels, but you just had to get them yourself. The tough part was the noise of the protestors. My anger is not at the hotel for this, rather the union and the local police. The started as early as 5.50am banging pots and pans and chanting and it went on until 10pm at night. The hotel compensated with no resorts fees and a few other things thrown in. All of the staff we dealt with were pleasant and tried their best. I found Melanie to be very pleasant even though she was there everyday listining to the compliants! But the noise was really hard to get past. You couldnt sit on your balcony and relax because the noise was just too much. The police just stood by and watched the protestors be rude to people, chanting that they will not stop the noise until they get their contracts. This is uterly disrespectful to all people that have saved to go on holidays, celebrate milestones and have downtime. Their beef is with the hotel, yet they contiue to affect the whole of the Waikiki area and all of those people that dont deserve their holidays to be affected. All I can say is they are not doing themseleves any favours by being rude, noisy and generally disrepectful to the public. Now I can comment on the hotel....The hotel has a bit of a 70's Hawaiian feel, could do withsome upgrades but overall its got a good vibe too it. We stayed in an Oceanview Room, these do have a great view over Waikiki. The rooms itself is a little small but acceptable. The bathrrom is a bit crowded also and didnt have any sheleves to store your toiletries on. The room was a little dusty, not sure if this was from the labour strike or just that it needs a little bit of love. The double beds were a bit saggy and small. Pillows were flat and lifeless!We ate at the breakfast buffet and I am sure there were some diferences from the stike but overall the tables were cleared regulary, the food selection was good, the line up for omletes was a long. For a American hotel breakfast it was good. I did find the platic plates and cultery a bit odd but I am hoping thats because of the labour strike.The pool area was really quaint, pool isnt large but I never found it over crowdered. The sun lounges were comfy and you also never had to look too hard for one. They played Hawiian music around the pool which was really nice, maybe a little louder than usual to drown out the protesters! The guys that manned the pool area were really nice. They had beach chairs, water, icy poles, sunscreen and were always helpful when you asked for something.The rating that I have given is largely to the location. This is a great spot to be able to walk to the beach, shops and great resturants. The pricing on this hotel is pretty good compared to a lot of the ther beachfront properties that charge for location. On this stay I didnt need to pay the resort fee but if I had of it really brings down the value of the property. The resort fees are really a waste, what you get is not worth what you pay and I really feel the hotel would have a lot more people happy with the property if this charge wasnt added.The beach chairs can be bought at the ABC store, no childrens gift was given at checkin, the only things that really have a value are the bottles of water (once again can be cheaply bought at ABC) and the wireless interest (which was never even offered).Based on location, price and generally being a pleasant hotel I would stay here again....lets hope with no protestors though!

We ended up getting our resort fees and parking fees waved, which saved us about $600...so yea, you bet I will take out my own trash and call for towels to save $600!! My only complaint was that we booked thru a travel agent and they requested us to have a room upgrade as it was my husband and I's anniversary and at first they put us in a room on the 8th floor. The room was an older one that had not been updated, there were several stains on the sheets and I just felt like the room was dirty.

I cannot get a refund so am stuck here ( for another 3 days) but would have preferred to know rather than being all happy and excited and then let down.I have never left a negative review before an am genuinely disappointed to do so but I cannot let this go. No offer of anything other than an apology for the noise.I am sat here writing this listening to it as its not just this hotel but you cannot escape the noise and i am on the 14th floor,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",10,1.0

They told us the 'resort fee' would be waived! Really? Given there was no service, geez, I'd expect that! Secondly, because we booked hotel through a third party, no refund of breakfast was offered. We did receive one nights' free accommodation.I would still recommend staying at this hotel - it's a great location and usually great service.

I just want polite staff & a clean room. Neither are here due to the employee strike & one has to wonder how much Sheraton/Marriott are just hoping this will fizzle out.We arrived Sunday & there was no word or warning that 6AM the next day, the hotel staff would go on strike. The hotel has a duty of care to inform guests of disruptions as they become aware of them. The negotiations have been ongoing since June, 4 months now & incoming guests should've been given an opportunity to book somewhere else, now we're stuck for another 4 nights still & cannot rebook because every other hotel now is on rack rates due to the 5 hotels now emptying nearby.We're in a room we paid extra for a view, that has not been updated in 20 years. I thought the Sheraton name was 5-Star (though relooking trips advisor has them at 3.5 star). AND... we still need to pay for the resort fee. Resort fee? What? This is a hotel near the beach, not a resort. Why is this not in the fee I paid when I booked the package through Expedia?Here is a few of my gripes:- Limited staff at check-in, though the next day there was no staff due to strike- We arrived early (12 noon), room not ready which we expected & we're dragging our own bags around the lobby. I suggest that the hotel should take bags to your bell desk not reception & then the bags could've been put in the room as soon as it became available. Instead, we had to dig out a bag tag before the receptionist would then send the bags up- ""I'll be helping you to check in today..."" was what the receptionist said. I know this, I am standing in front of you- Wallpaper is falling off the walls & is dirty- Lifts are being turned off regularly & the lift on the left (out of 3) has only opened once since we've been here causing lines & overcrowding- Pool closed one day due to no staff- Housekeeping closed with our room not cleaned now 5 days with 4 to go. Yes, we are staying near the beach & tracking in sand every day. So yummy- Collecting our own towels & toiletries from the lobby- Woken every day around 6 AM when the protesters start banging drums. This morning they were so loud, my bed was vibrating- No restaurants or food available. Though on the first night, we were served a cocktail by the most loveliest lady, I wish I got her name- Ugly bins in the floors to deposit our own rubbish- Toilets near the gym are those non-water ones in the urinals & now 5 days in without cleaning, are starting to reek. Don't go in, be warned!The most upsetting part is the hotel management. What are they doing during this crisis, & yes it is a crisis to make the stay as comfortable as possible for those guests sticking it out? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We can hear the protesters with the doors closed 24/7& they block the entrances & intimidate the people coming in & out with DON'T CHECK IN, CHECK-OUT!

There is no bar open or restaurant so I suggest to bring your own alcohol and food to get through the day. But you will get a resort fee refund - so if you can persevere you could save a few dollars, plus you save a fortune in Tips as there is no service staff.

I was very excited about using my reward points for the first time and to be taking my mom on her first trip to Hawaii.I booked my reservation via the SPG website for 3 adults in a room with 2 double beds at the Sheraton Princess Kauilani. A total of 140,000 points were redeemed for 5 nights (4 nights with 1 free night) and $172.75 in resort fees ($35/daily). The reservation was for Jan 2019 which is nearly 5 months out. I was pleased to see that I had just enough points to be able to book the hotel stay. I then purchased the airline tickets right afterwards on my SPG Amex card.Checked my account the next day under ""MyTrip"" on the SPG website to forward a copy to my sister. To my shock & dismay, apparently, my confirmed reservation was TAMPERED with and it showed 1 king bed instead of the 2 double that was originally booked. To make matters worse, I was slapped with $400 'extra person' charge ($80/day) which was never included in the original confirmation that showed only the resort fee of $172 but no charge for additional person when I reserved it for 3 adults. All these changes were made (by the hotel) after my reservation was already confirmed and made without me even being informed of any changes. My anxiety level shot through the roof when I saw the additional $400 charge since I had already purchased non-refundable airline tickets. Luckily, I had made saved copies of the original confirm reservation. It allowed me to compare the differences and note what was changed so I could report it. I called SPG member services and spent nearly an hour on the phone with the representative at SPG. She called the hotel directly to checkout the discrepancies. I was informed that a staff at the hotel had made changes to my 'confirmed' reservation from 2 double beds to 1 king bed because I had made a comment under the ""special request section"" of my reservation for an ""Accessible Room if possible"" to accommodate my mom in a wheelchair. Initially, I was informed by the SPG rep that the hotel stated that they didn't have ""accessible rooms"" with double beds which was why our room was switched from 2 double beds to 1 king and that the hotel is not aware of the added $400 charge. (Bogus! ) Also, you would think that such a drastic change from 2 double beds for 3 adults to 1 king bed for 3 adults would require some sort of notification or email by the hotel to the customer. But none was sent to me at all.When I inquired further why a $400 extra person charge was added to an already 'confirmed reservation' at a fixed rate of $172, the SPG rep indicated that she couldn't see the charges on their end in the system and that the hotel could not see it on their system either even though it was clearly evident under the SPG website under ""MyTrip"" reservation. I offered to send both the SPG rep and the hotel staff via email copies of both the original confirmed reservation showing only $172 in charges and the tampered reservation showing $572 in total charges with 3 adults. Eventually, after further discussion with the hotel by the SPG rep, it was discovered that indeed there were ADA accessible rooms with 2 double beds and that we would be putting us in those with the $400 fee for additional person charge removed since we were using SPG points and the SPG points does not charge for the additional 3rd person. To put a smoke screen in all of this by the reps, I was informed that it was a coding error by the hotel since they have only one code for 'ADA accessible rooms' for king bed and the hotel does not have another code for the 'ADA accessible' double bed rooms which completely makes no sense at all since inventories of rooms are tracked meticulously by hotel staff.The SPG rep assured me that she would add notes in my account to make sure that we are given an ADA room with 2 double beds with no additional $400 charge for the extra 3 person.What really upsets me in all of this and what I have learn:a) Hotel staff can tamper with a 'confirmed reservation' and change what you have agreed to purchase ""after"" the agreement is already made without your consent.Lesson learn: Save all documention immediately following your original reservation so you have a backup copy of what you 'agree' to purchase.b) Double check everything before your trip so you don't have problems such as this issue at check-in which would be a nightmare scenerio especially when traveling with a disable elderly person.c) Find a reputable hotel... I realize that I was not given honest answers through the whole process. How are they allowed to tamper with a ""confirm reservation"" without notifing anyone especially when the bed type is changed without consent and the total cost changed so dramatically? How can a hotel with 1,152 rooms not know that they have ADA rooms with 2 double beds automatically? How come the hotel can't see the charges applied on a reservation like the $400 extra person charge that was added to my reservation? Unforuntately, I have already purchased 3 airline tickets so I'm not able to cancel the hotel reservation. And since I don't have enough points to switch to another Sherton property, I'm stuck with this reservation. If I had more points, I would completely cancel this reservation and move elsewhere and not deal with this type of dishonesty for profit.","Kirkland, Washington",8,1.0

The hotel is centrally located - just across the road from Waikiki beach and in the heart of shopping and dining options.

For the location and in comparison to surrounding resorts, in my opinion it is reasonably priced - especially if you manage to find a deal that includes free nights for part of your stay.We had some trouble with our first room - the layout was logistically not viable for 2 adults and a 4yr old to stay in with a double bed right against a noisy wall air conditioner unit, amongst a couple of other issues. Having said that, I could not fault the customer service provided by the reception staff member Bryce/Bryance. His problem solving skills and patience dealing with one jet-lagged Mumma after more than 24hrs in transit were second to none and there was no stress in resolving the situation.I would recommend this hotel for location and value for money compared to other nearby options - save a little on your accommodation and spend more on your holiday experiences!","Toukley, Australia",11,4.0

PRINCESS KAIULANI:She was appointed Crown Princess of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and was next in line to be queen had it not been for the overthrow of the monarchy. She died at the young age of 23. LOCATION:Talk about centralized. Being smack dab in the middle of Waikiki makes walking convenient and Ubering cheap. It's walking distance to Waikiki's highlights like the International Market Place, Royal Hawaiian Center, and the Waikiki Yokocho. ATMOSPHERE:It's an older property but well-maintained. Vehicular access can be annoying as you have to yield for droves of pedestrians due to the sidewalk that fronts the property. The tower we stayed in rose about 10 stories with another taller tower next door about double its height. The hotel's pool and open-air restaurant greets you with the registration desk off to the side. The small pool harmoniously blends with the hotel's outdoor restaurant along with the businesses and public sidewalk of Kalakaua Avenue giving you great people-watching views but not much ""pool privacy"". While it was busy, it never felt over-crowded. ROOM:Our room overlooked the pool along Kalakaua Ave. via a small balcony with chairs and a table. Bedding was comfortable though a little springy. While no built-in charging ports were available, a handy power strip was found under the bed. A/C was strong. The floors, ceilings and walls are thin, so we experienced a lot of noise from the room above us in the morning, possibly from a small child running around, or a noisy housekeeper banging things with the vacuum. BATHROOM:Shower-tub combo, single basin, good water pressure and drainage. RESORT CHARGE:At $33/day, the perks are multiple (see my pic) but appeals to a certain market. Parking is not included and rings in at an additional $35/day. That's why we Uber!SERVICE:Ziggy checked us in. He was friendly and professional. The male associate who checked us out was friendly but I didn't even receive a simple ""thank you"".A big mahalo to the security officer I spoke to after getting home as we left a CPAP breathing machine in the room. He was very helpful and gave clear instructions on what to do. LOST & FOUND:I've never heard of chargerback.com but that's who they use for lost and found items. Filled out a simple form online, paid for shipping, and received our item via USPS in under a week. FITNESS CENTER:While I didn't use it, I saw it from our balcony. It's on the second level and overlooks the restaurant and pool. TIP:They have a nostalgic mail letter drop, the type that starts at the top floor and goes all the way down to the basement, with access points on each level across from the elevators.

Nice bar too! I stayed here for a week in a nice, very comfortable renovated room that had a terrible view (parking lot) and bird poop all over the balcony, but that didn't matter to me as whenever I wanted to go outside I just... left my room. I didn't try the food here other than the food cart by the pool near the street which sells a great acai bowl and coffee. The common areas of the hotel could benefit from a bit of renovation, and I didn't quite like that the elevators weren't secure (anyone can go up to any floor without a key) but I was happy with my room. Other than the nice room and amazing pool, the real reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because I idiotically left a large amount of items in my closet when I checked out and the hotel not only tracked them down immediately (including an expensive designer blazer) was super duper nice about mailing them to me.

We were in the Kualani Tower Room 1189 on the 11th floor. This tower is so dated and in desperate need of refurbishing. It smells of stale cigarettes and is musty. at first glance our room itself was okay dated with maybe a bathroom renovation done in recent years but the step in bath/shower is awkward and the toilet space is tiny! The towel rail is above the toilet and is loose. There were also no shampoo or conditioner in the room - this was rectified when I asked for it the next day.The biggest problem we had was the air conditioning. The room was so hot and the air conditioning just did not work properly. We had the temp set to 18.5 C (65F) and it was still hot in the room and it was so noisy we couldn’t sleep. After the first night I called reception to ask if there was anything they could do. The lady who answered was very understanding and explained that their systems were down. She said they would get a repairman to come and look at the unit and would let me know the outcome and if there was anywhere else available in the hotel. I never heard another word from anyone. The air conditioner did seem a little quieter but still the room was too hot to sit in. The safe didn’t work properly it was flashing battery when I told reception they said we would have to be there for that to be looked at - we didn’t bother. We went to use the ironing board it collapsed every time you put any pressure on it.I’ve read reviews about mini bars there certainly was no mini bar in our room.One morning when we went out for the day there was a room service tray left out the front of someone’s room - it was still there when we returned at 10pm that night!We stay in Sheraton properties every year and to put this property as a category 5 astounds me. The location is great but there are plenty of other hotels with a great location!! I am sure the rooms overlooking the ocean are better but unfortunately I won’t be back to try them.

They had more outlets around the room including USB outlets. The rooms have the option to be adjoining, which means that they're not very soundproof around the adjoining door. We could hear our neighbors talking. The bathrooms are pretty small and even in the renovated room, the shower/tub is not updated. I was surprised by the lack of towel holders/hooks in the bathroom. It's a beach hotel and it would have been nice to have a place to hang our wet swimsuits. The location is pretty amazing -- close to the beach and a ton of shopping and restaurants.

To start with, the location alone is wonderful, you would be hard pressed to find a hotel at a better location within $100 of this resort. The staff are fantastic, facilities are good and free GoPro hire and Wi-Fi dongle are the icing on the cake! The resort pool is never too crowded and the close proximity to the beach means you are spoiled for choice. Coming from Australia, our flights get in very early in the morning and the PK staff have always allowed us access to a complimentary room to 'freshen up' when we arrive as early as 8AM, they staff have also gone above and beyond to grant us early check in, a life saver after those red eye flights! I cannot speak more highly of this resort, yes the room are not ultra modern, but that is part of their charm. Whenever I close my eyes and think of Hawaii, I think back to the sunsets on the balcony of my pool view room, listening to the music, a cold drink in hand and watching the ocean.

Being on the 4th floor, we weren't too high up and could sit on the balcony and enjoy the music, without getting vertigo. Our room was immaculately serviced, Reception gifted us a bottle of champagne for my husband's birthday and staff were always courteous. Used the Splash Bar and Pool quite frequently.

In room safe, king size bed, adequate closet and drawer space, a lanai with seating and a refrigerator. Now a couple things that I had to figure out when I arrived was for some reason the TV and refrigerator were unplugged and when I called the front desk they asked me if I checked that. Of course not, I simply assumed that things like that were taken care of. Simple fix, no problem. The cleaning staff was awesome and very responsive to my needs and schedule, which I appreciate immensely.

It's nice to feel like a tourist every once and again, so we took the time to drive in from nearby downtown Honolulu to the PK for an over-nighter. First of all, there are 3 other Starwood properties in Waikiki (including the Sheraton Waikiki, the Moana Surfrider and the Royal Hawaiian). Of all the properties in the Starwood family, the Princess Kaiulani is the most value-priced (even though we paid around $300 after the $35 resort fee, $35 parking fee and taxes). Yes, even though it is the most economically priced...it still puts a dent in one's pocket! Enjoy the splurge!!!The last time I stayed at this property was prior to the refurbishment. Happy to report the renovation/refresher packs a huge improvement! The fact that it is less ""lux"" than its sister properties, it more than makes up for in comfort and amenities. To name a few: every room has a balcony (a must in Hawaii so you can enjoy our trade-wind breezes while sipping on a glass of your favorite cocktail...or starting your morning with a cup of java); each room has a mini-frig (to stock up on your essentials like soda, cheeses and yogurt); a water dispenser in the lobby near the elevators (so that you can fill your own hydroflask for the day and do away with plastic bottled water -our ocean honu turtles thank you for that); towels and beach chairs are free for the asking (for when you venture a block down to the famous beaches that Waikiki is known for)!I requested an early check-in (Saturday at 10am) and a late check out (Sunday at 4pm) and both were granted. So thrilled they could do this for the kama'aina (locals)! Much mahalos!While here, we used the gym facility which was quite adequate and offered more machines than most other hotel gyms. But why not get a workout in the pool instead? So we headed to the pool... We enjoyed the pool very much. It is not overly crowded and we did not have any trouble finding chaise lounges for us. We also split a burger and a smoothie with very friendly pool-side service. Never had a roasted pineapple in my burger before, but it was divine! Tip: If you can find it in your budget, splurge on an ocean view. I live here, and it still leaves me breathless! What an indulgence for the ocean view to be your last sight before bed, and the first think you wake up to in the morning!",,43,5.0

When we checked in l requested a beach view but we could only get a partial view which we were still happy about! We also had an amazing view of the pool area and it was lovely listening to the island music from the band in the afternoon and evening. Yes the place is a little outdated but l think it’s still a beautiful place to stay. The bellboys were quick to take our luggage off us to take to our room! The staff were courteous and helpful. The foyer, bar and pool area were great to just sit and relax. We bought cocktails which l thought were quite reasonable. We never had any meals here as we found it more reasonable going to Royal Hawaiian Centre Food court. I think the pool should be opened longer at night as sometimes we would be out all day and still want to have a swim in the pool after 7pm but that’s when it closed so we would have to go over to the beach which lm not complaining about that as the sunsets were amazing on Waikiki beach. We stayed here as part as our Cosmos stop over so had no choice in this hotel but l noticed it’s quite expensive to stay at, so if l was going to come to Waikiki Beach again l think l would go to the hotel next door, the Ohana Waikiki East by Outrigger which looked really good and was quite reasonable for money and still close to everything.

The rooms aren't top-notch in decorating terms, but we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in December 2017 and paid through the nose for a room that was frankly no nicer, and the staff at the Hilton had no interest in their guests except to add extra items to their bills. The central location of the Princess meant we could pop back to the hotel in the afternoon for a swim and reasonably priced pool cocktails, then go out again for dinner and more shopping :) The only complaint is that the pool is really deep with a very small shallow end, so all the kids had to cram into a small patch.

I was supposed to arrive from Big Island and leave for Korea the next day. I spent a lot of money on hotel during in Hawaii(Trumph int'l Waikiki, Disney Aulani, Hilton, Maunakea beach resort), so last day was just a short time, so I chose the Sheraton Kaiulani for the cheap price. But it was a big mistake. With the credit card I used to check in, they were approved for my dinner at the hotel. and it did not cancel credit card approval (approximately $ 140) even though it paid cash for resort fees and dinners when checked out. The cancellation of the credit card authorization was not immediate, so I was waiting believing it would be canceled.However, the credit card payment was not cancelled and was withdrawn from my account. I've sent a lot of emails to Sheraton But their answer to come back -- I don't know because there's no evidence... I should have received a separate cash receipt. I just got a zero bill only. Of course I knew there would be no problem. Because I have been doing this -Use credit card when checking in and pay cash when checking out.- to other hotels. So where did my cash go ....??????? I felt sorry for choosing the Sheraton name. Dinner was good because it was cheap. It was relatively cheap considering the price of Hawaii. I wish I had not paid double the fee for double payment.Anyway, since there is no evidence at the hotel,---They say they have never received my cash. CCTV is at the wrong angle and they can't see me paying cash. Should I waste my golden time just now only for $ 140???I think I should make this issue known so that no one can be harmed.I hope no one else will have problems like me in the future.

Also watch out for them in case they miss you.Across the street at Kings Village, there are vedors that set up there in the evening. Go to the very top, you can get pad thai, fried rice, chicken, shrimp, beef, etc on skewers. I took pad thai and chicken on skewers for $10. and it was a lot of food and also very good! Down at the bottom they had fresh salads, fruit and pastries for dessert. These were being sold anywhere from $2. - $5.00. It's definitely worth it and fun to buy from the locals. Back at the hotel our local tour desk guys were awesome, helpful and soooo friendly :) And if you want to rent a car, go to our tour desk guy. As a guest you will receive 50% discount on car rental. Pick up is immediately across the street. It's so convenient.","Calgary, Canada",4,4.0

The foyer area is all modern but very busy. Did not get the Aloha experience or feel getting off the shuttle as we have previously at other hotels. The hotel room 622 in the Princess Kaiulani tower was so old the furniture seen better days , bathroom so small with no extraction fans so was rather smelly. View from dirty balcony was not too bad. After first night requested a change in room due to state of bathroom and after 3 days were told they upgraded us to a more expensive room on the tenth floor. Well the bathroom was the same size but with extraction fan so minus the smell. Room furniture was slightly better, comfort of bed and pillows was much better and room appeared more airy, but been an upgrade from 6 to 10 you not paying for a better room but a better view. The pool is not very practical as there is not much room just to stand around in the pool as it gets very deep very quickly. You cannot stand around the sides of the pool either as it so deep. Pool rather small for the size of the hotel. All the social media photos make it look amazing but it is not. Resort fees are a rort, activities offered to guest should be complimentary and getting MiFi and 1 day GoPro , which if you are not aware of, is not highlighted or advised at time of booking would be cheaper to buy yourself. The other service that is part of this resort fee is the beach cold water and fruit service , which we did not experience as it is o my offered in front of The Sheraton Waikiki which is a bit of a walk from SPK. Only thing going for this hotel is the location.","Gold Coast, Australia",1,2.0

They are much quieter than the front rooms though a little dated and in need of updating. They have windows that can be opened unlike rooms with balconies where you have to keep the doors open if you want fresh air. The reception staff are always very helpful especially Sharen and Erin who have done much to ensure we have the room we want. The breakfast buffett is good though over priced in our opinion. We also had dinner in the restaurant one night and found it to be good with a wide range of dishes.

Nice bathroom products and plenty of tea/coffee each day plus bottled water.With the air conditioning on, the room was still too hot for us at night so requested a fan and kettle.These were both bought to us straight away which was lovely and with the fan on at night the room was a good temperature.

At check-in, we were upgraded from a partial ocean view room to a full ocean view room for our 5-night stay. The views of the mountains and beach were fantastic, and the patio has plenty of space to hang out and take it all in. Shortly upon settling into our room, housekeeping delivered a complimentary bottle of wine with a note from the guest relations manger for the occasion we were celebrating. This totally took us by surprise, and was an incredibly kind gesture. As SPG Gold, we received two free breakfast vouchers for our stay. There was a mix-up with the date on which they expired and after talking to the front desk, the manager on duty told the person at the desk to give us two more vouchers for the ""hassle.""

It's freaking Hawaii, with views that are endless, weather that is perfection and Aloha spirit for miles. I've stayed here 3-4 times over the last 6-7 Christmas vacations with friends and family, usually 4-5 rooms for the bunch of us. We are loyal. We are reasonable. Obviously a bit price sensitive as well.They've done some work on the Princess. In the lobby, mostly. It's back in the rooms, though, where it really is...not great. This year, we were on the 9th floor of the original tower, which features great views of and over the Moana. The view is awesome. The beds are STILL heavenly, something Westin is known for. So, that's the most important stuff. It's just for the first time I really noticed the furniture, carpet and walls are super duper tired. Enough to actually affect your mood. One of our rooms actually only had one undersized picture on the wall. There was a 4"" tear in the wall paper that flopped in the breeze...We split our trip into two hotels because we had different groups coming and going, overlapping. We spent the first 4 nights at the Princess and then moved over to the Outrigger.Let's just say that we booked 9 nights at the Outrigger for Christmas '18. I almost wish it was otherwise.

Staff were mainly friendly. We were in an updated room which was very nicely decorated and booked a partial ocean view. We were on the North side of the tower so could see ocean and mountains. The downside is that you are also overlooking the international marketplace and the (I assume) air conditioners on top are on constantly and are very noisy, the first few nights we had trouble sleeping. The last time we stayed we were overlooking the pool which I think is a better option.I also don’t think the resort fee is good value. Image attached. Last time we stayed we at least got a couple of free drinks at the bar as well as the wifi and phone calls. The Go Pro rental we thought would be great for our helicopter tour, but then we were told we had to purchase the SSD card ourselves (for $US30) and for something we don’t have use for it was a waste of money - Why offer this as an inclusion in the resort fee and then charge for the card which you need to use it? They could easily include this and wipe for the next user.Everything else on the list wasn’t worth anything to us.We had the buffet breakfast included which was convenient and generally pretty good. I like that they employ older workers there.We used the pool a couple of times, generally could always get a sunlounge and while the pool isn’t huge, it’s perfectly fine and flows nicely from the bar and breakfast area.The only thing I really wasn’t happy with was one of the bellhops ‘suggesting’ to a taxi driver that he point out to us a hotel on the way to diamond head that he said Mark Twain had stayed in. We’ve been there before and we know the way to diamond head so lucky for the taxi driver he did not take us the long way around. It did not sit well with me and we did not appreciate this tactic.

We had opted for a city view as it was cheaper but when we checked in our ""view"" was of a brick wall! Seriously six feet or so outside our window (room 327) was another building! NOT ACCEPTABLE. I requested a room change and they were gracious enough to allow this This was by the elevators but a far superior view. The rooms in the photos are NOT the only rooms in the hotel, these rooms are pool view/sea view and the ones on the other side of the hotel have NO BALCONY and are considerably smaller - bear this in mind when you book. There is sufficient space if all you intend to do in the room is sleep. Upon arrival we had a hamper of fruit, juice and dry food snacks, which was most welcome (we were told this was because we were long stay guests - 7 nights). The pool is smaller than I had expected but as we went in March there were always loungers and it was big enough for our needs but I imagine in the better weather it would get crowded. Free towels are available with your room key and I saw many guests take these over to the beach (less than two minutes away). The splash bar has happy hour between 11am and 6pm and the drinks choice is good, many rum based cocktails if you are into that sort of flavour. The food is a bit overpriced and there are better options outside of the hotel, that being said the seaweed popcorn was nice (special mention to Letitia!!). The staff were lovely, all of them and so friendly and helpful. The show is held three nights a week and is well worth seeing - pick up a voucher book from the lobby and you can get 50% of a second cocktail and show ticket so $90 for a cocktail and the show for two people or the premium dinner inclusive package for $120 each or there about. Its definitely worth seeing it was one of my favourite parts of my vacation. The AT&T free myfi option was also very welcome and saved me lots of money in data and roaming fees. It is the little touches like this that made the hotel a great one. . I don't know if its a US thing but the hotel don't provide shower gel like a UK hotel would. They do provide shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and soap so I'm glad I packed my own! They provide flannel, hand towel and bath towel, although the latter is quite small. The room did come with a fridge so pick up a few drinks and they'll stay nice and chilled in your room while you are out. They gave us two bottles of water every day (included in the resort fee). our room had a detachable clothes line over the bath for drying swimwear etc and a full laundrette in the basement $5 for wash and $5 for a dry.

The good things first:- The bed was fantastic and gave me really good sleeps. - My room was always clean and well prepared by the maid. - Most staff I interacted with were friendly and nice. The tour desk staff is very knowledgeable and provided me with good advice. - The location is very good. Everything in Waikiki is within easy walking distance. Now the downs:- The interior of the room is old and cheap with furniture looking like 1980s plastic. The cups for coffee and water were paper and plastic, which reminded me rather of a youth hostel. To sum up, the room didn’t feel like Sheraton. It clearly needs an upgrade. - Windows aren’t sound-proof. One could well hear the noise from the street and from the pool area (live music in the evenings).- I had to complain twice before the drain in the bathtub was de-clogged. Before, I had to cut my shower in fear that I might flood the whole room. - The breakfast buffet is just ok. Not really many choices. But at least the hotel caters for the Japanese guests. - I’m particularly annoyed about the “resort charge” of roughly $35 per day (see picture for details). In my mind, it’s a barefaced rip off with a number of “benefits” that nobody needs: free breakfast for a child if you don’t travel with one? Let alone if breakfast is included in the rate? A promotion booklet by local retailers and restaurants? I would expect that the things one really needs, like free WiFi, was part of the service without the need of being mentioned, as it is international (=non U.S. perhaps) standard. Because of the “resort charge”, I follow the contributor who wrote about this hotel on 26 March 2018 and deduct one point from my rating.Given the price I paid per night, I conclude that value-for-money is not very good. The hotel doesn’t fulfil what one would expect under the Sheraton brand. Thus and despite the good things mentioned, I can not recommend this hotel. ","Berlin, Germany",69,2.0

The beach is across the street, and the beach services make this the first place I’ve ever stayed where I felt the “resort fee” was 100% worth it. Plenty of towels, free comfy beach chairs, and they even have staff members who wander the beach periodically offering bottles of water and fresh fruit. A staff member even offered my kids a free popsicle when we returned our beach towels. This property is an excellent value, in a spectacular location, staffed by folks who seem happy to make you feel welcome and valued. We will definitely be back.","Boulder, Colorado",35,5.0

Platinum member, expected a better room, but happy with the maid service which kept my room really clean. Nice staff, generally reasonable prices, good facilities, but I automatically deduct one star from any property that charges a ""resort fee."" It is a lie, it is just a way to show a lower room rate for the booking sites. I have plenty of friends in hotel management that readily admit this. Sorry, I'm sick of it and I'm going to call it out from now on. It is particularly galling when I'm on a business trip and have no use for what they claim are ""resort amenities.""

Not sure where to start but let’s start with the water “spray” that soaked our carpet in our room for two days in our entry way and closet area. The water you know has done that before and the room definitely has a “funky” smell to it. I feel sorry for the maintenance guy who had to fix it and look us in the eye knowing it wasn’t the first time by his explanation of “must be a clogged pipe......again!!!” The pool area is small and definitely doesn’t accommodate all of the hotel guests. We got to the pool early on Monday and got some good seats while waiting for our kids. As the sun shifted, we moved our chairs to capture some sun after two rainy days. We were not blocking access to the pool, walkways or anything, just giving our kids some sunshine to lay out in. The pool “staff” quickly came over and said we couldn’t even move our chairs or, let the umbrella (which by the way was shading ONLY our chairs) down. We asked him how can we get sun and his response showed a complete and utter lack of customer service when he said “go to the beach, there is sun their”. A beach with 3,000 people and waves that will knock you over. There are reasons people lay by the pool versus going to the beach....completely oblivious and quite frankly and obnoxious answer. The check in was with an individual who wasn’t interested in being someone who would make the stay pleasant, but rather someone who seemed bothered by the fact that he had to do his job. Between not being able to move chairs and dodging the little red fire ants along the pool sitting area the day was uneventful...One bright spot was a young man who was working at the desk the next day, who worked with us and provided some info and some good answers to questions. Understanding this was spring break, there seemed to be very few people from the US here, and it was mainly some wonderful people from South Korea and a Japan, many who I had some fantastic conversations with. Great people who tell me they love coming to Honolulu for a vacation and getting away from the hustle and bustle of their lives..Not sure how our check out will be but I am going to assume interesting to say the least. No call from the front desk with an apology but hoping for the best.Do not recommend this hotel if you are looking for relaxing or quiet...noisy main road, terrible views, loud people, parking garage with no space (and a $35.00 per day parking fee added to your bill)....","Happy Valley, Oregon",4,2.0

The International Market Place is next door, Kings Village is opposite with a few take-aways attached (KFC, Subway etc) and also a large ABC store next to that. It's a short walk to the beach and handy to bus stops. The hotel itself has a good atmosphere. The Splash Bar by the pool is great with good happy hour prices. We stayed in the older tower which we found still good. Large room with refrigerator. I think though when booking a room you need to get at least a pool view room as some of the rooms would just overlook the car park which wouldn't be as nice.

The lobby and pool bar etc are unchanged and welcoming, and the staff friendly, but the rest of the hotel is pretty tired, and service is lacking. Our room in the tower over looked the beach and the small balcony is fantastic, but the rooms are tiny - and I mean tiny. The outdoor furniture on the balcony was old and stained, the bathroom barely big enough to swing a cat, and three nights there was no hot water! The beds are comfortable but there isn't enough room for more than one tired old cane chair (the same one as our first visit 12 years ago!) in the corner of the room so one of us was forced to sit on the bed to watch TV in the evening. Add to this the fact our room didn't get made up on three occasions and when it did they still missed things like replacing the coffee, or the cups, or the creamer (It was hit and miss and never once done right) and the fact that they now slug you $35 per day for parking (that used to be included the 33 dollar a day resort fee) and the place isn't the value it once was. On previous visits we had things like complimentary drinks on arrival and a free photo by the fish pond. This visit we were supposed to get access to a GoPro camera and a portable wifi device but no-one seemed to know anything about it at check in and the ""service desk"" staff didn't either so we gave up on it.

But it is not just the location - the open air lobby opens up to the small pool (with great pool chairs), pool bar and the buffet; area artisans set up shop near the lobby. Rooms from the tower showcase beautiful views of the bay and the mountainside.Rooms are well kept and clean. The bed is comfy. Air-conditioning worked just fine. The balconies make the room! The only problem we had was the shower... the water flow was practically non existent. It took me a long time to wash my long hair. The bathroom is in desperate need of updating. And they need better towels.Front Desk staff provided a quick check in and out experience. They offered insights to area sights and greetings everyday. The breakfast buffet was delicious. They presented so many options... an omlette station, pasteries, fruits, salads, country cooking, and Japanese fare. You can’t leave here hungry. In fact, if you are waking up at the crack of dawn, this buffet will keep you growling stomach in check until lunch time easily. Everyone working at the buffet was friendly and we never had an issue being seated instantly. Easily a highlight.We were happy with everything (minus the shower), unless you consider the parking. Parking was another matter entirely. It is pricey - $35/day! That was obscene and the people that run the garage could be impatient and inflexible... do NOT forget your pink ticket or they will make you think the world is ending. The garage is not well marked. Our first trip into the winding monster meant we parked floors away from the hotel access point because there is virtually no signage. Turns are tight. Not everyone that parks there parks smartly meaning that tight spaces are even tighter. Since we sandwiched out Hawaii trip with Oahu, we only rented a car for 1 of our 2 stays this trip. You honestly don’t need a car in Waikiki... rent your car when you need it only. Save yourself this tacked on expense that is not included in the resort fee!

Parking was $35/day which my work thankfully paid for. Parking structure often appeared full, but i was always able to find roof deck spots available. The $16 per person shuttle to and from the airport is actually not a bad deal, since we paid $38 for a taxi for 2 ppl, before tip. At times there were long waits for the elevators, while they were very fast, inexplicably a few would go out of service during peak hours. As SPG gold members, we got a priority line for check-in/check-out, we received breakfast buffet tickets for not 1 but 2 breakfasts ($30 value each) on two separate occasions. I got a room on the 21st floor, some things in the room seemed much more recently updated than the bathroom tiles which seemed very old. Bedding was comfortable. Lanai was a nice feature, but i got freaked out looking down. The city noise/construction site next door is quite loud at night. Fitness center was located in a ballroom with chandelier lighting, but i loved that it was very spacious for free weights, HITT, floor exercise purposes. View of the pool is included. Splash bar will give you free nori flavored popcorn with drink order. Splash bar service was very good at noon on a Monday, but otherwise i did not get to enjoy. Free live music or hula dancing most nights around the pool area. We barely took advantage of any of the resort fee ($30/night) inclusions.Staying this far into the heart of Waikiki, I will say it took 20-25 minutes every morning, leaving at 7am to get on the H1. It took 10-15 mintues to get on the H1 when i left at 6am. Also returning in the evening, the total commute took 1 hour, when theoretically the drive should have been 35 mintues (from East Side/Kailua).

Room: The room was as expected - clean but dated (there's a reason this place is way cheaper than the other SPG hotels nearby). However, the large balcony and breathtaking view more than made up for an older room. The room has a fridge for personal use, a coffeemaker with tea and coffee, and one of the best hotel hairdryers I've come across. Housekeeping was great. They replenished everything consistently, and even provided us extra coffee, water, and cups without us asking. Our room was adjacent to the housekeeping area and service elevators. Surprisingly, this location was really quiet. We never heard the elevator or staff. And when we did see staff in the hallways, they always gave us a big smile and answered any questions we had.Bar: The bartenders were incredibly nice and accommodating, and the drinks are reasonably priced for a Waikiki resort. The bar offers complimentary popcorn with seaweed/furikake that is delicious.Pool/Beach: The pool felt cold to us, so we didn't go in. We either went in the ocean or sat by the pool. That being said, many kids and adults were in the pool everyday. There was plenty of seating, too. The drink/food service at the pool was fast! We rented towels and complimentary beach chairs to take to the beach every day. The chairs were a big plus. The pool station also offers ice pops and fruit..Location: You are right in the middle of everything, and directly across from the beach.

We checked out at 2 pm, hit the beach and happy hour, and came back to shower. The hotel offers a room for an hour so you can freshen up before your flight.

The property was pretty average across the board.A couple of specifics that did stand out: (1) The gentleman that checked us in was competent but couldn't have been more disinterested in his job. (2) Our room was recently updated, but with somewhat tone deaf design choices. For example, there was very limited counter space in the room so you really had to pick and choose what you could bring out of your bag and the narrow ledge above the toilet was positioned such that the toilet seat couldn't stay up without being held in position.Overall, since we only showed up, slept, and left in exchange for saving a few dollars, I am not sure I would retrospectively change my plan. If this is a real vacation day for you, however, I would recommend staying at one of the much nicer properties within blocks of this one.

After 12 days it felt like the walls were closing in. Would definitely look to get a larger room next time. The room itself was ok, bathroom seemed dated but otherwise comfortable sleep. To be honest when you are in Honolulu you aren't spending time in your hotel room...Had breakfast at the buffet once and while the food was ok, it was very expensive and as we are not big eaters was not worth the money. Sometimes the smell of breakfast/dinner goes through the elevators, should have some air freshness in the elevator as the smell can be off putting sometimes.Splash bar is great to enjoy a few drinks by the pool or after a day out, staff are friendly and service is pretty good.

Good nightly music, however the music at 6.00am every morning through the speakers was fairly loud. Would not hesitate to stay here again.","Mount Maunganui, New Zealand",45,4.0

Our room was a decent size for a short stay, we had a poolview room and from the balcony also had a glimpse of the ocean. The hotel is in a great location, easy walking distance to the beach, restaurants, shopping, bus and tram stops are also close by. Although we did not eat at the restaurant we did enjoy a few light meals at the Splash Bar. Service in this area was efficient and the wait staff were particularly friendly and polite. We tried a few menu items and sampled the daily cocktails, our favourite meals were the Coconut Shrimp and Buffalo Wings. The NOT SO GOOD – we went to bed early on the first night after a long flight from Australia and were woken a few hours later by an emergency evacuation alarm (twice), which turned out to be a false alarm, thankfully. The pool is not huge and there was a shortage of sun lounges at times. There is a guest laundry available but it does cost to use the washers and dryers. The hotel is quite dated and could definitely use a bit of a revamp but our room was clean so we were satisfied. As others have stated the elevators can be slow but we found it to only be a minor inconvenience at peak times.The DEAL BREAKER – we did not unpack our bags as we were only staying a short time before heading off on a cruise but while we were in Waikiki I purchased 2 new dresses to wear on the ship. One was just a beach/pool cover up but the other was a nice evening dress which I intended to wear to our anniversary dinner. I hung both dresses in the wardrobe to prevent them being creased and unfortunately I forgot to pack them when we left. Once onboard the ship I realised that I had left them behind but did not have any phone service at that time to be able to contact the hotel. I called Guest Services when I was able and advised the staff member what had happened, assuming that housekeeping would have noticed the garments when they were cleaning the room and put them aside. Guest Services tried to direct my call to the relevant area but they were not answering and eventually she took my name and number and said they would investigate and call me back. Nobody returned my call that day or the next so I called again and was told that I needed to complete an online form for lost items. I explained that I had already called and left my details and was still waiting on someone calling me back and I was not able to complete the online form.When we returned to Waikiki I followed up with the hotel again and advised that I would be making my way down to collect the dresses. This time someone from hotel security called me back and stated that nothing had been ‘handed in’ from our room but he would double check with housekeeping and get back to me – I’m still waiting. I accept responsibility for the loss as it was my error in leaving the dresses behind but can’t help feeling disappointed that I had to call three times before the hotel investigated (or not) and although the garments were not hugely expensive one in particular certainly had sentimental value to me.Would we stay here again? NO - holiday makers are spoilt for choice around this area and if we return to Honolulu I would not choose to stay here again.","Bundaberg, Australia",46,3.0

Here are my observations thus far:The good:Location - you can walk to just about anyplace in Waikiki.Pool - you can find sunshine all day long, and shade too if you prefer.Friendly staff. The bad:Room - tired decor. No new shampoo bottles after we used the original bottle from checkin.Termites - in our door which leave us little piles of gnawed wood every day. See pictures! But, better termites than the other, unmentionable bugs! :) We have reported these critters each day to the hotel. But we still have our new ""pets.""While the staff is friendly, upon checkin, there's very little instruction on how the resort works - other than you'll be paying a big resort fee. Are there activities? Where do you get the ""refreshments"" by the beach? And, I requested a daily newspaper, but have never seen one. The good news is, at the end of the day, I'm in Hawaii!","Phoenix, Arizona",28,3.0

We chose this hotel for location and price. Neither of us are big city/big hotel people but we had a good experience at this hotel despite it being both! Parking is around the corner from the hotel and costs 35 dollars per night. The hotel allows you to park until midnight of the day of your checkout, so if you are planning to walk around Waikiki just leave the car in the garage. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a room with an amazing view on one of the top floors of the tower. Simply gorgeous. The room was basic but was very clean and did the job. Elevators, as others have mentioned, were not as frequent as they could have been but this is not the fault of the hotel - its an older building and only so many elevators were built.I must give a shout out to one amazing employee - Ziggy on the front desk. He took the time on our check in to answer questions about the island and even made recommendations on where to drive and what to do all with a smile. This young man is a shining example of what a welcome to a hotel should consist of. Thanks, Ziggy - you made our visit.The resort fee of 28 gives you beach towels, beach chairs, and internet access among other things. If you are only staying for one night, really it's just you paying for internet but I imagine if staying and going to the beach, having the chairs/towels/etc provided would be amazing and well worth it.The reason for the 4 instead of 5 rating is that on the morning of our checkout we went out to eat and returned to our room at 10 am (checkout is 11). After waiting for elevators for quite a while, we arrive at our room to find out that keys don't work. Housekeeping was there but would not let us in, nor would they radio down to the front desk. We had to wait again for elevators and go back down. We were then told that the timers on the door locks were not in sync with the real time so we were locked out because the doors thought it was after checkout time. We were also told it was a known problem and they had been trying to solve it for some time. Here's a simple solution. Program the keys with a later checkout to reflect the time the doors think it is. That way, guests will not leave with the last memory of an otherwise great stay as one of extreme annoyance. I truly hope the hotel has now solved this issue.We did not eat at the buffet (as we don't enjoy that style of eating) but did eat twice at the pool bar and it was great!!Overall, I would stay here again. Thanks again to Ziggy for making our stay memorable.","Barrie, Canada",119,4.0

There are two Sheraton’s in Waikiki so don't be confused as we originally were. This review is not about the Sheraton Waikiki which is much larger and more expensive. The PK lacks some amenities of the higher priced hotels but offers a pleasant stay at a reasonable price. While walking around we saw some other hotels in the area that we knew were even cheaper but when we visited them we knew that we definitely would not want to stay there.Here are some notes about the Princess Kaiulani.The entire staff was very helpful and friendly offering more service than I expected and made our stay very comfortable.The pool is small and the shallow area for the kids is even smaller. If you have a big family they will probably be bumping into each other.The pool side restaurant bar offered very tasty treats at a decent price for a mid-afternoon drink and snack.Breakfast at the hotel was limited. The main restaurant only served full breakfast buffet which cost about $26. They did not offer an a la carte menu for a simple coffee and a sweet roll or fruit which we would have liked.Although it's not right on the beach it's only a very short walk. You can check out a beach chair and towel in the pool area and take it to the beach. The public restrooms for the beach, snack bar and surfboard rentals are very close. The PK beach crew patrols the area regularly and will offer you cold bottled water and fresh fruit. Not as good as a cold beer or Maitai but it's a nice touch :-)We had a room on the 12th floor with a partial Ocean View. Our room was facing East toward Diamond Head, not directly South toward the water, but we still had a decent view of some of the beach (picture attached). When checking in, make sure you get something on the 12th floor or above or the building across the street will block all of your view.The room was not large but adequate for a week for two people. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. There was a refrigerator and single cup coffee pot in the room but no microwave. The bathroom vanity top was a little on the small side.This is a smaller hotel so there aren't any shops or chain restaurants on the premises. You will have to go outside for those.There are four elevators serving the tower and they were uncomfortably warm and always crowded. I have no suggestions for that. We just had to wait and squeeze in.If you rent a car you will need to pay $34 a day for parking at the hotel. I wouldn't think about trying to park on the street because it's very crowded in that area. Drive your car all the way up to the top level P5 to park it because that's where the elevator stops and it will be easy to get into the hotel from there.We enjoyed our stay at the Princess Kaiulani and found it very comfortable to come back to after a day of wandering through the bustle of Waikiki. Hope you found this review helpful and have a nice trip to Waikiki Beach.","Chicago, IL",11,4.0

I'll start with the Cons. We booked three rooms for six guests 9 months in advance and paid for them upon booking. I reserved three KING Ocean View Rooms, and we were given three rooms with two queens/doubles (small beds) with ocean view. Upon check-in, I notified the gentleman that we wanted kings, and I even called to ensure we were getting kings. His reply was that I also requested high floors, and they just couldn't accommodate all of my wishes. Had I been given a free upgrade, I would not complain, but I paid for these rooms. Upon entering the rooms, I was saddened to see the same decor that we saw in 2010 when we stayed there. The carpets were tired as was the furniture. I know the hotel is undergoing room renovations, but when I paid for the upgraded room, I guess I assumed I'd get at least a king bed I wanted, but not two negatives so quickly. The room was clean except for the edges of the carpets, on light stain on the comforter, and the dust on the vent. I'll post pictures of that. The bathroom and furniture were all dust-free and well mopped. The positives far outweigh the negatives. The location is unbeatable, unless you're oceanfront, but this hotel is directly in front of the Moana and offers beautiful views. We like to stay at the Moana, but since we brought our parents on this trip, we opted to book the three rooms here and spend the difference on activities. This was a more cost-efficient option without sacrificing location. The hotel lobby is fun, and our parents all really enjoyed the energy with all the people and entertainment. There are plenty of sitting areas where you can relax and enjoy each other’s company in the lobby area. Another positive is the nightly entertainment. You can sit poolside and in the bar and enjoy live cultural performances as well as casual singing. We definitely enjoyed it. The bar drinks were yummy, and service was great! The buffet in the hotel seemed a little pricey for me, because I can't eat crab legs, but for the rest of our group, it was a bargain! :) The food was all fresh, and our dinner buffet included a variety of seafood and local options. Please note that sodas are not included in the buffet price.The pool is one of our favorite thing about this hotel. Compared to hotels in other cities, the pool might seem small, but it's actually larger than it looks in the pictures and large in comparison to other Waikiki hotels. It is a salt water pool (wonderful on the skin) and has a deep end. There are always lounge chairs available, as well, so there is no rush in reserving any. Our housekeepers were so nice and helpful. There is a desk in the hotel where you can book excursions if you'd like.Our parking fee was $35/day, but our resort fee was less than what we usually pay at hotels like Moana, so it was okay. There was also available parking each day for us. We had a large GMC Yukon XL, which is not the easiest to park in cramped quarters, but we managed to find parking every day. The hotel lends chairs and beach towels, which was awesome for beach time. :) There are also stores all around the hotel where you can buy anything you need like sunblock, umbrellas, etc. There is also a show in the hotel now. There is a gym, which we didn't use on this vacation, but it's nice to know it was there.On some days, there are craft vendors in the breezeway, and they have such beautiful handmade crafts. There were also places where the kids could learn how to make leis.I am not going to say I won't be back, because this hotel has far too many pros to push it aside. I will, however, request that my booking be matched as made without any petty excuses as to why I'm less important than any other guest. When I pay for a King upgrade with an ocean view, that's what I get anywhere else we go. Also, the carpet edges should be vacuumed, and the vents should be dusted/vacuumed, as well. My suggestion would be to definitely stay at the Princess K if you are going to Waikiki and it fits in your budget. Just ask for an renovated room.

I was booked into a recently renovated room and really had a great view, but the room still felt dated and old. The same could be said of the elevator and also the hallways. It really feel like you are walking into a time machine of Waikiki in the 1960's.The staff on the other hand were all great and very accommodating. They really seemed to care for the guest and were efficient with check in. Every interaction I had from the front desk staff to housekeeping to the restaurant were all great. Even with the tired looking facility, the staff was pretty amazing.While this is branded a Sheraton, it really feels more like a Four Points. I think having the Sheraton name allows for higher prices to be charged, but if you go in with the thought it is going to be more like a Four Points, you will be fine. As an SPG Platinum, normally I would have access to the Club Lounge. This location did not seem to have a club lounge but they did offer a coupon for both a small plate item in the evening and the breakfast buffet in the morning. Both coupons said that gratuity was included so that was nice also for it to be truly free. Overall, I felt treated very well in a facility that has seen better days. If looking for the true Sheraton experience, then go for the other one in Waikiki. If you have the right expectations going in, then you will have a good experience here.","Chicago, Illinois",77,3.0

Throughout the week of our stay the housekeeping staff occasionally put some flowers in our room with a little note for our honeymoon.

This time I decided to stay in the lower Princess block with a pool view room, I was on the 6th floor, once again I have nothing but praise for this hotel from the cleaning staff up, everyone always friendly. I surprised myself with how much I also enjoyed being at a lower level rather than way up high in the tower, I will say the lanai (balcony) is a bit tighter than the tower but nothing to worry about, you can still sit there and have your balcony doors wide open… a few of my favourite staff (Kathy on the desk, Heidi, Angie and Lei at the pool bar)were actually off on leave this time, however I did get to meet the most beautiful and helpful Gabriella from behind the scenes in HR while she was selling shirts to raise money for the children’s hospital, what a credit she is to this hotel! (hope she still has the kangaroo on her desk) .. also Linda on the desk to help you with go pro’s, portable wifi’s, sim cards etc was so friendly and helpful, as I’ve stated before, I don’t bother comparing other hotels for prices etc anymore, I just book here, so simple. My stay here on my return from the Caribbean was all I’d been looking forward to and hoping for after I had survived being trapped on the island of St Maarten when hurricane Irma hit, I was trapped there for 5 days without power or running water then evacuated to the Dominican Republic for 5 days til I could get back to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to make my connection back to Honolulu via Las Vegas. I had been travelling for 21hrs including layovers, I was totally exhausted and quite sick when I arrived at SPK a little too early for my room to be ready, thank god Kathy was on the desk when I arrived, she organized a temporary room for me, so I could clean up and refresh and sleep til my room was ready, this time on the 5th floor.. I was sooo thankful for that, she went to the trouble of organizing a basket of goodies with a card attached to be sent to my room for me as well. This time I was on the 5th floor Princess Pool View room, which I enjoyed, it was clean and comfortable as is always the case, and it’s nice to have the afternoon/evening music drifting up. As the days passed, Kalei at the pool, after hearing my story also surprised me and had a nice little basket sent to my room .. (I wasn’t telling my story for baskets) what a great guy he is, I also want to mention Gregg and Erin at the front desk, always friendly and helpful, and beautiful little Leonora the cleaner on the 5th floor, always looking out for me and ready to chat. I Got to catch up with Heidi and Angie at the Splash bar who both gave me a great big hug too lol .. Another PC has been added to the business center which is a lot better than lining up for just the single one which was there. I wonder if Gabriella had something to do with that?? .. No wonder I love staying here! … I’ll be back in April/May.","Gold Coast, Australia",32,5.0

We had 4 rooms for our party and stayed here for 10 days with an average cost of $220. We moved rooms 4 times due to poor room conditions. There are several rooms where the AC does not work. The rooms had a minimum temperature of 78 degrees. One room had mold in it and another room had ants. We finally were moved to a newer remodeled room that the temperature would get down to 72 degrees. I could not believe that the rooms we were placed in were allowed to be utilized.When I asked about compensation for our troubles, we were given 2 adult tickets to buffet only. This was extremely disappointing because the buffet was limited in their food selection especially for those with food allergies. In addition, we would have had to pay for our kids to eat (which kids free was supposed to be included). As far as kids eat free, we were still charged at the splash bar restaurant for our kids' meals. The hotel stated that the splash bar was not considered a restaurant. It had a full menu and over 20 tables to sit at. Definitely would consider that a restaurant.Pool is not kid friendly. The staff restrict any toys and the less that 6 foot deep end is about 1/4 of pool. The majority of splash bar wait staff, with exception to Romeo only serve you when you flag them down. Positives are they offer seats for the beach and free icee poles for everyone. Definitely utilize somewhere else than the hotel's excursion desk. They are over priced and do not provide all details. For example, we reserved for Pearl Harbor. The tour was rushed and did not allow for time to do audio tour plus Arizona memorial. The hotel staff did not tell us that we would have to check bags at gate for a $4 charge per bag. Our tour guide provided misleading information regarding how much effort she had to put into obtaining our tickets. She often had a passive aggressive attitude and was extremely strict. 2nd example was we reserved the luau at the hotel. They told us to be a half 1/2 hour early. They failed to tell us there were kids activities before the event and our kids missed it. We then had very disappointed kids once they could not participate in the activities.I received a survey from the hotel and provided the above information with the disappointment. They provided a template response stating they would discuss with the hotel. I never received any follow up.

When we opened the balcony door to have a look out to the ocean, I didn't know which way to look it was non existent. To top it off there was a bug on the bed so the room didn't even look clean. We called down to reception and told them about the view and that we weren't happy with the room. They moved us to a full ocean View. I would argue that this was actually partial but at this point it was probably as good as we were going to get. There was no acknowledgement of our honeymoon by the hotel in way of even a congratulations, it was a very disappointing start to the holiday. We didn't spend much time in the hotel as we booked lots of tours during our short stay in Oahu. Would definitely go back to Oahu but wouldn't recommend this hotel, pictures of rooms on website are not true representations.",,11,2.0

Speaking of which, there is not even an appropriate or easy way to give compliments to staff, no card to fill out etc, I was told I had to go on line...I tried, I could not figure out their system.The location is short walk away to the beach and they are in a convenient locations for restaurants/shopping.I enjoy the live music starting at 6pm daily.The Splash Bar has some good snacks like their lettuce wraps and quesadillas, well priced for quality. There are daily drink specials.- The staff at the front desk is rude, not helpful.- There is no concierge desk as there used to be, there is only a travel/trip desk and a desk to sell you property, seems they only care about making more money even though you are nickle and dimed here enough.-In the lobby area there is a water station to get water for your bottles, one half of it is broken and looks very unsanitary to say the least.-I have stayed here 3 times. Once the room had a horrible mold smell, once the room had horrible sound proofing, you could hear everything from the rooms next to you. Another time there were lots of black bugs, horrible AC and the AC was very loud. Two of those examples were very outdated rooms.-The breakfast is literally almost the exact same thing every day. The omelet makers are ornery and prefer to make omelets the easiest way for them which means a ridiculous amount of oil that you will be consuming so the omelet flips easily for them...there is a salad of quinoa or pasta or rice however it is usually drenched in oil, drenched! The dressing renders the salads useless to me. They seem to cater to one specific demographic.-The electronic equipment in the gym does not work well at all...I spend far too much time trying to get the control panels to work, I end up annoyed and wasting time.- The pool is too small for the property size.-The beds and bedding are not the standard Sheraton quality of the past. They are not comfortable.-The lobby needs more than one computer, it is difficult to find it free to be able to print your boarding passes etc.-There is an on site laundry if you would like to do your own laundry however the machines are front loaders and the plastic rims are always disgusting...I can not believe it is sanitary to do your laundry in those machines.","Nashville, Tennessee",1128,3.0

We particularly love the paintings by Heather who paints and sells her paintings in the hotel foyer 3 days a week. We have been staying at this hotel during our Hawaii holidays for the past 4 years. My criticisms are the beds are double size and would like to have had queens size beds which we have at home, and the rediculous compulsory resort fee (which is a common hotel fee in most Hawaiian hotels) and it's inclusions which hits the hip pocket. Last year the resort fee included free parking where it does not include any more, so now to pay $70USD for parking and the resort fee each day on top of your accommodation fees is very expensive. There is a nearby parking station at $20 per day which is half the price for parking at the Sheraton Princess, so we ended up parking at the $20 parking station.We love Hawaii and enjoy our stay at the Sheraton Princess each time.

The room: mine was a city view overlooking the International Market Place. The room is probably the most basic and oldest I've stayed in for a SPG hotel. The AC, TV, wireless internet and shower all worked well and was sufficient for a business traveler who does not spend time in the room. The hotel lobby is a mix of modern and very dated design - not sure why the whole thing hasn't been renovated. The pool area is decent and gets plenty of sun even until 5pm. Parking is steep at $35 a day. What are the positives? First of all, I would have normally given this a 3 rating, but the staff were above and beyond professional, very friendly, and helped me recover a passport I left in my room safe. If you are looking for a centrally located hotel in Waikiki, close to restaurants, shops, and beach, at a decent price for the area, this is it. The fact that you could walk out the door and safely walk in any direction with so much to see along Waikiki's main strip is probably the biggest seller. Of course, this is not your parents' Waikiki and there are way better areas to stay than Honolulu if this is your first time to Hawaii. Negatives?

We heard they are going to completely change this hotel in the near future. It certainly needs it. The vibe of the restaurant, bar, and pool area reflect the type of hotel this has become. It is not a happening place. There are people but certainly not a lively bunch (at least during the 4 times I've been in the property or stayed there). Comparatively, go over to the Sheraton Waikiki and it has a completely different vibe...lively, happening, young.

We don't mind the hustle and bustle of the tourist area. The hotel is surrounded by a choice of restaurants, fast food outlets and convenience stores. The beach is just up the road and is a short, flat walk.Checking in and out is relatively seamless with never more than a few people waiting.There are often activities in the foyer, such as lei making, which the kids love.We had WIFI in our room, which worked ok.While the rooms are a little dated, they are kept clean and tidy and the staff servicing them are friendly and any issues are seen to in a timely manner.We didn't eat at the restaurant this time and whilst the food is very good it tends to be a little expensive for a family budget. The prices for cocktails and snacks around the pool aren't too bad.There is resort charge of $29 US Dollars, this used to include parking.However, a new additional parking charge of $35 per night has just been added. So i'm not sure what you get for the resort charge now????Talking to other tourists, a common talking point was that they wish the pool was open later than 7pm. Overall, I would stay here again but we will consider our options if extra charges continue to creep in.","Shell Cove, Australia",2,4.0

Still, I will offer a balanced look at my three day business stay last month at SPK. As I live in a city, I was happy when work was over and we moved on to more beautiful and remote settings in Oahu. But, here is a look at the GREAT, GOOD, BAD, and UGLY in my stay at the SPK as I saw them. Then, I will offer some Bottom Line-type comments . . .GREAT* Vibe: The SPK strikes a perfect balance of being a great setting for either a business or vacation traveler (or both as was my case). One would feel just as comfortable strolling through the spacious and modern lobby in either a suit or bathing suit (I did both). It has a 'beach' feel and yet would serve a business traveler who must be able to entertain, etc. * Location - If you must be in the city, this is the location. This might be my first time ever that I have wrapped-up work at 6pm, traveled back to my hotel, and still have had abundant time to go to a beach. Crowded yet beautiful Waikiki Beach awaits two blocks away. From the SPK's front door you have about a minute walk before you are in water. Also, there are a ton of conveniences available in shops just next to the hotel. GOOD* Splash: the on-site Splash bar is terrific and relaxing. They offer a variety of mixed drinks and a competent menu. There is almost always a live music act and a festive feel. * Staff: In limited interactions, I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. They were happy to help with searching tickets and offering information.* View: there are an abundance of pics here that prove you are going to have a great view almost wherever you are placed. And, it's not just a view from a window - your room will have a nice balcony to enjoy it from. BAD (Room for Improvement)* A Tale of Two Hotels: we felt the SPK was almost like staying at two hotels at times. I mentioned the spacious and modern lobby. It will have you feeling like you are staying at a much more expensive hotel at times. From there though, I had to step onto a cramped and outdated elevator that took me to my cramped and outdated hallway and then room, which was also a bit cramped and outdated.* A/C Unit: my room's a/c unit was huge, loud, and old. The temp control box was digital and modern but . . . the unit ran loud and was very weak, meaning it had to be on most of the time. UGLY* Nothing ugly to report in beautiful Hawaii. BOTTOM LINE* If you are coming to Waikiki for work or vacation (I don't know why someone would come to the only city in Hawaii for vacation), the SPK will make an excellent base. All that Waikiki has to offer will be at your fingertips at a price that compares nicely to other properties. I am already dreaming of the day I return to beautiful Hawaii.","Chicago, IL",135,4.0

The location is literally across from Waikiki beach. The hotel has a nice relaxed environment. The check in process was easy and not too long. The restaurant has great daily happy hour cocktails and a good menu. The hotel lobby is modern and so was the room we stayed in. Great WIFI in the hotel and also in our room. The beds were super comfy along with the pillows. My one and only downfall to this hotel would be with one of the concierge staff members a lady called Terry. Terry was very rude and disrespectful. Terry greeted us whilst picking boiled lollies from jar and eating them whilst talking to us with her mouth basically full swirling these lollies around. Terry clearly did not want to help and assist us to book 3-4 tours that we wanted some information on and to book. Terry instead slid the brochures across the table and sent us on our way with not even explaining or going over anything. Guy, the other staff member who was also at the desk on the other hand was LOVLEY. Guy is your man to book tours and get helpful information from. STAY clear of Terry chewing her boiled lollies and scrolling through personal Internet sites not wanting to offer any assistance. Overall great location and very clean.

I read various Trip Advisor reviews and selected this hotel. Some people complain about the smallest things... and there's no making them happy. I ignore them. The price was right since we got it on air miles, but their prices were more reasonable than other Waikiki hotels. The only added cost that I didn't see value in was the daily resort fee. There is also a daily parking fee if you have a car. The location of this hotel is great. It's centrally located across the road from the beach right in the center of all the action and night life. It's easy access from the street is also a plus. The pool area is well maintained with plenty of deck chairs and side tables.

They couldn't give us the requested king size bed so they gave us a ""renovated"" room. The room was pretty typical of a hotel room, but they really should have renovated the bathroom as well; the tiles were quite grimy looking. I did, however, love the balcony. Great views of the beach and the mountains! Extremely windy, though!Despite not being directly on the beach (just across the street), I appreciated the beach service the hotel provided. Towels and beach chairs were available by the pool and a few times a day someone from the hotel walked the beach with cold water, apples, and oranges.Side note because I thought it was interesting: The TVs in the lobby were advertising a Zumba class on Mondays and Wednesday at 4pm in the hotel.

The hotel is in a nice location(not on the beach but right across the street), The parking is $35 a night and the resort fee is $29 a night, so if you rent a car you are in for $65 plus tax before you even pay for the room. I get that price because its Waikiki beach but I also think that my room would have looked like something else then from the 1970s. Mismatched furniture that looked like it was from a garage sale from somewhere in Honolulu and the a/c was horrible. Not what I expected for a starwood property. The lobby area and the pool have been updated so that is fine. One nice thing is that in your resort fee you can get a tommy Bahama beach chair to walk to the beach and 3 times a day they bring cold water and apples and oranges for resort guests.","Smithtown, New York",4,2.0

She got me check in then proceeded to walk me through all the amazing things The island had to offer. Restaurants, beaches, hiking, different foods and fruit to try, and waterfalls to see. This helped make my honeymoon so memorable from the very beginning. She was great and her knowledge of the local area was a real sign of someone who loves what they do. I frequent many hotels and I can say I have never had that kind of outstanding service anywhere I've stayed.

Be aware that resort fees are not included in your booking fee. The staff at splash bar were friendly and the snacks were good but I suggest you eat out for dinner.

The hotel is appeared nice and welcoming. The hotel is across the street from the beach and you can walk there in under a minute.Upon arrival at the hotel, check-in was very slow around 1:00 PM. There was a line of people and not enough employees. I waited about 10-12 minutes. Once I was checking in, I was told there were no rooms available, but they would notify me as soon as my room was ready (check-in is 3 PM). At 2:15, I had not heard anything so I followed up with another employee who checked and said my room was in fact ready. There was already a lack of communication as I never received a phone call as I was told.Being Platinum with Starwood, my room was upgraded. Also, as a Platinum member I received vouchers for free breakfast buffet and a free appetizer at the Splash Bar/Restaurant by the pool. Also, by staying at the hotel and being a member of Starwood, regardless of status, you receive 15% off at the same restaurant and discounted rates and two of the other Starwood properties (Sheraton Waikiki and The Moana Surfrider (a Westin property)).I was extremely surprised to find out that this Sheraton does not have a Club Lounge (I have stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki and they do as do most Sheratons).ROOM (2956)I was upgraded due to my Platinum status. The room was in the updated tower (I'm told one tower has been updated and the other has not). The room was nice, but smaller than expected. By no means was it tiny. The room had a partial city view and partial ocean view.The room had a king bed, 2 night stands, clock, dresser, TV, small desk and chair, coffee maker, mini fridge, closet with hangers, iron and board, and a safe for valuables. The room had a patio with 2 chairs and a table. The thermostat worked well and kept the room cold. There were 6 outlets and 4 USB outlets available for electronics.BATHROOMThe bathroom did not seem to be very updated. If it was updated, it was done cheaply. The shower-head appeared outdated and small. There was a shower/bathtub combination, a sink, and a toilet. There was also a hairdryer, but it only blew cool air so I'm assuming it's broken. There were 2 additional outlets available for electronics.Splash Bar/RestaurantI ate two times at the Splash Bar. The first time was simply for the appetizer that I received as a welcome amenity. The service was good and quick. The beef lettuce wraps were very tasty.My second experience, for dinner, was not as good. I arrived and was told to sit anywhere. The restaurant was only about 2/3 full. It was almost 10 minutes before I was asked what I wanted to drink. After I ordered water, it was another 8 minutes before she came back to take my order, only after I was making eye contact. Even then, I still had no water. After I placed my order, my water came a couple minutes later. The food took about 20 minutes, which was fine. I ordered a burger and fries which were tasty. I asked for my check when the food came because I was extremely tired and wanted to go to bed as soon as I finished. I had showed the coupon for 15% off food upon ordering as stated on the paper. The discount was not applied. I called her back to the table and told her and she said just put your name and room number on the slip and I will make the adjustments to your bill (I billed the food to my room). I did so, handed it to her and left. 10 minutes later as I'm literally getting into bed, the phone rings and it's the same waitress telling me that I in fact have to come back downstairs and fill out the new slip now. Clearly there was a mistake on her end. I had to get dressed just to go back downstairs and put my name on and sign the new slip. It was not my error. She should have had someone else bring it to my room to complete the new slip due to her mistake.BREAKFASTThe breakfast buffet was very good. They had made to order omelets (or other eggs upon request. They also had scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, rice, salad, French toast, pastries and breads, cereals, and fresh juice. They had no water sitting out. You have to request water if you want it. I'm unsure of the cost because I received it for free being a Platinum member, but if the price is reasonable, I would buy it.OVERALLOverall, I would rate the hotel 3.5 but you can't rate half points. Mainly, the points are being take off due to customer service. Upon check-in I was told I would receive a call when my room was ready. I was sitting in the lobby for an hour and fifteen minutes and I only found out it was ready because I checked myself.The updated room was nice, but parts seemed like they were done only partially.I was disappointed there was no Club Lounge. However, the appetizer at the Splash Bar was good and the breakfast buffet was tasty.Also, the customer service, for dinner, at the Splash Bar was poor at best.I have stayed at The Moana Surfrider (Westin), Sheraton Waikiki, and Sheraton Princess. The Westin property and Sheraton Waikiki are both beach front. The Sheraton Princess is across the street. The Westin property gives Platinum members a cooked breakfast and so does the Sheraton Princess. The Sheraton Waikiki gives Club Lounge access and breakfast is lower grade. The rooms are nicer at the Westin property and the Sheraton Waikiki than the Sheraton Princess.I would recommend the hotel if the price was much cheaper than the other two. Otherwise, based on this experience, I would opt for one of the other two if the price was comparable.",,103,3.0

At the end of a week though we thought we had a ""handle"" on it. Loved the location a very short stroll to Waikiki beach and straight out the front to the major retail centre (Hawaii's Rodeo Drive??) with handy trolley stops and convenience stores. Not sure if the resort charge is value but the reduction in tariff from other hotels marginally closer to the beach felt right. Loved lounging in the Splash Bar by the pool, thgough pool did close at 7pm. Happy hour at the bar from 11am to 6pm and very good quality bar snacks food. Staff were excellent generally. Hotel itself showing its age a little but still comfortable. Our double King room was spacious though bathroom needed a good renovation. Special mention for Guy at the travel desk who set up some wonderful day activity options for us. Would stay again at the right price and probably get an ocean side room next time. Noise from mall next door on western side was extreme at times (massed air conditioning plants on roof?) and necessitated balcony door being closed at all times.","East Maitland, Australia",37,3.0

Room was clean and showed signs of some recent maintenance but everything looked worn. It was a Sunday night and from midnight til early morning all we heard were garbage trucks. It was a little better the next few nights, but we also got noise from the shopping centre beside the hotel. The pool is very deep and not good for non-swimmers. The pool was closed every night so an evening swim was out of the question. At times the elevators were very busy and you had to wait several minutes and even then you could not always get on.

This is a noticeable difference between my Marriott Rewards membership and treatment. I liked this location and it was a short walk to the beach.

The designated area at the beach was 100 yards from the hotel. Staff from the hotel would go to the area with water coolers filled with water and fruit and look for people with the hotel's beach towels. And odd system.... We only went to the beach once given that there was so much to do / see so felt that this resort fee was not worth it.

The hotel does actually provide shuttles form the airport, which I only found out after reading the information in our room. I emailed the hotel to ask for this information and never got a reply! I would suggest trying to get in touch as it could work out cheaper - $28 round trip depending on the number in your group. Our taxi cost is 46 one way due to traffic and an exit been closed. The room is small and better than I expected. We have a pool view room which does give a small ocean view which is nice. The bathrooms is really small. In the room there are wires which are lying around close to the tv and an extensions cord on the floor for more power points, I have never seen and am actually a bit concerning as we have a toddler with us who we need to keep away from the wires. The pool area looks nice and it seems that there is an allocated area if one wishes to go to the beach which is another nice touch.

Overall, I thought it was a good value for $127.06 + the $28 resort fee per night.All of the hotel staff was pretty friendly. They offered me both free breakfast + 500 points as a Platinum welcome bonus, instead of a choice between the two, which was nice. Because the resort fee includes free WiFi, and that is a Platinum amenity, they will also give me 250 SPG points, per night as an alternate benefit. They also offered me a voucher for a free appetizer at the bar, which was nice.They did upgrade me from a city view room to an ocean view room, that had a furnished terrace, and the views were pretty good. The walls were very thin, and I could hear people in the other rooms on both sides. The hotel does not provide in room glassware in the bathroom, but rather provides plastic cups, which I didn't really like. There were also not any bathrobes in the room, I'm not sure whether or not I could have asked for one...but I would have used it if it was there.The breakfast buffet included omelets which was great because that's not always included in Platinum breakfast.The hotel is about a 45-second walk to the beach and is well located; unfortunately, beach chairs are not provided, which is particularly disappointing given the high resort fee.Overall, I kind of felt like I was staying at a Four Points, and I'm not really sure how Starwood is defining the differences between the full-service Sheraton and mid-service Four Points brands.I might return if I got a rate of $127.06 per night again, but I probably wouldn't pay much more than that.

The rooms are reasonably sized and have all the comforts of a hotel of this size you would expect (ironing board, safe, fridge). Nearly all rooms have balconies with some form of view of the beach. Walking distance to Waikiki beach (aka absolute tourist trap) is literally the time it takes to cross the road. The hotel has its own pool, entertainment and a travel guide that can book ventures beyond the madness (i.e. anywhere outside of Waikiki) you require. Buses to and from the airport are easily access, as is the public bus to/from anyway (including buses). There is a very easily accessed car park for those staying at the hotel. Thankfully the resort fee covers this and it's perfect given that parking anywhere in Waikiki is either difficult, expensive or both. The hotel also has very close proximity to the tourist trolley buses - particularly useful if you're a Japanese traveller, as almost all the buses only cater to Japanese. We travelled using the Japanese company HIS, so this wasn't an issue.","Sydney, Australia",76,4.0

Wallpaper peeling off, carpet coming away from walls, balcony door impossible to slide open as it's so old. Would not even rate it 3 star.Wifi is good.So disappointed with this hotel.

The hotel is aged comparing to other ones, like the TV, drawers and bathroom counter were old.As years went by I improved to a Gold and now Platinum member, and I get to stay at the upgraded rooms. The hotel also grew with me- they renovated the rooms (I was in 2952) that have newer furniture and paint. The staff is very friendly - front desk try to get you check in asap, the housekeeping staff always have a smile on and is willing to bring you extra bottle of water if needed. The bell desk staff quickly helps you with the luggage. The con is their parking structure does not have elevators, so if you are unable to walk up/down the stairs handling suitcases, unload at the front entrance first and then go park.If you're a Platinum member, they will give you daily breakfast coupons for the days you're staying there. The breakfast buffet has a variety of hot and cold dishes, which is very filling. Last year when I was there I could combine two coupons for one dinner buffet, and the selections were good too. I do not know if this promotion is still going on this year because I used the coupons on breakfast. I'd recommend the hotel if you are on a budget and but want to stay at a centralized location.

These visits were broken up into a two night, before proceeding on a cruise and then for a further four nights on conclusion of the cruise. While we were guests I can truthfully say that the Princess is a real member of Hawaiian Royalty. being an avid reader of hotels Emergency Procedures I was extremely impressed of how detailed a Plan and Policy had been developed. To me, this speaks volumes of the operational aspect of the Hotel. The Staff, well what can be said other than superb! Always helpful, professional, cheery and knowledgeable. Whomever we spoke to with a question regarding, well, anything, the member we had spoken to was able to give accurate and fast answers. We found the staff very cheery, and even in the face of a mad ""Aussie"" managed to try and understand the lingo. The furnishings and fittings were well maintained and when a slow draining sink was reported a maintenance engineer soon put it right. The ambience of the poolside area was beautiful and calming. The pool itself, was well maintained and evidence that hygiene takes precedence over convenience for guests was exhibited when the pool was closed because of a contamination issue. To me, I would rather not swim, than have a hygiene issue be overlooked. Access to shops, transport and beaches could not have been better. The travel/information desk provided some excellent service and certainly was able to use his prodigious knowledge of whats going on and how to get there. Well done for a truly great job.Hotel Management and all staff can be extremely proud of the outstanding performance that they demonstrated while we were residing there.

The hotel is centrally located near all of the shopping and many restaurants. It is right across the street from Duke's restaurant and near the Royal Hawaiian Center. We were greeted by a friendly person at check in and were upgraded to a pool view room. This is an older hotel and the room showed some age but it was clean and we were hardly in the room. We had the included breakfast buffet which was fabulous. There was an omelet station and many various breakfast items to choose from. The guava juice was the best I have ever tasted. The service was exceptional in the restaurant. As soon as your plate was finished, they picked it up. We had Kimmy as our server for three days and she was great. We did have a car so we used the parking garage which is conveniently located next to the hotel. We also used the beach service, picking up chairs, towels and heading to Waikiki Beach, a short distance away. While on the beach, the hotel staff comes 3 times to offer you bottles of cold water and a piece of fruit.We did not use the pool as we came for the beaches but it looked clean and inviting.

The hotel is dated as the other reviewers have reported, but recent upgrades have improved it. It was to close, and be part of a complete renovation/demolition a few years ago, but then the developers lost approval connected with a larger project. Thus, I think that until that project did not move forward, the owner did not want to put any money into it. However, the recent renovations have improved the rooms, lobby and pool area. The hotel is located across the street form the beach, and if you pay for a high ocean room, which I recommend, you can see the ocean, part of Diamond Head, the pool, and the main street below. The money you save by staying across the street with an ocean view vs. on the beach with an ocean view is worth it. You can visit the other Sheraton properties on the beach and enjoy their bars and restaurants with room charges. The PK has all types of cultural activities, and nightly entertainment. The people who work there are all fantastic. If you want to go to Hawaii for fancy hotel room go somewhere else. If you want a nice room with a view for a moderate price, a good location, and wonderful staff, come here.

The hotel itself is a little dated, but who would come to Waikiki just to experience the hotel room. We had several maintenance issues, a refrigerator that didn't work, a broken tv, a toilet seat that wouldn't stay up, but upon reporting these to the front desk three workman were at the room within minutes with a new tv, new refrigerator and fixed toilet. To me the best part of the PK is saving money on the room stay, but being able to experience the beach side hotels across the street, the Moana Surfrider and Royal Hawaiian, and since they are also Hilton properties having the convenience of room chargers in their bars and restaurants.

You can even combine two of you breakfast coupons for a free dinner which is a great option. They give you a free small plate at the bar as well when you check in. Perhaps the best benefit is if you have a red eye out of HNL they have a section of the hotel where they will give you a room till 11PM! Now, you have to move rooms, but it is an extremely nice benefit to have a room to 11PM to work, watch TV or relax. It's just on the older side of the hotel on a low level.

The look of the lobby/pool is misleading. I do not know how anyone would choose to spend 300 dollars a night here. We were just staying here one night coming from Maui; arrived at 7pm so we just needed a place to sleep until we caught our flight home the next night at 8pm. Hawaii to Canada is a 12 hour flight mind you so we were hoping to get a good nights sleep. For a Sheraton and an SPG/Marriot member the room we were given was as basic as you could get. I have never stayed at a Sheraton this horrible in my life. Should have been a Motel 6 more likely. For our last night in Hawaii we decided to go out on the town since we had the later flight the next evening. Came back to the hotel at 2am and was woken up at 7:30 in the morning to a CHAINSAW... at first I thought I was dreaming but then at 8am BANGING right above us with a hammer..... We were in Hawaii for a total of 18 nights and on the most important night to get sleep they placed us in a room with construction above us.... My husband called down IMMEDIATELY and the hammering stopped. I hope I can upload a video because this was absolutely WRONG! We talked to the manager and we could not fall back asleep so they gave us a later check out which was very nice of him. There really was not anything else he could have done to make us happy going on 4 hours of sleep. If you want a cheap vacation hotel this is your place but if you are looking for somewhere decent stay elsewhere (Hilton Hawaiian Village was excellent!).

This is my fifth holiday on Oahu and I thought I would try somewhere different to stay ie.. here at Sheraton Princess Kaiulani, because the price was right coupled with Hawaiian airlines flights. After checking in we weren’t too happy with our room of 2 double beds in the tower (my booking did state “or king bed”). We went back down and we were assured we would be given another room next day. Sure enough for extra money ($AU474) we were moved a few floors up with a king bed. I also want to mention ""Kathy"" on the reception desk was so helpful and friendly. As can be seen with the photo’s we weren’t top floor but our views overlooking the pool and entertainment stage as well as ocean views were excellent, the room was clean and tidy. I didn’t notice too much traffic noise from the 10th floor and it was nice to hear the live music from down below each afternoon. We didn’t hear any construction noise from next door either, but, we did hear our adjoining room neighbours from time to time through the connecting door, but not enough to worry about. Some reviews have mentioned the dated carpet and wallpaper in hallways, I actually like it like that, gives an original Hawaiian feel to the place. We enjoyed the fruit and water provided at the beach for residents of PK and the beach chairs provided are great. In my previous reviews I've mentioned how much I loved staying at Outrigger, which I did, but I now prefer the more peaceful and relaxing resort type feel of PK,...

Reception I didn't find that helpful I was fobbed off with a few questions (silly things like where can I buy one stamp?). The dining arrangements may not be to everyone's taste, breakfast lunch and dinner is buffet service, which is very very geared to the Japanese, Chinese and Korean visitors although there was bacon and an egg station at breakfast.

(as it is known by all the local taxi cab drivers) on a family trip awaiting a cruise back to Australia. I was very impressed by the professionalism and courtesy shown by the staff members who assisted us in making the most of our 36 hours in Hawaii, particularly the concierge.The location is awesome for checking out the local sights - It is a manageable walk to the beach, and around US$5-$10 will get you to and from a lot of the shopping/restaurants/nightclubbery, although the Ala Moana shopping centre is a bit further out and Pearl Harbour/Pearl City is another story entirely.We were given a fair warning from the concierge that a taxi to the Pearl City shopping mall would cost around US$80 or take somewhere between an hour and a half to two hours to get there on a bus. Seeing that bus stops are conveniently located a short walk from the hotel, we opted to take the US$2.50 bus up to Pearl City, discovering that in rush hour, it certainly can take two hours by bus.The hotel features wi-fi, the price of which I believe is part of the occupancy charge for the rooms, but would seek further clarification. Further, there is a hot breakfast buffet featuring Western and Japanese options, distinctly featuring a staffed omelette bar to cater for Westerners and as well as nattou to cater for Japanese guests, or Westerners who have no idea what they are getting themselves into. I would make a snarky remark on the lack of Vegemite, to cater to Australians such as myself, but the hot buffet options were numerous and delicious and I found myself loading up with a bowl of miso soup (and some nattou) and even jerry-rigging a bagel with salmon and cream cheese using the available options. Top-notch.One last thing. The pool is a very nice one, cocktails are easy to come by and the staff are even happy to whip up something that is not explicitly mentioned on the menu (such as a long island iced tea) at reasonable cocktail-y prices.Tl;dr: Excellent base location for exploring the Waikiki area, little bit of a hassle to go further afield but overall nice rooms, great staff and an awesome island vibe! For extra credit, try saying ""Princess Kaiulani"" between your fourth and fifth cocktail.","Newcastle, Australia",5,4.0

Booking I was easy, staff were friendly, the room was clean and well maintained, and we had a room on the 7th floor overlooking the pool,and the Main Street. My only negative comment would be that the concierge was not always at the desk. We just felt that when the concierge needed a break (as in lunch etc) there should have been another staff member take that position.p for the duration.

A charming older hotel with an ambiance that newer hotels just can’t replicate. It’s open air lobby design takes advantage of the breezy trade winds. The lobby and pool were never overcrowded and the beach is just across the street. We booked directly with Starwood Hotels so got a great deal on a room. From the moment we checked in we were treated with a level far exceeding our expectations. Christina was not only extremely efficient and friendly but went out of her way to be helpful. Great attitude and customer service. She even remembered my name and room number the following day. Christina helped us enroll in the Starwood Preferred Guest program, gave us a box of chocolates on the spot then had our cards delivered to our room enabling us to activate and use them right away. Show the card at the dining room for 15% off, charge the dining room charges (not including liquor) to your room and get 25% off at checkout. The room was decent size, very clean and quiet, and had a mini fridge. Microwave available upon request. Our ocean view room had a large private balcony with a spectacular ocean view. Note to be careful during the day as the cement can get quite hot in the sun. The hotel is built on the former site of Ainahau, the home of Princess Kaiulani, who loved peacocks, hence the peacock theme throughout the hotel. Loved the Princess Kaiulani wallpaper in the lobby. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet, a great deal when using the SPG card. Coffee, juices, toast, pastries, oatmeal, Japanese breakfast (miso soup, natto, tofu, pickled vegetables), breakfast meats, fruits, salad bar and omelets to order. Walking distance to many nearby restaurants, jazz entertainment across the street, and an ABC discount store for snacks located a few doors down.

She also called us right after we got to the room to see how we were doing, which I appreciated very much because it shows that she REMEMBERED us and that she CARED. Best customer service I have experienced at ANY hotel. Also, the location is PRIME! You're literally right across from Waikiki Beach, close to fast food chains and convenience stores, and just steps away from the best shopping and dining in Waikiki, including the new and improved International Marketplace which was right next door! The room was well furnished, clean and neat. The bed was VERY comfortable. The bathroom was well cleaned and the shower had the PERFECT water pressure and heat for a nice relaxing shower after a day of running around Waikiki. I also appreciated the AMAZING ocean view we had from our lanai (balcony). It's the perfect hotel for a short term or long term stay in the middle of everything Waikiki has to offer.

Its not a biggy at all. The lobby does not have A/C like most sheraton I've been to.Being an SPG Gold Member, I had a room upgrade to the 21st floor, with the ocean view. If you are not SPG gold and not willing to pay extra, you may get the lower level floor room, nothing wrong with that except from level 19 and below it has not been renovated, so I was told. The newly renovated room is good, the view is awesome :D I love it. You are right there on the strip, if you do not want to rent a car, this is a good location.The bed was very good, I sleep good at night, if I have to nitpick, some guest are a little loud at night, and I got woken up by the cleaners once or twice at 8 AM.Breakfast is $26 and dinner is $46, in room is well...extra. However, you live across the street from fast food restaraunt and down the street (walking distance) Chuck's Cellar is pretty damn good steak! (at a premium price of course) they do have singers come every night to host a show while you eat dinner.Parking is NOT free(most hotel in Waikiki isnt), $25 a day to include resort amenities, such as towels 250 spg point, the elevator for the parking garage is a little bit hard to find, however they do have it. Premium internet is $8 (?) a day for non SPG gold and platinum (you need to tell them its free, the IT guy does not know this, I actually had to point him to the website on SPG where it explicitly says complimentary premium internet) Premium internet is pretty fast, I was playing games a couple time (overwatch) and it dint lag (most of the time) Basic internet...if you want to do anything other than checking email, forget about it.There are no Spa or massage service here, instead they ask you to go across the street to the Westin (this is where you also go for the beach). The Massage service was good HOWEVER what they dint tell you upfront is a 21% service charge, kind of a hidden fees since they dont tell you, I was a little irritated when I saw the bills. the cost of my massage was 205 as stated on the pamphlet, I was able to get some SPG discount, however, after all cost and discount included it came to be $240 for a 75 min sessions, rip-off, considering other places do it for cheaper price.The shuttles from hotel to airport is $16 I dint personally sign up but I inquire about it.I also attended their luau, its a pretty good shows, I am not big into the whole luau thing however I was impressed. I also met the niece of one of the Olympian, she told me her uncle was the shiny Tonga guy that bear the Tonga flags in the opening ceremony.Overall its a good place if you are on a budget and want a SPG experience, however if you looking for a quieter place, with more of a luxurious resort feels, I think the Westin are better, you get what you pay for.so how would I improve this hotel? definitely the resort fees and service fees needed to be emphasize, the activity outside of the hotel need to be cheaper, they want $26 transportation to Hanamau bay (its $5 for first time entrance and other time it will be free) but if this is your first time in hawaii you wouldnt know any better, this is a Sheraton, however they charged like its the Westin, need to lower your prices a little bit for us 90% lower income folks. More in-house activity, the Sheraton (or le-meridien) in Vietnam have Casino, the Sheraton in guam have jazz & blues singer on certain days.","Honolulu, Hawaii",19,4.0

On that point, the hotel does offer a nightly buffet for $42 and a daily breakfast buffet for $26, which by all accounts are very good.My room was satisfactory for my stay with two double beds and a very ""industrial"" bathroom, consisting of a toilet and sink like you would find in a gas station washroom (no vanity counter top with the sink) and a bath/shower combo. Maid service was very good and highly attentive during my stay. I don't normally leave a tip for cleaning staff, but I did this time. The furniture in the room is very dated and the hotel apparently has an upgrade plan according to their Twitter account, but I'm unsure what their timeline is. Something I should mention is that if you have a room that faces the pool, don't plan on going to sleep before 9pm due to the band that plays nightly. This caused some concern for us as we had people in our group working midnight's and couldn't get sleep before starting work.If I was on vacation, I would have opted for one of the other nearby hotels, but this one wasn't my choice.","British Columbia, Canada",1,3.0

We arrived at midnight following a late flight and was very impressed when the lady on check in said she would upgrade our room as we were a honeymoon couple! Great we thought! Until we stepped out the lift on the 18th floor, we were quite surprised by the huge change in decor compared to the modern looking lobby areas. Then we were even more surprised by how outdated our room was, it was clean but everything from the decor to the furniture appeared old and worn, similar to the other reviews, it was like stepping back into the 80's. The bathroom was tiny - you had to step over the toilet to get into the shower. We were then wondering, if this was an upgrade, dread to think what the original room was like! As it was then early hours of the morning we headed to bed. So imagine our horror after just a few hours sleep, being woken at 5:50am by lorries and construction noises. Now daylight, I went out onto the balcony to discover that our 'upgraded' room overlooked the construction site next door! Despite being 18 floors up, the noise was horrendous. After complaining at the desk, we were moved to the 22nd floor to a very lovely, very modern, very recently renovated hotel room on the other side of the building. We had no complaints at all about this room, it was lovely! Once the room issue was sorted, we had a lovely stay and had no other issues with the hotel. The location is great, the staff are lovely and very helpful. They're obviously in the process of renovating the hotel slowly but surely, it just would have been nice to have had some pre-warning about the construction site next door and not been 'upgraded' to overlook it! I would only recommend this hotel if you can get a room on the top few floors facing away from the construction site.",,5,3.0

When we booked we had requested a room on a higher floor that was less noisy after reading reviews. I followed this up by personally ringing Waikiki, prior to holiday to check my request had been received, yes but when we arrived we were still on the 2nd floor. It took 10minutes before reception could/ would find a room with a double higher up. This was disappointing as we have stayed twice at the Sheraton on Hawaii island - loved it and thought it may be similar here. The location is excellent, close to the beach and the main drag. That I think is it's best feature; it is in the middle of Waikiki and close to everything. Our room on the 5th floor, once we had sorted out the original problem, was fine,the clean and quiet if somewhat dark with not a lot of lighting for nighttime. The bed was very comfortable and bathroom although clean, looked, and was a little tired . There was a balcony for the room which was very pleasant. The hotel caters to numerous large tour groups and on one day my husband was physically pushed out of the lift while 2 other people from the same tour were helped into the lift. This was not a nice look. We did not say anything until the end of our stay when the manager wrote a note of apology, but still it should not have happened. . We asked for the room to be cleaned regularly which occurred; not always replenishing sugars and tea etc, but overall given the name of the hotel slightly disappointing. One could say the hotel is modern in part but plastic glasses in rooms is not really a chic look,nor great to drink out of especially when you are paying a resort fee of $us 25.00 pd We did eat at the restaurant one evening with a group of friends and this proved to be disappointing especially as because there were 6 of us we were automatically charged 20% tip when the meal and service did not warrant it.

Been here so many times I've lost count. This is my #2 go to hotel in Hawaii. I've never had any problems here. This review is an overall impression of the past 10 years and is not about a specific stay. Hotel: I would classify this hotel as upscale business travel or high turnover vacationer so expect crowds, wait lines and not much quiet. To be fair, this hotel is over 60 years old so some of the rooms and amenities are starting to show their age. However, facility is well maintained. Pool area and bar is nice and staff always friendly. Dinner buffet has good selection, never had a bad meal. Service: This is THE REASON why I like staying here. Front desk is always friendly and accommodating if I have a special request. Because of flight schedules I often arrive at 10AM-11AM but they always find me a room if my original one isn't ready. The extra breakfast coupon for being SPG Platinum is greatly appreciated. Room: Older rooms tend to be on the small side but have always been clean. Rooms facing poolside are noisy because of traffic. Linens are always clean and crisp. Five pillows on each bed is nice. Carpet, dressers, chairs, etc. are getting a rather worn and stained, about ready for an upgrade. Bathroom: (mostly) Clean, very small and in need of upgrade. Calcium buildup on shower heads and fixtures is a long running issue and gives a poor impression. Location: Heart of Waikiki. Literally across the street from Waikiki Beach. Walking distance to world class shopping and restaurants. Overall a very good hotel with a staff that makes it what it is. I always look forward to each time I stay here.

The child's crib though is from the 80's and my son kept getting his foot stuck between the bars while he was sleeping which would wake him up screaming. The tour operator was great! He booked in all our tours nice and easy! The thing that I hated the most was the resort daily fee. Being from Aussie, I totally did not understand this extra charge which was about $30 a day. Not only that but when we checked in they said they needed a credit card to hold $10 in case we mess the room up. Which is fine but they never advised that every day they would be taking out the daily fee from the credit card as well!! I had only brought cash in to Hawaii so I never had to use my card and get charged the fee! After querying it with manager, he said it takes approx 30 days to get the money back off hold !!! What the! Lucky I noticed it after 3 days so only 3 days worth for taken out. I still don't know why the free wi fi and car parking isn't included already in the price and you have to pay this extra fee when you're there.

But what I could not grasp was how the hotel will not allow their guest to bring outside food and to have it be eaten outside near the pool. Obviously there are tables and chairs, but what makes the employees say to their guests that you can't eat outside food when right next to use there are other guest drinking drinks they purchased from the bar. I wish I got this employees name, but she literally told me to gather my things and to eat in my room! Overpriced food from the splash restaurant and buffet isn't even worth your time.

For around $200/ night, you get a central Waikiki location, a pool, beach chairs, and live entertainment. For $100 to $200 more per night you could stay across the street at the Moana Surfrider which is much nicer but if you want something more economical, the Princess is a great choice. I had a wonderful corner room again with an ocean view (room 1962). Every night there was a Hula show and live music in the bar after the show. My stay as a Platinum member included the breakfast and dinner buffets. I can’t complain for free but I wouldn’t pay $25 for the breakfast nor $45 for dinner. I would opt to eat at the Moana Surfrider breakfast buffet for a little more money. Eat across the street and stay at the Princess.","Los Angeles, California",62,5.0

The wifi is included in the resort fee, as is a 'free' photoshoot - but be warned, it's not just a couple of snaps by the waterfall in the resort, it is a full on cheesy photoshoot. The pool isn't as big as they make it out to be in the pictures, but it was cleaned everyday (I saw them doing it), and there were plenty of sun loungers. The chi chi cocktails by the pool were a highlight.This hotel wasn't cheap, but I imagine for Waikiki it's very good value and I would stay here again if I returned.","Hamilton, New Zealand",28,4.0

You will love it as much as we did. Not on the beach, but across the street from it, you can walk through the Moana across the street and enjoy drinks meals on the ocean. Beautiful theme, worth the time to learn the history, wonderful luau show, the beatles tribute was fun as well. Food was great, but the price tag was typical for a buffet on the strip, $24 breakfast, $50 dinner. The best part was definitely the people, ask for Kerry at the check in desk, she took care of everything we needed. Pay for the upgrade to poolside higher floors so you can see the ocean. I told Justin at the desk that we missed the kukui nut necklace making session and he took his own necklace off and gave it to me for my wife. That says it all. Watch out for the free photo session, they want $30 a picture or $200 for all of them. Food in the Splash bar was the best on the beach, small plates were a bargain. Pool was excellent, workout room was available 24-7. Resort fee included parking, which made it well worth it, other hotels fee was $30 and up not including parking.Stop comparing and hit the button, this is the one!","Perrysburg, Ohio",4,5.0

We were given our keys and when we went up to the room -- - the housekeeper was still making up the room. The next day we were out of the room from 8am until 3pm and the room had not been 'made-up'.

Once you fly first class you never want to go back to coach. They feed you a full course meal and you get to watch all the movies for free. Your seat reclines into a bed also they give you a pillow and a blanket. Plus you get to drink free.... Yesssss........ Ok back to the hotel it was really nice with a great view. The bathroom was clean but the bathtub could of used some updating. The location was a dream around so many stores and restaurants. There was a KFC across the street with really good chicken. We did a lot of shopping and if you get a chance to go buy some cookies from Honolulu Cookie. Waikiki is a great place to visit but to expensive to live.

Used the pool a lot and it was great, pool towels available, also beach chairs, water and fruit brought to you at the beach.

You can even use beach chairs from the hotel free of charge to take down with you. Fabulous service.There is a $25 resort charge per day (plus tax) so I guess this could add up.Although we were able to get to our room straight away - check in is not until 3pm which could have been a huge problem for us as we arrived at 9.30am, and check out is at 12 noon - our flight was not until later in the afternoon - but on this occasion it worked out well.

The rooms are spacious and offer everything you need king size bed, shower, bath, toilet, hair dryer, ironing board (which I found very handy), plenty of hanging space in the wardrobe, bar fridge and a safe which was great so we could store all of our money and important documents. The facilities are clean and well looked after and the staff are all lovely :-) The only thing I would say is if you're coming from Australia and happen to be on the flight that lands at 6am, make sure you get your travel agent to see if you can check in earlier otherwise you have to wait until 3pm which is a long day after you've been on a flight for ten hours, because all you want to do is shower and have a nap. When we arrived our room wasn't available until 1:30ish in the afternoon but we were lucky enough to be offered a complimentary room to use for 1 hour to be able to shower etc. We didn't eat at the hotel but found plenty of options along Waikiki beach as there is so much to choose from.

Noise was not an issue with the construction since most of it was completed and no work after 6pm. The location of the hotel was awesome, we were right across the street from the beach and paid half the price of the Hyatt which was right next door. Our room had a balcony with enough room for a table and two chairs. The hotel rooms are in need of renovation, but the size was fine for a family with two young children. We had a couple of issues during our stay, but each was dealt with promptly by the staff. Overall I would stay at this hotel again because of the location, price, and amenities available. Positives of the hotel:Location - close to beach, restaurants, shopping, grocery store, and anything else you might need or want.Swimming pool - even though it was not a heated pool it was still warm enough to swim in. I would say it was at least 78-80 degrees at the end of March.Lobby - was very inviting, had lots of areas for you to sit at and enjoy the breeze and have a ChiChi (which were delicious).Noise - or in our case lack of street noise in room 1263. Even with the construction and the busy street below we heard very little and no nose from the rooms next door.Staff - gentleman who does the kids activities was very friendly, restraunt and pool staff very prompt and friendly with service. Even with the amount of sand our children dragged in daily the cleaning staff made sure there everything was vacuumed and wiped clean. Bed - love their beds. I have difficulty sleeping on beds other than my one, but these were very comfortable and I was able to sleep through the night.Pricing - after a lot of research they had the best pricing for the location. The resort fee was very reasonable, it includes daily parking unlike other hotels which charges you separately for parking, wifi that worked well enough to stream videos, daily Kona coffee in the room, bottles of water daily and brought to you on the beach at certain times, towels and chairs to take to the beach, refrigerator in the room and safe in room. Negatives:Rooms are in need of a renovation, which I believe will be occurring this year. Pool closes at 7pm because of the nightly entertainment by the pool.Restaurant food was not worth the price. Even with a free voucher for a breakfast and dinner it was not good. The fresh cooked omelette were ok, but there is only a few items to choose from to put in the omelette. Pancakes were awful, boxed pancake mix is better than those served. Juice choices were good as were the choices of fresh fruit.Dinner buffet was so bad I didn't go back for seconds and I love to occasionally indulge at a buffet. The roast beef we had at a luau was better than the Prime Rib served, crab legs were not fresh as can be, sushi was very low quality, and whatever pasta dish they served one night was inedible. Dessert should be the best thing about a buffet and even that was a disappointment. They charge $42 per person for dinner and $24.50 for breakfast.",san jose,46,4.0

But what they do instead is have a block of just normal non-upgrade rooms that they will give you till whenever after you check out. This was awesome as my flight was at midnight.

The building we stayed in was positioned side-on to the beach, meaning we had lovely water and city views from our balcony. The rooms were fairly average size for hotel rooms. They were clean but we found the housekeeping a little hit-and-miss as everyday at least one item that had been used wasn't replaced/replenished eg. cups, water, inconsistent number of towels supplied etc.We didn't have any issues with construction noise as we were on the opposite side of the building. We could occasionally hear it, but not enough to bother us. I could imagine it would be much louder on the side overlooking the construction site.Every member of staff I encountered was very friendly and helpful - pretty much every person I encountered while in Hawaii was like this.I would stay there again based on it being a bit cheaper than other places around it, though it would be nice to see the hotel and pool area get updated.

Just across the road from the beach, and in the heart of Waikiki.The hotel lobby is amazing and there is always plenty of staff and things to do. The pool is great (would be nice if it stayed open a little longer than 7pm for evening swims). There is plenty of areas to sit and enjoy the wifi and watch sports on TVs. There is also a lot of pictures and items about Princess Kaiulani, which was a nice touch of history and information.We also watched the Polynesian show that was preformed in the small indoor stage, which was amazing. The fire twirler was my favorite part. The buffet was also amazing, with crab and sushi, plus plenty of other tasty dishes and deserts. Wait staff was good too, and kept the drinks coming.Tip: Sign up to the SPG group when you are at reception to get discounts on the hotel buffet. - we both signed up and got a free box of chocolate macadamia :)Our room was just what we needed: nothing too flash but enough to have an amazing night sleep, we stayed for 9 nights so we needed a comfy king bed every night and that's exactly what we got. There is a great little coffee machine in the room, and the TV and plenty of channels to choose from. We stayed during the Honolulu Festival and had a great view of the parade from our room too.Tip: bring pegs to hand your clothes on the balcony chairs as there is not enough balcony room to have a air drying rack.Next time I come to Hawaii I will definitely return and will recommend.","Brisbane, Australia",17,5.0

I had called a few weeks previous to confirm the reservations and let them know it was a special birthday for my wife and reason for the trip and was floored when we had our room upgraded and a bottle of wine and treat basket waiting for us. The hotel is perfectly located across the street from the main beach at diamond head. It's literally 5 minutes from room to beach. Don't forget to check out towels and beach chairs from poolside big kahuna station. Sadly some comments trash this place for outdated carpets and other small things. My view is that my wife is not giving birth on the carpets so I don't care if they have a little wear to them or were popular in the 80s. Everything was clean and smelled nice and that keeps my wife (me) happy. The room was clean and serviced nicely daily. The wifi was great. My advice is since you are paying the resort fee, take full advantage of the things it pays for. The pool is lovely and gets good sun exposure during the day. We took advantage of the professional photographer (in the lobby). We had called a few places prior to our arrival for family pictures and the hotel service was way cheaper and what I liked best, they weren't pushy trying to make the sale. Other merchants sell stuff daily also in a non pushy manner. My son's favourite daily event was helping the staff feed the Koi fish.

The Lanai's are very small and only just big enough for 2 people to sit on. We also used the Pool area and pool service which was excellent although the pool is a little fresh it was lovely and refreshing and not too cold at all.

The hotel did provide a free bottle of champagne which was very nice of them and was greatly appreciated. We also were given a free portrait but unfortunately every time we stopped to set it up no one was at the desk and when someone was finally there they had to time available, bummer but not a deal breaker.the reason for the review was the outstanding service provided by Lei at the Splash bar and Grill. Here is a waitress that does her job at 10 all day long. Professional, Polite informative and just a great person. We did not spend all our time at the splash bar and don't get the wrong impression, but while the splash bar is pool side it is best to have your best employees attending to the patrons needs and she gets 2 thumbs up and a 10 on our rating.

Our flight was coming in late on a Tuesday evening and I had called the hotel ahead of time to let them know my group was coming in late. They were very understanding and ensured me that our rooms we had reserved would be held. I also had asked that my husband and I's room be close to my mom and sisters and that is what we got. We were on the same floor we were just an arms length away. We stayed on the 7th floor room 718 close to the elevators. They stayed in room 702. Although our room was close to the elevators we did not get a lot of traffic noise in the hallway at all. Our room was facing the pool, but from a distance you could see the ocean and beach. I would consider this more of a partial ocean view. Both rooms were like this. Overall I felt the room was very comfortable and clean. You could tell in the the bathroom it's starting to rust in some parts, and maybe it could use an update, but it was functional. The only thing we had a problem with was the safe in the room. For the first few days we were there we had no issues with it. The last couple of days we were there it wouldn't work. I tried several times to reset it but it still would not open. Finally called the front desk and someone came and opened it. We had it reset and tried again, (this time I took all of ours stuff out and kept it with my mother in her room safe) and it still remained shut. Could not open it even after resting it. All I have to say is be careful. Yes, I did know my secret pin/code to unlock it. The location of the hotel was perfect. It was close to everything and a block in and half from the beach. The resort fee that we paid included the beach towels and chairs to carry down to the beach. We would check them out by the pool and carry them down to the beach area. You had to have them back b y 6 pm. If you sat in a certain area down by the beach the hotel staff came down a few times during the day offering cold water and fruits, which I thought was a nice idea.  We loved the lobby of the hotel it was great. The daily breakfast we had could use a tune up. It was the same thing almost every time. The only thing they switched out was the potatoes from roasted potatoes to hash browns and from sausage links to another kind of sausage. The hotel staff were very nice and we never had an issue with them. Whenever we left our room and housekeeping was around they were always very friendly and nice. Overall our stay was nice.

We ended up having to stay 3 extra nights. We didn't want to completely blow out our budget so we chose the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani. The front desk staff are friendly and we were upgraded to a partial ocean view room on a high floor. The rooms are very dated, but clean. We had a balcony that overlooked the pool area and offered us a nice view of Waikiki beach. The building is old, but had gone through some renovations. One thing that has not been upgraded as far as I can tell, is the elevators. They are very slow and you can be waiting a long time. We took advantage of the beach amenities (beach chairs and towels and fresh fruit) and lounged at the pool one afternoon. This is not a beach-front property, but it is very close. There is only one option to eat within the hotel and it is a buffet and expensive. We never ate there. This hotel is very close to many great eating options in Waikiki. The only hiccup we had came on our last day. We had previously requested a late check out and when we got back to our room at 10:50am our key had already been recoded. I had to go down to the front desk, but since I was coming from the beach, I didn't have a photo ID, do we had to wait until security could let us back into the room. They apologized for the inconvenience, but said we should have come to the front desk that morning to get our key re-keyed. I think the system should have been able to be programmed to have our key work until our requested check-out time. Other than the one hiccup noted above, our stay was pleasant. It wouldn't be my first choice when we come back to Waikiki, but it suited our needs.",,15,4.0

However, there was an issue there that made me distrust the staff. Upon my arrival, the valet who met me in my car said there was no elevator to the tower, so he'd arrange for my bag to be taken to my room. Ok, no big deal--I'd expected to give him a tip anyway for watching my car while I was registering. The next day I discovered he had lied to me about the presence of an elevator. As I was driving up the floors in the garage I saw a big sign showing the way to elevator access to my building. Seriously! This made me pretty distrustful of this place as they clearly are more interested in taking advantage of their guests to the point of lying rather than serving the guests' best interests.

On our return stay here we stayed in the ocean view rooms and there wasn't a lot of difference aside from the room being slightly larger. The main difference is the traffic through the hotel. The ocean view rooms have a separate lift tower and it is so lovely not to have to wait for the lift. The main tower gets incredibly busy and often have to wait for the lift and cram in with a lot of people. The pool area has a great atmosphere as does the lobby. Rooms are clean and staff are very helpful. This is a very popular hotel!","Sale, Australia",22,3.0

Yes it needs some refurbishment and currently is next to a building site ( but you cant blame the hotel for that!), but the rooms were clean and the bed very comfortable! The rooms had everything you would need! The staff were lovely! Nothing was a problem for them! Always called you by your name in the restaurant and bars. Service was good! AND every time you came into the hotel we were welcomed home! A lovely touch! Breakfast a bit expensive and slightly disappointing on choice not quality and quantity! Limited choice for American/ European tastes eg no cooked tomatoes, hash browns. Baked beans or mushrooms for the cooked breakfast! But the evening meal.....wow.... Excellent price to get a fresh crab, beef, and a variety of lovely food buffet! The soup delicious and the deserts to die for! The meals at the bar were also good! The local raw fish dish beautiful! And a good price for drinks! At the end of our stay we checked out but had a late flight! The lady on the desk told us to enjoy the resort - we got towels for the beach and pool! Free wifi and then access to a room to freshen up! We also access our cases at any time and never felt that we were pestering the bell boys- who are soooooo lovely! The concierge (unfortunately i cant remember her name) was fantastic!! She was helpful with giving us directions to places and advice on other things! Nothing was too much trouble! Tommy on the tour desk was also brill and he recognised us from two tears ago! Now thats service! So if you want a hotel that that is aesthetically perfect but doesn't care about its customers then this isn't the hotel for you! BUT if you want a hotel that treats its customer with respect is friendly, clean and goes out of its way to make your stay in Honolulu special then book into the Sheraton Princess Kaiuliani.

Great position with restaurants and beach a short stroll. Got upgraded to ocean view which was nice but being back 1 street from beach only got a glimpse of ocean. Very friendly staff and couldn't be more helpful. The room is older style but more that comfortable with a decent bed and bathroom, not 5 stars but clean and adequate. A small lanai was nice to sit and relax with a drink. Ate a meal poolside which was good and the service was quick and smart, which was appreciated after being awake for so long after a 10 hour flight. The entertainment of hula dancing and singing was fantastic and was great to watch while eating my meal.Had a couple of swims in the pool which was refreshing after the flight.

The lobby has the pool area and main restaurant right there with a few conferences room at the furthest end. It's nice but nothing that says wow, welcome to Hawai'i. Check-in was quick and smooth though the Ainahau elevators notoriously always had a line at the peak hours (checkin time, after lunch, after dinner).

This room has a balcony with a beach / pool view: while other conference-goers who got rooms next to elevators reported rooms plagued with a nonstop metallic clang (1548), mine was quiet and had good light-block curtains. The room temperature was comfortable.The breakfast buffet had broiled salmon, omelettes, broiled white fish, and hard boiled eggs. The omelette chef is amazing, but even with her speed, the line can be long. Most of the carbs are highly refined: white rice, sweet pastries, french toast, pancakes, etc. There is miso soup with a selection of add-ins (tofu, scallion, natto, e.g.). The cut fruit was fresh and thoughtfully cut (small enough to fit in the tongs): standard selection + papaya, for a tropical twist.Major caveat: the elevators are extremely slow. Allot 15 minutes for an up-down trip: sometimes you luck out and three in a row come, but usually you have to wait; moreover, elevators that stop at the lobby close quite aggressively -- if you don't get in them right away, they'll be whisked away to another floor before you can hit the up button to call one again. I have avoided returning to my room (to get something, e.g.) because the elevators could be so slow.Check-in was smooth and the desk was happy to send toothpaste up for me, which was much appreciated. My room key stopped working one evening, and I was able to call the front desk for help: a security person came promptly (he must've lucked out with the elevators) and got me a new key.It's a good room, but I wouldn't pay these prices myself.

We were allocated room 408 in the Princess Wing, overlooking the pool with a great view of the stage for each night's entertainment (the stage view from some rooms on levels 2 and 3 may be impeded by foliage). We even had a small view of the ocean. Each evening's entertainment poolside was different but all very pleasant as we had our dinner on the balcony (lanai). The room itself was comparatively large with a huge king size bed, large flat screen TV, a Kona coffee machine, iron and ironing board. Minimal noise from the Main Street. The furniture was ""beachy"" - just what we expected in Waikii! The room was very clean and well-serviced daily in the afternoon. There was an ice machine on our floor, which was very convenient. The balcony was in shade in the morning, in sun in the middle of the day and then in shade late in the afternoon, which was great. The fridge was the coldest we had experienced at any hotel and large enough for an evening bottle of wine and breakfast goodies from the adjacent ABC shops and street markets. The bath was low-set which meant easy access to the fully adjustable shower. The safe was also quite large and easy to use. Unexpectedly, we were given a lovely fruit basket compliments of the hotel on the first morning. Plenty of lounges under umbrellas poolside. There is a laundromat (washers and dryers) for $3 a load in the basement, with a small sitting area. The resort fee of $26.18 covers parking (we didn't need it), wifi, daily water, phone calls (including 1 hour to Australia every day), beach towels, beach chairs and fruit & water in the Sheraton section of the beach. Our SPG membership gave us discounts off meals at the PK, Moana and Sheraton Waikiki.

I was able to see Diamond Head from my balcony and see the beautiful Moana Surfrider in full splendor right on Waikiki Beach. I had my suitcases delivered and rested for about an hour. I headed down to the lobby and low and behold, an old acquaintance from 20 years prior was still making and selling his jewelry in the lobby. I had just purchasde a ukulele and had it with me, I asked if he played and play he did!! He is 82 years old now, but 20 years prior had taken my friends and I on a tour of the highlights of Oahu, including a great Chinese lunch. Boy we laughed hard all those years ago. Even though he had no memory of us, I enjoyed his sharp mind and awesome ukulele playing.

Building is supposed to be completed by Aug 2016, so over the next few months noise levels should start to improve, as internal construction of the building will start. Reception did tell me that these rooms are allocated to rooms booked through an alternative source ie: Travel Agent, other booking agent & the Eastern Side Rooms facing away from International Market Place are allocated to bookings made direct with the hotel. However you can call up & ask for a Supervisor once your booking is made & ask for a East facing room. It wasn't always pleasant sitting on our balcony when construction was happening, but we didnt go to Hawaii to sit on our balcony from 7am-5pm & in reality we were away from our room from 10am-4pm most days. Room was fine but felt Bathroom was dated, & in need of updating, along with general mantienance of the room ie -our iron board was broken & fridge shelf broken.My biggest gripe would be the poor ventilation as you neared the lefts located by the Restaurant Area as we were coming & going from our room. It was very overpowering, & a couple of times made me feel queezy.Even though I have said Cons, in the big scheme of things they arnt major. Overall we had a great stay & considering what we paid in comparison to other properties we would return to SPK. If you are looking for a good value 3 star property this is the place to stay.

Loved everything about the hotel including its location, food service at breakfast ,front desk and dining staff, and the rooms. First room we booked was a nice non-smoking room with a pool view. It had been recently renovated. I was still a smoker back then so wanted room changed to a smoking room. New room was located a few floors up and although it hadn't been renovated like the first room and looked a little worn, it had a great view of the pool area and famous Waikiki [?] Beach . All rooms at the Princess have great little balconies with glass sliders. If other high rise buildings didn't block it, we could have seen down the whole beach area to Diamond Head ! The breakfast buffet was impressive with the usual expected foods plus a lot of Asian specialties ! Dining was either out in the open near the pool or inside under a covered area with view. Perfect location to sight see from. The beach was just across the street. Glad the condo market there softened as we heard the Princess was to be torn down for high end condos .

During our stay there was 1 night the Moana was completely booked up, so we were booked into their sister property right across the street. I now wish we would have been booked into the other Sheraton (Waikiki) property as it looked like a better quality hotel. My husband is a SPG Platinum member, he always receives a suite upgrade. If this room was an upgrade, I'm so afraid to know what the other rooms must be like.For those of you who know my reviewing style; I'm detailed- so if you like skip to the info you need.Parking: No valet. Is self-park and you retrieve from a large garage yourself. If you are on a budget, may be a plus for you. Upon check-in they do bring bags up to your room, so you don't completely get around tipping.Received no flower Lei greeting upon check-in.Pool- is small. It seems most pools in the area are small. (For big pools go to Maui, I guess). The pool is very public, right next to the lobby, the walkway from the luggage stand leads to the pool. Sidewalks with people selling paintings & hocking wares are right in front of the pool. Behind a scrubby hedge is the main drag of Honolulu, Kalakaua Ave. with all the traffic and pedestrians whizzing by. This is not going to be a sit by the pool quietly, relax with the island breezes blowing through the palm tree's while you peacefully read your book. Think loud, crowded & ""Seen"". Maybe you like that?The Beach: Put on your bathing suit & drag your beach stuff across the street, through the hotel, down around. Come back wet & cold. Get the idea. Staying at the beach is better, then across the street if you can. The Lobby: Not sure what the style is suppose to be. Contemporary, retro, tropical. It's just strange & no working. They have lots of posters for cheesy, magic shows & Elvis tribute shows that no one would attend unless they were part of a prepackaged tour group. The elevators were hot & stuffy.Room: The hallways were so hot, obviously did not have A/C. The hallways smelled badly. The room/suite was straight out of 1950. Maybe they thought it was the Hawai'i 5-0 suite. We were greeted by a harvest gold love seat, avocado green bath fixtures, and formica counters. The kitchenette had a Scotsman mini-fridge. I didn't actually check to see if it was still running. It had really low ceilings, old draperies & old furniture.The a/c unit rattled loudly.We were on the 28th floor. It was super loud, with traffic & construction noise from the International Marketplace, directly next door. There was a large balcony, with double sliders across the room. The huge balcony could be a big plus, except the balcony furniture was rusted & broken. Then someone had apparently tried to repair it with some duct tape. The balcony had a side ways view of ocean.Bathroom: The mirror was so old that the shine had rubbed off it in many places, it was also missing part of the metal. The avocado green bathtub montrostry/shower had a see through window with a retro frosted fern window looking out over the bed.Sleep: Earlier in the day, I took a nap. I awoke to something crawling on me. It was a small ant. There were several ants in the bed & on the floor. I then pulled out the bed and sure enough there appeared to be some kind of insect trap behind the bed.

My husband and I had the room at the end of the corridor and on entry I was appalled at the size and how old and smelly it was. It had a balcony that overlooked a construction site and the outdoor furniture so filthy I couldn't even sit on it. The room was barely big enough to accomodate both our suitcases and the smell immediately started playing havoc with my sinus. We had when booking asked for a refurbished room as a lot of the TripAdvisor comments had said that parts of the hotel were old and smelly. We had made our booking as part of a package through a holiday group and we emailed them to request it was really important that we didn't get dank smelly old carpeted rooms. My husband planned this trip for our adult kids and their partners as a family holiday and we had been to Hawaii twice before and been so happy with everything. First time staying at a VBRO property on the Northshore and then the Westin Surfrider at Waikiki and the 2nd visit staying at the Hyatt (our favourite). The children's rooms were slightly better in that their furniture appeared newer. My husband asked us all to stay put and not to unpack and he would be back. He came back 45 mins later and said he had managed to get rooms for us all at the Hyatt across the road. I will write a review on that experience but will say it will be much more positive than this one. The Sheraton call themselves 3 star but I would say it is more 1.5 star.,,21,1.0

In truth, that's about the only saving quality of this hotel. That and maybe the convenience of the parking garage I suppose.The main lobby is definitely outdated, with odd smells wafting in the air. Staff and service are average. The clean up crew was friendly, very pleasant to deal with, but calling down to the front desk was a hassle every time, consuming five minutes of hold time, even just for quick queries.We had originally booked ourselves for three two queen size bed -rooms, and one king size bed-room. Upon arrival, we came to learn that we had been placed in three king size bed-rooms. When we called the front desk, they stated that when they were booked, the request for said rooms was just something for consideration and not necessarily a reservation. Disappointing, and the front desk person said they would contact us as soon as the rooms opened up. There were other hurdles in just trying to get situated but I'd rather not elaborate. More importantly, inevitably they were able to get us one more room that had the two beds. Now the rooms. they were just subpar, lackluster isn't even a fitting word. The bathrooms smelled, and each room had a differently tiled bathroom, some older than others, definitely not what you'd expect from a place that specializes in accommodations. Rooms were tight as well and the amenities were just old. Having said all that, the company we were with, and the convenience of everyone being on the same floor and the hotel's location made for somewhat of a positive experience. Just OK, leaning towards, we've experienced better. Thank god for the good company we had with us.","Los Angeles, California",31,2.0

(I was traveling alone and walked everywhere.) I was very surprised by the open air lobby, but this was my first time to Hawaii. I didn't know what to expect from these big name hotels on the Waikiki strip. I guess the open air setting is common. But the lobby at SPK must have been recently renovated.I would have given this property the highest rating was it not for the outdated room that I had, which also seemed partially ready upon my entering. (Clues such as a chair in the wrong place and the trash & recycle bin were on top of the desk.) IMO - some minor renovations could do these rooms wonders! The other issue was that I had a slow draining tub. My 16th floor room had a balcony that faced the city view. Directly below me was the construction of the new Marketplace shopping center. I could see a tiny sliver of the beach/ocean. Although they did warn me about my city view (versus the beach), they did not mention the construction, which is happening all over Honolulu. I know the noise bothered some other reviewers, but I'm a heavy sleeper, and it really didn't bother me. The construction pretty much starts up at 7 am, but will stop immediately around 5 pm. Besides - you're not supposed to be in your room much... you're supposed to be outside enjoying Hawaii!Overall, I had a great time at the SPK.

The sliding door rattled very loudly with the hard wind blowing. The carpet was disgusting. the wall paper in the room was coming off. The bathroom had cracked vanity and tiles as well as MOLD.

We were excited by the presentation of the entrance foyer, it was grand, modern and very impressive. It was from here that the dissapointment began. After an 11 hour flight, 1 hour to get through customs and a 45 minute shuttle service to the Sheraton, we were greeted at reception with ""we don't have a reservation in our system for you"". Shock horror, despite having documentation showing our reservation it took nearly an hour for the young guy to find us a room which was supposed to be equal to what we had paid for. We were put on the 29th Floor in a room that looked like it had not been renovated since the 80's and the bathroom was well in need of some work. The room had a view of the city but the promised ocean view was only visible if you leant forward or looked around the corner. Surprised and DissapointedFor our inconvenience??????, we were offered a free breakfast for two and two free cocktails. The breakfast was dissapointing in that the bacon was rock hard, the juice watered down to the max and birds flying/landing in the uncovered fruit platters on display. I'm glad it was free because it saved the staff further complaints. When we reported the birds in the fruit platters, they were moved but we did receive a smug look from the lady who we pointed this out too. Also during breakfast, we observed and heard two female staff members arguing over who was responsible for doing what at a certain time. This occurred in front of all the customers seated ( about 6) at the time. Very unprofessional. Surprised and DissapointedWhilst looking to confirm a tour the following day with the Concierge, we were advised that this was not her job and we should do it from our own room where it was free. Surprised and Dissapointed.On the positive side the two ladies who looked after the both of us at the Splash Pool Bar were amazing. Lea and Angie (I think) were there to do anything they could to make our stay enjoyable. Great Service ladies.The bed in the room (King Size) was brilliant. With an upgrade to facilities the Sheraton could be a great place to stay whilst in Hawaii. Close to just about everything in Honolulu.With the Surprise and Dissapointment with our stay, the best I can rate is an Average but things could be so much better.As can be seen from my previous posts, it is rare that I provide negative feedback but I'm sorry Sheraton, it had to be done on this occasion.

Waikiki beach is busy but gorgeous, soft sand, clear warm calm water, although you can also surf, outrigger canoe (just like Hawaii 50!) and catamaran ride to your heart's content. Loved it. So many cool things to do and see on Oahu. Rainbows, tropical beauty, luaus, hike up Diamond Head, endless beaches, drive to the North Shore, go gliding at Dillingham Field, Pearl Harbour.

Not so here. Just a small coffee percolator and terrible creamer - those tiny little pots of UHT milk/cream. So just a tip...brink your own milk and tea bags and ask at the front desk for a jug. They may have one. There was one in the room where you get ice which we purloined for our stay.Beds were comfy - amazing pillows, crisp white sheets as you would expect. We had nice views over the pool area. Balconies are very tiny. Air-con is very cold. Bathrooms nice.Concierge staff were sometimes helpful, sometimes seemed to speak limited English (LOTS of Japanese tourists in Honolulu and so it seems concierge staff are hired accordingly). Don't make the mistake of asking the tour organiser guy questions instead of the concierge. Their desks are near each other. The tour guy just wants to sell you tours obviously so his 'knowledge' is about tours, most of which you could do by catching a bus or even a taxi for less. Ask the concierge about those :)Restaurants and bars are good. Cocktails delicious and food tasty and reasonably priced. Good value 'resort fee' too including wifi, towels around the pool, water bottles in your room and a few other things.Location is perfect for exploring Waikiki and shops and restaurants.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at Sheraton Princess Kaiulani and would definitely consider a return visit.",,0,4.0

The real plus here is the staff Tommy on the activities desk was beyond fantastic booked all my trips with no issues helped do all I wanted in my stay. Bar staff also get big thumbs up really good fast service even gave advice on late opening bar's. Only down side I had ocean. View room with view of mountains great but was also over a building site so had noise during day but not real issue as was out all the time it if you like to sleep in could be a problem.

We were sitting by the front door, waiting for a bus to take us to a breakfast orientation at another hotel and have breakfast while there. Near the time for the bus to arrive, I had a ""medical issue"" that worried me to the extent that I told my wife I needed medical attention NOW! She alerted the doorman, Melvin, that i was indistress and he immediately alerted the hotel security staff. Within 5 minutes, three security staff were at my side and giving me first aid and gathering information on my condition. They called for an ambulance and EMT's at once and I was in the bus, hooked up to an EKG, and feeling much better within no more than 10 minutes more. They suggested I go to Docs On Call, a walk-in clinic, at another hotel for further tests. I was taken there by one of their cars and got to see a Doctor within 30 minutes. If I had experienced a cardiac event, had it not been for the quick action of the hotel staff, I would have most likely expired. I later found out that the Sheriton hires off-duty fire/rescue people to take care of any medical issues that may come up at their hotels. I am forever grateful for their quick attention and quality care. Whatever emergency plans the hotel has, they were followed to the letter.  Now, to the revue, the only thing we were even mildly concerned about was the ""resort fee"" that we had to pay and had no choice in. We were charged a daily fee for all 7 days for things we would never use, such as, parking on the property, a photograph that they chose the pose to give us for ""free"", and in-room wi-fi. At check-in we were given an upgrade to a corner room for no additional charge, but that room faced the construction going on right next door. This was a mildly annoying thing since they started work around 5:00 or 6:00 AM and worked until around the same time at night. The room was quiet enought hat we slept through most of the noise, but light sleepers would probably benefit from a room on the other side of the hotel. The housekeeping staff was EXCELLENT! Our room was cleaned and made up every day and was always neat and clean despite the fact that we left swim suits and other clothes and items strung all over the room as typical hotel guests do. We received a bottle of Champagne since we were staying over our anniversary and got two bottles of water every day. We had two refrigerators in the room and a nice flat screen TV. The food on the buffet was VERY good with lots of fresh fruit every day and a large selection. The prices were high, but so was every other eatery in the area, so no surprises. The hotel staff was always very polite, very efficient, and catered to our every whim. The beach was right across the street and access was very easy. I would never pay for a beach front hotel when the short walk gets you to the same place. This hotel was worth every penny we spent on it and we will stay there again if we decide to go back to Hawaii. The bad revues others have given this hotel only prove that some people just can't be pleased no matter what you do for them. I witnessed a guest getting VERY ugly with a check-in staff member for a problem that the ""guest"" created, but still wanted them to fix it. Some people are just idiots.","Canton, IL",1,5.0

The Sheraton Princess K was one of the more affordable options with good reviews. Location was TERRIFIC. From our pool-view room we could see one of the colonial towers of the Moana Surfrider, just a block from the beach, close enough to feel we weren't stranded in the cheap seats. The lobby sets the aloha tone with its open doors, lanai-style, leading to pool, lush fan palms, pretty pocket grotto garden and street side access. Our room was ready for our 3PM check in and the front desk clerk was efficient and friendly. When we first drove into the parking garage the self-parking sign was posted at $40/night. Ugh. The extra charges of travel started piling up in my mind. I gave my credit card to the clerk at check in and he stressed the benefits of paying for the Resort Fee. Sigh. More charges. However, this sounded *optional*. (We've stayed at a Sheraton in Newport Beach, CA and the resort fee is not optional there.) Do tell! For $26 we get free 24 hour parking, premium internet access ($14 value), 2 complimentary bottles of water, free beach chair rental and towel service on their section of the beach (which we didn't have time to visit) and a room upgrade from city view to pool view with a very nice balcony. Sign me up!Our room was quiet, clean, with comfortable beds, extra pillows, coffee maker, good water pressure in the shower. I withhold one star for grimy smudges on the wallpaper in the bathroom (it is an older hotel) and no elevator in the 5 story parking garage. We had to park on the top level and thump, thump, thumped our way down 5 stories with luggage. Even though we travel light our bags are bulky. I'm fit but also 59. So, yeah. The handicapped access ramp in the hotel lobby doesn't lead anywhere so you can't roll luggage down that into the garage. Next time one of us waits downstairs with the bags while the other person parks & walks down. Live and learn. Overall, I would definitely stay here again!

After a 9 hour flight it was great to use the hospitality room to freshen up, this room has a shower, toilet, and lounge and you have the use of it for 1 hour.As we arrived early in the morning I did not expect our room to be ready, but when I went down to return the key from the hospitality room, Sharon informed me that our room was ready. Had a room on the 4th floor overlooking the pool and to the left we could see the ocean. On arrival to the room it was great to find that the air con had been left on, left this on all night and was never noisy. I work in the hospitality industry and I gave the room a thorough inspection and found the room to be spotless. The only downside was that you could hear the shower/toilet in the adjoining room but this is the norm in most hotels.Daily housekeeping was always great, always had the garbage empty and fresh towels. Included in the resort fee was 60 minutes of long distance calls per day, which I used to call back home and two bottles of water daily, don't know what the car parking was like as we didn't use a car. Didn't eat at the onsite restaurant or order room service either so can't comment on these.The resort is in close proximity to everything, only a couple of minutes walk to Waikiki Beach and there is a Subway, Burger King and KFC across the road as well as a convenience store. Is also in walking distance to heaps of shops, markets and restaurants. We got the local bus to Walmart and the Ala Mona Shopping Centre. for $2.50 per adult each way, and $125 per child, but used a taxi to get home which was only $20 including tip.Spent the whole day at Ala Mona Shopping Centre, which they are extending and had Bubba Gumps for dinner. We also went to the Premium Outlets, which was a waste of time, mainly high end stores and not many of them.Went to Pearl Harbour with Roberts Hawaii bus company for $86 per person which included the bus and entry to Pearl Harbour, the Arizona Memorial and tour of the Mighty Moe, Only downside was that it didn't include time to visit the Aviation Museum, so I would pay extra and do that. Also It is a working naval base and you have to take your photograph ID or Passport with you and you have to put all bags in a locker, except for what you can fit in your pockets.Did an Island Tour with Hawaii Turtle Tours, they take you to Diamond Head, Blow Hole, Makcapu, Secret Beach, Chinaman's Hat, Lale Point, Sunset Beach, Turtle Beach and the Dole Pineapple Plantation. If your lucky you can swim with the turtles but unfortunately we only saw 3 and they were in the shallows on the rocks and due to the sharpness of these we were unable to swim with them. But it was still a great tour in a mini van, so is a bit more personal than being on a big coach.Had a fantastic stay, all the staff were very friendly and helpful and room was always clean and tidy and only have positive memories.","Newcastle, Australia",8,5.0

If you want to stay smack down right in Waikiki, by the main street Kalakaua Ave, and just need to cross two streets to be on Waikiki Beach, close to the little pier, this is the place to stay. Walking distance to just about everything in Waikiki. And the rooms are ok, nothing more, nothing less. I arrived a day late for my pre-paid room, Tower high floor ocean view, and missed one of my three nights due to delayed long-haul flight from Europe. Knowing the money was lost (hotel gained) I asked if there was anything they could do to maybe comp me a little, as a small token of appreciation for having -given- them my money and not even stayed there. Well, I couldn't get a better room, cause I already booked one of the better one they could offer, nor could they do anything else… So no, they could not do anything… Really?? For the price I paid, and thinking the Sheraton name had a certain standard to it, I have to say I was a little disappointed. The hotel was old and dated, and the friendliest people were the mades and the concierge, not impressed by the hotel it self or the front desk. The day I was leaving I had a knock on my door, and there was an employee with a gift from the manager delivered to me. I was quite baffled about this, I accepted and closed the door. In the gift basket there was a card, and my suspicions were confirmed; this was not for me! So I quickly ran out in the hall and found the guy who brought it to me, and said this was a mistake - this was not for me. Of course he was very happy that I was so honest, but that is just me. Now, my concern is how the hotel did not know that I was still in the room, and not the new guest? I had not checked out, and obviously the new guest had not checked in… Another point off for the front desk who should really keep track on things like that. I had a whole day to spend in Waikiki the day I was leaving, so I asked for a wi-fi connection - cause the one I used got disconnected when I checked out. (It was heavy rain that day so didn't feel like walking around). They tried to give me several codes, that did not work, but they could not give me any other connection, like the one I had. But I could use their computer. I needed wi-fi to get in touch with my friends through iMessage (not having a US cell). So that didn't help me at all. And they were not willing to help me in any other way, and I could not pay for a connection either. Luckily I know Starbucks and Jamba Juice are very wi-fi friendly =) The pool area is a lot smaller than it looks from the photos, and its also right by the lobby, so I felt a bit on display from more people than necessary. I feel in a pool area, there should be mostly pool people, not every single person passing through the lobby…Oh, and just one more thing: right next to the hotel, they are doing construction on a huge area, so if you stay at that side, it might get noisy very early in the morning.","Haugesund, Norway",18,3.0

All staff were friendly and welcoming and attentive to our concerns (had to call the front desk twice; once regarding the shower head in tub - it fell from the wall when support broke and once when the toilet tank wouldn't fill after flushing). Both times I called someone was there within 5 minutes and fixed the problems. Also got to use a hospitality room for showering the evening of our flight home since we checked out at the normal time.

As the majority of places these days have free wifi this seems to be an additional cost that could be waived. The hotel pool closing at 7pm is also a problem as most families with young children use this facility and with the weather being so warm it is constantly being used.

We could see the ocean from our hotel room, and walked to Waikiki beach to splash in the ocean. The lobby is open air, centered around a standard looking pool. I do take issue with the elevators-no air conditioning, though it was a relatively short ride, if we were lucky enough to go straight to our 26th room floor without a crowd of other people, the hot box made me dizzy and nauseous. The rooms are pretty standard, but whoever cleans the rooms did awesome- my mom must have brought the whole beach with her one day and left tons of sand everywhere, the room cleaners made the room like new. We didn't try the Pikake restaurant, we weren't tempted, you could smell it every time you walked in the lobby and towards the tower elevators, if you like seafood and a Japanese flavors you might find it appealing.

From booking to check-in to check-out, everything went well. The ease of everything enhanced my trip. Here’s what I loved: 1. The room – well appointed, balcony with a south facing view, 42-inch flat screen high def TV, private, small fridge, desk and a full-size dresser. 2. Wi-Fi – decent internet speed was accessible everywhere on the property. 3. The location!!! The hotel is caddy-corner from Waikiki Beach. This means the hotel is next door to the best shopping in the Hawaii, and about a 200 – 300-foot walk to Waikiki Beach sand and water. 4. Outside services – the pool and outside services are in front on the hotel but surrounded by tropical gardens, walls, and a black lava koi pond. The outside team assists with the pool, but more importantly you can check out then take your towel and a foldable chair to the beach. This process was really easy, and there was never a wait. We changed are towels 5. The lobby of the hotel is expansive and Lanai style so you constantly get to feel that warm Hawaii air. 6. The pool is warm and clean and there are plenty of chairs. I really liked how the pool had a real deep end that was over 8 feet. 7. My wife and I work out almost daily so having a real gym was awesome. They had high-end treadmills, ellipticals, weight machines, but what I thought was great is that not a lot of hotels have, is free weights. 8. Water! The hotel has a water dispensing service that is sourced from an artisan well off-site. We were able to fill up our water bottles with delicious Hawaiian spring water, so we saved a ton of money on not buying bottled water – we also received 2 complimentary bottles in our room per day. 9. The Elevator – my wife loved this; the elevator close door button works! As soon as you push button or select a floor the doors close and you’re on your way. We probably saved 30 minutes over the course of our trip by never having to wait on our elevator. 10. Parking – parking was convenient and included in our resort fee. The parking is not on the main street that goes up it down, it along with the formal entrance is on a side street which means getting in and out is a lot less stressful. 11. Communication – I communicated with the hotel via email, over the phone, and on Social Media. Every communication was prompt, and courteous. Because they were so attentive on Social Media when I was trying to decide where to stay, I chose this hotel. Shootout to Esther for making this happen. My stay here was fabulous, and pricing was so much less than adjacent properties, and there was so much more included in terms of services than a condo rental. It was a real resort experience, with all the amenities and convenience that comes with it. The only downside is that I didn’t have more time to stay there (we were only in Hawaii for one week), but two weeks or ten days even at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani would have made this Hawaii trip even better. I can’t wait to come back!","Portland, Oregon",5,5.0

The balconies are large and feel private. In the evening, when there is a band playing pool-side below, you don't want to leave. - staff is very friendly and very accommodating.- great location As for the cons:- I think your experience of this hotel will greatly depend on the room you get. Ours had updated linens but otherwise needed a major refresher. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the ceiling had water stains, and our bathroom could have definitely used some fresh, no moldy grout. Beside the entrance to our door someone had written on the wallpaper with a sharpee and there didn't seem any effort to remove it. - I think the rooms good use a bit better cleaning or perhaps supervision. A wipe down of the outdoor seating would have been nice. Our tv and lamps were also really dusty and the carpet was in pretty bad shape. - The room across from us ordered room service on night and left their plate in the hall that same night. It was not picked up until almost a full day later. Again I'mnot sure what the process is for room service pick up but a day sitting in the hall seems like a long time.- I understand this is an older hotel and I actually love it for that. I wish some of the original details came through instead of being hidden under 80s era interior design. The beds were fine, linens were clean, the view was great and everyone was friendly.

We had a problem with our television, and within 10 minutes we had a tech in to fix it and he was in and out in no time, problem solved. The maids, the front desk, the concierge, the waiters and waitresses, pool staff - no matter where we went, they were so gracious and helpful it was stunning. This hotel is a little older, and the sound between rooms travels (you noisy Aussies!), but the beds are very comfortable, the air conditioning works very well and we were always comfortable and enjoyed our stay immensely. We were in walking distance of the beach, great restaurants, shopping, and Da Bus! We stayed 6 days and saw most of the island taking the city buses and a Circle Island tour that picked us up and let us off at the hotel door. We enjoyed our stay here immensely, and I would recommend the hotel for anyone coming to Honolulu for a stay.","Saskatoon, Canada",0,4.0

With an Ocean View room in the tower looking out over Waikiki & the Westin Moana Surfrider I was happy with the room for my stay. Sure, the hotel is quite a veteran of Waikiki accommodation and the rooms are not refurbished but my room had a sweet sleeper bed, widescreen TV and a clean bathroom.For travellers to Waikiki who won't be staying in their room much during the day it is a great hotel with a great location and you will save lots of dollars!The staff are friendly and helpful, check in was easy and early so that is a big bonus rather than waiting around all day for your room to be ready. The towel & beach chair service is excellent if you want to go over to the beach rather than hanging by the pool.Music every night poolside so good for grabbing a cocktail & relaxing either before heading out for the night or on the way back.Free WiFi, parking,2 bottles of water & phone calls included with the resort fee so I got my value out of it. Also The Link @ Sheraton is great for checking your flights & printing boarding passes or checking your work emails if you really have to.So I can easily recommend Princess Kaiulani for smart travellers who want location, sharp pricing and lots of Aloha when staying in Waikiki.","Sydney,Australia",29,4.0

You are surrounded by all that Waikiki has to offer. Plenty of places within easy walking distance. Seniors that have issues being on their feet for too long will appreciate how centralized this place is. Its not the cheapest place in Waikiki but not near expensive either.-Entertainment by the pool is nice although with so much coming and going of guests and non-guests, it can be a little hard to relax and get into the vibe of it all. But that's ok because you'll be drawn to all the commotion happening just outside and be swept up like salmon in a stream flowing here and flowing there.-This area is pretty much across the street from a police station (next to the Surf Rider) and kept in good shape. Although you still need to be on your guard against pick-pockets and other undesirables (like any big city) this area is fairly clean and safe as opposed to offerings nearer to Kapahulu Avenue (nearer the zoo).-The resort fees aren't so bad and as I said, parking is VERY easy here which is a huge plus.-My one gripe is that the AC is connected to other rooms...Meaning if you have some jerk ignoring the rules and smoking in their room, your room with wreak of cigarettes. A simple call to security however will remedy it real quick. Please, be considerate of others, you don't know if your neighbor has breathing problems, take it down stairs...After all, I'd offer the same respect to you!-Remember, don't let Waikiki consume your trip.

On top of that, we were given a hospitality room (smaller hotel room) where we could shower after a day at the beach before our flight free of charge - which was AMAZING.

The rooms are not completely ""up to date"" (mostly bathrooms), however, you aren't spending much time in your hotel room anyway...lets be serious.

Splash , the pool bar had fantastic cocktails (the Mai Tai and Tropical Itch were our favorites) and the food was really good too (the garlic fries!!!).

We spent 17 Glorious days at the Sheraton Princess Kauilani and we took full advantage of the beautiful Island if Oahu. This being our first trip back in 8 yrs after an accident this trip was monumental for myself. The Island captured the hearts of both myself and my Daughter all over again as if it was our first visit. First let me recommend this Hotel for the kindness and sincerity of the staff, the amazing Ocean View, Clean, Comfortable beautiful rooms, the amazing Lanai that you can sit on morning or night after all your adventures just listening to the Ocean waves, in the evening you can listen to local music being played often by someone on a Saxophone. I never found this individual but the music was nearly nightly and it soothed the soul.Next the Ocean is across the street, you are so close yet you are not trampled by the tourists all running toward the beach. You can walk at your leisure to the beach. There are Hotels with drinks and Appetizers otherwise known as Hawaiian Pupu's right there and right at the edge of Waikiki behind the police Station that looks like a tourist center there is a small window beach cafe with the most amazing lunch items and snacks. Right along the main strip there is a small ice cream shop with the Famous Dole Pineapple Sorbet. The Waikiki Beach is second to none, beautiful and inviting, warm and wonderful.However that's not near all there is to do. We three times took our Rental Car and went around the coast roads taking pictures and absorbing all the beauty of each and every scenic outlook. I wouldn't miss one of them. Although classified as illegal my daughter did the Dead Mans Cat Walk hike with two warm local kids her age. This was well worth the effort the scenery is spectacular. We visited the ONLY Palace on US Soil, originally within the Hawaiian Monarchy, The Iolani Palace, as well as Queen Emmas Summer Palace. We located the Royal Burial Grounds and paid our respects to the former Kings, Queens, Princesses and Princes. Their History is not to be missed within a visit to Oahu. We of course went to Pearl Harbor, not once but twice because one day the boats weren't allowed to go to the Memorial. A trip to Hawaii isn't complete without paying your respects to the men that gave up their lives there so we may continue to visit this beautiful paradise. Moving toward the other shores on this beautiful Island we went to Kailua and Lanikai Beaches. These are more local beaches yet they are filled with beauty less tourists and they were simply amazing. We doing Teddy's Bigger Burgers in Kailua, and the Hawaiian hamburger, with fresh grilled pineapple this was delectable, with Sweet Potato fries and the Chocolate Peanut butter hand dipped Milk shake. After a long day of swimming it hit the spot. The next day we visited the Pali Look out, then the Valley of Temples, another must in my opinion. We were lucky to see the Waterfall in the distance across from the exit of the Pali Look out flowing quite magnificently even though it is far away and it was in the DRY season. The Valley of Temples was absolutely beautiful. There is a Buddhist Temple there along with Many other religious Shrines to many Faiths. This was a peaceful and amazing place to visit and I wouldn't have missed it for the world.The next day we set off on our adventure to explore the North Shore. We visited the Dole Plantation, then a quick first trip to the Historic town of Haliewa. Dole was wonderful yet busy. The pineapple fresh and the Sorbet were amazing. I've often told people until you have tasted Fresh pineapple in Hawaii you haven't tasted Pineapple really. Due to the fact that after being harvested if it is to leave the Islands it is injected with many preservatives, which dramatically change the taste of the Pineapple. After a wonderful visit to Dole and the gift shop where we bought lip balm in tropical flavors you can't find on the mainland we headed toward Haliewa. We quickly observed all the changes in the years we were absent, then made our way to the Coast Road. To visit Sharks Cove Tide Pools, and Turtle Bay. We stopped and took many pictures of Sharks Cove Tide Pools but this trip we didn't make it to swim in them because my back was still hurting. Next we went to Turtle Bay, to say I was blown away would be putting it mildly. We observed 20-30 Turtles coming in and out of the water eating the Algae on the Lava boulders in the water. You are so close to these Sea Turtles, but must remember never to touch them so that you never change their Natural Habitat. After all the Sea Turtle is the ONLY living Prehistoric thing we have left. In Hawaii they call the Sea Turtle the Honu. It's worth your time to look up the Honu and investigate the meaning behind it and how it applies to you. I guarantee you will be captivated with these beautiful creatures as I was... We spent a couple of hours just watching them and taking pictures we were so excited. Loving this so much we came back the next two full days after breakfast to swim with these beautiful Sea Turtles. At this point I must digress, for breakfast everyday we went to the most amazing, affordable restaurant for breakfast. Keoni's right on Kuhio Ave. The food was all fantastic but I fell in love with the Banana Pancakes with Coconut Syrup or the Macadamia Nut Pancakes with the coconut syrup. They also came Banana/Macadamia Nut that were great. On the third day to the North Shore my daughter did the most amazing adventure ever. she went on a free dive with Sharks with no cages. This was a private charter with no more than 6 people. They went to a secluded spot where the water was 650 feet deep, the boat Captain and Shark expert got in the water to make sure of the Sharks temperament .. And then for two full hours they free swam with Galapagos Sharks. They also saw 2 Baracuda that were very afraid of humans and swam away quickly. My daughter used her GoPro camera and filmed this adventure of swimming with the Sharks, a memory she will cherish for a lifetime. ( this was especially wonderful for her because she's starting College to be a Marine Biologist with Shark Studies as a Primary Interest for her.) again after a very long hot day we found. Teddy's Bigger Burgers and we're thrilled. The other day we found a host of Shrimp Trucks that make fresh Shrimp in many different ways and you sit at picnic benches enjoying the tropical environment while you eat outdoors. We enjoyed shopping at the stores especially the Red Dirt Shirt Store on the North Shore, as these shirts can't be found anywhere else in the world, they now have a whole new variety called Lava Rock Shirts that are amazing too. We found the Haiku Stairs, deemed the Stairway to Heaven another illegal hike but we decided to save this until our next visit. Everyday after our adventures we swam in the beautiful waters of Waikiki Beach and sometimes even our swimming pool at the beautiful Sheraton Princess Kauilani that has converted their pool to a salt water pool at some point. Amazing in and of itself. Reconnecting with Hawaii in this amazing 17 day trip and spending it at the Sheraton Princess Kauilani was incredible. I feel like I'm surely leaving things out here like the adventure we had in going to find the shop to purchase the Go Pro the several times I missed my exit and we laughed till we cried. Of course the day we spent at the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet where souvenir vendors are there to sell any thing and everything your looking for, there are over 400 of them. The night we drove to Ko Olina to have dinner but the restaurant was too busy so we took take out and sat at the Marriotts Ko Olina Beach Club Resort and ate a picnic on the beach watching the Sunset. The Afternoon Tradewinds Sail that leaves from the Sheraton Waikiki Beach, (coupon on Groupon), the sail was FANTASTIC!!!Like I said I know I'm forgetting things because our 17 days were packed and sitting here now, I've got tears in my eyes wishing I was back for another 2 weeks right now. For anyone looking to go to Hawaii it's NEVER out of your reach, it's never some where you can only dream about there are ALWAYS ways to make this happen. If you need tips contact me, this was my 8th trip and I plan on making #9 at Xmas. To get me for help thethirdeye08@gmailHawaii is amazing and somewhere everyone should aspire to expierence, the feeling you have after being there is incomparable. ",,59,5.0

Although the hotel is in need of an update and the decor is a little old and tired, it is clean, very comfortable and its proximity to local beaches, shopping and attractions is perfect, basically right in the middle of the Waikiki strip and just across the road from the famous Waikiki beach. The staff are absolutely wonderful, friendly, accommodating and will do all they can to help, even better to,see is they employ a good percentage of mature age people here and this is excellent in this day and age, it's always lovely to have a young staff but there is another whole world of older workers out there with far more experience and superior service skills so,the mix is good to see at this hotel.... The pool is small but well maintained with a great area to relax and the music every night is top notch..... The tours desk and concierge were informative and very helpful.... The only slight negative is the buffet breakfast which is below average in my opinion, the selection is poor, quality is not great and the variety (little as there is) never changes. I heard the egg bar was ok but alas for me I have an egg allergy so couldn't use it,my he only consistent thing about the breakfast was it was consistently bad, however the breakfast staff were wonderful, polite and very very friendly......","Cairns, Australia",40,4.0

It's right near the beach and very close to the shops everything was in a convenient walking distance. The pool was a decent size and very clean. The highlight that this hotel had to offer was the beach chairs that were available to use whilst going to the beach and every few hours staff would come to the beach to offer water and fruit. Overall this hotel was quite peaceful, beautiful and the staff were friendly.

I feel like most Waikiki hotels are dated and not nearly worth what you're paying, especially compared to other resort towns. I tend to avoid staying in Waikiki for exactly that reason, but here's what worked and didn't work for us at the PK:+ Cost. Just over $100 a night, we were 'upgraded' to a partial ocean-view that just happened to be adjacent to construction of the new International Marketplace. I honestly didn't mind the noise, it felt far off and I'm okay with the sounds of the city when staying in a city, but I'm sure that's a dealbreaker for many. + Location. Super central, we were able to walk anywhere around Waikiki without it feeling like much of an effort. + Resort fee. While resort fees are complete bull, this one at least got us both wi-fi AND parking, which in a $30-40/night parking city is not too bad. We had no problem getting in and out and about. + Common areas/staff. The lobby and pool area were very nice, and actually tricked us into thinking we were really getting a crazy good deal when we first arrived. I liked the open pool, bar, and ability to walk in and out of the property so easily, and the person who checked us in was very friendly and helpful. - Room. Dated as mentioned, just nothing special, not really a huge minus if you're not spending much time in your room but worth mentioning that the rooms feel less Sheraton than Holiday Inn. We went in not expecting any view at all, so we feel like we came out ahead in the end, and one nice thing about the 'city view' of International Marketplace is that it's very expansive, like you're not right up against another hotel. I would likely return for another value deal at a value resort like this one, and throw the extra dough into food/experiences.","Los Angeles, California",36,4.0

The zoo and Kapiolani park are about .5 mile away AC in the room seemed like it couldn't keep up during the days (mid July 2015) but it was rather humid during our stay. Also, I'm not sure if the sliding door to the balcony was supposed to be so hard to open. I suspect it wasn't as the lock to latch the door didn't work.

I wish I had checked Tripadvisor before I booked my stay here. It is very easy to understand that this hotel is number 60 out of 82 hotels in Honolulu.Even as a SPG Platinum I felt that I was staying in a dingy and tired roadside motel. You are forced to pay a resort fee at about 30 USD per night. What in the world makes this hotel a resort? There is no beach, and the pool is small and filled with kids, no place for relaxing. The pool area is very small considering the number of rooms.- nearly 1200 rooms. Check in was slow, once we got to our room we were shocked. How can this hotel bear the Sheraton name? It does not appear that this hotel has been renovated since the 70s - when they built the tower. The view was great! That's the only positive I can say about the room. Housekeeping was spotty as well - they did not restock the toiletries fully on any morning. There was always something missing - shampoo, soap, etc. The wifi signal in my room was very spotty. I read somewhere that the whole hotel was due for demolition, I can understand why.I could hear snoaring and the tv from the room next door, poor isolation. The furnishings were 1970s, and the bed was absolutely not even close to the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed. No sockets close to the bed - just like any other old hotel. Slow elevators that took forever. The breakfast was okey - but utterly disgusting. Pigeons were feasting from the buffet every time they got the chance. The staff members tried to keep the pigeons away, but as soon as they got busy with other things the pigeons were back. In my country this would be considered a health hazard.The dinner buffet were nice as well, even though the food were supposed to have a different theme each nice we found most of the food to be the same on the two nights we visited. We also found out that two breakfast coupons could be exchanged to one dinner buffet. The dinner buffet was almost 50 dollars, PLUS tip and drinks.However, on our first night we went downstairs at 9:30 PM to get some food. We were informed that the kitchen were closed, and there were absolutely no food to be had. The bar was open, but they weren't serving food. I find that very strange....1200 rooms and absolutely no food to be had after 9PM??? As we were very tired after travelling for 24 hours we just settled for a Subway right outside the hotel entrance.The platinum/gold desk were never staffed. Having 1200 rooms, and two persons working at the front desk meant that there were long ques. Once I had to wait 20 minutes to change my room key (that wasn't working). BTW - I could hear people complaining about the hotel several times when I passed the front desk.I will give one star for the nice room view, and one star for the nice restaurant/bell boy/beach service staff. The restaurant staff were really accomodating. So was the bell boy staff - they also kept parcels for me without any hassle. The hotel don't have any beach stand - but you can borrow chairs and towels by the pool and take to the beach. They will also give you a bottle of water and an apple - but only on certain times. Found these guys to be very accomodating. The other staff we encountered, at the front desk and housekeeping, were indifferent.For the rest of the hotel - zero stars. Location was good.Verditc: I wont stay here again in a million years! Take your money and go elsewhere :)","Oslo, Norway",203,2.0

We didnt mind the fee but please outline it when booking . Also our room while being very comfortable and clean was obviously one of their ""bottom of the range"" being that our view was a wall until you walked to the balcony then it overlooked the pool plus the air cond was very loud from the neighboring tower of the hotel when sitting on the balcony which we didnt do much because of this AND it never had any sun.

They just go about their job and you feel like they would be just as happy if you were not there. My room had a partial Ocean view and full view of the pool. It was a good view but if you don't go down by the pool and listen to the singers you'll still hear them really well. The wall paper in my room was peeling off. Towrds the end of my stay I noticed water dripping from the AC vent. I could hear the people in the room next to me like they were in my room. I knew when they opend and closed the closet. I could easily hear their conversations. When I took a shower I noticed the soap dish was not clean and the grout in the floor was dark grey in some places. I asked the maid to clean the rest room really well. She cleaned the tub better but not the floor. The next time I saw her I asked her if she could get the floor scrubbed. She explained that she might but it took a machine. They were able to get the machine up to clean the floor but if a gust wants the floor clean get it cleaned. The bar had good drinks and a good staff. The food was pretty good. The pool closed at 7pm which seemed since the sun was still up. There was a stand to get your towels from at the pool but they had two people there and required you to electronically check the towels (whiç˙ were nothing special) in and out with your room key. The pool staff was not perticularly frindly or welcoming. Guest are allowed to use the pool at sister properties if you want to walk over. I have stayed at worse hotels but I have also stayed at better. I am really suprised Sheraton doesn't either fix this property or at least rename it so it does not hurt their reputation.To end on a posative the bed was comfortable (but there was a dark stain oin the sheet that I noticed near me feet on the first morning.)

The gym has excellent Life fitness equipment and the pool area is pretty good........BUT....the biggest problem with this hotel is the noise between rooms. There doesn't appear to be any amount insulation between them and you can hear everything going on in the rooms around you. I don't mind a bit of noise until say 11pm or even midnight but as I write this review its 1am and i don't think i'll be getting too much sleep tonight. It took 2 visits from hotel security to quiet them down with the second visit being 2am.

We booked a king standard room with city view, but we were given a complimentary upgrade for a partial ocean view room with double beds. Our room was on the 16th floor, the hallway was a little dim and had a musty old smell. When we got to our room it was clean, but when we stepped out to the balcony our view was of construction that was going on, which the check in staff did not mention. The construction would start at 7:30 am and end at 5:30 pm it was very noisy, we were never able to have the glass door open to let breeze come in. The only partial ocean view we saw was when we stuck out our heads over the balcony to see the ocean, good thing we didnt have to pay for that partial ocean view because that would be a rip off. We tried changing our room, but they kept telling us that nothing was available. The lobby to the tower elevator would always smell like fried fish because the buffet was right next to it, which was not pleasant to smell as soon as I came down stairs, they need to put air fresheners around the lobby. Our lock to our baggage was also tampered with. We left in morning to North Shore and locked one of our bags and when we came back to the room it seemed like someone had tried to open the lock because the key hole was pushed in and jammed and we couldn't get the lock to open, so my husband called the front desk and security came to our room and told us that he didn't think anyone was trying to get into our bag as ""if someone was then they would have"" and just brushed it off as if nothing happened. He fiddled with the lock for a bit and opened it, luckily everything was in our bag, so be careful with your valuables. Other than this hotel we had a great time in Hawaii, would not recommend staying at this hotel it is outdated and needs a major renovation. The lobby is the nicest part of this hotel. Initially after reading all of the other reviews we wanted to cancel the reservation and book with another hotel, but they had a no cancellation policy and now I see why because then everyone would cancel their reservations.","Santa Clara, California",8,3.0

We had never stayed in Waikiki and always stay at the Turtle Bay when we come to Oahu. Let me say what makes this hotel worth it is it's location for the money. The rooms are sad and dated, the hotel itself has an old vibe and it's a ""I need to be renovated"" vibe not ""wow, this is old hawaii"" vibe. That being said we had the best view from our room, amazing. We looked out and saw the surf, diamond head and the ocean over the top of the Moana Surfrider. You get privilages at all the Sheratons in the waikiki beach area so really, this place is a deal, You aren't ever in your room anyway.

The only negative issue we had was with our bar tabs for the first couple of days, which until we were made aware of what was happening (courtesy of another establishment that notified us when presenting our check) we were double tipping the wait staff. When we did enquire why our bill for 2 people was incurring an automatic gratuity charge we were told that since we were sitting at a table with 6 or more other people, an 18% tip was already factored into our account. We wondered why our drinks seemed to be a little more expensive than we thought they would be. Would of been nice to know that up front however it did teach us to look over our checks a bit more carefully before leaving a tip!

Great beds. Next to international market (perk in the future) and central location to most of the beach area.Recommend fully and would definitely return.------I've stayed at many hotels and typically book my room solely off of star ratings. It seems like this rating system may be upside down as this hotel greatly outshone those with higher star rating.I grew up in Japan and Hawaii, but it had been years since I had been back to either. I immediately noticed at both that the people didn't seem as friendly as I remembered when I was growing up. I remembered people smiling a lot, having respect, taking care of elders, and just being ""good people.""I could still find a higher percentage of these people the further I got from Tokyo and Honolulu, but it was a genuine disappointment on the whole touring both.------The staff we encountered at Sheraton Princess had great customer service and didn't seem fake: they weren't only smiling for the tourists. I think when you can see them smiling and laughing when each other it's a great sign of where the true aloha spirit is coming from.I also stayed at the Marriott and Hilton; incredibly disappointed by a handful of staff members and the rooms themselves.As someone returning, the Princess was ""no ka oi"" for me","Thomasville, Georgia",24,5.0

We were a little concerned over some of the reviews as to the age of the place, that it was old and tired, etc., but to be across the street from the beach smack dab in the middle of Waikiki, we figured we'd give it a shot. We were only going to be there one night (off to the cruise ship the next day), so I splurged to give my husband an ocean view for our first night in Hawaii! And it was!!! We live in SE Florida and see beautiful oceans and reefs and sand and palm trees all the time, but we opened the door to the room and said OMG in unison!!! We were positively delighted!!! And we thank Justin, at the front desk, for his sensitivity to our wanting to make this a very special celebration! I can't say enough about Justin! He was everything you want someone on the front desk to be! Understanding, professional, diplomatic, caring, and really really nice, too!!! We were simply thrilled with our view!!! The lobby is gorgeous at this place, and the location is fabulous (for the price), it's exactly across the street from the big fancy hotel on the beach! And right in the middle of everything you could want!! Walk anywhere! We did a little walking, but ended up at the beach for sunset and a fancy drink. Our room was not the most updated we've ever been in, due to the age of the building, it's small compared to the new hotels. But the bed was terrific, and we're annoying oldsters who want comfy beds 'cause sleep can be elusive. I absolutely loved the bed! Average bathroom, good water pressure, clean, clean, clean. We were only staying one night, but they treated us like we were staying three weeks! We enjoyed a super breakfast the next morning (not included) but we thought it was a deal at $24.50.....bottomless buffet of good food, which we enjoyed on the patio. There's a problem with birds in these outdoor spots in Hawaii, and we got the biggest kick out of the employee whose job it is to shoo away the birds with a stick with flowing fabric on it. I'm not keen on sharing my space with birds, but we're eating outside and it's Hawaii. No biggie. We got ourselves into the vacation feel with a photo (we got a coupon from Justin) and we did the picture thing and we're glad we did because the photo on the ship was awful, and they only took one.....these guys - Gerard & Zachary at the Photo Booth, really seemed to care that we liked our pictures. He took us all around the property to various trees and backgrounds and we got ourselves our favorite picture from the trip. And he squeezed us in on his lunch break 'cause we didn't have an appointment. Across the board the folks at the Sheridan were so nice, the place is beautiful, the room although older (very 70's) was spotless and very comfortable and who cares, the view was awesome!!! The bedding was all new, plush white on white. The very best pillows anywhere!!! We were in the tower on a high floor in a corner room looking toward Diamond Head. Wow just doesn't cover it for our view!!! All these hotels have an added on fee for parking, etc., about $25, and we had to pay that, but even with that tacked on, it's still the best deal in town! It was a glorious start to our two weeks in Hawaii. You can stay on the beach for $450 a night, but this was in the $225 range, called a partial ocean view and I can't imagine anything nicer!!! I actually liked it better looking up the beach than to look directly at the beach! If you're super fussy for the to-die-for bedroom, this isn't for you, but if you want clean, good service, gorgeous view, comfortable bed, beautiful lobby, a restaurant, and a good price, we found a winner!","Fort Lauderdale, Florida",2,4.0

The location is great, right in the middle of Waikiki and across the street from the beach.The lobby is open and comfortable. On the first floor, there's a large area for computer access, a sitting area to read, the pool (no hot tub), a small stage for performances, and a bar/restaurant. I didn't eat at the restaurant, but the buffet breakfast smelled wonderful! There are 2 buildings and I'm sure some had a view of the ocean. Mine did not but that was okay since I wasn't in my room very much. The room included all the standard amenities including a small fridge and 2 free bottles of water. The beds were clean but the room itself and the carpet were a bit dated. The staff was friendly and knowledgable. You need to pay the irritating $25.00 resort fee per day. It includes free parking (I didn't have a car), internet (well, internet should be free), free buffet for kids with paying adult (I had not kids) and a free photo that they choose. So, you need to book your free photo shoot 24 hours in advance. The only time they had for me was at 2:30, which wasn't convenient. But the idea is that you walk around the property with a photographer taking multiple photos for 15-30 minutes. Then, they pick which photo they will give you for free and you can buy the others. The pool is open from 8am - 7pm. If you head to the beach, they hand out fruit and water to guests 3x a day by the statue near the beach, which is a nice added benefit. They also offered lei making and other activities around the hotel during the day. There was a work out room on the 2nd floor that had a good number of cardio and weight machines. The only thing is that I asked for a late checkout for 11:30 and they deactivated my key at 11am. I had to go down to the front desk and they happily reset my key card.

I even posted on my travel blog that there is no need to look further as I had found the world's worst Sheraton. I had long held that the Sheraton Pasadena was the worst of the worst but I was wrong. The hotel is in a horrible state of disrepair the bathroom floor tile is filthy, as is the gold flecked cultured marble bathroom countertop that is about 6-8"" Lower than a standard bathroom countertop. In the room and the bath the wallpaper is dated, patched, and peeling, the carpet has numerous snags and runs, and the trim of the bathroom door seems to be rotted away. Finally the room smells very moldy and there appears to be black powdery stains around the vent. In general, it seems quite dingy.

The location is excellent, about one block from Waikiki Beach, loads of restaurants and shopping. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our entire stay. The lobby, courtyard and pool are very nice and were not crowded. They offered free music and hula shows every night poolside, which our toddler absolutely loved. However, the rooms are very, very outdated and worn out. We booked an ocean-view room and upon entering were extremely disappointed. We did not expect what we'd find at a luxury hotel, but it was well below the standard we've grown accustomed to at a Sheraton, or even more budget hotels. Though the room was very clean, the first thing we noticed was the musty smell. The room had almost no amenities, the furnishings were very old, chipped and scratched and there was no décor to speak of, aside from one faded painting. The wallpaper was separating at the seams. The bathroom was minute and unwelcoming. It was also next to the noisy service elevator. The ocean view of Waikiki was excellent, but could only be seen by going out on the small balcony. We decided to visit the front desk and see if we could purchase an upgraded room. The gentleman at the desk was very kind and helpful. He offered us a deluxe ocean view room at no extra cost and we took him up on the offer. The room was slightly larger, no funny smell, and in somewhat better condition. It had a wonderful view of the ocean and the Moana Surfrider, as well as the courtyard where the hotel had free nightly entertainment. We stayed in the room through the rest of the week and experienced excellent service from the staff. The food at the restaurants wasn't great but was what we expected. Though we had a nice stay, unfortunately the rooms were of such low quality that we would not stay here again, nor recommend to a friend.",,4,3.0

This hotel has an incredible location. Right off the beach, and in the middle of everything. You can find tons of stores and restaurants nearby. There are also lots of beautiful walks to be had in many directions from the hotel. The hotel lobby, restaurant, and bar are all open air to the pool area and very upscale. One aspect that I loved was that parking was included in the $25 resort fee. Many other hotels in the area charge for both, $25/day resort fee AND $30/day parking. And I found the staff to be incredibly friendly and helpful.As has been said earlier, the rooms are a bit small, old and dated. There is nothing really wrong with them and I found mine to be very clean. It was fine for me, but it's not going to impress. However, the bed was incredibly comfortable, the flat screen TV had lots of channels, the included Wifi was fast and reliable, and the room had a minifridge. Try to get a high floor with an ocean view if possible, it is amazing. I was only on the 12th floor and my view was still pretty great.I was given a discounted breakfast buffet and while not huge or elaborate, it had a lot of great options. Since the restaurant is open to the pool area, it does make for a very nice Hawaiian breakfast experience. I wouldn't pay the full $25 for it, but if you can get it included in the room, it's really nice.Overall, even with the dated rooms, this is a very nice hotel with an incredible location and I would have no problem staying here again.",Seattle,64,4.0

This hotel was actually the cheapest hotel by far given we had a car and needed parking. I must say my rating is given considering the normal prices they charge, not really the last minute distressed inventory price we paid (which was exceptional for such a centrally located hotel, even if we didn't need to park). The first impression is - well, the hotel is VERY old, the mail chutes on each floor attests to its origins in the 1950s. Consequently the rooms are rather small by modern standards, even if they were updated some time in the previous decade or so - so is reasonably modern inside. It also seemed reasonably quiet, but then again maybe it's only because the hotel wasn't anywhere near full. My only complaint is that the air conditioning was either off or waaaaaaaaaaaaay too cold (the system is so old you can only control fan speed). Luckily the temperature was comfortable enough that we didn't need the air conditioning at all. Surprisingly the WiFi works wonderfully well, better than many much newer build hotels. We had a ""partial ocean view room"" so our balcony had the view over the pool, an outlook to the front of the magnificent Moana hotel and a bit of blue ocean beyond. Quite nice to just sit around and watch life pass by in the pool and the street below.It's a wonderfully located hotel, cross the road and you're on Waikiki Beach (which really is nothing special, especially given all the beautiful beaches we'd seen on Maui and Big Island in the week prior). Everything in Waikiki is within very short walking distance, which is just as well because the buffet looks very ordinary. I especially loved having Haagen Daas in the same complex, and Cheesecake Factory being a very short walk away ... The pool area is rather tranquil given the location, I enjoyed that it was a deep pool you could swim in, but never understood why it closes so early. It's the kind of pool you'd want to have a drink or two and a swim after dinner. There's apparently also a beach chair service on Waikiki but only during the middle of the day.Parking fee is included in the resort fee, which is great because other hotels can charge a lot more on top. The parking lot is a bit curious, only the top floor has elevator access, but it doesn't matter because the lot itself is so close and handy.I'll most definitely stay here again if the price is right, but certainly is not what you'd expect from a Sheraton (think Holiday Inn), especially not at its normal prices.","Sydney, Australia",56,3.0

Disappointing to read the negative reviews about the accommodation as I was considering staying there next visit mainly because of the location carpark and of course the Kaimona band which play there every Friday Saturday and Sunday nights.

Some things are fabulous, like the location, customer service, check-in, bell station, valet, breakfast areas and speedy elevators. It's these fabulous and wonderful features that tend to eclipse the most horrible feature: the rooms! This is why you'll see such a large range of ratings on here - If you don't care that the rooms are straight out of the 1950's, both in layout and furniture, there is so much else to love that you might be tempted to give this hotel 4 or 5 pts. However, the bedrooms and hallways were dirty, filthy, old and archaic. The bathrooms were old and dingy and tiny. They need more than a renovation they need to be remodeled. I called the front desk upon seeing my full ocean-front room, which I paid $40/night extra for - and just broke down and cried because it reminded me of an old, cheap hotel from the 1960's in Niagara Falls. Of course in the 1960's all the hotels were cheap-o. I mean old and dirty and ick! - right now, here at this Sheraton! Why they have not renovated the rooms is shocking. However, when I called the front desk they sent Elizabeth Rapp up to help me and she quickly whisked me to another floor and made sure everything was as neat and clean as it could be. Once I got used to the idea of having a less-than-nice room, even though the beds were fabulous and there was no noise, everything else panned out. So it's difficult to rate. Sheraton, how could you allow an amazingly-located hotel with your name on it to get run down like this? It's super nice that the open-air lobby and breakfast area has been renovated, now maybe the rooms? Their pool was a salt-water pool and not heated, but it was warm enough and the salt-water felt good. The buffet breakfast is served until 11:00 and has everything you could want. The elevators are super fast and there's a place to fill your water bottles with fresh water from the well off site. There's a place to get your pictures taken around the hotel and on the beach, as well as all open-air lobby which was just delightful. Every morning there were local artists selling their wares also in the lobby. The view from the room was stunning and the beds were as always, comfortable. There wasn't much noise and my room was very quiet. All staff in every department went always, always, always above and beyond to keep the hotel looking as best as it could and always offering to get you anything you'll want. My room was #1750 and I highly recommend it as being one of the nicer, cleaner rooms. If you want to cry when you get in there because it's old, old, old...just remember that 1750 is one of the nicer rooms and floors and even it looks old. But the chairs were comfortable and useable and I was grateful for that. My first room, 2350 ?? even the hallway was dark and dirty. The 17th floor is much better than the higher floors which need new carpet, new wallpaper - steaming the old off as it's already got about 8 layers on it. If your windows/doors shake with the wind, do not accept this because they have someone who can come up and fix it right away. If they would wipe down the safes that might help. There is just dirt and gritty, shabby old lampshades and not even a footstool or chaise lounge. There is so much great about this hotel if they'd just redo the rooms it'd be an easy 5. Unfortunately that isn't scheduled until 2017!! I guess that is the critical mass point at which the ugliness of the rooms supercedes the beauty of the rest of it. I would stay here again and ask for room 1750. That's the only way. The staff was stellar. They can only do so much with what they've got to work with and if you can close your eyes to the room, the bed is comfortable and the view of the ocean outstanding. The air conditioner works quite well, you get fresh water daily, the internet worked well. Lots to love. :-) Just don't go here to get pampered. This is not a spa hotel. At all. It was a nice memory but the rooms, they're bad. It was only the customer service team that helped me move all my things to another room and floor that saved the day. If you don't care about your room so much this hotel will be fine, however, if you need a nice room consider another hotel. The rooms are just not there.

On arrival our room was not ready so we were asked to have a welcome drink in the splash bar by the pool until the check in time of 3.00pm but it was still not ready when we went back so we were upgraded into a better kingsize bedded room and from then on everything was rosey! We had a couple of minor issues when the toilet blocked and when we ran out of shower gel but within 5 minutes of reporting the problems a member of staff was there to sort it out (all the staff here were lovely). The location of the hotel is right in the centre of Waikiki handy for all the designer shops and restaurants and only meters from the golden sands of Waikiki beach. We didn't use the pool much during our week because of the heat as it was far cooler on the beach so we would collect our towel and beach chair from the pool assistants every morning and go down to the beach. So as I have already said the staff in the hotel made our stay what it was we did our own thing and really enjoyed ourselves. The room was a decent size with a coffee making machine and cups that were replenished everyday beds made and towel changes etc etc and the bed was really comfortable, so all in all if I got the chance I would definetely stay here again!","Gateshead, United Kingdom",54,5.0

I booked online for 4 nights and I did not have an option to select two beds. When we check in, I asked for two bed room. They accommodated and gave me a free upgrade to the partial ocean view room at 26 floor. From the room, I could see the Waikiki beach. Like others, we paid the resort fee which covered the parking. When I asked them type of activities that we may be able to do on the island. No one seems like could provide good suggestion. But they answer some of my specific questions. We did not use the hotel restaurant since they are pricy. The hotel is just few minutes away from the Waikiki Beach. It is very very close. There is ABC Store by the hotel and we we went to buy many supplies. However, last day, we learned there was a Safeway grocery store about 5 minutes drive (it may be much cheaper). The bed is comfortable. We spent as much time as we could outside. So by the time we got back to the room, we were very tired. We just slept. The only complaint I have is the construction next to the hotel. If you close the door, it was quiet. However, in the morning 5AM, construction started, you can hear truck beeping sound all the time which is very annoy. We did use the pool once which has very nice setting.

I was approached by a security and was told that the area is private property and I must leave the premise. I complied and left. The whole time I walked away I got looked at as if I'm going to wait in the area like a criminal. Family ended up looking for me and was told that I was kicked out for using my computer. Upon calling and speaking with the Guest Service Manager I explained my story. Was told a store had complained about me waiting there. The manager ask why didn't I tell the security I am waiting for family. My question is why didn't they ask instead of kicking me out. It's not my job to ask questions. If a hostile security kicks you out you do it before a cop comes and get charged with criminal trespass.My family did go to the near by business and apologize for me sitting outside and no one said they called. They informed unless we are sleeping, doing drugs, or becoming a neucence then it should not be an issue with any of the business.

We just returned from our stay there from 2/26-3/6. The courtyard near the pool was lovely! Very nicely decorated and the nightly entertainment always gave us something to look forward to. We never did eat the buffet or swim in the pool. The buffet was greatly overpriced but smelled fantastic! The pool we never really have done in Hawaii anyhow. We stayed on the sixth floor overlooking the pool and were lucky enough to have a partial ocean view and could see the entertainment on the stage from our lanai, another bonus. We were very please with our comfortable king sized bed. Very comfortable!! Housekeeping did a wonderful job cleaning, supplying new towels and making our bed each day. We had one panic moment where we realized I took my ring off and left on the bathroom counter to apply some lotion. We were already a few miles away so we called the hotel and security quickly secured our room and let us back in when we returned. That was a comfort! Our safe also malfunctioned on our last morning there and maintenance came quickly to fix it. Parking is a major bonus and worth the resort fee, as we had a rental car. This is the best location right across from Waikiki and best place we have stayed in since being in Hawaii. We will recommend to others and will return. As a side note, my grandparents came to Hawaii 19 times and stayed at this hotel each time so I am pleased to carry on the tradition!!

This rate was apparently only for employees but the details of the rate were not disclosed at the time of the booking (and i have read all the info!).

After waiting a very long time to get served at reception we were finally given our rooms. The lobby, while decent looking, was packed with people. The elevator took forever and we had to wait 10 ninutes to go up to our room. This is where things took a turn for the worse. Despite us requesting multiple times and being assured (at the front desk just minutes before) our rooms were not interconnecting. This is a problem because we have 2 rooms and having them separate is a huge hassle. When we rang reception they were extremely unhelpful and suggested instead we get given free shampoo as a compensation. I thought this was a very rude comment because we had mentioned one of the problems with not having interconnecting rooms is sharing toileteries like shampoo. They made no effort to help us or arrange a room swap. Another room in our party is also on a completely separate floor, to which the responded ""but they are still in the same building"". I find this to be extremely rude, we book as a party and we are not even on the same floor? What a joke. The rooms are old, dirty, the balcony doors dont lock, we cannot access our wardrobe due to a desk, the safes look decades old and the rooms are TINY. We can barely open our suitcases anywhere. The balcony railings look ready to rust and break off if you touch them. Our ""ocean view"" consists of you leaning our the railing and looking far out to the right. The pool is tiny and has barely enough chairs for everyone and it closes at 6pm for some unknown reason. We waited for ages at the bar and were ignored and then had to wait at our table for ages for the waitress. Overall it is a huge disappointment.

Hotel fee also included a free 4x6 pic, drink voucher, Wi- FI, and a few other things. Rooms: I have read so many reviews before coming here that I just could not believe some people on here.

Get there earlier and grab your tickets before the allotted tickets for the assigned time slot run out. - Hike Diamond Head! Another must. 0.8 hike. It was not that hard- anyone can do it. Wear sneakers!- bc I see so many people wear sandals. Ugh. :). $1/person fee. Or $5/car. And at the bottom get the shaved ice for $3.25. -Go to the North Shore. Along the different beaches We explored Waimea Bay (beach there). We also went over to the Waimea Park and went to the waterfall for a $16 fee. Bring a waterproof disposable camera for the waterfall. - along the drive was THE Dole main station. We stopped for a few minutes. (Overpriced pineapple IMO). - we ate at Jameson's (before Waimea). That's all...I really hope that helps! ",,56,5.0

Location wise it was fantastic - literally right in the heart of waikiki, a 2 min walk to the beautiful beaches, shopping galore and food courts a 5 min walk away.Also it is worth noting that for the $26 a day resort fee (quite low by my findings) you get : Free WIFI - cost me $10 a day at the Hilton AND free parking - again $25 a day at the Hilton.Would I stay here again - absolutely!!

We went for a business trip/vacation during the Christmas holidays This is an older property but, location to all the activities of Waikiki are right around the corner. You go to utilize all the activities of your vacation and should only need to sleep and shower at the hotel. The beach is right across the street thru the Moana Surfrider lobby. You can get beach chairs, towels and water in your room with your resort fee and enjoy the beach of Waikiki. Restaurants are all around the area... use the Menus magazine found at the Concierge desk to find reviews. Cheaper breakfast can be found in the area if you don't wish to pay $25 for a buffet. We walked a few blocks and found eggs, bacon and pancakes for $4.95 ea. You can catch the Pink line trolley for $2 ea. and ride all around Waikiki and back for a very cheap sightseeing tour (takes about an hour). As mentioned in other reviews the property is older but, very accommodating. A microwave and small refrigerator in every room and an ABC store on every corner to stock it with soft drinks and beer. If you check out, you can leave your bags with the Bell Stand and have another full day in Hawaii before you catch a late flight home. The hotel even has a hospitality room for use for 1 hour...that is first come first serve to let you freshen up (shower) before you catch your shuttle or taxi back to the airport for the long flights back to the Mainland. Never ate in the hotel but, there were always people in the restaurant at all times of the day and especially at night. Every night there was a show of some sort with music and dancing (if your room overlooks the pool you can here it all from the balcony) and later another show in the bar area. Great local talent! Overall this is not a 5 Star hotel but like I said if you just want a place in the middle of everything and just use it to sleep and shower then the SPK is the place to do this at.

This made the floor very slippery to walk on. Also, I clean vacation rentals for a living. I try not to be picky when I go on vacation to a hotel. However, there was some very obvious problems with the cleanliness of my room. Upon checking in my room there were about 10 pieces of very long hair throughout the bathroom (in the shower, on the sink, around the toilet, etc). I was grossed out to see this. I went down to the lobby and made a complaint about it. They told me that when the maid came to clean my room the next day, that they would make note of the issue and have her take care of it. That is not really an acceptable response because as a cleaner, if I had made that error - my company would call me back immediately to come clean up the hair. I waited til the next day and sure enough after my room had supposedly been cleaned - the same hairs were all in the same locations! I told them again at checkout and all they did was apologize.

My wife and I stayed here previously and this was our second time staying here (20 nights in total). The decor is still extremely old (we were told it had been renovated however this only applied to reception apparently). We paid for a high ocean veiw room, but we were put in a low floor and wasnt till I complained that we moved to a higher level. Unfortunately the sound of rusty balconys being scraped and painted first thing in the morning was something to get used to (the rust is so bad they must be doing this continually, in desperate need of replacing).However the biggest problem was the level of service in the pool and bar area. As I tried to purchased two drinks at the pool area bar for myself and my wife, he said he wouldnt sell them to me unless he can identify who my wife is (who was by the pool putting suncreen on my 2 kids aged 5 and 8). Ive never had this accusation (of buying drinks for minors) thrown at me before and i felt extremely embarrassed in front of other guests.Getting any table service in the pool/bar area is almost impossible. You only have to walk over the road to the Moana Surfrider bar to find out what service is meant to be like. Its not costly to attend tables and take food orders (you might even make a profit doing so) . Everyday the staff stood planted at the bar walking around only every 30 minutes or so.I wont even start on the rude moustached pool towel bloke, ill be here forever.

Small bathroom and comfortable beds were pretty much all that was in the room. Everything was clean & well maintained, but felt dated. Quick shortcut past the pool through the sister hotel across the road onto Waikiki. There is a major construction site next door as the International Market Place is demolished...I think they will coincide a renovation to occur during the period. I imagine you could get a better deal to include the breakfast, but overall the staff were lovely and that is what you want when you stay anywhere.

You couldn't ask for a better location in Waikiki for the $ value and we had an ocean view room looking over the pool which was perfect. The service was great and we used the wii fii that came with the resort fee so can't comment on the timed computers in the lobby. Nor did we rent a car so can't comment on valet or car park. The pool is lovely and doesn't feel overcrowded at all (like it does at the Outrigger). We were out all day either in the pool, wandering the restaurants or at the beach so the construction noise next door wasn't a problem for us but if you are someone who likes to stay in your room then yes the noise of construction would get irritating but this is my only negative comment!

We got two per day, rooms always cleaned daily and 2 bottles of water and coffee/tea replaced every day.Second, staff was friendly and helpful, even found my wife's expensive sunglasses and had them waiting on us when we returned from an outing. Third, yes it is dated a bit, but clean, great location, we were on the beach in 5 minutes, only 100 yards from the property. I didn't have that much trouble with noise, it is a big city, expect some.Fourth, the rooms were laid out and signs posted where your room is when you exit the elevator. just take 30 seconds to read them.Fifth, never have had to have a certain paper, i.e. Wall Street Journal or other delivered to me every day. I am on vacation. if you want one, there is an ABC store 50 feet in either direction.Sixth, you want a robe, take one with you...lol Really? $225 a night in that location? We did get a free drink at the bar, guess I should complain because it wasn't of my choosing, but hey, I'm easy to please. This is Hawaii, everything costs more. Our friends paid $280 a night, plus $36 resort fee, no free breakfast. (valued at $24 by them, but even at $13 each was worth the room fee). if you get a chance, want a nice hotel, stay there.

The tissue paper box was empty and never replaced, no bottles of water as part of the resort fee (two bottles per day). Called about it, waited an hour and still no tissue box or bottles of water. Had to call again before someone would come up and deliver it. The hotel rooms are dated and the toilet seat won't stay up.

After one night there we went to the front desk to request a better room as that room seemed more Motel 6 quality than Sheraton quality. To their credit, after a discussion where I emphasised the room was not of the standard we expected, they did move us to a room in the newer higher tower. We were on the 27th floor facing north east.The room was definitely nicer and the patio was larger and the view was very nice. Even though the second room was better than the first, we still don't feel it was up to Sheraton standards.The housekeeping and maintenance staff were very pleasant and helpful. We did have an issue with the lock on the new room. Security came quickly to confirm that we were the right people trying to get into the room and to determine the problem.

I tried to book a better room but it wasn't available. However from the reviews, I'm probably better off not paying the extra money anyway. Upon check in the young man at the desk wasn't very helpful, even when I told him it's my birthday and I'm here alone because I have to attend some business meetings. I requested a room on a higher floor away from the elevator so I could rest when I got done with my day-long meetings. He could care less. My room wasn't ready at 2pm, all he kept repeating is ""check in is at 3pm""! This is the first time I've ever come to Waikiki one hour before check in time and I was told the room wasn't ready(and I've been here 3 times in the last 6 weeks, but at a different hotel), but maybe they are that busy! I have to say that the young lady who gave me the keys at 2:50 (I decided to ask if the room was ready a little earlier once I saw another desk agent was available) was extremely nice and tried to upgrade me but said the rooms were all booked. She also offered to send a complimentary bottle of wine to my room for my birthday! Now that's Aloha service! Someone train the other kid quick or let him go. Anyway, I digress! Today is my first day here and I avoided coming back to the room for as long as possible so I don't have to sit in this dreary room for too long! Lesson learned- next time I'm going back to my usual hotel! I thought I'd give is a try because someone in my company had said they stayed here before! Maybe they got a better room? Either way, I don't recommend this to anyone unless you really have no place to stay. Really disappointing experience from a Sheraton and a Starwood resort!Oh yeah, the two stars are for the location! ","Westlake Village, California",5,2.0

However, speaking strictly regarding the two rooms we stayed in at the old section (not the tower rooms) I was surpized at the level the room was kept. The walls were bare except for a picture on one and a bath robe hook (?) in the middle of another one. The furniture had to be from the late 1970/s and was beat enough to show every year of use. The bed was comfortable and standard for Sheratons, but even the bathroom was of a caliber more associated with a Super 8 than a Sheraton. Again, the tower may have been renovated, but the main hotel rooms were obviously never touched. Keep this in mind if you stay here. Many people say when they visit Hawaii, its not about the rooms but the closeness to the beach. If thats the case, then this might fit your needs. However, usually one stays at a Starwood for the room as well as the location. Not strictly the location. On that note, it is across the street from the Moana Surfrider and in a good location for a quick walk to both the beach and for shopping. Its just that when I stay at a Sheraton, I expect more than what these rooms had to offer....wow...","Clovis, California",29,3.0

There is also an emergency medical center inside the hotel. It is surrounded by plenty of excellent restaurants. I wouldn't suggest using the hotel buffet as it is very expensive however the items on the regular menu are priced reasonably and are very good. The Honolulu Coffee that is located right outside the pool area is decent but very expensive (Starbucks is cheaper). There are three towers, each with distinctively different rooms. The biggest tower at 29 floors have excellent rooms while one of the other towers have significantly smaller rooms. Rooms are clean, come with lots of towels, hair dryer and lots of pillows. Staff are very friendly and helpful. If I needed anything, it was promptly attended to.There was live entertainment every night. It was usually a band in the evening and a one man show with a guitar at the hotel bar towards the later hours of the evening. You could not hear this from most rooms and did not disturb in any way. I would say this entertainment is geared towards the older crowd and as such would not consider this a party hotel but better for business travelers, families and couples. There was some construction by the hotel which disturbed some during the day however it didn`t bother me.

This hotel is more reasonable than others in the Oahu Starwood family and affords a choice of various views from individual lanais. Although we love the ocean view, the pool view offers a view of nightly entertainment from the comfort of your own room (request poolview with view of the stage minus palmtrees). The hotel offers a Starwood dine-around option and parking is included in the mandatory resort fee. Rooms are comfy with a frig. Housekeeping is very friendly and helpful. The pool is a good size and the pool guy is great! (The only criticism really was that management should tell the young male lobby personnel to be alot more attentive to the needs of ALL quests...it seemed they could not be bothered to give us directions, say, to a local street two blocks away or address our other questions.) The hotel is nicely located to public transportation (we use bus passes all the time and rent a car occasionally to travel to the North Shore) and is across the street from the beach. It is near the pick up for the free HIlo Hattie shuttle and many fine restaurants and entertainment as well as shopping. The Princess is adjacent to the New International Marketplace, scheduled to open 2015. (We love Saks, but we mourn for the return of the old marketplace vendors and eateries under the old Banyan Tree that were truly a tourist delight....I quess Trump and the Outrigger have started the trend to upscale Waikiki and thus it continues; but we feel it is at the cost of Aloha!) The Princess is a place of abundant history, so ask if they still have tours of the hotel and its sister property across the street, the Moana. This hotel offers a good taste of Hawaii at a resonable price.

Although on 2 days only some of the towels were actually changed. We had the complimentary water & coffees re-stocked most days. Twice the cleaners attempted to enter the room prior to knocking, and both times were prior to 8:30am (not unreasonable to still be in bed at that time).As a positive, the front-of-house staff were very friendly & the pool/bar area was good to relax in when I had the chance.

While the map did not lie - the location is great, the story told by the pictures was a lot less veracious. The hotel is not horrible, but my low rating reflects as much a disappointment of my expectation as the issues with the hotel.Upon check-in we were told that our ocean-view reservation was upgraded to a handicap accessible room, which would provide a better view. The room was on the 12th floor of the western tower, facing east, with the views of the ocean, east Waikiki, Diamond Head, and the hotel courtyard, and these views were indeed spectacular. It was quite noisy - despite the 12th floor, the noise from the street traffic, the evening shows on stage in the courtyard, and the nightly performances of the street dance crew right outside the hotel measured at 77 dB on the balcony. The sliding door in the room did not do much to block the noise. This door did not do much to block the heat either - coupled with the aging, poorly designed AC system, the room was always hot and very humid, even after running a whole night. The only modern part of the electrical system was the thermostat, which was smart enough to shut the system off while we were out of the room, so we could not leave it running to keep the room cool for when we come back, which made for a very miserable experience.The room was quite small, and the two double beds did not leave much room for the chair and the vicker armchair, making it feel cramped. The bedding was clean and the comforters fluffy, but the pillows were not supportive at all. Both beds were slanted to one side, and the mattresses would easily slide to the side off the boxspring, making the person sleeping on the hanging-off side feel like he was about to fall off. Flat sheets, which were not long enough to wrap around the foot of the mattress, would untuck the moment we pulled out the bed covers to get into bed.The carpets were old and grungy, and other than the view through the sliding door, which was great, the room decor would be best described as 1960s low-end - it did not look redecorated since being built. The room had a flat-screen TV, a mini-fridge, and a safe which did not work. The closet had sliding doors with paint which was beginning to peel off, and the entry door also looked a bit warped and peeling. The real disappointment was the bathroom, which was described to us as handicap accessible. It had a warped barn-style door, with the sliding track on the outside. Because it was not straight, and had layers of peeling paint, it would not seal off the odors or the humidity of the bathroom, which incidentally has no exhaust vent. In service of accessibility, the bathtub was replaced with a plastic enclosure with a straight curtain rod running straight above the edge. With the grab bars protruding from the wall side, there was not enough shoulder room to shower without rubbing against the curtain. The bottom lip did not contain the water inside the shower enclosure, so it was running on the floor, until we thought of barricading it with the towels. The towels were thin and small, so we ended up using pool towels for showering also. The counter was old and worn out. The faucet used to be painted white, but the paint had peeled off from about half of the metal, furthering the dumpy feel of the room. The door couldn't lock, or even slide fully closed.The building has ~30 floors (there are two other buildings which make up the hotel). It had 4 small elevators, one of which was broken for half of our stay. It was hardly surprising, as the elevators seemed in poor condition from the start, with the indicator lights burned out and not replaced (this is a former elevator engineer talking). Still, to get up we had to wait 15+ minutes to fit into the elevators, and to go down during the evening rush hour took even longer. After waiting for 20 minutes, we decided to take the stairs, only to discover that they were disgustingly dirty. We mentioned the broken elevator to the clerk at the front desk, whose reply was ""Oh, really? I will see what we can do"" - nothing was done during the rest of our stay.Our hotel stay turned out to be an interesting multi-cultural experience - other than ourselves and a small contingent of Canadian soldiers on the islands for a military exercise, every other guest at the hotel seemed to be Chinese. They have a higher tolerance for being packed sausage-tight into the elevators, which you pretty much have to do even with all the elevators in service. Not being used to the high-rise living, I found the experience to be annoying, and the excruciatingly long waits to get into the elevator only raised my anxiety levels.The lobby is clean and spacious, but open to the outside, so you feel all the humidity and heat with none of the cooling breezes of being out on the street. The staff were friendly, even if not always helpful. There was a buffet breakfast ($25) and dinner ($40-42) served in the lobby restaurant - I think normally this restaurant is operating in another part of the main floor, which was being refurbished.The main floor opens up on the courtyard, which has a fairly large pool with lounges, a poolside bar with tables, and a stage, where most nights there were live performances. The hotel bills itself as a resort, and charges a little over $26 per day of a resort fee (including tax). This is a good value, as it covers the parking, internet, pool towels, and usage of the pool and other fitness facilities. You can also borrow a beach chair to go to the beach, which is not quite across the street, but is really close. Apparently, they also have a beachside fruit service for the hotel guests twice during the day, though we haven't experienced it. One issue is that some of these resort facilities, usage of the pool, towel exchange, beach chair rental, close very early in the evening - most nights at 7 PM, and some nights as early as 5. This means that you need to tailor your schedule to that of the hotel, rather than it being the other way around, as I feel it should be at a resort. Despite all these gripes, the hotel is in a central location, with the street below full of high-end stores, much like Rodeo Drive. The evenings are full of energy, and the sidewalks are full of pedestrians (mostly Asians), street performers, and homeless people. There is a small stage by the beach, where there are Hawaiian-themed performances. The beaches are packed with people, and the wave-breakers make for a very calm water to wade in, save for all the people splashing. There is an ever-present swarm of surfers a few hundred yards out in the ocean, beyond the breakers.Being in the thick of things is both a blessing and a curse - all the food establishments there, including low-priced chains like Subway, KFC, Burger King, McDonalds, carry a hefty tourist premium. Originally I thought that this was the case everywhere on the islands, but the last day we ventured to the south-east end of the island, away from the touristy areas, and discovered that the same chains were only slightly more expensive than the mainland, and significantly cheaper than Waikiki. Another issue is traffic congestion - there is a lot of it everywhere in Honolulu, and even more so in Waikiki. There is a lot of one-way streets, and the main drag has an interesting arrangement of lights, which favors pedestrians over vehicles. This makes even a seemingly short trip take a long time. While the distances are generally short, going anywhere requires you to make an arduous trek to the freeway (which has a speed limit of 35-45 mph most of the way through the city). This hotel is good if you are after the experience of the tourist vibe, proximity to the beach, and the nighttime entertainment. On the other hand, if you are looking for rest and relaxation at a beachside resort, I would recommend you look elsewhere.","Scottsdale, AZ",89,2.0

Great location, excellent staff, lovely rooms (if not a little dated), genuine all round great stay. There is some modernisation being undertaken right now, which, when completed, can only enhance your stay. We had no problems at all staying here. We had a room on the 5th floor of the main block (not tower) overlooking the pool area. We had a great balcony, if not a little small, with a partial view of the ocean. Yes the pool is a little crowded, and perhaps too small for a hotel of this size, but who needs a pool when you have the entire Pacific Ocean a couple of hundred metres away? The only downside I have is the resort fee. Definitely not worth the money unfortunately, you'd have to go some to get the value out of it. A few bottles of water and free internet access does not warrant $25 per day I'm sorry to say. At least consider a pay as you go resort fee that way people are only paying for what they actually use.

This was, I recall about $12 - $13 per day in 2011, now its $25, a 100% increase, for what they describe as 'valuable extra services'.In reality, these are nothing of the kind....internet access, which is generally free in hotels around the world, parking (great if you actually have a car to park), a couple of bottles of water in your room every day, AND, if you are on the beach at the right time (times vary) an extra bottle of water and an apple or orange (your choice). Woopy Doo! And that's the extent of these 'valuable extra services'.My personal opinion is that that the resort fee is way too much and is simply a grab for extra dollars.

We booked through a travel agent for 5 nights and the location of the hotel was excellent. Our main complaints are that the rooms are dated, the front desk was not accommodating and there was massive construction next door. To start with the rooms, it was clear that nothing had been updated since the 80's and it was pretty small. The view from our side of the hotel was a giant construction project right underneath us. When I asked to change rooms to avoid the eyesore, the hotel wanted to charge us an upgrade fee because there was nothing of equal value available on the other side of the hotel. In terms of the help, one front desk employee; Jahan was actually terrible. He was difficult to work with when we ordered food to the hotel, refused to heat it up for us and then canceled our taxi to the airport without letting us know. He did all of this even though on arrival we gave the front desk our cell phone number and let them know all of this would be happening. There are much better choices close by that are worth checking out...don't need to stay here.","Forest Hills, New York",16,2.0

Mainly because of the location, pretty much across the street from waikiki beach, and they had a back enterance to the international market, which is sadly not there anymore. I love the koi pond, feels like old hawaii, hopefully they will keep when they eventually remodel the hotel itself. Second to the last time we stayed, we had to change the hotel rooms three times, the first one the A/C was leaking, the second time, something else was wrong. The front desk staff are friendly and helpfull, and they will move your luggage for you to your new room, if unfortunately you do have to switch.

The location is great - right in the centre of Waikiki, but the hotel is really not that great, being rather old and tired. We were put on the 18th floor of the main block, directly facing the huge hole in the ground that is the massive building site next door. The noise from there was absolutely intolerable (crashing, banging, beeping) making it impossible to rest or sleep, even with the windows closed. We asked to move rooms immediately and had the most enormous run-around from the front-desk staff, who came up with various (and ever-changing) excuses as to why this was not possible. We involved the rep from our holiday company, who got on to the hotel's senior management. Eventually, after 24 hours and one dreadful night, we were moved to a much better-located room. This was in the small block facing the pool, and with an ocean view over the top of the hotel across the road. Our room was comfortable and well-appointed, if a little in need of a refurb. The bathroom was small, but OK, with bath & shower, but a sliding door. The pool is large and deep, and there are plenty of sun-loungers and fresh towels (you get cards for your towels).

When we were planing this trip we wanted to stick to a budget with accommodation and the sheraton princess seemed liked the perfect option. How could we go wrong with such a major international hotel group. To our major surprise, we were very very wrong. I remember getting out of the cab and walking Into the reception area and just wanting to cry. It took 35 mins before we were served and another 25 min to check us in. Taking deep breathes I was telling myself it will get better. Again I was so very wrong. The actual hotel is very old and outdated. There is a smell that lingers around the hotel and its not very pleasant. The pictures I saw of the sheraton princess when researching hotels in Waikiki were quiet nice and the hotel did look old but not outdated. When we walked into our room it took me a while to take everything in. The bed was messed up as if some one had been sitting on it, there were stains on the wall and in the corners on the floor there were dust balls with hair,the smell was horrendous, which was coming from sewage from the bathroom, the furniture was so old and worn out it was unbelievable!!I cried and cried. My husband who is a typical male and nothing bothers him was in shock as well. I went straight to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. He was polite but seemed unfazed at the fact that I was so upset and that made me angry. He said the best he could do was give us vouchers for dinner that night and that I should understand that I have not booked a new and modern hotel. That made me more angry and I demanded that I speak to someone who can do something. I then was speaking to another manager explaining everything all over again and said if she could not help me that I would like a full refund and would go somewhere else. She then popped up her shoulders and asked me to wait a minute she then came back and told me she had found us another room that would be a lot more pleasant for our stay. We were moved to another room on a higher level. It was nice, still outdated and old but a lot more cleaner than the other room. The Resturant there is horrible, we used our dinner voucher there and all I could eat was bread rolls the food is just terrible and cold. My husband, who again is the most laid back person could not manage to put anything in his mouth. The pool is nothing like the photos I saw on their website. It looks as if some disease is brewing in their, the colour of the water is quiet scary, needless to say we never used the pool. I would defiantly go back to Hawaii but never go back to the sheraton princess, it really ruined my holiday, it was so upsetting to me that we paid so much for the accommodation and it was really a 2 star hotel.

I was told by some people at the hotel that the hotel will be remodeled sometime in August. Hopefully, this is going to happen as the status it was in when I stayed there didn't, in my opinion, live up to the Sheraton name.Staff: Extreme inconsistency when it came to the quality of staff service.Let's talk about the good service:My housekeeper Belinda was very thorough in her service. She was also very friendly and helpful. There was a lady at the front desk and I think her name is Erin. She was also very helpful and friendly.The Bad: I was in line at the front desk behind two Japanese ladies waiting to be served. There were two clerks there at the time and one was assisting some other customers. The only lady who was available did not acknowledge our existence in any way. First, she was busy talking with another staff. Then she disappeared into a room, completely ignoring our presence. We were all shocked as to how she treated people. There was also another male clerk (at another time) who was very rude. Again, I couldn't believe I was staying at a Sheraton!There was a Burger King right across the street from the hotel. But the food was very expensive. I recall a combo meal cost me about US$10. There were some other restaurants in the same shopping complex. And, of course, they cost more than Burger King.Fortunately, there was a food court (about a 15 - 20 minute walk) from the hotel. The food was not really cheap either. If you're in a budget and want to try something local and reasonable, I would suggest going to a ABC store (there were several near the hotel) and purchased a Musubi. Some musubi comes with spam; while there are those that come with chicken etc. (Different ABC stores carry different kinds of musubi. Depending on how big your appetite is, one musubi can be a meal. You can ask the clerk at ABC to heat up the musubi for you. Also, go early as choices can be limited if you're late.All in all, if it's not for the few ""nice"" employees at Sheraton, I would have given this hotel a ""poor"" overall rating.

Similar to the swap meet or flea market. Now for the rooms, they were a little dated. After all it IS one of the older hotels in waikiki. We had a partial ocean view facing Diamond Head and it was plenty a view from the private balcony. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and also the Royal Hawaiian shopping area almost right across the street. Overall this hotel is decent because of its location but the rooms do need some upgrading. ",San diego,2,4.0

We both have very mixed feelings about all of it, however its best to list out the good and the unfortunate items:Positives:- Location – it really is a 5 minute walk to the beach. I wouldn't even say 10 minutes…perhaps if you are really slow. The convenience and reduction of cost in not being right on the beach is well worth it, as you can even walk through the hotel across the way to get to beach if you want to.- We had a “high tower ocean view” – floor 15. It was a nice view, unfortunately somewhat blocked by neighboring properties, but there’s not much you can do about that no matter how high you go. Balcony is large and it was relaxing to sit and see the ocean, or at night…the city lights up the hills on the other side. The “high tower ocean view” rooms fortunately do not face the neighboring properties under construction, so we lucked out.- Room was clean and housekeeping staff did a GREAT job making up the room each day and replenishing soap, paper, water, etc. They were also friendly and greeted us each morning as we left.- Bell staff was not especially friendly, however they were fast and accommodating. We didn't have to wait much at all for our bags, or for a cab to be hailed. They do an efficient job.- Bed and pillows were clean and comfortable – no issues here. Bathroom was also clean with fresh towels each day.- Fridge was decent. Wish there was a microwave, however you can get one for an extra fee. In-room safe is actually pretty large – bigger than others I’ve seen at other hotels in the past.- Pool and outside pool bar area are nice and inviting. There is a small waterfall and koi pond…the ambiance is nice. Pool-side evening entertainment was also pleasant.- Mandatory Resort fee includes free Wi-Fi and free parking in the adjacent garage – this is helpful and convenient.Unfortunate Items:- When we checked in, we were handed our room cards and a few other things, but otherwise no explanation of anything. Check-in was literally 1 minute, which included collecting payment info for the resort fee. It was only a few days later that I actually looked through the items handed to us to realize we had pool cards that would give us free towels and beach chairs as well as fruit and whatnot…so basically a nice beachside service. This was not explained to us and there’s nothing in the room letting you know about that either. So it’s up to a nice front desk clerk to let you know about that, otherwise you discover it yourself. Also apparently we had a free photo we could have had – did not know about this one either. I have only realized that by reading the reviews below.- The hotel is under some remodeling, most noticeably in main lobby and lobby/street-level floor. During our entire stay, there were painters, people hammering, people putting tarps or drop cloths up, men busting up tile, jack hammering, etc. Pretty much anything you can think of with a standard remodel. Would have been nice to know this, as we probably might have stayed somewhere else. I don’t know why they don’t choose to do the bulk of these repairs at night, when there is little to no activity in the lobby. Furthermore, anytime we wanted to use the “Internet Café” (which otherwise was actually really cool and they have several stations with 2 printers it seems) we couldn’t, because the computers were covered or disabled in some manner so men could work in that area. - Breakfast and Dinner buffet are a joke. I’m sorry to say that but for the price of nearly $30/person, there should be about 4 times more food put out there. Also, it’s disconcerting when there are workmen breaking up tile and pieces of tile are flying around right by the buffet items. Poor planning on this one. Who knows what is flying into the food. It was our last day and we were checking out, so I did not bother to complain on that one. There are several other restaurants around the area within a 5 minute walk that you can eat at – however most are pretty pricey as well, so be prepared.- Front desk staff is a mixed bag – a few were nice, most were not. Only one individual was really nice and helpful, and we did not catch his name. He worked a night shift at the check-in desk and gave us good advice on things to see and where to go. Probably the only really friendly person there. Otherwise, the lady running the Travel/Tours desk is not very friendly unless you want to purchase something directly from her or the hotel. There is also a man who works the same desk – he wasn’t friendly at all. When we asked him how we could get to the North Shore part of the island he just looked at us dumbfounded and told us to use the freeway. I asked for a map and he finally gave us a really bad photocopy of one. Concierge was neither friendly nor unfriendly – we once talked to a young woman and the 2nd time, a young man. Both were just “ok”. Really made us feel like our questions were not that important, but at least they weren’t rude.- Exterior of the hotel needs a facelift, mostly rooms not facing the street…but facing adjacent properties. You can see the deterioration of balconies/stucco and rusted railings from the outside.- Neighboring properties on both sides are under construction. This really isn’t the fault of the Sheraton PK, it’s just unfortunate. The International Marketplace is closed and won’t open again until 2016. There’s a lot of noise and construction from that side. There is also a neighboring hotel that is completely being redone, and quite a bit of noise from that as well, and an ugly view if you’re on that side. The sad part is, this actually could be a nice property if all this junk wasn’t going on and staff were trained to be consistent on friendliness and helpfulness. We loved the openness of the lobby into the pool area and getting that island breeze through there. I think after renovations are done…it will be a nice place to stay. Rooms are a little tired, however you spend most of your day away from the hotel and exploring the island, so who cares if the carpet is a little old and the bathroom tile is a little outdated. And I think if we had encountered more friendly staff than those who were rude, maybe we’d have a better overall opinion here….but since we don’t, we would not stay here again and would recommend others to do their research and find out what’s going on with the hotel you’re planning to book, or wait until the Sheraton PK is done with all its renovations.","Mesa, Arizona",44,2.0

It was a last minute booking via hotels.com as we hadn't planned on staying in Waikiki before flying back home. Checking in was fine, we were even given an upgrade to a 7th floor room with partial ocean view. In spite of what seemed to be constant, chronic chaos in the front desk/lobby area, the front desk staff were professional and courteous. It appears that renovations are underway, as I saw exposed wiring and freshly painted walls in the check in area and beyond. Our room was respectable, my hubby enjoyed the flat screen TV. The two beds were narrow but clean and adequate for our needs. The carpet could be cleaner, but the bathroom was clean so that was good. Complimentary water was provided in the room, and a mini fridge too, which sat atop a safe in the ample closet. Great fir keeping drinks cold for awhile :).We didn't eat here as the dining area carried a weird smell and the food looked less than inviting. So we ate at the Jimmy Buffets a few minutes walking distance away. Be prepared for a chaotic feel at the hotel entrance- there were always dozens of ppl coming back and forth with several piles of bags and suitcases lying around. A bit disorganized. However, the hotel is well located close to Waikiki Beach and all the high end shops. I would not consider staying here again unless serious renos were completed. Would recommend staying in Ko Olina outside of Waikiki, which is where we spent our first 6 nights at the JW Marriott Ihilani. If Waikiki beach and shopping isn't that big a deal to you, then stay in Ko Olina. Rent a car and do a day trip into Waikiki, which is what we did. ","New York, NY",42,3.0

We were given an upgrade to a deluxe ocean view which Ihave to day had we paid for it we would have been at the front desk complaining the room was only slightly bigger than the ocean view rooms, the lanai was smaller than those of the ocean view rooms the view was mainly of the moana hotel with the ocean showing above it and also of the swimming pool but at night the noise from the street was loud and you could hear the group playing by the pool with the lanai doors shut. Speaking of the lanai doors they were heavy to move we asked maintenance on two occassion to oil them and it was done on the second request which helped for most of our stay but not all of it as they were sticking again before we left. Can't comment on the hotel food as we only ate breakfast once as we had a complimentary ticket, the reason we didn't use it was all meals were way too expensive, you can get far more reasonable prices outside. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful the female conceige was useless the male was very good and most helpful. The pool staff were great. Housekeeping well whilst being nice and firendly one day our room didn't get made up at all, the bathroom was not cleaned except for changing out the towels, the bedroom never dusted and the lanai wasn't cleaned at all thoughout our stay. As for the room being deluxe I have visited Oahu many times and stayed in many other hotels of more moderate grade and this did not come up to their standard no pictures on the walls except for one faded small picture of shells in the bathroom!!! Yes renovations are taking place and as I understand it the hotel will now close next year for extensive renovations, hopefully this will improve the so called deluxe rooms however it will probably mean I will not be able to stay as the price will be elevated way out of my price range.

The hotel is slowly being tidied up - this was happening while we were there but gave us little trouble. We had a pretty good room - sea views. The Moana Surfrider is across the road on the beach side so you have to take into account that there is a lower building in front of yours but hey, when you come from the country, a view of the ocean is something to be marvelled at. The weather was perfect so I am sure that will colour all my reviews but the Sheraton PK is in a great spot for shopping, beaching, and of course all the restaurants that are arms length away. Some people have said that for a Sheraton the PK is disappointing. It's true it's tired and we had a chest of drawers with very dodgy drawers and a fridge that on the first night woke us up. But my husband kicked it and it was fine after that. We were staying at the PK because friends and family were so for all of us it worked brilliantly. The breakfast is great. You can have a full buffet or a continental. I had the continental and it was very very nice. Most mornings though we would get something from the little coffee pod at the front of the gates and have it on the balcony of our room. One of the things I particularly liked about the layout of the hotel is that generally you pass through the pool area and that was where we would all bump into each other during the day and make our plans for the afternoon or evening. It felt very communal. Every time you stay somewhere your feelings will always be dictated by a number of things but I do think the PK is good for what it is. Regarding costs I think it's probably a fair price. One of our friends got a really good deal on flights and the hotel and stayed for a tad longer.","London, United Kingdom",40,5.0

So the manager asked us if we wanted to move to another room, which we did (the AC wasn't working properly anyway and had to have maintenance come and fix it earlier in the evening). They moved us quickly to a lower room facing the International Marketplace, which, sadly, is being torn down.

He waived the resort fee ($50), which hardly seemed enough to me, but I didn't make a fuss. If we had been up and about when the mirror fell, someone could have been seriously hurt, or worse.

No apologies. My wife and I went on a drive around Honolulu to check out the sights. When we finally checked into our room, a horrendously foul odor hit us! We were unsure of what the smell was but upon investigating the room, nothing was clean! It was horrible to see dirty finger smudges on walls, light switches, bathroom fixtures. I immediately talked to an uninterested local bruddah with pierced ears at the front desk who told me that he'd have housekeeping stop by to freshen the room up. I informed him (let's leave his nameless, i'm sure ownership will deal with this guy) we had a constant leak above our shower, chipped walls and broken furniture. The sheets and pillows smelled like urine. He simply replied ""ok"" with no compensation or room moves offered. We ended up at WalMart to purchase cheap pillows, sheets, and cleaning supplies. When we arrived back, housekeeping didn't show up as promised. We ended up putting a Do Not Disturb sign on our door so that we could keep track of our bedding and belongings. We informed the front desk and concierge of our concerns but nothing was done. Heck I even posted something on twitter to grab the attention of ownership. Upon checkout, I voiced my concerns and frustrations with the Front Desk Agent. She said that she would pass the information along to her boss and took my guest comment card. No one has contacted me, offered any sort of compensation, or even thanked us for our stay. I would appreciate some sort of re-imbursement for our troubles.

Sadly, for a business traveler I cannot recommend this at all. For a family, same thing - 2 thumbs down. The rates were higher than much nicer properties I've visited, the room was a bit of a wreck, and the noise was awful. The staff were very average (a few of the private vendors were friendly, but those were the only happy faces I saw). I heard they're going to be closing for renovations in the near future, and perhaps that explains the dresser drawer that wouldn't stay closed, dust around the middle of the lamps, the stains on the carpet and chairs, the short shower curtain with straight (vs curved) rod that didn't really keep the floor dry. The elevators were often overflowing so getting to/from the room proved challenging time to time, and the restaurants were expensive (there are less expensive places around the area and farmer's markets a few nights a week). A band started at 10P somewhere in the area and kept me awake until midnight each night I was there. The bed lifted in the middle so avoiding a tumble to the floor felt awkward. In spite of the higher rates, this property charges $10 per day for a microwave and $14 a day for wireless internet service in the room. Computers are available in the lobby for those who wish to use them, though printing and time online is limited. The pool looked lovely and evening bands playing near the pool sounded great. It's a close walk to the beach and found some good bargains at the nearby Kings Market, but would not stay again.","Lihue, Hawaii",15,3.0

The same goes for the furniture in the room as a whole.Service: The maid has been knocking on the door at 7:15 AM every morning and woke us up to see whether she could clean the room.

We primarily wanted to see Pearl Harbor.LOCATION: The location was great for everything we wanted to do, and very convenient - we had a partial ocean view of Waikiki (blocked by the hotel in front of it by a block that is actually oceanfront - the Outrigger), and could easily walk to the beach and to all of the local/nearby restaurants and stores in Waikiki tourist area. It was great, especially for a brief stay and for not having rented a car for this stint. (We signed up for a Pearl Harbor tour that picked us up at another nearby hotel that we were able to walk to easily.) Note that it is not on the beach and does not have direct beach access. It is only about a block away though if you want to walk. ROOM/HOTEL: The room was neat and servicable but very average, not high-end at all. The furniture was relatively bare-boned and the bathroom was not one I'd want in my own home, however, for our brief trip, the location mattered more, so it was fine. I would say the same about the pool - perfectly fine, but nothing luxurious.Service was responsive and they sent us a free bottle of champagne to our room because it was our honeymoon. I did not rate value because we booked it as part of a package. I would say that if you are used to a more average hotel and not a luxury one, you would be pleased with this hotel. If you are used to more luxurious accommodations, updated bathrooms, etc., then you may be disappointed. There was nothing actually wrong with the room, and the service was fine.

Having read some reviews here I was absolutely shocked how picky and stupid some reviews can be. We knew this Sheraton was only a 3 star property at time of us booking. Yes this did surprise us that a Sheraton does have properties rating at only 3 star so our expectations werent overally high. Now despite this we thought its not going to be anything too special. Check in was very slow but yes its a busy time of year. We asked for a room away from noise and traffic but I don't think it happened. Our room was noisy as we were close to traffic noise. Yes this hotel is dated (like most hotels in Waikiki) and its 3 star hotel but we were told it is getting demolished in August 2014. One thing that absolutely shocked me that someone's review stated that this hotel would be ""like staying in a backpackers"". Oh my god, obviously whoever they are haven't travelled much or ever stayed in a real backpackers. Having stayed in many backpackers around the world this place is definitely NOT a backpackers place. Our room was clean and comfortable but in a noisy spot. Luckily shutting the door helpful a bit. The only thing was the aircon was a bit loud. After the first night our airconditioner stopped working and our room was hot when we returned from our day out. When we rang guest services we had a guy come up straight away to check it out. Within a few minutes we were told we would have to move rooms. OK, that is fine because it was definitely uncomfortable without airconditioning. Within minutes we got a call from the manager telling us that we can move to another room and someone will come up and help with our luggage. OK, you would expect to be moved if aircon wasn't working but I must say this issue was resolved so quickly that we were happy with their customer service. We were surprised just how quickly they did this as a lot of places you would have to wait and wait. I actually rang the manager at guest services and thanked them for such prompt service. Our second room was bigger and cooler which was nice but the safe didn't work. We just didn't bother with it. There was loud music till about 9.30pm each night here but that was not an issue with us. The pool area isn't as big as I thought. The food here was a bit pricey and the quality was ok but could be better for the price. We were given beach chairs and water and fruit for our days on the beach (was included in resort fee). Also this was the only hotel in our Hawaii trip where our wifi actually worked so that was relief. Ok, this hotel is dated, but the rooms were clean and comfortable and well even with our room issue the service was very good. Its in a great location so close to everything.

The pool bar is a very pleasant place to pass some time as well. The restaurant is an outside terrace, again very pleasant, meals are buffets and the service for coffee/drinks etc can be a little uneven, they always seem to be very rushed and not have quite enough staff on. The food is fine, nothing out of the box. The pool is quite large and the hotel supplies towels and beach chairs. The rooms are very comfortable, we had a twin room each bed was a double, and the room was a good size, bright and airy with good airconditioning and a reasonable size bathroom. Room has a fridge and coffee maker, TV, hairdryer, safe, iron and ironing board, so pretty much all that you need.

This hotel is in such bad shape and has been needing renovations across the board for many years now. The carpets are terrible, A/C never cold enough, popcorn ceilings, outdated furnishings, terrible mattresses, dirty bathrooms, and so on. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra 20-30 dollars or even the same rate and stay somewhere else / anywhere else. Room cleanliness is a must for me and the last 3 times I've stayed here there have been multiple issues. On top of all that, platinum members are greeted nicely at the desk for check in and amenities are just water and free wifi, big deal. Checking in/out process is always a time consuming issue and checkout is even worse if you need to get to the airport on time. Plan ahead. Ask yourself if you want to stay at a nasty hotel and maybe see the ocean, or stay at any other numerous properties with the same or better view, but much cleaner and more accommodating.

Sadly, our room was beyond being disappointing--it was disgusting. The bathroom was not clean and had a hole in the ceiling that looked like it was letting in creepy crawlies, the hallway to get to the room was depressing and dated. But what really disturbed us is that the room overlooked the garbage cans. When we opened the lanai door to step out not only was the view unacceptable (even at a budget hotel), but the cans were open. As you can imagine, in a humid place like Oahu, the garbage cans were emitting the most disgusting smells. To make matters worse, the airco was loud and made cranking sounds. But we couldn't figure out how to turn it off--except by opening the lanai! Admittedly, if we were staying longer, we would have demanded to be moved but instead just spent our short time there out of the room.

There were 4 of us in the room, and we also had a rollaway as our children do not like to share a double bed, sorry I have no room photos to add, as the children are in them all.. The room was very small by the time the rollaway was added, but we made the best of it and actually had a fun time. (Why can't hotels have a king and 2 singles as a Family room or as a standard room???? ) Anyway, YES this hotel is showing its age, YES it needs updating, but if you are looking for a central location and wonderful service, this hotel is a good choice. The parking is included in the resort fee, so that also makes it a convenient choice. We hired a car from across the road in the foyer of the Hyatt Regency, and we did our grocery shopping at the Food Pantry on Kuhio, 1 street behind the hotel. The beach is just a short stroll across the road. The pool is nice and deep and offers plenty of beach chairs around it. The laundry is in the basement and it was handy to do a load of washing, they have change machines located in the laundry room. We had no complaints about any of the services (housekeeping, front desk, room service). On this visit we stayed 4 nights at this Sheraton and then checked into the Sheraton Waikiki for the next week. See my other review for the Sheraton Waikiki. We wanted our children (aged 10 & 14) to enjoy both Sheraton properties.I did visit the hotel next door to do a comparison (Holiday Inn Beachcomber) and did note the rooms are a bit larger and more renovated. The pool at the Beachcomber however is smaller and not as nice as the Sheraton.

Thank goodness I had the reservation number in my phone. Well he found it due to the fact he did not spell my name correctly ( even though I spelled it out and is only 3 letters long ). He then had difficulties getting my rooms arranged and the CC reader wasn't working well.We finally made it to our room and the rooms were OK. There is no thermostat to control the room temperature. It was AC on high, low or off. The satellite TV had poor reception due to the winds I guess (not that you are going to watch a lot of television when in Hawaii). The balcony is tiny with a small table and 2 chairs squeezed in. There is a small fridge in the closet and that was nice to keep some drinks cold. The rooms have no sound insulation at ALL!! Our neighbours were loud and you can hear all their conversations. They stayed up late and got up early so basically we did not get much sleep. Received a note under the door the next day saying they need a credit card to secure the second room. I went down and the front person was quite rude saying it is necessary. I don't doubt that by why was it not taken care of when I registered in the first place. Both rooms were in my name and registered as such. She could have been nicer saying they dropped the ball and could have been more apologetic. Instead she made it feel like it was my fault that I was trying to scam them.The hotel is very busy with big tours and there is a lot of traffic. Not much to do within the hotel itself.

The main floor lobby and pool of the hotel are attractive, the price to stay here is excessive.Forget about eating in their restaurant, it is not worth it at $39.95 for a dinner buffet with few items other than crab legs. Their other menu for daytime dining was excessively priced as well. Drinks at the bar by the pool were also expensive, without the expected quality of liquor at these prices.There is a mandatory daily resort fee of $23.95 which gives you ""Complimentary"" -ha ha!! Wi-Fi internet access that is extremely limited in bandwidth. I was unable to send even a text email with their ""Complimentary"" internet access.On the bright side, your resort fee does include attached parkade parking so, if you rent a vehicle, that is very good value.The rooms are 'okay' but a little dated. The bathroom and shower have the black mold beginning to appear in the silicone sealant. -This is a normal, frequent occurance that can be managed with more attention to detailed cleaning.This is a non-smoking hotel but some people still 'sneak' smoke within their rooms. I am an 'outdoors only' smoker and still found the smoke that drifted into my suite intolerable, to the extent that it would wake me up in the night. -I can't imagine the revulsion a non-smoker would experience.There was a very nice view from my room, pool plus partial ocean view and Diamond head.The rooms are not sound proof and you hear the constant automatic slamming of doors from other hotel rooms. Even conversations from the next room!!! The patio doors are also not particularly sound proof so you do hear any excessive noise that is occurring on street level, even from 9 floors up!!I found the bed quite comfortable but the pillows were way too soft, even with 4 stacked!!I did submit feedback to the hotel regarding my disappointments but received no reply. To me, this says they don't particularly care. Rumor has it that the hotel is scheduled for demolition in the very near future, like December or early 2014.Location is very convenient but, if you are out after 10:00 pm, expect to see several prostitutes in the area.

It was small and old and generally dirty. I called down about the A/C and they said I could look at another room one floor up.The second room looked like the first but the A/C worked. It was slightly musty and the lights worked but honestly it looked like it hadn't been updated since the 80s. My roommate tweeted pictures of our first room and they called us to see at that point if we wanted to see a third room in the tower. The third room was in the tower and seems like it was updated slightly more recently than the others. Perhaps the early 90s. This room had a weird blood-like stain in the bathroom. We took it out of frustration. Upon returning from dinner, I flicked on the lights and found a visitor on the bedside table. A COCKROACH! I tried to kill it but it escaped into the drawer. The hotel staff offered to come spray it or fumigate the room. But I have asthma and don't want to stay in a chemical fog. I just want a bug free clean nice room! We are stuck here because we pre-paid for the two nights through an Alaska Airlines vacation special. I'll NEVER do that again.

I've never been so disappointed in a hotel of this caliber.We also found out from the staff that it's due to be torn down next year. I just want to make sure no one else makes the mistake did.

I liked the location and the fact that most (if not all) all of the rooms have balconies. But after my most recent stay, I'm done with this property. I'm a loyal Starwood member but if I can't stay at a different affiliated property, I'll stay at the Marriott (see my review). While the actual room was OK, the bathroom was in disrepair. They should be embarrassed at charging $200+ a night for a room in that condition. I'll admit I'm terribly annoyed by resort fees, but at the very least I expect to be able to use the services provided for by the fee. I think it's ""amusing"" that as airlines unbundle fees and charge for those that passengers ""want,"" hotels are bundling fees together that I do not want and make it a mandatory fee. The only ""bundled"" fee I cared about was the Internet access (which I can get for free because of my status at most every other Starwood property but not here). I had 3 wifi enabled devices with me, and was only able to access the Internet once in 5 days for about 30 minutes before it dropped off. But I know my devices worked (one excuse the hotel used for my inability to connect) was that I was always able to connect in the lower level public areas of the hotel. I asked the front desk for assistance at least 3 times for this and another service issue and was met with either enthusiastic offers of assistance to indifference, but it didn't matter, no service commitment was followed through on (and the one time I asked to speak to a manager he/she was not available). Literally they would promise assistance within 15 minutes and an hour later I would still be waiting in the room with no help (and no note or voicemail apologizing and offering assistance). I started my stay at the Courtyard by Marriott (because no Starwood property had availability) and wish I'd stayed there. Give this property a pass. Oh, and there are prostitutes at the southeast corner of the property in the evening near Kalakau Avenue, annoying for guests that don't want to be bothered with that attention.","Anchorage, Alaska",55,2.0

We opened the door to our room to find that we had only one bed. After then returning to reception we informed them we had booked a room with 2 beds and were told there was none available. A manager was called with no solution other than to take the room or go to another hotel. We were too tired to look for another hotel (after flying in after an exhausting flight) so we accepted this room. They brought up a portable bed. The upside was the manager offered us a free dinner voucher. Overall the bed was comfortable and the view good, but this hotel is very dated and really in need of a total renovation including the lifts...very scary on occasions! It is expensive for what you get. I don't understand why these hotels charge a ""Daily Resort Fee"", these items should be included in the room charge anyway.

Thoroughly enjoyed the accommodations and amenities. The room (27th floor) w/balcony - was spacious and had a fantastic view of Waikiki Beach and the ocean (even from the bed when drapes were opened). The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of storage space (large closet & large dresser). Having a small fridge, in-room coffee, and in-room safe were pluses. The check-in was slow (only one front-desk agent!) but we found staff to be friendly & courteous - especially our housekeeper ""Gloria"" - who was fantastic (genuinely happy, friendly & accommodating). There is a resort fee...however it includes parking, free wi-fi & use of beach towels & the nicest Tommy Bahama beach chairs...(Note: this property is not on the beach - and you will have to carry your chairs over - but just cross the street, walk 1/2 block and your there). The pool area is the hub of the hotel and almost seems like the lobby...there were plenty of lounge chairs...much of the dining and entertainment is done around the pool also (food is pricey). The internet lounge was very comfortable with plenty of desk-top stations for guests use. As other reviews have mentioned - the Sheraton Princess is a little ""dated"" and could use some sprucing up but it is a great value, in a fantastic location, with all the amenities you could want. If you're looking for luxury - you might be dissappointed. This was my 6th trip to Hawaii and I honestly don't spend much time in the room - so the money spent for ""luxury"" would be wasted.

Having realised that I had left a power converter and phone charger in my room I called the hotel 20 minutes after checking out, at 6 in the morning. I explained the situation and was assured that security would immediately go up to the room to retrieve the items. My friend, who was staying in Waikiki for another couple of days, could then pick them up later in the day. When he asked at reception in the afternoon, there was no record of the incident, and staff were indifferent and quite rude. I then called the hotel - from overseas, as I had travelled home - and also received sub-standard service. After being passed back and forth between Reception and Security, it culminated with the hotel's customer service manager telling me that 'there is nothing else we can do' and 'oh well, that's just the way it is...'.Thankfully the items weren't particularly valuable, but the inconvenience combined with the arrogant attitude of some hotel staff means that I for one won't be going back.","Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",16,2.0

My wife, toddler son and I were on a budget this year so we stayed at this hotel instead a higher star hotel than we had in the past.I have to admit that I was skeptical after reading some bad reviews, but our experiences ended up much better than expected.We stayed 6 nights in Sept 2013 in an ocean view king in the Ainahau Tower.The room was a bit dated, but nothing to really complain about. I was fine for us and housekeeping did a good job each day for us.If you're keeping a car there, when you first arrive, you will drop off your luggage with the attendant who will then direct you to park in the self parking structure. You can then check in at the lobby and the bell staff will bring your luggage to your room. Make note of your rental car details (make/model/color) since you need to provide this info when checking in and getting the car permit.For parking, the only elevator access is on the 3rd and 4th floors on the Ainahau tower side. Just look for the signs that show where there is an elevator. For most this may not be needed, but we had a stroller so we always needed it.The hotel lobby is always busy with people, the elevators do sometimes take a long time and get crowded, there is a lot of noise from outside at night time, and the rooms are dated. This all really wasn't a big deal since I know Waikiki and what to expect, especially if staying in that area. If that kind of stuff bothers you, then spend the extra money someplace like the Surfrider or Sheraton on the beach or just stay further away from the busy part of Waikiki or go to another island like Kauai or the Big Island. But if you're not high maintenance and used to the busy pace and noise of Waikiki, then this hotel is fine.","Bay Area, CA",2,3.0

ABC store across the street has everything you forgot, or fresh pineapple and yogurt for a nice healthy breakfast! Sheraton always takes good care of you, super comfy beds and pillows, great staff!

Bathroom was a bit small but ok.

I did not have much problem sleeping, even with the noise. Easy strolling along Kaiulani Ave. Easy walk to Waikiki Beach across the street and either through the Moana Surfrider Hotel (no one there seemed to complain about our using it as a walkway to the beach), or through one of the street beach entrances a little further down.No complaint about the resort fee, like some other reviewers seem to have a problem with. It seemed to be reasonable and in line with other hotels. Not sure I understand the rationale for setting is as a separate fee; it didn't seem to be optional, so why not just incorporate it into the final room rate. As part of the resort fee, PK provided beach amenities: towels, folding beach chairs, and even one of those small plastic inflatable rafts to use on the beach.Staff was courteous and helpful. Especially one of the people at the tours table. He spent a lot of time arranging one-day tours to Maui and Big Island for 4 of us. He made a lot of phone calls to accommodate us.

It's right on the main drag of Kalakaua Avenue, but this particular corner at Kaiulani Avenue is surprisingly less frenetic than other parts of central Waikiki -- perhaps because there's not such a high concentration of restaurants and retail on this particular stretch. This property is definitely showing signs of wear, and some amenities seem a little improvised, like the oddly placed gym that sort of floats between a large terrace and a big open public area where large groups sometimes convene. The standard rooms are on the small side, but the ones on the higher floors of the tallest tower offer great views of the beach and mountains. I was upgraded to Room 2762, one of the hotel's suite accommodations, which was a very spacious open-plan room with a wet bar area in the large entryway; a big seating area with sofa, desk, armchair, and large flat-screen television atop a chest of drawers; a two-poster king bed; a bathroom separated from the rest of the room by a glass wall, good for showering while enjoying the view; and a very long double balcony that really brought the outdoors in when both sliding doors were flung open. This is by no means a luxury hotel, but my room was simply fantastic and, with the great location, made up for all shortcomings.

Every moment was wonderful from the young man checking us in (I think his name was John) to Bobby Kubota the restaurant manager who provided complimentary champagne to Lenora S. who kept our room clean and comfortable. The Celebration Luau show and dinner gave us lots of priceless memories. I love the location and atmosphere this hotel offers with the nightly native music and the wonderful tropical smell in the lobby and pool area. At check-in we received a free upgrade and enjoyed a very nice room with a pool view and partial ocean view. Sitting on the lanai while enjoying the cool breeze was the perfect way to end each day. The music ended at 9 pm so we were not disturbed while sleeping. Each day we walked one block to see the Duke statue and wave to the camera and to the folks back home. Altogether, the Sheraton Princess gave us a dream vacation.","Kihei, Hawaii",30,5.0

I am a Starwood member and expected this hotel to meet up with all of the other hotels. It doesn't. Think Howard Johnson's. I decided that most of the good reviews must have thought they were reviewing the good Sheraton down the street. The rooms are old, the pool is small and dated and it is across the street from the Beach. When I realized I had checked into this hotel I tried to switch. It would cost 400.00 more to switch to the Moana surf rider across the street. ( the package was listed as 150.00 more when I booked) I will take that but because of the extra expense I will book one night there -not stay here at all and stay with friends the other night. Apparently that wasn't good enough for them. I could only switch if I booked two nights. Really??? I stay at the st Regis all the time and have never been treated as rudely as this hotel. They would have got my room fee for two nights. I would have paid 200.00 extra for one night at their other hotel. No deal. DON'T STAY HERE. NOT REALLY A SHERATON.","Los Angeles, California",5,1.0

The complimentary toiletries were a generous size and also refreshed daily. We had a room on the 19th floor which was located on the corner of the building and gave us views over the ocean and Waikiki beach from our balcony. We chose not to eat here so I'm unable to comment on the food although it did seem to be a bit pricey i.e. $39 to $42 for buffet evening dinner. The staff were friendly and helpful and there is free Wifi. There is also free use of computers and printer in the lobby area, which was great for us to print off our boarding passes for the flight home.

The hotel is a little aged and is slated for major renovations next Summer. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. Caution, this hotel is not for the culturally or ethnic insensitive. The hotel has arrangements with several travel agencies in Asia so, while I was there, I would estimate that 60% of the guests were from Asia. For me, this was fantastic since I find Asian travelers more hospital that those of the 48 contiguous States. For those who have health issues, Straub Medical Clinic is located on premises which should relieve you of any medical concerns you may have while visiting Waikiki. The food and entertainment in the hotel is top notch. Live Hawaiian music permeates throughout the lobby and restaurant during dinner hours. Later, I would recommend the hotel's Splash Bar. On two consecutive nights, while a guitarist was playing tunes, hotel guests and vendors did impromptu hulas. It was fantastic!

When I commented that we were surprised about the condition of the room, the staffer actually stated that I must remember this is a 50+ year old property and I should have booked a better room at the Sheraton Waikiki. My adult daughter, who was with me, could not believe the staff member would not even try to defend their own property. I did inquire at the Sheraton Waikiki if we could make a change there. The front desk clerk said he was hearing more of these types of complaints about the PK, but could not give us accommodations for our entire stay.

It has a lot of floors and rooms all built probably in the '70s or '80s. The place is very dated but I must compliment them on their recent renovation to their suites: you could hardly tell they are of that older vintage.Unlike the Surfrider, whose age is part of its beauty, the Kaiulani's birthdate is somewhat from a time when we made some of our ugliest and cheapest buildings. But the property is getting reinvestment and seems to have a cheery feel to it. Very tourista and just what a middle-class Hawaii vacationer should expect. It isn't five-star, nor does it pretend to be.The hotel has a cute little pool that is right off the lobby and feeds a steady flow of Mai Tais and other libations as the afternoons fade toward dusk. There is almost always some kind of Hawaiian-style entertainment going on at this point, and it all sort of blends together into buffet time as the sun sets.Buffets of a downtown Las Vegas level of quality are the standard here. Again: this is a great place for a budget vacation. Not on the beach, not fancy, but better than home for many.Because they turn over a lot of bodies the property's staff is as nice as can be expected under such conditions.",Maui,29,3.0

The pillows were perfect. The room had a fridge in it and there are ABC stores close by to buy food. We did not eat at the hotel as the buffets were too expensive - approximately $40.00 each. I'm not sure if there was a menu or not - no one said anything so I assumed there was only the buffet. I find out now that there was a menu. There is a Denny's and an IHOP around the corner and down the street so I wasn't too worried about where to eat breakfast. There are internet connections in the rooms but no WiFi.

We had to call for our room to be cleaned-after we had given them about 8 hours to clean it. I have been in Sheraton's in other cities and was amazed by the luxury of those hotels. This hotel-no way Sheraton quality. We got a free breakfast. Unfortunately someone had to stay at the table and make sure the birds did not take your food off your plate.Only one time were we given covers for our plates. The pool closed very early-6pm. There was still 2 more hours of daylight! The water was cold-not heated at all. The patio chairs were so close together that you couldn't walk between them. The employees didn't know their own hotel or area-we asked where the gift shop was-they didn't know. We asked whre we could get something to eat-fast food---well there was a burger king, KFC and subway about a block away. The staff told us about a bar about 3 blocks away.

Recently, I spent two back-to-back weekends here with family visiting from the mainland. I think the best thing about the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani, is its location relative to other things in Waikiki, without the much higher price point of hotels right around it. Granted, you are not directly on the beach, so if that is what you are looking for, pay the extra $100+ per night to stay at the Moana Surfrider across the street. The PK is perfectly comfortable for a stay in Waikiki, short or a week, and you will undoubtedly save money from other properties. The hotel is in desperate need of a style renovation and upgrade. I was always waiting for Rose, Dorothy, Blance and Sophia to be waiting on the lanai for drinks. If you can overlook the sad carpet, and awful 70s color scheme, you will enjoy yourself. We had a deluxe oceanview room, which provides great views of the city and the Pacific. Bathrooms are SMALL, which is the case with most older city hotels. NEWSFLASH: Sheraton...it would cost you very little to install curved shower rods in the bathrooms, to give the illusion of more space in the shower, without any major construction.A big mahalo to Gregg and Ping at the front desk. Both were very firendly, and accomodating when we needed to be moved to alternate rooms because the room we were in, though the hotel advertises wi-fi, and charges you in their resort fee, didn't have wi-fi.

I cannot believe the review by jassdsu saying that the Sheraton Waikiki is much nicer with a friendlier staff. The S.W. is on the beach but it is too large which requires a lot of walking to get to anywhere. The S.W. lobby is like a very long 'wind-tunnel'. The P.K. has a more open feeling in the lobby and I think the staff is better than the S.W. It was easy for me to compare because I had stayed at the S.W. the last week of February and then at the P.K. two weeks later. I do think that the bathrooms at the P.K. needs some work - - our faucet leaked and we needed to put a towel behind the faucet to absorb the water. The P.K. is just across the street from the Beach and much closer to great restaurants. Food is too expensive at the S.W. Both hotels have a 'Resort-Fee' - - - much higher at the S.W. than the P.K. More JALPAK & JTB groups at the S.W. than at the P.K. which causes more congestion around elevators, restaurants and halls. The bell--staff is faaaaar better at the P.K. than at the S.W. Lastly - I cannot believe that the rate was higher at the P.K. than at the S.W. for 'jassdsu'.

After a few painful weeks of sailing we ported in Pearl Harbor and i could not wait to jump on my mountain bike and see Oahu! I found eventually found myself wanting a place to sleep in downtown Waikiki. I thought it would be a small matter to pick a hotel and get a room. After something like 20 hotels with no vacancy i was getting a bit discouraged! After standing, most conspicuously, in line with my mountain bike in tow at the Sheraton Waikiki I was assisted by the most gorgeous of asian goddesses. She seemed sincerely dismayed in informing me that there was no vacancy. But hold on! She jumped on her phone and began to call every friend she had that also worked in hotel reception. She found a room for me at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani. I wish i could remember her name!About the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani... Absolutely worth the $150 room charge. The room was 4 star american standard. It was clean and functional with every modern amenity including free wifi. The rooms appear to have been last renovated in the early 90's however they have been kept spotless and functional. The bed was extremely comfortable but keep in mind that i just got off a bicycle seat and prior to that a navy bunk bed. The sheets where pure white and smelled sterilized clean. The shower was excellent with a modern shower head.The hotel offers a decent pool that is popular with the kids and those who want to chill out from the bustle of the beach.The famous Waikiki beach is merely across the main drag, Kalakaua Ave. So it is not right on the beach... fine!

I will preface this review by saying that we stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki which was a different level of hotel...and we were spoiled by the accommodations there. We moved after one day to the Princess to save some money and because the Waikiki was sold out, and having seen some reviews, we were ready for the property to be a slight step down, and in some areas it was. The location is really great, blocks from a main tour pickup and drop off point, the beach is a short walk, and there are tons of restaurants and name brand and boutique stores. The lobby, while dated, was clean (and very busy with arrivals and departures). We did not use the restaurant or bar except for a welcome drink when we walked in, but both were also clean and appeared well staffed. The pool area was nice, and oddly enough there was never anyone swimming, just sun bathing. We checked in after 3 because the room was not ready when we first arrived in the morning, but I understood this as the hotel was full the night before and checkout is at 11 am, so I was unfazed by it. Our check in was made warm and friendly by Kathy, who was great and made up feel welcome. Getting to our room in the tower, it was again clean, but also dated. The view from the 26th floor, however, was amazing! The ups and downs were unfortunately a recurring theme with this hotel. A really nice touch was the fresh flower arrangement that was provided for us as a honeymoon gift. Then 10 minutes later, a complimentary bottle of champagne was sent up. Awesome! Up again! Then the downer came at 11 pm when we could hear a performing band from across the street. The sound echoed through the natural canyon formed by the tall buildings. Not the hotel's fault, but my wife simply couldn't sleep. In the morning we asked to move to a different room, and once again, Kathy came to the rescue! Luckily, she was able to find us a room in the much-newer feeling wing in the building by the pool. No noise, fresher room, and the views were actually just as nice! lastly, the housekeepers were very friendly, making eye contact and saying hello very day we saw them.We continued on with our week of beach, swimming, shopping and touring, and had no more problems. So while the Sheraton Princess could use a facelift, it was truly the face of the caring staff, and Kathy in particular, that made our stay great and just as importantly would entice us to return. Didn't love the resort fee, but we tried to get our money's worth out of it by getting beach chairs and towels, and using the internet which was wireless in the 2nd room we moved to.

This trip I travelled with my mother (3rd visit to PK) and my 3 year old daughter. Upon arrival at 8am we were made to wait till 3pm for a room after flying from Sydney, Australia. The hotel was not full, but that was too bad. In the meantime we had lunch by the pool and was served a stale club sandwich with black avocado (not fresh). We returned the sandwich and gave lunch a miss. By the time 3pm, we were very tired and checked into our standard room which was tiny, original bathroom (very old) with a view of the carpark and down below dumpster bins. By this stage I was starting to feel like we were anywhere but Hawaii. My mother complained to the bell boy about the room. About an hour later the hotel sent up a fresh basket of fruit apologising for the room. Only to open the fresh basket of fruit and discover the fruit to be green and mouldy. I went downstairs to the reception to thanked them for the fresh fruit, but in Australia the Sheraton is of a high standard and when we give fresh fruit, it isn't covered in mould and that they were welcome to eat the fruit themselves. With that we were upgraded immediately to the Ocean Deluxe Room which was a nicer & bigger room with a lovely view of Waikiki Beach and I started to feel like I had in fact arrived in Hawaii - finally. The only further problem was that the room stunk of ""MOULD"". This hotel is old and is in need of renovations with all bathrooms. The service is a little slow. My mother was very disappointed with her 3rd visit to PK and won't be returning next year. Such a shame to have a regular visitor have such a disappointing experience. Other than the hotel, our trip to Hawaii was lovely. The Waikele Outlet is a shopping heaven. Travel with PJ Plover, they have coach's pick up and drop off from Dukes Statue on Waikee Beach for $10 return. Pearl Harbour was interesting. Alo Moana Shopping Centre was over rated. Once you have been to the outlets, further shopping isn't necessary. The outlet covers everything. The Ross Store has great/cheap clothing for children. Will definately return to Hawaii again for a shopping holiday, other than that, there isn't much to do in Hawaii.

Yes, it is perfectly located but I'm not sure that this is so much of an issue in Waikiki, as it is so small and so well serviced by buses and taxis galore. The noise factor was a real problem, even on the 26th floor! After 2 weeks there, lack of sleep was becoming a problem. Also, as a Starwood guest and user of Sheraton hotels, we were astonished to discover that there wasn't even a shaver point in our bathroom. The provision of toiletries was a hit and miss affair too - another potential problem as there were three of us in the room. We know that we only had to ask and the staff would have provided, but my point is that we shouldn't have needed to ask, it should have been provided on a daily basis. Totally agree with the others that the staff were great. The show was great too. We did have a laugh at the lady on the tourism desk though, we wanted to ask about getting ourselves around the island using public transport and no matter how many times we re-phrased the question she kept telling us that she could only talk about the tours she sold. We gave up and let her talk. It would have been nice to be able to get general tourist info from someone. The room was tired in the extreme, tiles needed regrouting, decor very outdated, the door to the balcony kept getting stuck so my husband had to open it for us on occasion. The wardrobe door was equally iffy. No minibar even. The daily resort charge was an affront considering we did not use the pool, car park or restaurants. Too many Japanese for our liking and more lifts needed as the wait at busy times of the day was silly. So, all in all, thumbs up for the hotel staff (not tourism) and thumbs down for the hotel.

To be fair, it's hard to find a bad location in Waikiki. It's small and entirely walkable and every bustling street corner has it's ABC store, plenty of restaurants, and wherever you are, you are never far from the beach. But the SPK is really in the center of it all. You are a couple of blocks from the beach, which is perfect. Waikiki beach is a public beach area anyhow, so for me it wasn't worth paying the pricy room rates to get closer access. Check-in was fine. The lobby area was extremely busy - lots of people running around (I actually felt like I was in Tokyo because a huge percentage of the guests are Japanese), but no wait for the front desk. There's a $24.50 per day resort fee that's charged - this is a pet peeve of mine. Resort fees should either be optional or included in the stated price of the room and if you're not using some of what it includes (wireless, parking), then you are subsidizing it for other guests. Anyway, at least it included some free drinks at the bar. Pool area is nothing to speak of. There was some live entertainment at night, which was nice to listen to. But do not go here thinking you'll be spending much time at the pool. I hardly saw anyone in it. And it's definitely not for kids -- only a tiny area is sectioned off as the shallow end; the rest is 6-8' deep. The rooms have had their better day...maybe about 30 years ago. They are now dingy, stained, and loud. Uncomfortable beds and paper thin walls makes for a poor night's sleep. Toiletries in the bathroom were OK. Hallways look dingy as well. Really needs a major overhaul.But at the end of the day, I think it doesn't really matter where you stay in Waikiki that much - because you probably won't be spending a ton of time in the room or in the pool area. The greatness of the area is really the beach, trying out some great restaurants (Marukame Udon around the corner is worth the wait), and walking/people-watching on the main streets. Enjoy Waikiki for what it is. It's not the quiet paradise many have in mind when traveling to Hawaii, but it's still scenic, cultural, and a lot of fun. My advice - don't spend a lot of money on your hotel here, it's just not worth it. Definitely go to Waikiki and check out the main sights of Oahu (Circle Island Tour, Pearl Harbor, Polynesian Cultural Center), but save the majority of your money and your time for one or more of the other islands. I'd stay at the SPK again for cost and convenience, but the rooms are just not up to the standards of the places I would normally stay in.",Chicago,343,3.0

The free drink they give you at check-in was not good, and I would recommend dinning off-site. SPG members get 35% off of food purchased at any of the hotels on the beach (Moana Surfrider, Sheraton Waikiki and Royal Hawaian) I did have a couple of nice lunches on the breach front at some of those hotels. Overall, the stay was nice and I really didn't have any issues. For the price, it was great. The beds were very comfy and that was VERY good after long days on the beach! Waikiki beach is pretty crowded with a lot of culture in the area which was interesting. You really have to try the ice cream at the Market place which is only a block or so away.","Wautoma, Wisconsin, USA",2,5.0

It was simply appalling and people need to know.This is a copy of the original letter I sent to Starwood Hotels- Owner of The Sheraton.They completely agree!Dear Customer Service Representative,We were guests at The Sheraton Princess Kaiulani in room 483 from 2/4 - 2/10Firstly let me say that the room was clean, well stocked, comfortable and generally the staff were pleasant and helpful. I am quite sure that after reading this feedback you will have to tend to agree, because no matter what the rate scale everyone deserves a good nights sleep. I have several short videos documenting the 24 hr loading zone noise. I am aware that this kind of activity is necessary to keep the resort stocked cleaned and functioning efficiently however the noise level in the room is simply unacceptable! The ridiculously loud beeping of trucks backing into the loading zone, which can happen anytime 24/7, even 3am on a Saturday and Sunday will awaken you abruptly. To add insult to injury there are employees and associates laughing and yelling amongst themselves. My suggestion would be, at the very least, to provide earplugs with an explanation and apology for any inconvenience. Possibly look into sound proofing the doors on to the lanai. Being unable to sleep on vacation is just flat out wrong!!We did request to be moved and I offered to pay because we could not sleep. This was basically blown off without apology or any sincere concern. Thank you for your time.Sincerely,Catherine BailieThe guest services manager sent me a courteous email but made no mention of taking any action, for the comfort of future guests, to suppress the shocking noise level.","Los Angeles, California",5,2.0

I wanted something in the center of Waikiki so there were lots of restaurants in walking distance but could not afford a beachfront hotel. This ended up being a really good option for us. It is right across the street from the beach and was very reasonably priced. We stayed in one of the cheapest rooms but it had everything we needed. The breakfast and dinner buffets are free for kids under 12 with one paid adult so a huge breakfast (which meant no need for lunch) was $24.50 for both of us. The property is well-maintained and I will stay here next year when I bring my next grandson.My only complaint is that the check-in line was way too long.

It took us 23hrs from leaving our hotel at Heathrow to arriving at the Sheraton in Honolulu so were very tired upon arrival but check in was quick and when we mentioned we were on our honeymoon we got upgraded to a pool view room. The rooms are dated but clean and comfortable and if like us a hotel room is a base to sleep and shower whilst you explore the local area then the Sheraton is perfect. At the end of the day you get what you pay for - you're not paying 5 star prices so don't expect 5 star luxury! The breakfast buffet is good and plentiful, the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is ideally situated to go off and explore, just a few minutes walk from the beach, shops and restaurants. We booked the Polynesian Adventure trip to Pearl Harbour and found it to be a bit rushed, we could have done with an extra hour or two to fully explore everything at Pearl Harbour. If we went back we would hire a car and do Pearl Harbour at our own pace - there is a lot to look at and take in, make sure you have some tissues as it can be quite emotional at times!

The lobby and pool areas are nice and updated, however, the rooms are NOT! I unfortunately stay at this hotel 4-5 times a month and have never ever had a decent room. Many of the rooms are extremely small (think college dorm); so much so that there is not a place to put your luggage. The bathroom is small with a pedestal sink, but no counter space for your toiletries. I have had rooms that absoluetly reeked of mold and mildew and asked for a different room. They accomodated me with an old outdated room that looked as if it had not been remodeled since the 1970's. The shower had lime green and bright yellow decaying tile. There is no water pressure in the shower (in ALL the rooms that I've stayed in), and the small detachable shower head makes it virtually impossible to shower because the trickle of the water is directed at the back wall of the shower. The a/c is a joke with only an on/off option and it barely works. The door locks are so old that I've gotten locked out of my room several times. When securlity comes to let me in, they inform me that the door is locked from the inside!!!!! I tell them ""No, that I am not in the room"". When I finally get inside, I look at the lock to see that the extra security lock does not stay unlocked, it bounces over and locks itself every time you open/close the door. The windows barely open, maybe about an inch. However last week, I had a room with a window that opened all the way, but there was no screen, and because I was on a lower floor, my room overlooked the roof of an adjacent building. So, anyone on the roof of the other building could have crawled into my room easily. Needless to say, I opted to keep the window closed and use the barely operable a/c. ALL of my rooms have been filthy with dust easily wiped from a/c and fan vents by me. If I can do it, why can't the housekeeping staff? The windows in the main hall on the individual floors have louvers that are always open. This seems nice with a nice breeze flowing through the hall. However, if it is really windy, your room door will rattle all night and it sounds as if someone is trying to enter your room. I NEVER EVER get a decent night's sleep here. I will be asking my company to place us at another hotel!!!!","Boulder, Colorado",7,1.0

Overall we were very satisfied with our stay. Reading over some of the reviews, I realize that there are obviously substantial differences in the quality of the rooms and you should be aware of this. We were initially upgraded from a standard room in the Kaiulani Wing to a pool-view room in the Princess Wing. Every night there is poolside entertainment (live music and here and there a dancer) and at first I was worried this would be too noisy. So I requested to see the Standard Room in the Kaiulani Wing where the rooms have either street or mountain views, to decide if I would not prefer that location. The Kaiulani Wing is older and the reception staff warned me that I would be getting a room that is rated lower than the Princess Wing room they gave us. The standard room in the older wing was nice enough, but the bathroom was somewhat dated and the view was not as nice as what we had, so we stayed in the Princess Wing. There is also the Ainahau Tower, the tallest of the three towers. Our room was pleasant and comfortable. It had a refrigerator, safe, hairdryer, 2 bathrobes, iron & ironing board, king size bed, 2 nightstands, dresser, desk and a chair, TV, a rattan lounge chair with a small high end table next to it, a balcony (called ""lanai"") and 2 chairs and a small stool on the balcony. I am pretty sensitive about the bed and the bedding and often feel that beds are too soft and bedding insufficient. Not so at Princess Kaiulani hotel. The king size bed was very comfortable and the covers comfortable and perfect. The large sliding door has both light blocking and sheer curtains that can be adjusted according to individual preference. We had good wireless reception for our laptop computer in the room. Our daily resort fee of $18/day included both the wireless internet and parking, in addition to some other small benefits like 2 waters per day. My one complaint about the room would be that there was no table for writing or eating. There was room for a table, but the hotel chose to place the lounge chair there instead. This lack of a table and 2 chairs was pretty annoying, since it was a working vacation for both of us and when one of us was using the desk, where we set up the computer, the other had no place to do any work, write, read, enjoy a beverage or eat. Without a table and 2 chairs, the only place to sit down was on the balcony or on the bed. Even low budget hotels usually have a table and 2 chairs as standard furnishings so it was disappointing that a hotel that should have been in a higher class than budget could not manage to provide such basic equipment as a table and 2 chairs in a room meant for 2. Other than that, the premises are well kept and pleasant, everything was always clean. Elevators run well and often. We didn't have much contact with the staff, except on the first day, when we were frustrated beyond belief by our simple request that they explain to us how to transport our luggage from our rented car that was parked in the parking lot to our room, by way of elevators rather than stairs, which appeared to be the only way to get out of the parking lot. Eventually we found the place where we needed to park to access the Ainahau Tower elevator from the parking lot, but it took us 1 1/2 hours from the time we checked in to the time we got our luggage in our room. We had to make several trips to reception, got locked in the emergency exit stairway (which we entered on the advice of hotel staff), had to walk 7 flights of stairs down before we were able to get out. The parking lot offers convenient parking if you plan to rent a car, but be aware that the principal way to get in and out of the parking lot is by stairs. The location is in the heart of Waikiki, directly across the Moana Surfrider, the oldest and one of the fanciest hotels in Waikiki. This location can be quite noisy - there is traffic and people noise drifting in from Kalakaua Avenue, and poolside there is entertainment and the bar also has singers and karaoke. Some of the bar guests can get noisy. However, if you close your balcony doors, about 95% of the noise is blocked out. We were on the 5th floor and had partial ocean view. If you are higher up, you will probably have better views and it may be less noisy. We had no problems with the bathroom. Good water pressure, nice non slip bottom on the tub, the shower can be used as hand-held or overhead shower. The faucets were easy to operate, and the shower had a safety bar to hold on to. We always had an extra roll of toilet paper, absolutely no problems in this area. The refrigerator was small but sufficient for some food or drinks. On the day of our arrival we received 2 vouchers for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. When we went to use them, we learned that they were for a specific house drink, something that looked like a Mai Tai but was made with vodka. We were willing to give it a try, however, this drink was really disgusting. I poured mine into the flower pot next to my chair (because they wouldn't make me another drink while I still had an unfinished one) and my husband gave his away to the karaoke singer after he tasted mine and decided not to touch his. The karaoke singer took a sip and left the drink untouched after that. I think the drink might have been good if made with rum rather than vodka, but was really undrinkable the way it was prepared. Because of this experience at the bar, we did not go to the bar again, nor did we eat at the hotel. The breakfast buffet cost $24/person and the dinner buffet was $37/person, but I have no idea if these were good values or not. The hotel would do better to offer a complimentary beverage that tastes good rather than the stuff we received, or not to give any complimentary drinks at all. One unusual experience we had was with our safe. We placed our valuables there - cash, ATM card, credit cards - and by mistake left it open the whole day we were gone. When I discovered in the evening that the safe had been left open while we were gone, I braced myself for a substantial financial loss and hassle - yet everything was there, exactly as we left it. Needless to say, this was a pleasant surprise and says a lot about the quality of the hotel staff. The lobby has several computers available for the guests and has nice museum-style displays about Princess Kaiulani and her time period. Also of interest is the fact that located on the premises is a regular walk-in clinic, something I really appreciated because I became quite ill during the trip to Hawaii and needed to see a doctor. While I had to wait 1 1/2 hours to be seen, the treatment had me 95% back to normal the next day and saved our vacation. It was very convenient that a clinic was right there on the premises, open I believe 24/7.","Central Coast, California",70,4.0

Most of the staff were very nice, however when I asked to use the phone down at the Concierge, the staff member told me to use the phone in my room. Getting up and down in the lift was also a bit of a hassle with all floors between 1-29 accessible in any lift, which meant long wait times. The decor of the rooms is also a bit outdated, but they are clean and efficient with housekeeping services.

But I remember staying here over ten years ago and not a single thing has changed, and I'm including all the way down to the comforter and carpets. The place smells horrific too, like your grandmas house but moldier. I highly doubt the air quality would pass that of smoggy LA. The fact that Sheraton and SPG puts this hotel in the same Category 5 pricing along with the Sheraton Waikiki (which is actually on the beach) and the Moana Surfrider, a Westin (just across the street, historic, and actually on the beach as well) is pathetic. Sheraton should be ashamed of itself, its audacity.The staff is the one shining moment that has become a mainstay and salvation for all Sheraton and SPG hotels that I've stayed at in the last few years. The girl that we checked in with took her time to explain what was included in the resort fee (exactly same benefits as the sheraton waikiki) She made sure we had a nice room location since we were SPG gold members. The bartender at the pool bar was great about the free welcome drink. Overall I love the staff, they are great, and definitely earned another star for this hotel.The Room: Pathetic. The carpet, the furniture, the bedding, the chair, the safe, EVERYTHING is original to when this hotel was built. And I had to look it up. Built in 1955. There is no way its been updated since then. For the money they want you to pay I simply can not believe it. The bed was very uncomfortable, way to squishy for me, soft is not even the right word, its uneven support left me with a terrible backache. The bathroom is teeny tiny and has the original small white tile with moldy grout. The highlight of the room by far is the large balcony with great views of the ocean and Waikiki Beach. But of course forget about seeing Diamond Head because the Hyatt built its tall towers right in the way. No one travels to Waikiki just to sit in the room but this doesn't really even live up to basic expectations at this price point. And remember, if you get a room that faces the pool, thus faces the main street in Waikiki, it is going to be loud all day and night, whether it be street noise, kids playing at the pool noise, or music coming from all over. Oh yeah, and because the hotel is so old, there is no wireless internet in the room. If you're important enough they do offer a verizon mifi hotspot they will let you borrow.Overall this hotel is like most in Waikiki. That said, its old and needs to be updated. That said, for about the same price or exact same point redemption you can be across the street actually on the beach staying in an updated room since the Eisenhower administration. Don't waste your money, book early at a better spot. Sorry Sheraton, you know you need some help, so do it so you can justify the price. I stayed here probably ten years ago and payed around 100 bucks, that was fair, anymore then that is not worth it.","Phoenix, Arizona",127,3.0

Look for coupons for the tourist attractions and tours because the prices can be quite different for the same things.The unprepared tourist will pay top dollar for the lack of knowledge on choices.

The room, ""an upgraded city view"", was in reality facing alleyways, the back of buildings, and the top of the adjacent international market of junk. For one person, the room size was fine. For two, probably still OK. For a family of four? It would be a nightmare. Everything was very dated. I called it ""Panama City, Florida, cheap, 70's style"". The veneer was peeling off the furniture. The cloth chairs were stained and disgusting. The carpet was worn. The worst? The bathroom. Not just vintage ugly, but moldy, under the sink and above the shower. The shower was tiny, with a shower curtain so close to you that you hated to get in. The only redeeming thing about the room was the bed, which was comfortable in accordance with mid-range Sheraton bedding. The racket from the street, filtering up from in front of the market at night was irritating, with street performers using amplifiers to sing, cajole, and harass passers-by. Location is fine, with ""beaches to the left, and retail to the right"". I did not eat a single meal here. There are lots of better options. No wireless, although the wired Internet service was fine.

Since I was traveling with my friend I sent a request to the hotel asking for room with 2 Queen beds. For some reason you can't specify it during reservation process. Next day I received an email where they confirmed that got my request and it was noted. Well, as I found later 'noted' means nothing at Sheraton PK. At the time we arrived we got a room with King Size bed. Lady at the reception tried to tell me that there's no any requests. I showed her an original mail thread about it and she 'found' it but said that request depends on availability and they don't have anything available at this point. It means they just ignored my request because I can't believe that in August hotel was booked completely. I understand that mistakes happen sometimes. Usually is such situation hotel offers you free breakfast / drinks / room upgrade / free nights. Not Sheraton PK. They gave us free roll-away bed, that's it. Next day I sent a complain and received a confirmation that they got it. No one contacted me. Later after the trip I sent another feedback directly to Sheraton web-site and was ignored again.Few things you want to know in addition to my terrible management experience:1. I stayed in Ocean View room. And actually in other hotels it will be called partial ocean view room because you can't see ocean just from you window/balcony directly. It's on you left side.2.

First of all the hotel is not new. It is an old hotel located 100 yards from direct Waikiki Beach and within 100 feet of all the 5 star shops along the main streets. So yes, the hotel is not new and it is clearly not 5 stars. But most everyone in here have complaints about simple and small things that only a 5 star hotel would have better. And let me assure you that a 5 star hotel in Waikiki is around $600-1000 per night. This Sheraton is around $170-250 per night. HUGE DIFFERENCE. All of these competing hotels are within 100 feet of the front door to this hotel. If you truly desire to spend that kind of extra money for a hotel to get extreme luxury, then go ahead and spend the money. But if you want a 4 star hotel that has TREMENDOUS views and in really decent, clean and nice shape for being this old, then this is your hotel. Think about it! Seven days here instead of the other hotels will allow you virtually pay for your entire vacation from the savings. If I ever come to Honolulu again, I would never stay anywhere else. It simply does not make any financial sense, unless of course, you have so much money that it does not matter. I don't so this is my hotel. And a very nice one too.

The location is great-right in the middle of shopping, restaurants, and just across the street from the beach. The rooms are in desperate need of renovation - our closet door fell off the first day we checked in. The balcony looked over the pool and we could see part of the beach but the bars were rusted and the concrete floor was cracked so badly we were afraid to stay on it for fear the whole balcony would just fall off. By far, the best part about the hotel was the tour desk operator Marsha Southworth.

Dislikes: corridors looked like an old hospital, musty and slow elevators, stained and peeling wallpaper, faded carpet, very small bathroom with tarnished fittings (I had the same tiles in my flat in the '70's). We didn't pay for an ocean view so the standard room looked out on to adjacent rooftops and commercial waste bins. No screen to the balcony so left it closed off and air conditioner didn't have a thermostat - it was either on or off and the outlet was level with my partner's face and on the wall so he had sinus by the 2nd day? Pool was full of noisy children and there was lots of empty cups and debri around the area so spent very little time in the resort.

My frist impression as I got off of the elevator was I was in the wrong hotel. It smelled and looked more like a Holiday Inn/Best Western than a Sheraton. I had called prior to our stay and was told that the hotel had been renovated...not sure what was renovated, but it certainly is not the rooms or the common areas. We checked in and were given a Gold Upgrade to a nice view of the alley. If you craned your neck to the left, you could see a bit of the ocean though, so yes, it was nicer than some of the rooms...but we got to hear the garbage trucks in the alley every morning about 6 AM. Not good for catching up on some well deserved rest.The room itself was clean, but very very dated....seemed reminescent of early 80's...not an upscale category 5 resort that you would expect in a Starwood Resort Destination. The towels are what you would find in the above mentioned hotel chains, and the beds are not the trypical comfy Starwood beds...first Sheraton I have stayed in and experienced this. The elevators were often full and can take awhile to get down to the lobby during busy times...which seemed to be most of the time. Parking was convient, but we had trouble finding a spot a couple of times. Wasn't too much of an issue.We didn't eat at the restaurant, but the buffet looked nice.We didn't use the pool, but it looked like it too could use some renovation...big peeling off spots on the bottom of the poolThe best part about the pool area was the ability to borrow beach chairs...we ended doing that every day and getting away from Waikiki and exploring other areas of the island. It would be nice to be able to have more than one towel to use, but that is all you are allowed. Overall, it was OK, not great, and if you are going to spend the $ to stay here, you may want to save a few dollars and head about a block down and stay at the Holiday Inn. The location is central and walking distance to anywhere in Waikiki, but it is VERY crowded.","Seattle, Washington",13,2.0

We had booked a special package rate and had to explain this at check-in.We had to explain everything that was offered in the package. Asked for late checkouton our final day and was told we had to pay. I enquired why when we were gold members.We were told we could have the 4pm checkout and then the associate standing at the nextcomputer said no we couldn't had to be 1pm. At the same time this associate was dealingwith an older woman who was having problems with her air conditioning. This associatedismissed her in a rude manner and then started to belittle her, in front of me, to anotherassociate behind the counter. I asked if we were getting an upgraded room which is anotherperk for gold members. Yes we were. Which seemed strange as the hotel had no record ofus being gold members.We went to our assigned room and it was everything I had not requested in my list of specialrequests in my original booking.Housekeeping was excellent for the first three days. We leave a gratuity everyday. We stopped because things changed. The closet doors looked as if a previous guest had shaken a can of coke, opened it, and let it spray all over the doors. That was never cleaned. I wiped three of the louvers and the sticky substance was easy to remove. I didn't finish the job.On the 8th day housekeeping returned to excellent. We did fill out a form in the room and left it with the front desk. Our complaints were neveracknowledged.The hotel needs to be renovated. Our bathroom was moldy around the ceiling in the shower.The taps in the tub dripped. The sink and toilet seat had cracks in them. The sink faucetsare very old. Chrome worn off to reveal brass underneath. Water leaked from base of faucets.One serious concern was the balconies beside us. The concrete was deteriorating and therebar is exposed. Public washrooms in the hotel are not cleaned very frequently.

All of my interactions with the staff were pleasant. Room was very clean. Did it help that we tipped every day instead of leaving a tip at the end? There could have been a problem when we first checked in with the room, but it was dealt with.

Across the street from Waikiki so a very good location with many shops and restaurants within a few minute walk.Staff 3.5. Would be a 4 based on the guy we dealt with at check in. But, we had an issue with our room and when we went down to ask for a new room the girl that helped us was quite dismisive and didn't show very much concern about our issue (our first room given to us was dirty).Room 2. The 2nd room we were given was clean and has provided a place to sleep but is about 20 years overdue for a renovation and isn't really acceptable to fly the Sheraton flag. The walls are paper thin and shake every time a neighbour closes their door. Perhaps they should re brand as a Super 8 or Travelodge. The shower was an old basic plastic insert with a semi functional shower head. Blue carpet and furniture from the 80's. The positives were the ocean view was quite good as advertised and the bed was quite comfy (looked to be an older non pillowtop bed but was much comfier than the newer model of beds at some updated Sheraton or Starwood Hotels).Elevators - 3. There were 4 elevators for the tower but seemed that only 3 were working. At times (5 pm'ish) there was a wait of 5 + minutes and 30 + people waiting to get on so that was kind of annoying.Gym - 3. Okay. Did the job.Pool - 3. Okay, but the sun doesn't hit the pool until at least 10:30 am because it is in a courtyard that is blocked by the buildings.

The rooms are cramped and outdated (though I will say the view from our room was fantastic). The service was about the worse I have experienced (and I am platinum at SPG (their hotel group). The staff did not seem to want to be there (with maybe once exception and he did not seem to have a handle on his job) and were not helpful. And they claim on their website ""wireless high speed internet access in Guest rooms by request. This is simply not true. When I got there I called and asked about the wireless and I was informed that the ""tower"" did not have wireless only wired. This is a pain. I use mostly my IPAD and it cannot use wired and it is a pain to have to be at the desk. And the bottom line is they say it is available. This stay was in June and let the management know about this issue and I just checked and their website still says what I listed above. The experience was so unpleasant that I did not stay at the Starwood hotels for a while and only returned to use my points. I have to say that I have some good experiences since I have been back (at other hotels). I will never stay at this hotel.

I was thinking this place should be ok as it is a Sheraton and all but although I tried to stay positive I was pretty disappointed overall. We had a pool view room...the pool view was very average. The shower in particular was so old it was frustrating even to turn the tap on was a mission. There is no ""beach service"" like they offered. You just get handed a towel and told the chairs were out (even if you turned up at 7am). I guess you get what you pay for but I would be digging into those pockets for an extra $50 and treating yourself somewhere half descent. Waikiki is a beautiful place but you miss it all when you stay at the Sheraton princess....I do however highly recommend the sheraton pink palace, Sheraton Waikiki or outrigger on the beach ",,19,2.0

I booked here from the SPG app and got a great rate. With Platinum status I was hoping to get a suite upgrade since they were available online just a few days prior to my arrival. On checkin I was given an upgrade ocean view room on a high floor (much better room than I reserved, but not a suite). THE ROOM: The view from the balcony was pretty good, although I had not realized the hotel is not actually on the beach (my own fault for not reading the details properly). I had a view over Waikiki beach and lots of adjacent buildings (room2162). The room was a touch on the small size for a Sheraton but by no means cramped. It has a flat screen TV, a large safe and a fridge. Floor to ceiling windows face east (with slider onto a balcony with two chairs and a table). The AC was quiet and efficient (a big plus) with a digital thermostat. The bathroom was looking a little tired (about 20 yrs since the last refit if I had to guess). THE LOCATION: You cant beat the location for shops and nearby restaurants. The hotel is right across from the Westin (which is on the beach). Now for the service: on checkin I was asked if I wanted to take advantage of my Platinum late checkout. Unfortunately the latest they could check me out was 2pm. The clerk checking me in did suggest she could request another room for me to move to in the morning if I could come down at 11am. I won't bore you with the details, but this led to a series of service fiascos resulting in my losing much of my only day on the island by trying to sort things out on my room. On the plus side, I did talk with the manager on duty and explained what had happened and he was EXTREMELY accommodating (thank you). My advice, if you have a problem, bring it to the attention of the manager. This is supposed to be a category 5 Sheraton but it's more like a 3 or 4 in my opinion. Even so, the hotel offers rooms at great value and is a stone's throw from Waikiki beach. On that basis it's good value and worthy of 4 stars. NOTE: Waikiki beach area is not quiet at night. If you are a light sleeper you may want to stay somewhere else - I was kept awake all night by sirens from emergency vehicles speeding up and down the road outside. SPG Platinum tip: ask them to waive the resort fee, almost everything in it is included in your Platinum status other than breakfast.","Boston, Massachusetts",131,4.0

The beds were comfortable (the foam pillows were great) and the shower had good water pressure. We were in a tower room with a nice view from the patio that we really did not use much. The stay at one eat at all was very nice for us. We ate dinner at the other Starwood hotels and charged to our room. The chairs they lend at the pool were very nice. We put them in the car and visited beaches at other locations on the island when we wanted a stop on our drives. If you want to stay in town the beach is a really short walk from the hotel. We went for a quick dip one afternoon and found the way quickly. The breakfast buffet was fine with a fresh eggs station and lots of fresh fruit. We booked the 35 off rate which was really great for dining since we got a discount on the restaurants as well.

We booked the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani so we could splurge in other areas of the trip but the savings were not worth the lost sleep and additional stress. We will not stay at this property the next time we visit Oahu.The Good:Most of the staff (other than front desk) was friendly and demonstrated the Spirit of Aloha that makes Hawaii so special.Lobby, pool, and grounds are very nice.This property is centrally located and you can walk to most hot spots in Waikiki Beach.The Bad:Although check-in time is 3:00 our room was not ready until after 6:00 PM. We arrived about 3:00 PM and were told our rooms were not ready. We were not the only ones as there were several groups in the bar area waiting for their rooms as well. For our trouble we were provided one free drink each and breakfast the next day.The rooms can be extremely noisy. We had room 715. This room is next to the elevator lobby and the noise level made it very difficult to sleep (I would compare it to being next to a highway at rush hour). We were also awakened each morning by trucks beeping as they backed into the loading dock below.The front desk staff continually expressed they were sorry for the inconvenience but never took any action to correct our room problem. When we went to the front desk about moving to another room because of the noise were told that they would not know what would be available until morning and to check back then.

The front of desk staff were very helpful when we asked them to help us confirm a trip we a local tour operator and when changing money. We didn't eat in the restaurant but we did have cocktails by the pool most days. There was pineapple tasting every day. The pool looked quite small, but it was never crowded and we always had a sun lounger. Every night at 6pm there was traditional entertainment by the poolside. We sat on our balcony with a pre-dinner drink listening to the music and watching the dancers before heading out to eat.The hotel is really well located for the beach, the International Market Place, the bus stop to Diamond Head (don't book a tour - much cheaper to do it yourself - entrance fee is only $1!), shops, restaurants and bars.The only negative point i would mention is the presence of ""working ladies"" on the corner by the entrance of the hotel at night.

Otherwise, if you want to save some money but have a great location and average room then choose the Sheraton Princess.The Sheraton Princess has an awesome location. You will be right in the middle of everything (the beach, shopping, restaurants), but you will also have the noise at night until about 1am while you are trying to sleep. It's not just road noise, it includes a steel drum band, random Hawaiian music, people laughing, etc. The lobby and pool is shabby with no frills. It's obviously dated and needs an update. The pool is small and has plastic lounge furniture, but the attendants are very friendly. I am a gold starwoods member so I was upgraded to a corner deluxe tower room (Thank God!). My room (25th floor) was large with 2 windows, incredible view and dated but clean furnishings. My friends stayed in an adjacent room that was dark and had a large wall on the balcony blocking much of the view of the ocean. Also, the bathrooms need an update.

The bathroom was really the only part of the room id say maybe was a little outdated. the breakfast buffet is like 20 bucks or more per person but theres plenty of places to eat right around there.

No pool floats were allowed to be used in the pool which was worrying when the pool was 8 meters deep at one end and young kids who can't swim were in the pool. The pool also closed very early. In a beach resort area, I would expect that the pool would stay open later than 6pm. The whole pool area also needs a huge face lift and the size of the pool should be increased significantly.","Sydney, Australia",9,3.0

The pool seemed a little small for the size of the hotel however it was fairly quiet in the pool during our stay. Check in was seemless in fact the gentleman upgraded us to a room with a KIng Sized bed and staff were professional. My only gripe was an over efficious receptionist who would not loan me a scale at 10pm at night to weigh my bags for the flight home suggesting that I needed to bring all my suitcases down. A small tip to the porter solved my problem in a hearbeat and I was happily carrying my scale back up to my room.,"Sydney, Australia",47,3.0

We had previously stayed twice at the Sheraton Waikiki but due to its makeover and extreme price rise we looked for a cheaper alternative and came across the PK which stood out due to its combination of location and reasonable pricing. Upon arrival at the hotel we lined up in the lane which stated for 'gold SPG members' which my father was we were ushered to the desk however shortly after we're rudely asked to join the end of the line asaff our membership was not as per that express lane demanded. We then re-entered the line.up with it consisting of only one other person and after a short wait were ushered again to the front desk via the same lady. Her rudeness and short temper originally were unnecessary and UNderstandable if the line were long.. however in this situation were silly and weren't needed. We were apprehensive of staying here due to the fact we never had and had read reviews of its inferiority to such hotels we had stayed at before and After this first incident our fears appeared to be confirmed. However, we took a deep breathe and continued Onto our room which were 2 High ocean view rooms. Which I believe we're rooms 28.26 connecting. Upon arrival they were extremley clean and light and had a magnificent view comparable. Even better than that of the Sheraton beachfront WaikikI. Over the almost three weeks we stayed there we came across beautiful and caring staff which made our holiday feel more like being at home. Being there for Christmas the Christmas dining was lovely and the entertainment enjoyable. We had a few rude staff experiences during the time. However the staff which were accommodating and brilliant overturned such bad experiences for example our wonderful maid and terrific bar and pool staff. The location is ultimitley a winner... a small leisurely walk to the beach and close to all the shopping Waikiki has to offer which was convieniant as myself and my three younger sisters(13-17 years old) would go by ourselves and shop whilst our parents relxed It is safe for teenagers to be by themselves', contrary to some commentsI recommend you rent a car and explore the island yourselves, visiting for our fifth time having a car allows us each time to discover something new and wonderful from this island and with free parking included in the resort fee this saves a lot of money. As you are not needed to tip a staff member to valet park. Overall happy experience. We are returning the 4th of December this year 2012 for three weeks.

He said that the hotel hasn't had smoking for 3 yrs. He told me they having smoking spaces outside the hotel for my convience. For my convience would be directly in my hotel room to smoke when I want. I do know & understand that Hawaii has a smoking ban in place for the last 3-5yrs, but hotels state they have rooms available. This manager tried to make everything a personal matter.

We stayed for two nights being 07/10/12 & 08/10/12. Our first disappointment was that apparently the booking made by our travel agent only guaranteed us ""a room"" but not a particular ""type of room"" so, although we'd request a low floor due to a dislike of lifts, and twin beds due to not being a couple, we were originally allocated a room with a King Size bed on the 16th Floor! And it took much frustration and debate with a staff member to have it changed.We found the rooms to be clean and tidy but old style - more of Australian Motel style rather than Hotel style. I begrudged the not-optional $18 fee a day. It gave us unlimited Wi-Fi, but if you had no need for Internet, you are paying $18 for two bottles of water a day. It also allegedly gave us 1 hour of international calls, however we were unable to make that work until we'd obtained instructions from the Concierge. We were also unable to use the room TV until the Concierge gave us instructions and a Channel List for that.

If given this option again, I would not choose it over the others in the area. Let's start with the drop off/parking situation. No valet and no permission to leave your car in the drop off circle during check in...very rude and inconvenient. During peak check in, there was nobody manning (or even WATCHING) the SPG premier line area that had three signs posted for premiers to ""wait here""...while newly arriving customers kept getting helped at the other end of the counter. The manager on duty barely seemed to care (""thanks for pointing it out"" but no apology), leaving the signage in place without manning the premier check-in spot and he could easily have offered to get my luggage delivered to the room rather than make me schlepp around like a goat herder between parking garage, drop off circle and check-in desks. I've stayed here several years before and was hoping that some of the $6B Sheraton rehab dollars would have been spent here... nope, not a penny from what I can see. Room counters and bathrooms are at least 30 years old and the furnnishings aren't too much more recent. Breakfast buffet...why should we leave a fine-dining size tip (which is recommended! on the check starting at 15%!!) for a self-serve buffet!!! The cold coffee is already in a jug on the table, along with the sun-warmed creamer packs, and the juices are all self-serve as is the food. The only thing the server does is put the check -- that was handed to you by the hostess before seating -- into a folio. And obtw, there is also a cashier being paid to serve the point of sale function at the front of the restaurant. How many employees does it take to justify a $25 breakfast that comes free for elite loyalists at most other Sheratons around the globe? Speaking of perks, the ""resort fee"" includes everything that an SPG Platinum would get for free anyway, but they can now charge you for it by using a different name. Dont ask for a late check out either...that requires management decision even though it's supposed to be an automatic perk. Every employee in a management/deputy position should stay at a real Sheraton and learn from it...I will probably cancel my upcoming reservation to stay here again unless these issues are truly addressed... the game here needs to be raised a lot more before I will return.","Riverside, California",691,2.0

Next night I realized my night cream was gone.. I swore the maid stole but 2 days later we get a call from the manager stating that the maid broke it, they offered to pay for it IF I decided to replace it.. Sure let me take a $20 cab ride to Longs.. No thanks! So i suggested that they credit us for it instead and they gave us free breakfast buffet coupons instead..

The front desk staff was pleasant and my room was upgraded to a beach view. Very nice touch...except the room is next to the elevator. The room is old, the carpet is dirty and the bathroom should be gutted. There is no stopper in the sink - great opportunity to lose contact lenses. The bathroom only has a shower, which is fine, with a shower seat. So dirty it is disgusting to look at!

We were upgraded to a wonderful pool view and actually can see a sliver of ocean view. Didn't expect this upgrade and VERY VERY GLAD to get this upgrade because the room was JUST PERFECT!!! On top of this, What A SURPRISE to find a bucket of ice with a bottle of champagne and 2 wine glasses in the room, compliment from the G.M.!!! WOW, my husband and I were SO THRILLED that the hotel did this and made our 2 nights kick-off stay in HNL something that we will not forget!!! The room that we were given is in Princess Wing. Due to our plane flying out late from HNL to LAX, we needed to have a room that allowed us to have a late check out. Since the room that we were upgraded is a popular room, we were not granted a late check out the night before our departure even though I am a SPG Gold Plus member but were told we can switch to a room that has king size bed which will not work for 4 of us. Anyway, on the day of departure, I decided to approach the SPG member desk and spoke to the girl at the front about the possibility of getting a late check out at 4 pm. She went into the back room to check with her manager. Another SURPRISE is that she came out from the back room and told us that we were allowed to switch to another room but is a king bed and able to stay till 4 pm. THIS IS SO AWESOME!!! We are SO APPRECIATIVE & THANKFUL of how this is handled instead of just offering us a hospitality room to be used but gave us a room to stay for the 4 hours and it made a lot of difference to our plans that day as we can take it easy before heading out to our late flight out especially with a 2 years old who needed a nap in the afternoon !!! Definitely, I would come back to SPK again because this is the only hotel that we stayed thus far that willing to do above and beyond to make this wedding anniversary trip with 2 young kids such a memorable one and seamless!!!Kudos to the G.M. and the entire team in SPK!!!!!","Irvine, California",71,5.0

After reading some of the reviews here, I just had to write. This hotel is value-priced right as it is right in the middle of ALL the action in Waikiki, including being right across the street from Waikiki Beach. For about $140/night, you can be right where you need to be -- in the middle of everything that is going on in Waikiki, including being right next door to the International Marketplace. You could stay at the Royal Hawaiian, right down the street, at $400/night if you want the best, but for the rest, this the P.K. is the best. You're not in the room much anyway, so who cares about the size of the room. If you've ever gone on a cruise, you know what I mean. The room is for sleep and shower. For the price, you are right in the heart of Oahu, and this is where we put our money to stay every time we are there (over 20 times). We love the P.K. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and they aim to make the stay as nice as Apple Pie.As a matter of fact, we stayed at another hotel last year (Miramar) and it was no where near to our favorite of the Princess Kaiulani. We actually went over the the P.K. to use their pool and eat breakfast as it is one of our favorite places to say in Hawaii.

As a Starwood Preferred Guest, I got a a special discount so went with a full ocean view room. What a view!

It is located one block from Waikiki beach near the Duke statue and is next to the International Market. The parking garage is in the rear and parking is included with the resort fee. It is a full service hotel with a nice pool, restaurants, bars, nightly entertainment, a Polynesian show, fitness center and internet lounge. The rooms are compact but we spent most of the time on the lanai with the beautiful view of Waikiki beach, ocean, Diamond Head, central mountains and downtown Waikiki in view. We really liked the bedding and sleeped well every night. The hotel is on the main Waikiki road, so there is some evening noise, mainly street musicians, but it dies down around 11pm.

I am a former ""local girl"" who knows her way around the island, and has seen a hawaiian beach more than once, so I didn't necessarily need a ocean view, or ocean front type property. Plus, since this was an unexpected death in the family, we were on a budget. I chose the SPK as it was close to Diamond Head Mortuary, and the relatives I was visiting near Hawaii Kai, and the price was right. Also, the resort fee ($18) included parking fee which is cheap for Waikiki. Our flight was delayed into Hawaii so we didn't check in until 1am. I had a reserved a standard double bed room. We were put in Room 315 which was just the smallest room ever. Really dinky. Room receives 2 stars. There were twin beds - who still does that? The twin bed was comfy (one star). A small table which was overcrowded with the coffee pot, brochures, and a pen. Exactly 2 towels. The room was so small that my sister and I had to sit on our twin beds to stay out of the way of each other. I couldn't believe this was a Sheraton room. I felt like our room was an afterthought. Kind of like a storeroom or closet that was converted. Or a room that the nanny or the kids would stay in. Wish the flatscreen TV worked. It took up half of the small wall. We didn't ask to move. My sister said by the time we repack everything we would be leaving hawaii anyway. The gym was okay. Overlooks the pool. No AC. There are precors and treadmills and a small selection of weights. The resort fee includes a parking space in the secured covered garage, 2 water bottles daily in your room, pool towels, and chairs to take to the beach. SPK will send over twice a day water and fruit to a certain designated area on the beach. Cool idea but we took our chairs and towels to the beach area in front of the Sheraton Moana.

This hotel is in an EXCELLENT location with superior views and immediate access to shopping and dining in town. The staff is amazing here and I really enjoyed the pool area. I signed up for their 'club' and received a coupon for a free maitai at the pool bar, which was delicious. They had live entertainment in the pool area that was fun.The GOOD about the room- the VIEW. The lanai is HUGE and we had a gorgeous view of the beach and pool area. So beautiful! Pay the extra charge for a view here- completely worth it.The bed was comfortable and the room included a mini fridge and microwave.The not so good: a TINY BATHROOM and the room and hallways of this hotel are seriously outdated. Well maintained, but old. This hotel would get five stars from me with a little decor updates.The resort fee includes use of pool chairs and towels you can check out and take to the beach. They also deliver water and fresh fruit TO THE BEACH for hotel guests. WOW... MOST IMPRESSED was using the 'hospitality suite'. We had to check out HOURS before our flight left, so spent the day on the beach. They allowed us to use a room for an hour to shower and get ready for our flight before our shuttle arrived. What amazing service! Thank you Sheraton!","Eugene, Oregon",33,4.0

The resort package includes parking which with some free drinks is a deal and the clue is to explore how the HIGHEST parking decks lead in to elevators in the buildings making getting in and out a snap.

We didn't really have any problems with the hotel at all. The rooms are a bit outdated but a lot of hotels in Hawaii are like that. The beds are very comfortable though. The walls are paper thin, the last night was tough falling asleep with all the noise from above us.Also didn't have our room cleaned one of the days which was weird and bottled water wasn't brought to our room for 2 days in a row so had to call down to get some.We have a room on the 4th floor over the pool and it was a great location. We could see the performers on the stage in the evenings and hear the music from there. It was nice to sit on there and enjoy the atmosphere. The pool doesn't have many spots that you can sit in the shade if you wanted to. The pool seemed to get really busy after lunch as well. The staff at the Big Kahuna? (place to get towels) just seemed to be over staffed (3 staff to hand out towels). Seemed to stand around and talk a lot in their hut but didn't really clean the surrounding pool area. I haven't been to Hawaii in a few years so not sure if this is standard now but no tubes or air mattresses were allowed in the pool. The only thing allowed were water wings for kids and life jackets. So lots of parents that brought little tubes for their kids to push them around in were disappointed. The resort fee of $18 a day is a bit steep if you aren't using the parking service that is included in that. It does cover internet, 2 bottles of water daily, and beach service (water/fruit) brought to you at Waikiki beach twice a day which is nice when you are there. Although if you take in the pool for the day no water bottles are offered to you there.We were able to use the hospitality suite (which was nice to use)to shower after we had checked out of our room as we had a night flight.It was also nice to have entertainment at the hotel daily, also other activities throughout the day which other hotels do not have.

One of the things that spoilt it was someone was smoking on the floor above & the cigarette ends landed on our balcony, the smell was also unpleasant when trying to get some fresh air. Great bed/linen, slept really well. Had a couple of issues, no coffee/water left a couple of days. Can't understand there only being enough coffee to make 3 cups, surely if there are 2 people in a room it would make more sense to leave enough for 4 cups ( a cup each in the morning/night). We had the same problem that a lot of people seem to have, we arrived after a long flight & were not able to get into the room for several hours. It would have been helpful if the receptionist would have given us some idea of where we could wait, thankfully the Rock Island Cafe across the road made us feel very welcome.The 'resort fee' instructions could have been highlighted clearer, we didn't realise just what a good deal this was.

I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member so I booked this hotel through SPG assuming this was a sign this hotel was of a decent standard! Much to my dismay the entire hotel appears to have been swept up in some kind of time warp, walking in here is like taking a time machine back to the sixties... Worn and out of date decor abound as far as the eye can see, and sadly not even the service can compensate you as that is even worse!From the time I arrived to drop my luggage staff were overworked and offhand. My bags were stored but the line for the front desk was so huge I didn't even want to approach staff to advise that I had arrived and see if there was any possibility of an early check in. I figured this must have just been an odd busy moment for the hotel, so left with the intention of returning later in the day when things were quieter. When I returned at 630pm to check in I still had to line up and wait for at least ten minutes to see a staff member about check in. The staff were downright rude and disinterested, and I was shocked at how many extra taxes were charged in addition to the advertised room rate, paying a ""Resort Tax"" is appalling especially when you are only staying for one night and you don't use the pool or the car-parking at all! I was given my keys and told where to go, but no-one showed me to my room or properly explained how to get there, so I wandered around for a while before I managed to find it. The room was like stepping back in a time machine, worn and shabby furnishings and a horrible bathroom, it is plain to see this hotel in its entirety is crying out for a major refurbishment. For the price you pay versus the quality of this accommodation, it is highway robbery and an absolute joke! Not to mention the exchange rates in the hotel! The gym was a sectioned off part of what looked like the banquet hall area, and was not even air-conditioned making it a totally unpleasant place to be. The only vague positive was that the beds were comfortable...Given the price paid there are too many other fantastic options in Waikiki, I stayed at The Modern on my last night which was amazing especially by comparison.

The point being I have been familiar with the islands for some years now and several of the hotels in the Waikiki area as well.]This was my wife’s first visit to Hawaii and we stayed here from June 3 (Sunday) till checkout on June 8th (Friday) as part of a multi-island anniversary trip. I had booked this trip through Pleasant Holidays online on the Sheraton/SPG Website. Rather than pay a heavier price for one of the other SPG hotels on the beach, I opted to save money and stay here at the Princess Kaiulani. I had read Trip Advisor reviews prior to booking and was amazed that some people complained about the location of this hotel to the beach. Again, having lived here for over 6 years I knew this was CLOSE to the beach and also adjacent to the Hyatt Regency, Kalakaua Avenue (The main street in Waikiki) and the International Market place. I knew the rooms were going to be a bit older, but again, for the money and the Sheraton name, this was fine with me. When we arrived we were upgraded one level so instead of a city view with no balcony, we were given a city view with a balcony. I didn’t even ask, we were just given it. The room was adequate, the bedding fantastic, and the only complaint about the room was the air conditioning unit which was older. That is, it and could have worked better and could have been cleaner. Again, for a prime location in the heart of Waikiki, this didn’t bother me much. As far as service, maid service was spotty for the first three days. They kept forgetting toiletries and towels. This was finally remedied during the last two days. I did read on Trip Advisor that someone complained about the glasses being dirty and yes that happened to us. With the exception of one staff member, everyone was very cheerful and helpful, bell boys, desk staff, etc. The pool staff was extremely helpful and polite. The one staff member that I had a problem with was a hostess at the restaurant. We received two complementary cocktails and I went to get them while we were at the pool. The coupons gave the name of the bar as one thing, and the sign on the bar by the pool said another. So I asked the hostess at the restaurant and she condescendingly rolled her eyes pointed towards the bar by the pool and said “at the Bar” rather rudely. Again, the rest of the staff was fine. Not only is the hotel in great spot, but they also have an area near the famous Duke Kahanamoku statue were they bring you Fruit, and water. You can also get beach chairs at no cost. I’ve also read complaints about paying the resort fee however, the free in-and-out parking alone is worth the fee and you also receive free wireless access. Again, the complaints about the hotel’s proximity to the beach and the resort fee are really unfounded, just look at the map. For the price, this is a very good bargain and I suggest that you strongly consider it when planning a Waikiki stay. Mahalo for taking time to read my review.","Brownsburg, Indiana",101,4.0

When we got there my wife was sick so we stayed in the room the first night, in this room the safe didnt work and the plumbing leaked and when the wind blew the sliding door rattled. The next morning we went to reception and asked for a room with water views we were told that this room was a water view room but after checking we were moved to the other side to the 12th floor which had water and beach views however the plumbing in this room leaked worse the plug in the bath didnt fit, the door to the bathroom didnt close the balcony was dirty the room wasnt cleaned properly daily and in the lift lobby on our floor there was a half drunk drink on the table that sat there for 4 days. Downstairs the main walkways ran through the buffet so you had to dodge people with plates and vise versa, birds regularly flew in and helped themselves to food from the buffet. The pool regularly closed early and on one occasion clossed at 5.30pm just as we were getting back to the hotel from a day trip. They say they have a beach service with chairs and water and fruit service on the beach not once did we see this service and we had to carry our own chairs to the beach which were just little fold out chairs you sat on the sand.

Tjis may sound trival, but it mattered after 14hours of travel.We were upgraded to a new room in the new tower the next morning. I was very pleased with the service and accomodation the manager made for us. We then received the master suite on our last night at the hotel.Overall, the price and location is fantastic if you want to be in the thick of the action and across the street from the beach. I recommend staying in the newer tower. If you're looking for luxury- this isn't the place for you.

The outdated air conditioning system left my room perpetually toasty (it didn't help that I was on the top floor, so heat rises...), and the rusty bathroom fixtures were pretty unsightly. The gym had nice equipment, but the room was nearly unusable because it was not air conditioned. A few circulating fans were on, but it was not enough even at 5:30 in the morning. On the plus side, the bed was very comfortable with a soft, plush duvet, and if you are a Starwood Preferred member then they keep the room stocked with free bottled water. The fridge was also a fairly nice size, making it convenient to store some beverages and snacks from the ABC store across the street. I paid a conference rate of $140 a night and wouldn't pay a dime more to stay here.

Let me start by saying that I have stayed at some very inexpensive hotels on occasion and I don't expect perfection, but this was the shabbiest room I've ever seen. I stayed at this hotel for four nights in March in a room on the 7th floor. The hotel was apparently fully booked at the time and I was told they couldn't give me a room at the standard check-in time. I was given a hospitality room for a couple of hours until a room became available. So much for a guaranteed check in time, but not too big a deal. Of course, all hotel rooms need to be re-furbished from time to time. Sometimes the furnishings or decor of a room may be somewhat worn. That's to be expected. However, this room was a mess. Take a look at the photos. The furnishings weren't just worn, they were worn out. The room wasn't just overdue for renewal, it was years overdue. Interestingly, housekeeping was doing a good job of dusting and vacuuming. I guess there wasn't much they could do with the black mold in the bathroom and the disgusting stuff on the shower head and hose, but the tub and floor were clean. Since the photos speak for themselves I won't describe in detail the shabby condition of this room. I'm sure that they must renew their rooms at some point but I would never trust this hotel for a stay again.There are many decent hotels that give good value in Waikiki and I've stayed at several. This is not one of them.","Vancouver, Canada",56,2.0

My flight was delayed by 8 hours, so I got in with my rental car at 3am. When I drove in front of the hotel, I was told by an employee I couldn't stop there, even to check in. I had to go park around back. So I drive around back, and find it's a parkade. With the elevators locked up for the night. The only stall available was on the 4th floor, so I had to haul myself, 2 bags of luggage, and my 3 year old down 3 flights of stairs!! I was NOT happy. When I get to the front desk, I'm angry and mention it, and the desk clerk shrugs at me. Next, my husband had already been there for 2 weeks. The room only had a double bed, so he requested to upgrade to a bigger room. No go. The desk clerk informs me the hotel was not informed myself and my son were coming. They certainly were informed. When I ask for a cot for my son, I was told the room is too small for a cot, but for a fee, I can get extra pillows and linens so my son can SLEEP ON THE FLOOR!! You want me to pay for my son to sleep on the floor? What a joke. The room is right next to the elevators, so we listen to that all night. Calls to the front desk go unanswered. I went to the activities desk and asked for toddler friendly tours. The guy gives me a map, and highlights how to walk to the zoo. Thanks.Then the icing on the cake was when I went to the restaurant for dinner. I walk in, ask if there is a kids menu. Yes, I am told, there is. The waitress says she'll bring one right over. 10 mins later, no menu ( the place is mostly empty). I get up, walk to where 4 servers are standing doing nothing, and ask for the menus.

This time when I booked it, i automatically booked with pool view. Sitting out on the lanai (balcony) is a Hawaiian experience in itself especially in the evening with the little Hawaiian band downstairs... The hotel does need a ""new look"" its alittle dated but just the rooms and especially hallways but it still wouldnt stop me from staying there. Its very clean, spacious rooms and a very ALOHA ambiance. I recommend this hotel as the best hotel in Waikiki beach if you cannot stay right on the ocean. Also, check in was at 3;00pm, we got in super early and explained it was our honeymoon and they let us have an early check in. Staff was great as well... two thumbs up and a big A+ for ALOHA!!!!

It is conveniently located less than a minute walk from the beach (as you certainly would not want to use the pool unless you are the type to go to the tropics and swim in fresh water when you can just do that at the Holiday in Toledo... but I digress) You have to keep in mind that no matter where you go in Honolulu (especially Waikiki) it's just another American city located in very beautiful setting. Expecting to ""unwind"" is unreasonable with the clanking dishes of restaurants located near pools and thousands soaking up the rays on the beach.

This is one of the better priced hotels for this area of Waikiki. The rooms are clean and well maintained, but most furniture needed to be updated at least 5 years ago.While we fully understand that ""check in is not until 3"" is a fair policy, and we appreciated the front desk completing our paperwork upon arrival at about 1:30 PM; waiting until exactly 3:00 PM to start releasing rooms (and making everyone stand back in line to get keys) makes the process go very slowly. Since every room does not get cleaned simultaneously, releasing rooms as they are finished would make us and the front desk all have a better arrival day.The location is very central in Waikiki and beach assess is very simple. The pool and patio dining area is very straightforward, clean and comfortable. I am surprised this hotel does not have a hot tub pool.We did not eat any meals on property, even though we were there for 5 nights. We generally look for more interesting choices than hotel food.Suggestions for travelers:If you have a car, drive to the top of the parking garage. The only elevator access from parking is on the top two parking floors, on the beach side of the garage. Every other part of the garage is accessed by stairs only.Also, this hotel has the largest in-rooms safes I have seen in 20 years, since the days of key safes. We were able to leave more stuff, than usual, securely in our room.Since we had a good idea of what we were getting and picked this Sheraton for value and location; we would gladly stay here again.

I came back around 3pm to check in and it went downhill from there. The line to check in was about 20 deep so I used the Gold Preferred line. I ironically got to deal with Celeste again. She asks"" how can I help you?"" I said I'd like to check in and she rudely says ""I know that, I checked you in earlier"". She then proceeds to tell me I have to go to the end of the other line because my Gold card is invalid. She then says OK, I will take care of this and proceeds to call Starwood and right in front of me says "" I have an individual with an invalid card trying to check in, will you verify the number?"" Of course the number is good so about 20 mins later she proceeds to check me in. The room she gave me was awful. Smelled of mold and very outdated. Looks nothing like the pictures posted on their website. I called down for a room change and they said no problem, we will send a new room key right up. 30 mins later i call back down to see whats taking so long and they had no idea what I was talking about.

It has a gorgeous open lobby adjacent to the very nice pool with lush landscaping and a nice bar and restaurant serving buffet breakfasts and dinner. We really enjoyed the pool and pool area after a morning on the beach. Please note that all Waikiki hotels have small pools, not what you will see in other vacation destinations. That being said, this is definitely one of the nicest - and we've stayed around Waikiki in previous years.The resort fee is $18 per day and with this we got free local calls, 60 minutes long distance calls per day, 2 bottled waters daily, free wi-fi (a bit spotty at times), a free child buffet with a paying adult, and free parking. I may be missing a thing or two. The fee is mandatory, but we certainly found value in it with parking alone. Our room was very clean. I will admit I was a bit disappointed at first with the bathroom which could perhaps use an update. After the first day, however, I didn't give it another thought. The rooms are just a teeny tiny bit outdated, but nothing to bother yourself with. We (my husband, 4-year-old and I) were quite comfortable there and found there was plenty of room for us. The bed and bedding were heavenly and housekeeping did a wonderful job each day. The walls featured lovely hawaiian floral artwork, and the television was a nice sized flat screen with ample cable, including Showtime. We're not terribly picky, but do feel we have reasonable - high standards and so I'm a bit surprised by the negative commentary in other reviews. This is Hawaii people - lighten up! Don't expect a Sheraton on the islands to mirror one in LA or NY - its just totally different, but great!A very large safe was available for use in the room, as was a nice sized fridge. Both free. The east wall was all glass, with 2 open sliding doors leading out to the balcony which had 2 chairs and a table. Lovely. Please note that the odd numbered rooms in this building (pool main building) do not appear to have balconies. All others in the 3 building do appear to have them.I will admit I was a bit hesitant to book based on mixed reviews. However, after staying here I see no reason to ever stay anywhere else - and I have stayed at 5 star hotels in Waikiki before. The location is perfection, right in the middle of everything without ever feeling anything but relaxed as she is set back just a bit. While some say she could use a facelift, I completely disagree.

We got married in a Sheraton hotel at home in Ireland and it was fabulous and as part of the Starwood group we were expecting a lovely hotel and great service. We arrived after a very long flight and the person at the check in barely looked at us, started having a conversation with someone else before we finished checking in, ignoring any questions I had about wifi etc and basically looking annoyed he even had to deal with us. No congratulations on being there on honeymoon (though we realise the amount of people on honeymoon in Hawaii) but a welcome or hi how are you would have been lovely. Starwood Group had said we would get an upgraded on checkin, but if our room was the upgrade I wouldn't like to see the others. Positives about the room were that the bed was comfortable and clean and we had a balcony with a nice view of the town though noisy at night. The downside was the room is in really bad need of refurbishment, cupboards off their hinges, extension leads lying around the place, bath not working (despite sending someone up to fix it, it still didn't work), grubby and worst of all it had a connecting door to the room next door so we could hear everything from our neighbours. We had booked a smoking room, though only one of us smokes and only ever outside but on arrival my husband went out on the balcony, closed the bedroom door and had a cigarette. The next day there was a phonecall reminding of us of no smoking, absolutely that's fair enough, though it wasn't inside and we haven't been able to figure out how they saw this, it remains a mystery. My husband from then on went downstairs outside the hotel to have a cigarette, though he smokes few and far between. On check out the manager tried to charge us $300 for smoking in the room that morning, claiming housekeeping had seen signs of smoking. This is an absolute con. We had been out since 7 that final morning, came back at 12 and housekeeping had not even been in the room. There was no apology or backtracking on their behalf, all but one of the staff we encountered was rude and the breakfast!!!! $24,99 per person, for a below average buffet, outdoor seating, with pigeons and birds walking on all the tables and on the plates and cutlery which is disgusting. The staff here need a good lesson from starwood on customer service. We will never get another honeymoon, and they really put a dampner on our whole trip, when it can so easily be avoided.

I had contacted the hotel to see about upgrading our room for our honeymoon. They said they made a note of it and when we arrived we were upgraded to a balcony room (originally we apparently did not have one). It was a mountain view, but still nice to be able to sit outside in the mornings and evenings. To our surprise, they also brought up a bottle of champagne and some fruits and other goodies to congratulate us!The pineapple carving demo was fantastic. He had a long line and it was the best pineapple i've ever had. The crafters that set up are also pretty cool to check out.My husband and I developed a daily routine of heading out to the beach, coming back to the pool for happy hour (waitress Debbie was the best!), then heading in to get cleaned up and venture out for the night. We did the breakfast buffet twice, but didn't sit down there to eat. Instead we did the to go box and ate on the balcony. The first time we both paid and had our own boxes, but found that was way too much food. The next time my husband went down and just made us box that we shared. Another perk to staying here is the beach service. Each day (as long as you use the provided beach towel so they can find you) you will get water brought to you out at the beach if you lay out near the duke statue. It was very refreshing. They also had apples and oranges, which made for a great snack. The food we tried during happy hour was just ok, and breakfast wasn't bad. There are definitely better places locally though. About our room - it was small and outdated, but clean and served its purpose well enough. Our a/c never seemed to really get very cold at all and the screen was completely covered in dust so thick that no air could get through it. We ended up leaving that open and it worked a bit better, though not much. The bed was very comfortable though, as were the pillows. We didn't spend all that much time in our room, so it was fine for our needs.The gym was a great bonus for me and I used it a couple of mornings.

The usual facilities continue in place. The standard of servicing the rooms has slipped. It is not as speedy or complete as it used to be. The bedside table lamps did not work. The power cables lead behind the bed so it is impossible to see if they are plugged in or even whether there is a socket. Water flow in the shower is very slow and it was impossible to get water any hotter than warm.The biggest change however is the imposition of a COMPULSORY daily 'resort charge'.This $18 + tax per day charge covers a range of items from friendly/frustrating self parking to children eating free at the buffets as well as free bottled water at a specific location at the beach. Each of the various services has its own qualifications and limitations. These things might be fine for a family on a resort holiday but they are inappropriate for an older single traveller looking for a couple of nights rest & relaxation. When presented with the list of 'services' by the receptionist I went through it item by item and found not one of them could be used by me during my brief stay. ""Do you mean that even although I cannot use any of these 'services' I still have to pay for them?""""Yes.""At this point I felt the possible presence of the Mad Hatter perhaps lurking behind a potted palm. I looked around and there he was, directing guests to & from taxis and busses. As I walked across to the lift lobby I am sure I glimpsed a white rabbit disappearing behind a sofa.The receptionist had no discretion and suggested I speak to the Hotel Manager who happened to be present in the reception area.After a brief conversation & review of the electronic records, authorised I be excused from the charge.My conclusion is that this hotel is mostly interested in accommodating family groups on week long or longer resort holidays. The compulsory 'resort charge' is another financial punishment to the solo traveller, of any age. As hotel check in time does not commence until 3.00pm, many guests would not receive much benefit from the first days charge.","Sydney, Australia",42,3.0

All our questions were answered, suggestions were given and our tours picked up in front of the hotel or across the street.

Got 2 rooms on the 22nd floor and 1 room on the 28th and 1 king bed and 2 rooms with 2 doubles. Two of the couples were celebrating anniversaries so 2 rooms with king beds would have been nice.Also, the resort fee of $19/night/room showed on some sites and some books as optional. It is not optional so we paid an extra $400.00 (3 rooms x 7 days) for 2 bottles of water/day. The resort fee includes free parking (we did not have cars), free internet in rooms (we did not bring laptop and there is internet in the lobby) 2 free bottles of water/day and free towels for beach (we had own towels).

There are also a lot of free computers and free wi-fi in the hotel lobby. If you are coming here with the intention of sitting around the pool I wouldn't recommend it as the pool area is not that nice, but as a convenient base and a comfortable bed if you're out and about all day you can not go wrong. The biggest con for us was the massive queue on check-out and we had a flight to catch. A bus full of Japanese tourists had just arrived and instead of dealing with them as a group, they were getting checked in individually.

The air conditioning was kind of loud, but we got used to it. There wasn't a real restaurant, more of a bar, a buffet and a small appetizer menu. They had very good entertainment each night - hula dancers, great Hawaiian singers - something different each night. The pool was fine but there is no hot tub. You get free towels for the beach and sand chairs (which was nice). The pool people were very friendly and were a great resource for local attractions. The best part was the location.

I'm very seriously confused on how to proceed with with review because so much of what went wrong with the stay could not be controlled by the hotel itself but the property alone lends itself to some problems.Facts: Right off Waikiki beach (about a 2-3 minute walk at most). We took a cab from the airport and it was ~$25 (before tip). Cab to the Ala Moana shopping center ~$9-$12(before tip). Easy access to dining, ABC Stores (Like a very expensive Walgreen's...hint to those traveling with infants...bring enough diapers to get you through at least 24 hours. We paid $14 for 10 diapers at an ABC store), There is a grocery store (Food Pantry??) located on the next block behind the hotel. There is a small, but cold, refrigerator in the room which is a huge convenience.So, the good stuff first. The staff that we dealt with were pleasant and worked efficently to solve the problems that arose (more on that later). The location is excellent for dining, shopping and the beach. The hotel has beach towels/chairs available every morning and if you hunt down the PK guy while you are on the beach they will give you free water/ fruit - just show them your room key. The pool is a very simple area but is clean and there were plenty of chairs each day in sun or shade. We were in two different rooms during our stay (more on this later) and both of them were ""partial ocean view"" but I don't think a full ocean view upgrade could have been much better. The first room was 1771 in the Ainahau wing and is a corner room which gave us a great view of the oceam from the balcony. The second room we were in was 956. This was wonderful as well - a pool/ocean view. Next, the average stuff. The rooms were, as many reviews have described, dated. I found them to be clean, however. Things like the wallpaper peeling a bit or an older faucet on the shower didn't bother me. If you want the most up to date property, this isn't the one you are looking for. Next, the $18/day ""resort fee"". This was a bit of a rip off, IMO. I suppose if we had a car the entire time, it would have been a good value because it covers parking. It also covers one hour of local or LD telephone time but who uses a regular phone anymore? It covers a host of other things that we never took advantage of. Now the less than awesome. I should preface this by saying that there was very little (if anything) that the hotel could control about most of this. They handled my complaint as best they could. I wish that I had been aware of some of this before I made reservations - I may have changed my mind about staying here.There is absolutely NO wireless in the Ainahau tower. You have to use a network cable and the internet is SLOW. I sort of/kind of got a wireless connection in the looby but could never maintain it out by the pool. This was not my understanding - I was lead to believe when I called the property that the $18/day resort fee covered the wireless. Working was very frustrating. The first night we arrived around 8pm. There was music BLARING - I thought it was coming from our neighbors. It was very loud. Unfortunately, it wasn't the neighbors; it was coming from the street. Around 1am, I finally called the front desk, exhausted. They were very polite and told me that the cops had been called, the guy was supposed to quite down at 10pm but sometimes the cops had to come shut him down. The next night it wasn't singing that kept us up but the guy with the calpsyo drums. I went to the front desk and they moved our room to an ""inside"" room (#956) in the same tower for the next night. This happens frequently, obviously. tThey have an apology card preprinted and have a procedure on how you are moved. The noise is better from this room but there is a lounge singer from the hotel that goes until ~11pm. (I should also note that we were traveling with our infant so we were in our room earlier than we would normally be. If this were just me and my husband, the noise probably wouldn't have bothered me so much because I wouldn't have been in my room that early.)One of the last days we were there, the pool was closed due to ""organic contamination"". It was poop. There was poop in the pool. Again, nothing the property could do about it but...just....there was POOP in the POOL. They handled it well, though. So that's about it. Other than the bar, I never ate or drank anything at the hotel. It was normal, over-priced hotel food from what I could tell (we'd walk past the breakfast buffet everyday). I don't think I would stay at this property again simply beacuse I don't like the fact that I was on their schedule rather than my own....with the entertainment, the lounge singer, etc... It was impossible to just watch a sunset or read a book in the evening on the balcony. However, it's not nearly as awful as other reviews have made it sound. I'm completely ambivilent about this property.","Anchorage, Alaska",45,3.0

Very nice.I hate that you pay the resort fee, come on Sheraton sort this out!The room was just slightly old fashioned but clean and reasonably well appointed. Beds very comfy. I asked for a foam pillow to support my neck and they obliged me. They provide a small number of towels (this is budget remember not luxury). Bathroom are really quite old and small. Bath is ancient!! Service was reasonable, anything we asked for we seemed to get. We chose not to eat here because having had a few drinks, and realised they were poor quality, I didn't want to risk paying a lot for bad food. Now, if you have been to Hawaii or London or Paris or Rome, you will know that the hotels are very expensive, offer tiny rooms and often are old and tired. So you have to consider this is what Hawaii offers...i went tho see a room in the Sheraton Waikiki because I would like to stay somewhere with a new bathroom, well the baths were the same!! So, stay here if you are ok to be near the beach do not plan to eat there a lot and also don't mind not having proper beach service (i.e. umbrella and lounger provided), bear in mind you can hire sun loungers anyway.

You don't have to, but we find our room is always so much better when we come back and we really do appreciate those who clean up after us so we want them to know that :)STAFFMost times, the staff is nice and will go out of their way to help you or greet you at the least which we really appreciate. We noticed that since we are practically local (from the Big Island) most staff everywhere in Oahu are either very, very rude or just ignores us completely -- but we're glad this hotel is the exception and treats everyone equally.PARKINGThere is an elevator in the back side of the parking garage which you probably won't find right away. Depending on where your room is you might find it easier to park near the stairs. Unless you have a good amount of heavy luggage, this shouldn't be a problem. Elevators to your room floor is available from the lobby which is only steps from the parking garage.RESTAURANTI like the food here. It is typical Hawaii restaurant food though. We never expected a difference in price either. I'm guessing most people will consider the buffets expensive but again, this is usual. We'd rather walk a short way to the Cheesecake factory which is not a buffet but is delicious and less costly. But if you can afford it, why not? The only problem I see with the restaurant is that the buffet extends across the main walkway of the hotel so it has a feel of ""crossing the street"" to get your food. It also is uncomfortable as a guest passing by. We do like the live music during dinner though :)Choose this hotel if you're the reasonable type that would rather spend big bucks elsewhere but have a nice overall comfortable experience.","Hilo, Hawaii",11,4.0

I had read some of the reviews before I left and was a bit concerned about the hotel but it turned out very well. Loved the location so handy to everything and they provided beach chairs and towels for taking down to the beach and came down with water and fruit to a certain location on the beach twice a day as well. There was a resort fee of $18 a day but that included free parking, internet both in the room and computers to use in lobby and free long distance calls of 60 min a day. Had the best coffee in the room I have ever had and also had a small fridge which was very handy. The room itself was tired so don't expect it to be fancy. The bed was comfortable and the room was kept very clean but if you want your room to be perfect this is not the place for you. Also this hotel has rooms that overlook a parking garage so if you pay the lowest rate you may get a room with a very poor view.

My first ever stay at the Princess Kaiulani was a very nice experience. The hotel property is older, but a good value and, most importantly, the best location in town. The staff are all friendly and attentive. Rooms are a bit outdated though. I got a basic room with the back view (which I didn't really mind, because in my experience, the street view always comes with a big price - the street noise :-) and I used my room basically only to take a shower and get my 4-hrs overnight sleep). The Pikake restaurant is great (you must try their buffets, both breakfast and dinner - worth your money; my favourite was the dinner, of course, while you can enjoy a nice cocktail with the live entertainment next to the lovely pool). If I could suggest one area for improvement, that would be the internet service. I'm not sure whether that was just my bad luck, the bad timing, or my bad karma :-) , but I almost never had a smooth connection either in my room or in the hotel lobby. I was constantly cut off, had to try re-connecting every 2-3 minutes (that was annoying!) and the last 4 days, it was almost impossible to get through at any time (for that time, I was using the public internet access as places like outside cafés and restaurants).I must mention one person who totally stood out from the rest - that is the Tour & Activity/Concierge, Marsha. Her desk is right at the entrance to the property. Inspite of the ever-long line ups of people crowding at her desk, Marsha is an always friendly and smiling hard-working professional who is at any time ready to listen to you and give you her professional advice and direction. She is very patient, and she physically stands up and walks you around showing you practically what she tells you. I have booked a few activities using Marsha's help. Marsha is very knowledgeable about everything local; she is also a sophisticated world traveler herself (she's been on both sides), and she can related to all tourists' questions and concerns. She listens and helps. Once again, Marsha, a big mahalo to you for your help! :-) . Marsha and the rest of her hard-working colleagues made my stay a very comfortable experience at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani.

It was very pleasing to receive a lovely fruit basket on arrival. Paying the resort fee was also very helpful, we had to make some international calls and being able to do this it saved us a lot of money. The comfort of the bedding made for a restful sleep each night.I would like to thank Naomi at Concierge she needs to be commanded for her friendly personality and knowledge of the area its lovely to have good service.

I was only in town for 2 nights, so it was fine. I've stayed in Waikiki many times before at other places but got a great room/car deal with this hotel, so I decided to try it. A couple of things: I had a 'high ocean view' room on the 28th floor (29 being the highest floor) and I'd say those views should be categorized as 'partial ocean views', at best. The room was fine, relatively clean, had a mini-fridge, and it's an older hotel. The $18 daily resort fee was ok because it covered parking, which is at least $25/day anywhere else, beach service (chairs, water, fruit, etc.), bottled water in room, and internet. They said it included wi-fi but I could never find a signal on my iphone OR my laptop, so I had to use the wire. The hotel is centrally located and easy walking to anywhere in Waikiki. My advice, if you want an ocean view, pay extra and stay in an OCEANFRONT hotel. If you don't have a car, the daily resort fee isn't worth it, in my opinion. If you're planning to stay any length of time, you might want to try a privately owned apt - they are all over and very affordable. For short stays, this Sheraton is fine...I only wish they were a little more 'consistent' about their amenity descriptions.",North Carolina,116,3.0

My husband and I are frequent Waikiki visitors and have stayed at a variety of hotels from upscale to low-budget types. I was quite pleased with my overall experience. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful. I usually make my accommodation decisions based on the bedding. I was not disappointed. Great linens and comfy mattress. The room itself was clean. The air conditioniing could use a little updating. The a/c did not have a thermostat, so you had to choose between constant cool air or chance opening the balcony door. We were on a lower floor facing Kaiulani Ave., which just happens to be the gateway to the ever busy Kuhio Ave and between the late night owls, the delivery trucks, the shuttle busses....you probably couldn't sleep with the balcony door open. My advice, opt for one of the other 2 towers (3 towers in total). In the end, you couldn't beat the location. You are steps away from the Waikiki hotspots - The Beach, International Market Place, The Royal Hawaiian Shopping Centre, Restaurants (if you are on a budget-Subway and Burger King are right across the street). If you have ever been to Waikiki, you walk to get where you want to go and usually you end up walking more than you realize. So its nice to be in the centre of it all. I would recommend the hotel to those who are looking for a clean, comfy, budget friendly stay. Yes there are pigeons pool side and quite often joining you at the table, but that's Hawaii. When you begin to get annoyed remind yourself that you are in Hawaii! Should you get a chance, you have to walk to the Round Table behind the hotel. Best pizza ever!",Saskatoon,10,4.0

The balcony was to die for and the views were amazing! I felt comfortable walking around the room in my bare feet and also thought that Housekeeping did a great job of cleaning the room daily. The staff at the pool, the front desk, the bell desk, the concierge, and the banquet departments were top notch. I dropped some money off the balcony and I had two staff members helping me look for it for over 30 minutes! It meant a lot that they took the time to do this for me. The beach is a 3 minute walk, the International Market is right next door, and there are a lot of shopping options and restaurants very close by.

All night we heard what my partner thought was planes roaring overhead (which turned out to be the service elevators going up and down all night), as well as the ice machine clunking away on the other side of the wall. Also the bathtub was very shallow, which I suppose is irrelevant if you only shower. The bed itself was comfy enough, so that was the upside.

But we did have to pay an upcharge, but I was willing to so we didn't have to stay in the original room.The housekeeping was just ok. I don't think there was a lot of attention to detail but it was clean. The servers around the pool were great, very friendly, cheery and were excellent. they took the time to chat with you and were very customer service oriented. However the cleanliness around the pool was not great. We found chairs one morning and it was disgusting the amount of sunflower seed shells that were around the loungers.

We booked our trip through COSTCO. (highly recommend this as well as the Sheraton PK!) This was our first trip to Hawaii and the Sheraton PK added to the great memories we will cherish. We were located on the 6th floor pool view, with a peak of an ocean view. Our room was always clean and well kept. The breakfast was always a plenty. (kids 12 and under eat free w/ paying adult) The Hawaiian bands each night were always very pleasant to listen to. Being in the middle of the shopping district was also perfect for evenings out, although it does get crowded. The staff was always pleasant and helpful, and very professional. The kids loved making their own leis and bracelets, what great activities. The short walk to Waikiki Beach wasn't an issue at all. I would recommend saving your money to stay here instead of a ocean front hotel. Your money can be spent on exploring this beautiful island! it was nice that we could use sand chairs and towels from the hotel to bring to the beach. Save your luggage space and leave your towels at home! (we forgot ours and thought we'd be purchasing some, so it was a nice surprise) We couldn't really come up with any negatives about the Sheraton PK, but if I could change one thing it would be to leave the pool open for night swims (pool closes at 6pm) It would have been fun to let the kids swim while listening to the bands at night. Btw, the pool was also very clean. Each morning we would watch them clean the pool and wipe down all the lounge chairs. If you are a runner...run from the PK to the Diamond Head head entrance it's a great run! (approx 6ish miles out and back)The hills can get you, but the view at the top will have you forgetting the strain to get there. It's breath taking! Can't beat a morning run like this! The hotel has running/walking routes printed at the desk. Their gym is also very well kept if you decide to use it instead.

Hopefully a small portion of the $18. resort fee can be used to buy some fabric softener for the bath towels.......WOW! Like drying off with razor blades. Has no one else noticed this?

It is an older style, but clean with friendly staff. It does not have the over priced rates of the other hotels across the road but is in a great location. We had a pool view room on the 5th floor, my wife and I and our 4 year old really only used it to sleep and store all our bargain shopping, if you choose to go, then you would be crazy to want to stay in your room there is so much to do all day and night, every night. Parking is included with the hotel service fee, it worked well for us as we hired a car from Alamo from the airport for the 2 weeks were there, you need to hire a car to see the Island properly.The Cheese Cake Factory is only a 3 minute walk down the road and has great food, remember the serving sizes are larger than in Australia and on average for the 3 of us for either lunch or dinner it would cost around $50 to $60 including tips and DUKES across the road has good buffet type meals cheap.. Go to the Aloha stadium Markets for all your tourist type stuff it's huge, the international markets next to the hotel is o.k but you have to get an idea of prices. ABC stores are everywhere in Waikiki, they sell everything from alcohol to toothpaste and pretty good prices. The Round Table Bar just down from the hotel do great pizza as well. We went to a luau at Paradise Cove, it was a great night, next time we go back we might try the Polynesian Cultural Centre. It is allot more expensive than Paradise Cove and allot further away towards the North Shore.Ala Moana shopping complex is a must for everything and has a great food court. Macy's believe it or not was great for bargains and has pretty much every brand name that you could imagine, there is one just down the road from the PK Hotel. My wife could not get enough of Wall Mart, she loved it for all the little ones toys, so much cheaper than home.When staying at the PK you can pretty much just duck out for a wander or a quick shop and then just go back, it is that close to all that you need. A great place to stay and highly recommend it to anyone. Last tip.... Get onto ""YOUTUBE"" it has clips of all the places you might want to go, and gives you a feel for the experience.

Back then it was showing signs of wear and need an update as it was like being in a timewarp out of the 70's. I gave it a good review as staff and others things werr not too bad.This is our second visit over late December 2011 to early January 2012 again taking my family of 5 as well as bringing our friends along as well. We booked 3 high ocean view rooms.... yeh sure these rooms faced away towards the city, if you walked out onto the balcony and leaned over the railing you could see the ocean. These rooms should be classed as high city view rooms.Checking in to hotel we requested rooms on a certain side which were completely ignored from hotel staff who were very condescending to the point where they were rude.We had just come from the Westin Maui and the desk staff were fantastic, although they had to deal with the so called gold SPG members expecting everything for free.I went back a number a few times of the next 4 days but just gave up, I got friendlier service from parking police.We were there for our 25th wedding anniversary, plus my friends and mine 50th. We got a bottle of wine but she received nothing which was disappointing.The rooms have been updated but are still ordinary when compared to other SPG hotels, the location is good.I doubt very much I would stay here again after dealing with rude staff at this hotel, not just one but numerous.Our stay at the Westin Maui voucher we gave them we were exempt from the resort fee of $25 per room per day, but here at Princess Kaiulani they charged us regardless for this stupid charge and said we had to pay it......

I will start with the warnings everyone else mentions there is an $18 a night resort fee which includes extras like internet but they do not give you any directions how to get wireless internet to work for free, the code is printed on the card telling you about the $18 fee but not directions. I think the reason they do not give the instructions is to get you to buy the $15/day internet plan that is offered by them. The TV is also a scam, we were unlucky enough to have two days of pouring rain, more will be said about that later but, we could not figure out how to get Non pay TV. The PAY screen loads when you turn the TV on but nowhere is there instructions how to get regular cable TV which is offered. I feel its a scam not to tell people how to use the TV. If people want to buy movies and TV shows fine, but also tell them how to watch the local news or weather. Here is how in case anyone else wants to know: push the channel down or up button on the remote to get regular TV. Even when we finally figured it out we were stumped by the fact some channels worked sometimes and other times those same channels were unavailable all you had to do was change the channel then try to go back and what you were just watching had become unavailable.We had a couple of days of bad weather which is fine something we can not control but our balcony was flooded there doesn't seem to be drainage. On top of this the carpet got soaked in our room as in ""squishy to walk on soaked"" not just damp and it was a large area. By the time we checked out a not pleasant musty smell was very evident.Now on to some general annoyances why does the pool close at 6pm? It's right in the middle of the courtyard, why not keep it open after people come back from the beach maybe some people don't like swimming in the sun. Not sure what the reason they can't have it open into the evening? The towel policy is also a pain.As for issues with our room its proximity to the elevator shaft for the staff elevator made it impossible to sleep-in it's obviously not insulated and they would start using it at 6am waking us up which sucks when you are on vacation. There were a couple of things that the hotel did fix promptly when made aware. Most of the lights didn't work in our room so they sent up an electrician to fix. The safe was also locked when we checked in and there was no directions on how to use it they did send someone to unlock it and he told us how to use it. A couple of small annoyances relating to the bathroom. The room had a sliding door for the bathroom and it was difficult to open and close that seems to be something that could be fixed pretty easily, the balcony door was hard to open and close also for that matter. There is no hook in the bathroom to hang clothes which seems like a no brainer since people will be changing from wet beach clothes to dry stuff in there and hook would be nice.The staff was generally friendly although the check in agent was not. I also had a difficult time getting a drink at the poolside bar was there twice for 10-15 minutes and the waitress ignored me both times. The bellmen were great and the cleaners were always very friendly.I had stayed at this hotel a few years ago and really liked it but this experience changed my mind. I am even questioning my participating in the SPG program why bother if you are paying for hotels of this poor quality.","Vancouver, Canada",9,1.0

Check in was fast and they upgraded us for free to a pool view room. I believe this is the oldest wing of the hotel but we had no problems with our room. The room was clean and it had a small lanai that over looked the pool. We had requested 1 king bed but non were available, so we had to settle for 2 doubles. The beds and bedding were very comfortable and the best feature of the room. We actually really enjoyed having our own beds to relax in after long days in the sun!! Sure the hotel is old, but it's very well kept and I didn't see any signs for the horror stories that some people in previous reviews have stated. We rented a car for our entire trip, so the resort fee of $12 per day was actually a good deal since it included parking. I do believe the resort fee has been increased to $18 per day, still not bad if you have a car. I believe the majority of the bad reviews for this hotel come from people with unrealistic expectations. People have to remember that this is a 3 star hotel. For the price we paid, we were very satisfied with our stay. I know this hotel is not considered a budget property, but if you shop around a bit you should be able to get a good rate like we did. I would recommend this hotel to first time visitors or people on a bit of a budget.

All major hotels were booked upon our arrival a day early, so we stayed at a ""familiar"" hotel down the block. We requested early check in, and left our bags and headed to enjoy the sun. On our original booking we had requested 2 double beds, and this had been confirmed in the morning. Alas when we returned at 3pm, our room contained a single king. Michelle, our Front Desk agent suggested a rollaway, as a temporary fix, to which I replied ""No"". Brian, the Front Desk Manager, met with me, and with Michelle's assistance they ended up giving us 2 single rooms for the price of 1 room. We were both most impressed with the professional way this mistake was rectified. My friend was put in a smaller room, adjacent to an elevator shaft, which was quite noisy. Understanding the Hotels capacity, we gain asked when a room became available away from the unending noise, would a room switch be possible, again to our delight, the Front Desk crew made this move seamless, while my friend was out- thank you!The Hotel is very centrally located to the main shopping strip, and very handy to the beach. For both of us, the gym facility is very important, the new equipment, and state of the art cardio equipment was fantastic. I might add, there is a $12 a day resort fee, which includes 2 Bottles of water, coffee, free internet, beach towels, gym, fruit at the beach, and other goodies, that upon review SAVED us a lot of money.The rooms in the old wing were rather dated, but very clean, and our housekeeper, Belinda was a joy!

I was on the 15th floor, and db Meter app on my iPhone registered the sound levels at about 80db during the live music and 75db during the car alarm symphony.

A bit more pricey in our book, but we didn't want to stay in another run-down place like my parents did last month. This hotel has a spacious lobby and beautiful garden with a mini-waterfall, plus it's right next to the international market place!We arrived around 10pm in mid-December 2011 and while there was only one other group before us, service was on the slow side. Yes, there was only one person at the desk, but it felt like she didn't know what services were provided at the hotel, and couldn't answer questions about parking. We had better luck with the valet attendant. But at least she served us with a greeting, smile and flowers?! Maybe she was new to the job? Well, I let my husband deal with the paperwork while the rest of us waited, looking at hotel's chocolate display of Waikiki. Quite impressive in detail if you don't look too closely, hehee~We stayed on the top floor (29th I believe) in the back corner with a partial view of the ocean (more like seeing the ocean between two taller buildings... but at least we got to see beautiful rainbows every morning). The room itself was spacious enough for the 4 people in 2 queen beds; we only used the rooms to sleep and shower so not a big deal for us. And there was ample room in the dresser and closet to unpack our clothes in and store our luggage. However the bathroom seems poorly constructed... the door bangs the toilet which makes it hard to go into the tub/shower (without hugging against the toilet or sink), and compared to the rest of the room, very outdated. Nothing ""luxurious"" about the bathroom with its dirty cream tiles and rusty plumbing, and scratchy towels. Luckily I brought extra flip-flops to shower in... and to just walk around in the bathroom.Because the marketplace is so close, you can often here the late-night craziness; must be louder as you're closer to the lobby/ground. Since we were on the top floor, we only heard the drums and anyone with a stereo system, but compared to our screaming neighbors and motorcycles back at home, this was nothing.Some of the goods, even if just the minor details: shampoo/conditioner/soap/lotion was provided in a lovely citrus tone (mandarin & mint) which were refilled almost daily (maybe b/c we had 4 ppl in a room?!); two free water bottles and coffee daily; and the service lady was very friendly. Because the towels were so thin, she gave us extra towels for the ladies to dry their hair with (we don't like using the hair dryer, but it's provided in the room as well), every day of our stay without another reminder! Some days she would leave more than 2 bottles of water~Parking was included (after paying that resort fee, of course) and there always seemed to be plenty of space. Though b/c it was December, there were a lot weddings happening, so if you were out late, you might not find one. But we asked the parking attendant and she always let us park in the reserved spaces~Wireless connections is only reachable in their computer ""room"" down in the lobby, but they also have computers/printers/fax of their own (4 desktops). However, you are only given 20 free minutes PER DAY, and then you need to start paying up~We only ate at the Pikake Terrace once for their expensive dinner buffet (well, compared to hotel buffets, decent price) and stocked up on crab legs. Delicious! But keep on eye on them; some batches are left longer under the heat lamp and the ones on top became dry and chewy. We sometimes waited for a new batch! We did have one batch that was super-salty, not sure if it were the crabs or the person cooking them. Their roast was tender but really salty! Salad and fruits was clean and fresh, and there was plenty of other entrees, sides and desserts! Our waitress was bubbly-nice, but some of the others around us would look glum and/or stand in the middle of customer traffic (who are trying to get food and go back to their table) talking to one another. Not sure which section they were supposed to serve, but slightly rude! Because the dining area is mostly outdoors, stay clear from the corners of the giant umbrellas when it's raining; you will get wet. Just sit closer to your table =P I don't clearly remember the furniture as it was dark (there were only candles and tiki torches), but just your typical pool stuff. And if you get small portions per trip, you're always getting up so I don't see why I needed a plush seat or something!All in all, a wonderful stay. If the price is right, we wouldn't mind staying here again. I think I was more happy because my mom got to enjoy herself; she rarely gets to treat herself to a resort hotel after years of motels/day inns. Which is perfectly fine when you have plans; you can spend more on food or things to do...don't really need the fancier resort hotels. So, unless we win some grand prize from somewhere, we won't be going to one of those hotels any time soon. Princess Kaiulani was a nice enough treat to ourselves!","Pinole, California",8,4.0

We didn't use any of the facilities of the hotel, as we were out and about all day and literally used this as a base to shower and sleep.

Although we would not rate it as a luxury hotel, it is first rate, reasonably-priced and remains our favourite hotel in Honolulu. The hotel's palm-lined garden is attractive leading to the lobby and restaurant area. It occupies the former Ainahau Estate, where Princess Victoria Kaiulani lived until her untimely death in 1899. Her large portrait and several smaller ones and photographs of hers ornate the open lobby. In the pre-Christmas weeks, Chef Bauer and his elves labour for many days building a winter scene with sugar and ginger bread. This display was larger than in the past, and is the most impressive and magnificent make-believe winter scene we have ever seen. It also includes two miniature railways. The original hotel opened in 1955, followed in 1970 by the 29-floor Ainahau Tower. Thanks to the SPG Platinum/Gold desk, we checked in quickly, welcomed by a gracious clerk, who had reserved a nice, comfortable room with balcony on the 25th floor of the Tower, overlooking parts of Waikiki Beach, Diamond Head etc., and beautiful sunsets. If the rooms had double-glazed doors, they would be quieter. We always enjoy eating at the hotel. The Pikake Terrace offers reasonably-priced sumptuous breakfast and dinner buffets. The waiters and waitresses are friendly and very competent. As of 18:00 h, it has nightly entertainment, usually featuring local bands and Hula dancers. The adjacent ""Splash Bar and Bento"" offers a-la-carte dining and entertainment. Its Happy Hours from 15:30 to 17:30 h offers tasty snacks and sub-tropical drinks. It also serves my favourite Fire Rock Ale from Kona. Regrettably, the Japanese Momoyama Restaurant was closed (for good?), and so is our favourite Hano Hano Restaurant, previously on the top floor of the Sheraton Waikiki.Perhaps because of the predominant Japanese clientele, oatmeal is not on the Pikake buffet; however, tiny Kim, bent by age and 35 years with the hotel, brought me oatmeal upon request plus brown sugar, without my asking.Ravenous pigeons are a negative. The hotel has tried a feeding area, but their seemingly limitless appetite attracts them back to the tables. The Mauna Kea Beach Hotel and Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel on Hawai'i and the Westin Casuarina on Grand Cayman are wrestling with the same problem. Perhaps, someone should record a pigeon's death cry and a hawk's cry and have them played intermittently.As always, I liked the hotel's large and very deep oval swimming pool. Its water was quite cool, but pleasant and refreshing. Its low temperature is ideal for extended swimming, because it relegates most guests to the lounge chairs. A big improvement over beach mats are the hotel's portable collapsible ""sand chairs"". Although they are low, they are comfortable and keep guests off the sand. We carried our chairs across and down Kalakaua Avenue for a few steps to Waikiki Beach. The hotels sends twice daily a young man and woman, drawing a cart with cold bottled water and fruits for hotel guests (identied by the ""sand chairs"").The always busy hotel attracts Japanese tour guests in droves. They were scurrying out and in, laden with shopping bags from Macy's and other fine stores along Kalakaua Avenue. Our most memorable visit was in early Decmber 2001, when the hotel rather resembled a morgue, because shell-shocked and air-plane-phobic by the collapse ot the World Trade Center, tourists avoided Hawai'i. At the time, the hotel had placed us on the 29th floor of the Tower in a large and sumptuous suite, worthy of the Emperor of China, had he lived.Although the hotel has no beachfront, it always attracts us like a magnet. We were sad, when we moved from the hotel to The Royal Hawaiian, but if our lives are spared, we shall return, because the hotel has created a feeling of ""belonging"".","Toronto, Ontario",75,4.0

The hotel location has an interesting Hawaiian history as well. Housekeeping was great as was the front desk staff.

It can sneak up on you and really should be included in the rate so costs can be compared. While this resort fee includes self parking and internet.

The rooms were blocked for our group, so the rate was reduced to $159/night, which based on the condition of the hotel seemed about right as the hotel is across the street from the beach in the heart of Waikiki. The Kaiulani is very outdated, with lots of nicks and scars in the walls and furniture in the guest rooms. The carpeting looked fairly new, however. The pool is pretty small compared to others in the area for what is considered a luxury hotel. The water of the pool is not heated, which suited me, as I am a lap swimmer. However, they put a buoy across the shallow end so swimming laps is pretty awkward. The pool is only open from 8am to 6pm, so early morning or late night swimming, which would be great, is not available, plus the pool is smack up against the lanai eating seating, so you are in full view of everyone. The dining venues are very limited, mostly to an expensive buffet for breakfast and dinner. We did not eat anything at the hotel, so do not know how good the food was. There are tons of restaurants within an easy walk of the hotel, so you can quite easily find just about any kind of fare for varying prices. There are classes available each day for things like hula lessons, etc., and there usually is some form of entertainment--bands, hula dancers--every night. OUr room on the 23d floor of the tower was average size but the bathroom was fairly small and in severe need of remodeling. The countertop stone was pitted and dirty looking, plus the sink had a crack in it. They provide a flat screen TV with lots of free channels. The worst problem with the hotel is the noise from all the tourists milling around below the area until very late at night and into the early morning hours. Bands play in the area below the hotel until quite late too, so you hear the drums playing loudly unless you close your sliding glass door. The noise even penetrates the room with the door closed, unfortunately. The bed linens were crisp and clean and the beds and pillows were very comfortable. Lighting was very good throughout the room and bathroom. There is plenty of hanging space and there are drawers for storing your folded clothes, although the drawer space is a bit limited. There is a safe and a refrigerator in the room, so you can buy juice, cereal, snacks, etc., to make eating a quick bite a bit easier.","Sacramento, California",66,3.0

The king size bed was very comfortable. It was a struggle getting out of it in the morning!This hotel also puts on interesting activities like hula dancing and ukalela lessons at no extra cost. Don't miss the pineapple carving! Maybe they will add line dancing in the future (hint, hint).Check in was a bit slow for tired travellers, but check out was quick and efficient. The staff are very friendly and helpful, particularly front desk and bell men.No problem with the resort fee although not sure if we got full value as we didn't have a car, but the included long distance (and international) phone calls is a bonus and the high speed internet was great.There is an ice machine on each floor which is great for drinks in your room.

Excellent view of the ocean, hotels, mountain from our lanai.Cons: The wind noise that roared and moaned through our room was unbelievable, especially as the days weren't particularly windy ones. Luckily the wind died down at night. One of the phones in our room crackled so badly it was good there wasn't anyone we needed to call. The decor was definitely island nostalgia - turquoise or pink painted built-ins and rattan tropics. Bathroom was not someplace you wanted to spend time in but clean enough.

The room itself was dated and had that 1980's feel but this was fine for us as we were only using it to stretch the legs after several long flights with two small children. Service was fairly ordinary, most employees looked overworked and the expressions on their faces suggest they may as well be just as happy working for Apple making iPhones in a Chinese slave factory!

We had booked last minute on Priceline for around $85/night which we felt was an okay price for this time of year. Initially, we were checked into an unrenovated room that was dreary, musty, and dated. The carpets were dirty and the washroom was dismal with no counter space! You should definitely be aware that this hotel charges a daily resort fee of around $12.50. The fee includes wireless internet, a welcome drink (sugary non alcholic drink), self parking, and 60 mins of free phone calls including international calls. We were aware of this fee and was fine with it as we had a rented vehicle and the parking rate itself would be considered very reasonable in comparison to other Waikiki lots. After our first night in the unrenovated room, we were fortunate enough to speak to the front desk and be moved to a renovated room (still quite dated but definitely better than the first room that we were given). Our stay improved greatly from this point. I did have problems accessing the wireless internet but I spoke with their technology assistance team via the front desk and they were able to get me up and running on my netbook and iPhone with some slight adjustments to my settings. I never used the pool as the beach was nearby and we preferred getting out of Waikiki during the day. If you are on a lower floor, the noise might be an issue so I would suggest requesting a higher room. The Starwood Sweet Sleeper bed is excellent and is provided in all the rooms including those in unrenovated rooms. We also happen to be at the hotel during a pineapple cutting demonstration with free sampling and a lei making class (I assume this is part of the ""resort"" fee?) This hotel is definitely in need of a major overhaul but the same can be said of many other hotels in Waikiki.

The location is fantastic. The property looks a little aged. The green carpet is not a good choice. It makes the rooms and lobby look a little dirty. The bedding at all Starwood hotels is great. The view from my room was embarrassing - but I did not stay there for the view, and booked the most basic room.Furniture is very basic, but acceptable. The refrigerator wasn't stocked. The hallways look very ""cheap"".The property was very busy for New Years, it took some time to catch an elevator.The pool was acceptable for Hawaii, but would not be up to standard in other parts of the world. It was disturbing to expect guests to have a ""towel"" card ready when picking up a very simple towel. I wasn't given such a card at check in, and had to wait for a manager to get a towel for my 5 minute pool time.The manager gave me a towel card, but did not explain, nor did I sign and agreed to the small print. The small print alerted a guest of a charge for the towel if the slip was not returned at check out. Enforcing this would disqualify a guest from using the express check out - and the lines were long.I am a Gold member for the SPG program. Getting points or status nights is important. I tried to book the hotel on the starwood.com website, but nothing was available. I called the hotel and was told the hotel was sold out.I was able to reserve a room on Orbitz.com, but was not explained Starwood would not honor SPG benefits.I did not receive points, nor did I receive status nights. Guests should be warned to be penalized when booking a Starwood hotel with travel agents and tour operators. I can't believe the travel industry is not boycotting Starwood Hotels & Resorts.I was not mad aware of a mandatory ""Resort"" fee until I checked into the hotel. I understand several hotels and resorts now charge such fees. I feel such fees border on extortion and may be illegal. One of the benefits was a complimentary juice drink at the pool bar. After the tip, this drink turned out to be expensive for a watered down fruit colored drink in a small plastic glass. The resort fee did include 60 minutes of phone calls. Well - my cell phone is free. The resort fee also included internet, but WIFI in my room was not available, only Internet cable. Since I did not take my computer but my I Pad - this was not an option for me.The resort fee did include parking, what was great for me- but unnecessary for most tourists in Waikiki. Most tourists would not rent a car.I am puzzled why Starwood is upsetting their guests with such ""mandatory fees"". Such ""fees"" are nothing but a mandatory and hidden increase of an already agreed room rate. Has anyone ever challenge this in court?I stayed at the Hyatt across the road many times.

Also, the staff were really great with the kids. One of them took 45 minutes to show them around and let them feed goldfish an hunt for lizards. My kids are still talking about it. All in all I would say this is not the sufrider, but the rooms are very clean and comfortable and the location is fantastic. The breakfast buffet is fine and reasonably priced. My only criticism is that roll-away beds seem very expensive, but I assume that is because they have to upgrade the room to fit them in.

She has put us in a ""renovated"" room and that the hotel is fully sold out. When we opened the door to the room, the last renovation was probably during Reagan administration. The wallpapers were peeling, theres mold near the ceiling, and rusty fixtures in the bathroom.

For similar prices stay at the Marriott or even the Hyatt were they don't charge you a ""resort"" fee $12 (which I totally don't mind paying if this was truly a resort, which it's not). I was handed a stack of coupons and cards upon check in for happy hour and for towels and chairs. The chair rental is at the end of the strip about a 15 min walk, not across the street as one might assume.

Apparently when we were told ""renovations"" it only applied to the LCD tv and new bed linens, well thank heavens or else I'm guessing the linens would be from the 60's when the hotel opened. The bell man told us they are demolishing these towers next year so it's all the same condition. So Starwood let me ask you this.

But the truth is this hotel leaves a lot to be desired. First, it's NOT on the beach. To get to the beach you need to cross the street and walk around several other hotels. Second, it's very crowded and dated. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls in our room and the bathroom had built-up crud on the floor. Third, the rooms are small and few of them have any sort of view. But you CAN hear music all night long from the neighboring hotels, making it hard to sleep. Finally, the parking is very inconvenient; the structure is quite a walk away from the hotel.

The service was excellent. We booked a Pool view room and were upgraded to an Ocean view room in the Ainahau tower, the room was in need of some renovations, especially the bathroom, it appeared to be a little shabby & old, but in good condition & well priced. The room safe required a service when we checked in and the service man was there to fix it within 5 minutes of our phone enquiry. The view was just beautiful, overlooking the Moana Surfrider hotel & the ocean, it was a delight waking up to every morning. The Hotel is in the best position, I have been to Hawaii 3 times before this holiday, this being my 4th, and have to say this was by far the best location as we were in heart of eateries, shopping & across the road from the beach.I definetaly would recommend anyone wanting to stay in the heart of Waikiki, on a budget and requiring a decent, well serviced hotel to stay here. The staff were very friendly, helpful & grateful. 3 out of the 5 days we stayed here we had the Buffet breakfast, the Ainahau Buffet breakfast which was $27 per head, which included scrambled eggs made on the spot, bacon, sausages, hash browns, pastries, fruit, cereal, coffee & juices.. My husband was not with me on vacation this time, as I was with a friend on a shopping & ladies getaway, and it happened to be my birthday on the 28th Nov, while I was there, he called the hotel from home and ordered a bottle of Champagne & chocolate strawberries to the room as a birthday surprise and was also so impressed by the staff taking his order, they were more than happy to look after the order and went out of their way to call him back confirming it. I recieved it as Rooms service in the evening, and it was such a beautiful surprise, the preparation and typed up birthday card from the hotel was just fantastic. I cant speak highly enough for the hotel staff. The $14.00 added package fee daily, was well worth it, we recieved, 1 hour of international phone calls a day, it didnt matter if we made 3 phone calls of 5, they just had to add up to 1 hour. Hotel parking (which we didnt use or need), 20 minutes internet usage a day & 2 fresh water bottles. There was a misunderstanding with the internet usage as we thought you used 20 minutes in the day, not in one go, it wasnt expalined to us properly when we checked in, and when we complained about the additional internet charges & the misunderstood procedure of their usage, the lady in the front desk took it to the Manager who deleted the extra internet charges from our bill almost immediately. It was a misunderstanding as it wasnt explained upon check in properly. I do recommend this Hotel if you're looking for a place to stay in the heart of Waikiki and on a budget.

It's more or less clean - your room may look dingy, but that's the age showing. If you need 4- or 5-star accommodations, look elsewhere. Almost every room is described as ""ocean view"", but that might require creative alignment of your balcony's chair. But it you're just looking for a good clean bed and hot water, then seriously consider the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani - because its location makes it an insanely good value. Literally less than sixty seconds to walk to the Pacific Ocean from the lobby, even though it's not considered ""beachfront"". Right next to the International Market, with its shopping and food court. And right in the middle of countless restaurants and clubs in downtown Waikiki. (Side note - Waikiki isn't quiet at night, and the hotel's rooms are nowhere near soundproof. I travel with earplugs.)As is common with any hotel nowadays, the Sheraton Princess charges a $14 a day ""resort fee"", but at least this includes both high-speed cabled (not wireless) room Internet, and parking for one vehicle. There are numerous hotel-organized activities for the family and the kids, and the hotel has an adequate pool, if you don't feel like walking over to the beach (they'll spot you a towel, too.) There is an indoor/outdoor buffet-style restaurant serving breakfast and lunch, but I found it to be pricey - the breakfast buffet at Duke's Waikiki, which is literally right across the street, is $10 cheaper.So in summary, the rooms and facilities of the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani are average and adequate. The service is pleasant, but sometimes struggles to keep up with the load (lines are common). But it's a sensational deal. This hotel is frequently discounted, and participates in Priceline and Hotwire. And its location is platinum-coated 5-star. If you just plan to use your room for sleeping and showering, and budget is an issue, it belongs on your short list.","Denver, Colorado",13,3.0

One day, they had a pineapple cutting demonstration in the lobby and you got to sample fresh pineapple. We had a drink and watched the music one night by the pool.And it's right across the street (almost) from Duke's which is a great place to have a drink, a burger and see Diamond Head in the background.

Hawaii had never been on our ""bucket list"" but we're delighted we went. I'm going to review a few elements of the trip but this will be the first and I'll try to identify other elements which will appear in separate reviews. The other elements I'll CAPITALIZE so if you're interested you can find them on Trip Advisor (TA).First, the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani...we'd read lots of TA reviews so our expectations weren't too high. We were pleasantly surprised. The reviews that comment on the fact that the hotel is 'somewhat tired' are correct - but it's great nevertheless. The location is ideal. If there's any location complaint it's the noise on the street but Kalakaua Ave. is Waikiki's main drag. The people watching is outstanding. If there's one complaint it's the street vendors. They're everywhere. But I digress. I'm going to write another review of HONOLULU/OAHU/WAIKIKI but this one should focus on the hotel.Our room on the 21st floor faced Waikiki Beach. It was wonderful looking out at the surfers that were there from the minute the sun came up to when it was too dark to see. The room was clean and comfortable - if a bit tired. No complaints!!!The people at the hotel are what makes it. Everyone we met that worked there was friendly and helpful. The all seemed to work hard to make our stay there special and relaxing. I have no complaints. The folks at the front desk went out of their way to ensure we had our every wish fulfilled. The housekeeping staff did a great job. All in all, everyone was terrific. I'd say, such a commitment to customer service starts at the top so congrats to senior management.Location wise it's excellent. Located right across Kalakaua Ave from Waikiki beach is great. Since we rented a car (at the airport) for the three days we were there we found it easy to navigate around the city and around the Island.The Sheraton charges a $12.00 per day ""resort fee"" on top of the room rate. It includes a variety of things like parking, beach chairs, water and fruit brought to you on the beach, a free welcome drink. Aside from the free welcome drink, the only thing we used was the parking and with rates in such a built up area as Waikiki we were glad of the parking garage.I want to do a couple of other reviews of the trip that have nothing to do with the hotel so if you're interested where I've capitalized certain things, there will be a review of it somewhere on TA. One thing is the WESTJET FLIGHT to Honolulu, another is the NCL CRUISE we took from Oahu to Maui to Hawaii to Kawaii. Four islands, unpack once. Great way to do it.I'd also be remiss if I didn't comment on two other hotels in separate reviews - the ASTON BEACHWALK HOTEL at Waikiki and the COAST AIRPORT HOTEL in Vancouver.If you have any questions about this or any other post I'm happy to get your email and I will respond to your questions.","Port Dover, Canada",105,4.0

I have stayed at the Sheraton PK six times and of all the hotels I have stayed at in Waikiki (7 hotels), in provides the most consistant value. Where else can you stay in Waikiki within two minutes of the beach for less than $150 per night.No the facilities in this hotel are not four or five stars, but it's price and proximity to the beach make it a better value than any of the beach hotels. Most hotels in it's price class are several blocks from the beach, not one block.Great bang for the buck here. I highly reccomend the PK to those wanting the proximity to the beach for half or even a third the price. Plus, you can always dine at the Royal Hawaiian, Moana, or Sheraton Waikiki and charge it to your room.","Atlanta, GA",45,3.0

Looking at the website we kind of knew what to expect - touristy, a little tacky, but in the middle of it all. Having read Tripadvisor we knew it'd be a bit tired but would do the trick. We found reasonable rates on the Sheraton website and bit the bullet - we really just needed somewhere to stay for two nights so weren't too fussed.Upon arrival we knew it was going to live up to expectations. I guess that if you don't travel a lot then you could love this place. It was a bit garish and when we checked in we didn't really get the level of attention you'd expect at a better hotel - there's a little bit of a tourist conveyor-belt approach to things. Our room was tiny - absolutely miniscule. We were on a low floor, in the shorter tower, and faced a car park. I think our special rate got us one of the worst rooms available. The rooms in the main tower could have been better - they all seemed larger from the outside and had balconies. In the end room size didn't matter much - the first night we were there we were very jetlagged, the second we were a bit drunk. The hotel and rooms are incredibly tired and in desperate need of a makeover. They are definitely ""nineties in Nagoya"" themed and the beige overload still gives me nightmares. The room was a bit grubby too and in need of a major spring cleaning. The bed was great - a decent Sheraton bed. I did sleep well. The bathroom was tiny and the shower head could only be attached at two levels - one too low and one really high - it was very odd. The bathroom was tiny too and reminded me of Japan. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as I think it was $25 per person for the buffet - which was far too expensive, even for Waikiki. You can get similar buffets at some of the 5 star hotels nearby for the same price. The gym was pretty good. It was large, well-equpped and very clean. This is one of the hotel's best features in the end. The pool area was alright but nothing you'd want to go to more than once. The resort's pool towel policy was a bit strict too - a little bit Butlins from what I can imagine - but I suppose it is necessary. The hotel is in a very good location though - very close to the beach and all activities. When we returned to Waikiki for the last 4 days we got a great deal at the Trump which ended up not costing much more than the Sheraton. If you have standards and want a good quality hotel I'd recommend shopping around or waiting a while until you find something a little fancier.","London, United Kingdom",165,3.0

They show us a couple other rooms that had the same smell we saw the mold growing in one of the closets. Meanwhile my wife was having a terrible reaction to the mold. I told Greg (sic) that there is no way we can stay in this hotel and that it is unsafe and not fit for habitability. He said that if we left he was going to charge us for the 5 nights regardless. I was dealing with hotel management from about 6pm until midnight trying to resolve this issue. It was apparent that hotel management had no care for its guests health and was only concerned about their bottom line. When I told Greg that I have to take my wife to the emergency room because she had a reaction to the mold, his attitude was indifferent and kept repeating that he's going to charge the 5 nights.

My overall experience was extremely pleasurable and there were very few complaints that I can offer. I can say that I would definitely stay here again.I booked my reservation directly through the hotels website and was able to purchase a buy now rate at a significantly cheaper rate than making a normal reservation. Meaning, I prepaid for all three nights upfront and it was non-refundable.The hotel does not off shuttle service so you will need to arrange transportation from the airport. Check in was fast, efficient and the gentleman who checked me in was very welcoming. The one improvement I could offer the hotel is to provide an envelope to place drink vouchers, towel cards, room keys and daily resort info card into. I was given paper after paper with no where to put it. I was also very happy when I learned that my room received a complimentary upgrade!I stayed on the 5th floor with a lovely view of the ocean, pool and entertainment stage. I was able to enjoy the band and watch the hula dancer each night from my balcony. By the way the entertainment was free! The room itself was a standard 3 star hotel in my view. I had upgraded bedding, flat screen tv, chair, ottoman, desk, mini-fridge and safe in my room. The bathroom was nothing exciting. It was all white and pale colors and the water pressure for the removable shower head was strong! The one thing that needed improvement in the room was the wall paper in the bathroom. It was peeling away from the wall and near the toilet it looked like mold was growing.The hotel is right across the street from the beach, right next to the International market, shopping centers and eateries. I cannot stress to anyone how amazing the location of the hotel is. If it depends on you paying an additional $20-30 per night for a room, consider this place... the location in itself is worth it!Other positives:- housekeeping staff were ALWAYS friendly, greeting with a smile- the hotel was well kept- grounds were niceOther negatives:- front desk staff were SLOW at check out (huge line) and they weren't very friendly, as they were at check in- menu prices for room service, poolside and buffet were very pricey- pool closes at 6pm- was never told where to go for beach side service or chairs- doorman or greeter talked to shuttle driver about tattoos instead of helping me carry my bags to the shuttle- no one offered drinks or a menu poolside, figured there would be waitstaff","Brush Prairie, Washington",28,4.0

Got lost trying to find this place, but what a great location once you're there. Check in wasn't a long process at all. In fact, the front desk were quite pleasant. The hotel is smaller than other hotels I've been to, but you're next to the International Marketplace in Waikiki, and right across the street from the beach. When I checked in I received welcome drink tickets which was nice. You are surrounded by stores there. If I hadn't had other places to visit, I would of just taken a taxi or hotel shuttle and saved the $$$ from the rental car. It's just so close to everything.When I arrived, I had parked the car in self parking which was $12 a day, which was included in the resort fee. That was cheap compared to what I've paid at the Hilton Hawaiian village which was about $25. I see that everyone stated the internet was included in the resort fee, but when I tried to log in, it said a daily charge of $14 for internet and wifi, but maybe I was so busy with wanting to hit the nightlife, that I didn't notice the passcodes? After stepping foot off the elevator to get to your room, I felt like I was in a 1970's hotel. The rooms were clean and had very comfortable beds, but the rooms decor was very dated and are in need of remodeling especially the bathrooms. We walked by the buffet and decided against it since it was kind of pricey and there were other places to choose. Since you're on an island, everything is pricey. Although, I think this hotel has a great location, I found it to be average due to the hotel being dated comparing to other hotels I've stayed at. A remodel should be in the works. I do think their employees are very friendly and helpful which is a plus.In 5 hours I was able to drive around the island and have dinner in Kahuku @ Giovanni's, take pictures of sea turtles and the beautiful beaches, shop in Haleiwa, eat Shave Ice @ Matsumoto's, eat cake @ The Alley in Aiea and pick up some cookies for the trip home!","san diego, ca",79,3.0

There's a coffee bar by the other pedestrian entrance and there's also a HopOnHopOff stall there, too. It's smack in the middle of Waikiki and you can pretty much walk easily and explore the shops from any direction at this location. Valet is included in the $12 resort fee which also included welcome drinks, pool service and beach chairs and towels. The street says 1 way, but you can get to the hotel from both directions. It's right on the corner across the Hyatt.ROOMS: We were assigned to a City view room which meant views of other buildings, but you can spy a sliver of the ocean in between the buildings that may block the view. They have other rooms which have Ocean view and I imagine that would be gorgeous. We had 2 double beds, although I requested 1 Queen bed. It was ok, the hubby and I had our own beds for the night which was a laugh really. The bathroom was a lot more spacious than another hotel we tried. The room and bathroom felt dated, but it wasn't too shabby. The linens were fresh Hotel collection type and pillows lovely and soft.There was a flatscreen TV, fridge, iron, hairdryer. Didn't notice any noise and didn't stay in the room much except to change clothes and sleep. It's convenient going to/coming from the beach coz we didn't have to lug around much stuff with us and we could easily return stuff to the room when shopping gets heavy. SERVICE: Everyone was friendly here except maybe the waitress at the Splash bar. She wasn't the cheerful type and could smile more, but other than that everyone was nice. The valet guy was definitely nice. He greeted us and chatted and I wish I noted his name coz he was memorable. We ate at the splash bar while waiting for our ride, but otherwise preferred to eat elsewhere. The food wasn't bad though. We liked the Kalua sliders, the taro bun was different and the bbq sauce pretty good.AMENITIES: There was a pool, I'm not sure if there was a gym, but we didn't use either.

Only downturn was the $12.00 a night resort fee - being international visitors we appreciated the towels and sand chairs and the cold water and fruit delivered to the beach; but had no use for phone calls to the mainland; the wireless internet (who wants to be in internet contact while on holiday) nor did we use the parking as we only hired a car on one day.

Slightly bigger, but couldn't wait to get out of the room. So when booking, be careful that you specify what you want: View, balcony etc, otherwise you may end up in the 4 walls we got.

No one was pushy, rather enjoyed looking and not being pressured to buy. The room was very clean, the carpet was vacuumed daily, the towels plenty and plush and the room was very quiet when the windows were closed.

The room was comfortable and we had a great view overlooking the Sheraton Waikiki and the ocean. Our room overlooked the International Market. Sitting on the balcony at night was entertainment enough. The compulsory resort fee included 60 minutes of international calls per day, WOW, car parking and bottled water, and other things. The pool was relaxing and we had no trouble getting 2 pool chairs. The location is outstanding, Subway/Burger King/KFC directly over the road, drug store/supermarket/Ihop in the street at the rear of the hotel, Cheesecake Factory on the main street at the front of the hotel. Macys next to the International Market and all great shopping at your doorstep.On our first day we were advised the shuttle to Waikele Outlets was fully booked. Taxis were approximately $75 each way, so we hired a car. I had never driven outside of Australia before, so this was an adventure. If you do hire a car, make sure you purchase the proper fold-out map, because the small photocopy version the hotel gives you or written directions may not help if there is roadworks and you are directed away from your journey. We also drove to Pearl Harbour, this also saved us time and money, because it is free entry.We were advised that this hotel will be closing in the next 18 months, and 2 of the towers demolished for renovation work.

The room also happened to be a corner unit so we had views of the mountain, pool and we had a partial view of the ocean between the two buildings in front of us.

Overall, we think the hotel is clean, with very friendly staff, and the room well appointed. We agree it is not a recently modeled hotel, but it is very functional. We stayed on the 22nd floor and were fortunate enough to have a front corner room, with a great view of the ocean.Check the room size before you book (I found the lowest rate is for the room with 230 sq ft, whereas for another $20 (your mileage may vary), we have the use of a 280 sq.ft. room. Not huge, but comfortable enough. The bed was very comfortable, and the amenities were what I would expect from a Starwood property. It's location is perfect, and we were able to walk to many attractions close by, including the Waikiki Aquarium and Zoo.The food (we had lunch & dinner buffet) were good, portions large. The staff were friendly, accommodating and helpful. Examples: Once our friend requested papaya during dinner buffet (not amongst the fruit served), and our waiter went to the kitchen and brought back a whole papaya. Another was me inquiring how to get out of the garage to catch a very early flight when the security gates were locked. The security guard patiently walked me through the steps, as well as the options that are available.The only issue we had with the Princess Kaiulani was the LONG check-in process. We arrived at 1:30pm and saw 6 front desk personnel, with 8 parties ahead of us. You would think it would be a breeze. Unfortunately, 3 of them were dedicated to Starwood Elite guests, and they were helping 2 parties. When they were done, they did paperwork. Of the remaining 3, one was dedicated to arriving guests from Japanese tour groups; who escorted them from the back of the line to her monitor, and afterwards went to the office in the back. The other 2 front desk personnel were available to help the rest of us. One appears to be in training, so there was actually only one available service agent. It took us an hour to get checked in. I don't know where the front desk manager was. Many hotel personnel passed by, and no one redirected the idling staff to help. I just think it is an extremely inefficient & ineffective operation. I do have to say the agent who helped us was very helpful despite her workload.All in all, we would stay there again.

You may not be suprised by this, but the fact that the trip is a holiday, booked as a holiday, paid for as a hoilday, where else but a resort would you expect to go. The list of amenities you get for the 12.57 dollars per room, per day, include such delights as 2 free soft drinks per stay, (i.e. 1 per week), 2 bottles of water a day, local calls, 1 hr international calls, free child (under 12) per audlt eating @ circa 40 dollars each, free parking and a space on the beach half a mile away.Now, as I'm on holiday, I don't know anyone local to call, my family is with me, so I don't need to call home, my laptop is at home, so I don't need the internet, my car is also at home, the pool is just outside reception, so why walk half a mile for the same service? which leaves the free drink and 2 bottles of water, I can get one & litres of water across the road for 1 dollar, so 12.57 dollaars for the water is a little steep.Also, if you book a standard room, watch out. The view is a multistorey carpark, just what you want after 10000 miles. An up grade will cost another 20 dollars per night, per room.So be careful, expect to pay out on arrival, it cost me £500 with the up grade a & resort charge before I'd even unpacked.","Birmingham, United Kingdom",1,3.0

I won't rehash the details but you can check Sheraton Waikiki for my review. We were given two rooms on the 26th floor next to each other. Rooms are dated but functional. Two double beds in each room. Desk, LCD TV, safe, minifridge and coffeemaker. Nice to have the fridge and the coffee provided was quite good. Had to leave note for housekeeping for more creamer as they had only provided two each day. Bathroom had the standard one sink, toilet and tub all in one room with one door. One plus of the hotel is the rooms were well insulated. Did not hear our kids next door and we were concerned but it turns out it was the sound insulation. Having said that our room faced the International Marketplace and everynight we could hear the street performers. The first night is was fine since it ended by 11 pm but the second night we realized we were going to be listening to the same set of songs every night. I can't say it bothered our sleep since the music was done by the time we went to bed.Self parking was fine(no valet parking) and we always had parking at the top floors. What a lot guest did not seem to realize was that if you park on the bottom three floors you had to take the stairs down to the lobby. But if you followed the signs to the disabled parking to the top two floors and to the left of the main parking structure the spaces were next to the elevators that we could take directly to our rooms. By the way there were both regular parking and disabled parking spaces in this area and it always had empty spaces. Resort fee is $12 which is much lower than what seems to the standard $20 at most places. It covers self-parking and wired internet. Each cost $15 seperatedly so it is a no brainer to pay the resort fee if you are using either and in our case we used both. No wireless in this hotel so no facebook for my wife iPad which does not have 3G. She had to use my laptop or iPhone. Across the street is an ABC store and a Burger King which was good for breakfast and snacks. Tried the Pikake Terrace for their dinner buffet for $34.50 and felt it was good value and would recommend. Selection is limited and but they have snow crab clusters and prime rib and both were good. Only thing unusual is that the food is in two areas seperated by a wide hallway that hotel guest use to get to the elevators. I had noticed earlier people crossing the hallway with plates of food. For breakfast it is $21.50 but they have a takeout breakfast for $10 where they give you a takeout container what you can fill up with whatever you want. I noticed a lot of people carrying it up the elevator during my morning Burger King run. Talked to an elderly gentlemen and he said he fills it up and serves as breakfast for him and his wife. Aside from the Pikake Terrace there was really no other place for food in the hotel but it is centrally located and we did get some great inexpensive meals at the food court in the International Marketplace. Pool is nothing special. A small oval pool. Not crowded and okay for small kids. Our kids showed no interest in it. Overall I would consider coming back since I think considering the room rates on the web it is a good value.","Da'an, Taipei",14,4.0

The rooms are in desperate need of re-decorating and modernising. We also got a rude awaking with the fire alarm it went off twice at 5am it was a false alarm however nobody explainned it was a false alarm, we phoned down to the lobby to ask what was happening but there was no answer.

There were water stains on the ceiling, visible grime on lamp shades, and LOTS of wear and tear on the furniture. The in-room Sheraton infomercial about their billion dollar renovations are insulting when you are sitting in a room that hasn't had a renovation since the late 80's. My other complaint was that when I checked my bags to wait for my room, they would not take my laptop bag. I had to spend 2 hours lugging that around which is how I discovered the lovely patio across the street.

Right in the walking distance to all the big major hotels, the park, restuarants, and of course the beautiful beach ( about 2-5 minute walk). They had nightly entertainment of dancers and singers right byt the pool/bar/buffet so you didnt have to go far. on the second floor was the poynesian dinner and show which is a bit pricey but the show was def worth the price and is a must see ( plus hotel guest get a discount which was a bonus) they have a very good excursions and tours desk and they were very friendly in helping us find the right stuff, we did not need a car because of the close walking distance and all tours we booked had transportation. Over all the staff was friendly, the rooms were a little older but decent and beds were comfortable. If we returned to Oahu we would want to try a bigger resort howeverr this definately would be on our list if we needed a budget friendly yet nice place to stay again.Cons:Since it is right in the spot were it the busiest and most crowded it was loud ( but hey your in hawaii right have fun). The pool was rather small and the buffet was pricey but not all that great. The Hyatt is right across the street and was their employees were on strike and protesting ( I know this wasnt in Sheratons hand but it was so annonying and non relaxing to here yelling and loud drums at 430am in the morning). If it is a busy season and you cant check out late but your flight is later in the day they do allow for you to have a room for one hour to freshen up at a first come first serve, however the down side to it was when we got the room for an hour it was dirty, used towels bed not made, you can tell the people just left which was not pleasant at all. The food at the Polynesian Creation show wasnt that great ( but the show itself was so awesome Id still recommend going to it). House keeping was always late cleaning our room, so after a long morning of doing fun things we just wanted to come back and relax in our room and twice our room wasnt ready or cleaned. The first time we said it was ok just give us fresh towels, and toilet paper ( we were so tired we didnt want to wait and just wanted to rest) so she checked in as if she ""cleaned"" the room. it happened again a second time but when we complained they did make sure our room was always cleaned on time.Over all it was a great experience, the flaws and cons were just mild things, so i would recommend staying here if your looking for a cheaper hotel but one that is decent looking, friendly, and close to the beach and attractions.",California,9,4.0

While the hotel itself could use a good facelift, our room was clean and the staff was very friendly. As it was, we were so busy that we were not in the room much at all. We did a lot of driving and had a rental car and the Sheraton PK has a good parking structure which is extremely convenient, but best of all, the parking was FREE!!!!! I don't know if that's standard or if it's because we are part of the rewards program, but free parking in prime real estate in Hawaii is unheard of -- even for hotel guests. Location is great because you walk right past the pool and you've got all the shopping and restaurants you could want. However, if you're looking for a relaxing, laid back Hawaiian vacation, this isn't the location for you. There's a lot of people and navigating Kauakala street (I think that's the name of the main avenue) is challenging at night with all of the crowds.

We were told we would have a ""city view"" in the Princess Kiulani wing with wireless internet and a BALCONY to sit on at night and view the city lights (we thought).. We arrived after a 14 hour flight from Florida and no sleep since 2 am (add 6 hrs). only to be escorted to the ROOM FROM HELL! It was like an old Motel 6. The room was old, small and very outdated, the a/c didn't work and the 3rd floor balcony was right over the very LARGE TRASH CONTAINER WHICH SMELLED LIKE A SEWER!!! Forget being outside at all! Oh, and the view was of the parking garage. Oh and then the sliding door immediately stuck open and maintenance had to be called. My boyfriend was SOOOOO embarrassed as he had planned a beautiful vacation for us and spent a huge sum of money on the trip.Well, he called down to the desk....... which I have to say the staff was very nice...... but the only room they supposedly had open was in the same wing, with the same view, same very outdated style, only on the 11th floor. He was told they could get us another room the next day (which turned out to be nicer and larger with a balcony over the pool) for $20 more per night!!! The old ""bait and switch"" routine..Once we were in the new room on the 7th floor, which was larger, nicer decor, comfortable, had a pool view and a partial view of the ocean and surfers, we had a wonderful stay, but we couldn't believe they would even suggest anyone stay in the first room we had! What a terrible way to treat guests staying 9 days in your hotel! And it's not like we had just walked in looking for a room for the night! We had an agent book us a month ahead!!!Would also tell everyone to plan on eating offsight. Breakfast is ONLY buffet style for about $29 per person. We asked for just 2 cups of coffee ""to go"" one morning and they asked for the full amount. Of course we objected and ended up spending $6 just for coffee. FYI: There's a coffee stand on the main street just in front of the hotel past the pool that has great coffee a lot cheaper.......... with a place to sit so you can people watch. And there's a McDonald's two blocks away and a Burger King just across the side street...... plus beautiful pool patio restaurants across the street on the beach with some awesome buffetts for the same money.The hotel is located centrally to all that is happening in Waikiki. The nightly poolside Hawaiian music and hula dancers are relaxing to watch from your balcony if you happen to face the pool (which I suggest). FYI: There are many street artists and musicians and even a street preacher on the main street in front of the shops which are in front of the hotel until 11pm that are very noisy from the crowds cheering, Plan on staying up til they stop their activities. But be sure to check them out!Finally, the wireless internet connection was terrible. I bought a new Ipad just for this trip as we wanted to research condos (we're hoping to retire there in 3 years) and had to go to McDonald's to use it. The good news: your added ""daily hotel fee"" includes parking. Also there are 3 ABC stores within one hundred ft of the hotel. For those of you who donm't know, those are NOT liquor stores although they do carry some great rum! You can get everything there: souveniers, snacks, fruit, sandwiches, sushi, cokes, t-shirts, sarongs, etc. Save your receipts!!! at $100 you get a freebie!The bad news: the ""fruits and water"" they say they say they serve you twice a day in front of the DUKE at Kuhio Beach is only an apple and bottled water. They come find you (as you have a striped pool towel to identify you). They only found us once. Their advertising makes it sound like there's a ""spread"" awaiting you. There is not so eat before you go.OH, I must mention this. There is a great ukelele teacher that gives free lessons in the lobby each week.. He and his group also play by the pool at night one night a week. Look for him. NOt only does he teach you to play, he has some very interesting stories about the Hawaiian people AND he can tell you where and what the locals eat. Also the hula lessons in the lobby are fun. Be sure to join in or at least watch!All in all, we had a good time, BUT, we would probably NOT stay at this hotel againunless they GUARANTEED our room........... which we were told they don't do until you arrive.

If you are going to Waikiki on a vacation stay at one of the other Starwood resorts (if you prefer Starwood hotels like we do). You will be glad you did. Starting with the check in, the woman checking in seemed bothered she had to help us. I asked to give her my SPG number and she seemed inconvenienced, and then made a comment that I wasn’t even a platinum member. Should that matter?The hotel is VERY outdated. I know that Starwood has been re-doing tons of hotels across the globe (they mention it frequently on the SPG channel on the TV), but I have no idea how the Sheraton Princess missed the list. I would think it would be at the top of the list. The rooms were outdated, almost no décor what-so-ever. The AC was TERRIBLE. We sweated every night all through the night. The thermostat is a “knob” and you can’t control the temperature or anything. We didn’t ask to move because the hotel was so outdated we assumed they were all the same in every room. The hotel is noisy overall too. We had to sleep with the TV on all night long to try to drown out the sounds. You can hear a lot in the surrounding rooms both adjacent and above. The “activities” coordinator was useless. We tried to see her before breakfast she was talking to someone which was fine so we got our food and went to try again. She was still talking to the same person when we came back, and had multiple groups of people waiting around her. They appeared to be chit-chatting more than talking about activities. We didn’t want to wait around for her, and only had a simple question so we called from our room. She wouldn’t answer our question, told us to come down to the lobby to see her and that she was very busy. Well we weren’t about to try that again and we walked across the street to the Westin where we were helped professionally. They helped us in about 1 minute and we were on our way.I guess if there is any positive to this hotel, it is the location. Though it is not on the beach, it is across the street. It is close to many stores, restaurants etc which makes it nice. I would say it is centrally located. We spent as much time as possible away from the hotel. We spent our time at the beautiful Sheraton Waikiki (5 minute walk) and the Moana Surfrider Westin (directly across the street) which is a phenomenal hotel. You can charge everything to your room there so we enjoyed a nice resort hotel since we were not staying at one. I wish our breakfast vouchers were vailid at the sister hotels like they were in Maui!If you are visiting the area on a vacation, I don’t think you will enjoy this hotel. The price may be a little cheaper, but you get what you pay for. Hopefully Starwood sinks some money into this hotel and brings it up to the standard people expect from Sheraton hotels.","Boston, Massachusetts",9,2.0

They accommodated us in every way. We stayed at Sheraton Princess for 6 nights on the top floor (29th) in a Oceanview room. Our trip was wonderful not to mention during the trip my fiancé proposed to me on the beach which was priceless. Because we got engaged, the hotel sent about two bottles of wine and a bottle of champagne during our visit. We would come up to the room and our champagne would be nice and chilled for us enjoy. The hotels pool/bar area was relaxing. There is someone at the towel desk at all times. The night entertainment was very tranquil. The hotel accommodated us with each room service order. A few things I would have a minor negative feedback on was the service of the waitress at the outdoors hotel restaurant. She really took her time to serve us. The second would be that the hotel doesn't have a Jacuzzi or whirlpool. The third would be that the hotel is slightly outdated but still comfortable. Its not 4 star but a great hotel to stay in to relax for a bit and then be out and about. The travel desk was very helpful with accommodating our trip wishes.

Having chosen the hotel due to the ""Sheraton"" branding we expected a certain level of quality. The location is really first class with views of Waikiki beach and in the centre of all the action.We found the check in staff very rude when checking in and out, we were the only people at the desk both times but got the feeling they had better things to do rather than serving guests. The bell guys we found very pleasant and the tour organiser Tommy was a very helpful and polite chap who helped us no end.The room was ok, nothing special, we have stayed in better quality Motels in the USA, so not really the standard we were expecting from a Sheraton. The bed was ok no complaints there, the bathroom was basic and very dated.The hotel has a compulsory $12 a day resort fee; this we felt was a complete rip off. It included ""High speed Internet access""! This is not Wi-Fi it is a cable on the desk in the room, no good if you have an IPhone or HTC like we did. You also get 2 bottles of water a day (which we never used) and free towels at the pool. So basically we paid $12 a day for towels which are included free at most other hotels I have stayed at.My advice would be if you are just looking for a room and get a good rate this hotel is ok, if you are looking for something a bit special and want to avoid the $12 resort fee choose one of the many other hotels in and around this one.","Cheltenham, United Kingdom",1,3.0

We decided on this hotel because it was close to the beach and was next door to the hotel the wedding was at. Come to find out it is in one of the best locations in Waikiki. We were very happy with this place because of its close location to everything and that it was cheap. With that in mind we were able to check out several of the rooms because most of the wedding visitors stayed there. If you are looking for a nicer room at this place try to stay in a room in the center tower of far left from the front desk. Our room was to the right of the front desk and like some reviews, it is old. The rooms were dated and the bathrooms looked like an 80's dormroom bathroom. However everything was clean and the beds were very comfortable. We paid around $130 a night and stayed 6 nights. We stayed one night at a hotel across the street (because that was where the wedding was at) and paid $280. It was very nice. But saving $150 a night times 6 nights we were able to go shark cage diving, pearl harbor, catamarans, surfing, and fine dining. We are the kind people who are hardly ever in our room on vacation so we didn't care what it looked like. So if you are picky about having a flat screen, nice furniture, and an updated bathroom then I would pick somewhere else. The staff was extremely helpful and nice. This place is close to shops but doesn't really have any in the hotel, which is nice because only the hotel guests are wondering through the property.

Looked like 1970's Holiday Inn decor, but the room I had did have a nice sized frig and the bed was good (but not Westin good). However, the other rooms my party stayed in did not have a frig, so be careful when booking if you need one. Not the cleanest place either.

But there are 10-15 hotels in a three block radius that offer the same great central location and I’m sure a better quality stay.When we first arrived the hotel looked fine, although I’ve never seen a lobby this busy before. I assumed it was simply because it was check-in time. Unfortunately I was wrong. It’s always busy with hordes of people trampling this way and that, or queuing for the reception or elevator which adds up to create a bustling and what can only be describes as unrelaxing atmosphere.After waiting for 20 mins to check-in my partner and I went up to our High Ocean Room only to discover we didn’t have much of an ocean view and unbelievably two single beds on opposite sides of the small room. Not the romantic getaway we had in mind.After complaining we were switched to a room on the opposite side of the hallway. This time it did have the king sized bed I had requested when booking and a slightly better ocean view. The rest of the room though was still very disappointing. The balcony was small and cramped, the railings rusty and the chair and miniature table looked like they had weathered more than their fair shares of Hawaiian storms.The bathroom was also cramped and in desperate need of an update, which goes for almost every aspect of the hotel.To top off our disappointment the lobby, which also acted as the buffet dinner area (very strange indeed), was filled with an unappetising stench every night from 5pm onwards as the food sat out for the busy foot traffic to admire and well, hold their breath. We never did work out which dish made this smell, as needless to say we didn’t sample the food - but thanks to the hotels location there are plenty of restaurants to chose from near-by.If I could book my holiday again, I don’t think it would be a surprise to you I would not stay at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani. Instead I would most definitely spend the extra $200-300 dollars it would have cost me for the entire week to stay at one of the many other hotels near by.","Sydney, Australia",1,2.0

You are there for the amazing natural beauty and history that this indescribable land has to offer. So here goes the review:Location: RIGHT ACROSS from world famous Waikiki beach. Right in the middle of all the action. City views on one side and the ocean on the other. Convenient to restaurants, shopping malls and anything else you would ever need.Pool: eeeeeehhhhh....not terrible...but I prefer the beach anyway for swimming and lounging. But the pool provided plenty of shade if needed, lounge chairs towels. My only issue was that it is nestled in the middle of the hotel's buildings and felt somewhat confined. Rooms: So I was fortunate enough to be up on the 25th floor. It is a preferred room and you will pay more but I had a beautiful view or the city, mountains and the oceans. You most likely will NOT see diamond head because of where the hotel is located and the juxtaposition of the surrounding hotels...but double check if that is on you list of wants. As for the room itself...it was a little dated in terms of the carpet, tile in the bathroom and the 80's art work on the wall. There was a flat-screen TV, fridge and coffee maker with YUMMY Kona coffee. And the bed when I needed a good night sleep after hiking and surfing and being in the sun all day was oh so comfy!Food: There is a buffet option for BLD. I only ate breakfast there one morning and it was very good...and the food for the other meals always looked and smelled appetizing. If I remember correctly it was around $20 per meal...but the hotel might offer a deal so again, double check. Most mornings there is a small coffee/bagel stand right off of the pool area that worked for me.Overall, the rooms are very reasonably priced for what you get.","Boston, Massachusetts",29,4.0

We all stayed at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani hotel. This hotel has a great location on Waikiki, across from the Ala Moana Surfrider and 1 block from Waikiki beach. The location is great as the International Marketplace is a few stores down the street and the hotel itself is surrounded by stores. We had a partial ocean view balcony room that oversaw the pool below. At night you can hear tropical music playing below from the hotel's restaurant by the pool and the entertainment from the busy Waikiki strip and International Marketplace. It was really breezy during our stay so there was no need for A/C. The room was very compact and not the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. I felt they were a little outdated and should be replaced although they didnt disturb our sleep that much. The room decors along with the beddings and furniture are also outdated. They really need a new modern makeover or even fresh paint cuz the room felt as if you were more so in Motel 6 than a Sheraton hotel? The tv was ok, kinda blurry on some channels at times but we barely used it only to check the weather/news. Bathroom is very compact and no counter space at all, but room and bathroom was always clean thanks to housekeeping. Staff was always friendly upon check in and check out, had no problems. We all checked in early, our room wasnt ready and they even offered to have the Bellhop hold our luggages so we can have some lunch and come back. That was nice. The lobby was always very clean and beautiful. It really represented Princess Kaiulani well as her pretty paintings were displayed everywhere and I enjoyed looking/reading all the history the hotel had to offer. There's even a activities desk downstairs if anyone was interested in booking Luaus, Parasailing, jet ski, etc. Daily there would be local vendors in the lobby that sold unique gifts and crafts for purchase so that was interesting to me. We never went to the pool as we were on the beach everyday but the pool was pretty small. And the restaurant downstairs had a nice breakfast buffet although its a little overpriced so note: get the breakfast buffet to go its cheaper $10! haha Best things I liked about the hotel was they gave you beach towels and beach chairs to take with you to the beach so that was a big plus for us! Also i forget, but at certain times of the day the hotel had waiters that came to the beach at a certain location, and you can place drink orders with them. (although we never made it) And it was extremely helpful that we got two free Hawaiian water bottles to take with us to the beach everyday, so we hardly bought water bottles. Thanks (note:These perks are what you get for paying a daily $14 resort charge) The only thing I disliked about the hotel was using the hotel's Internet and printer in the lobby, although its was free to use for 15-20 mins? a day, you must pay attention that its only within a 24hrs period eventhough you did not use all the minutes they give you. Since I didnt know that I was charged and extra $5. And the only reason we ever used their computers was cuz our free wi-fi in our room was always way too slow.

I wanted to be right in the center of Waikiki so that we had a plenty of entertainment and didn't have to travel far. i thought it would be a good introduction for him. The hotel is SO CLOSE to the beach. Only a block away. The mall was a short walk and the Intl Market is right next to the hotel. Here was what was disappointing: the hotel and rooms are terribly outdated. There were stains in our carpet, the lights in the bathroom were florescent as well as outdated and small. I felt that it was was very cheap, if not cheap looking. Our room faced the garage but if we wanted a view, we'd have to pay an extra $50.00 per night. We were there for 7 nights. Not interested in that. We were hearing a swoosh sound at night and morning and would wake us up at night and finally concluded it was the elevators. This surprised us as we didn't feel like we were THAT close to them. The pool closed at 7:00pm which was a downer and there is no hot tub. The ""nightlife entertainment"" was silly at best. The hotel hired ukelele players singing Niel Diamond and John Denver songs in the lobby at night. The crowd was over 60 or full of families. What interest is this for young couples? The hotel had closed the pool at 5:00pm one evening, much to our disappointment, and hired elderly ladies dressed in neon colored bodysuits to do a small performance in the pool. It was very silly as it seems they were imitating dying swans dancing to instrumental music!!!! We'd rather have the pool to ourselves. The good things: they provide a service that allows you to take towels from the pool area to the beach and they come twice in the day to find you on the beach and give you fresh fruit and water. The buffet breakfast was fresh and plentiful. You can get a box and pay only $10.00 for takeaway. There were daily activities in the lobby like pineapple carving, making your own lais, jewelry and photography sellers and so on. This would be a great hotel for families and older folks who are interested in a place to sleep with attractions nearby not for a one of a kind experience, and definitely not for couples looking for a romantic getaway.",Los Angeles,9,3.0

We were here celebrating our 5 yr anniversary and his birthday. Had a wonderful experience at this hotel! It was in a perfect location right next to the international market and right in the heart of waikiki. We were on the 9th floor in the main wing. Our room was a little small and the bathroom was a little out dated. Our room view was out looking the parking lot. Wasnt a very pleasant view. We called down to the front desk to see if we could have a room with a balcony. When we book our flight and hotel through expedia it showed that the standard room came with a balcony. Since it was both our first time in hawaii we didnt know what to expect. Having a balcony would have been nice but it wasnt that big of a deal. Kim at the front desk said it would cost us $40 a night just to upgrade so we didnt bother. We came to hawaii to go out and not stay in our hotel room. My husband and I would go down to the splash bar to get a few drinks during happy hour. It was really nice and relaxing. All the staff were friendly! We are already planning another trip to hawaii in dec for my birthday and will def consider staying at this hotel again.!,"San Jose, California",2,4.0

The room was nice and clean, it had a refrigerator, iron, balcony and the maid came everyday. The location can't be beat, you are right in the middle of everything, the beach, restaurants, shopping and nightlife. I went on several excursions and they picked me up at the hotel or across the street. The shuttle to the airport was only $9.00 and left every half hour. Parking was included in the resort fee as was Internet access in my room. I never ate at the hotel because it is way to expensive, but Dukes is practically right across the street.

I've been staying here since I was a little kid, but haven't been for the past 4 years. Wow, how it has changed in 4 years. Besides the 144 sq ft of a box they put us in, the service is horrible. The people at this hotel treated us like [...] the whole time we stayed here. We had a waitress who was extremely rude who told us they have a 1 drink minimum to sit in the bar area. 1 drink minimum?!?! Maybe it was the way we looked? This is a 2 star hotel at best, who charges a minimum drink order just to sit in the bar/lounge area. Ridiculous! Then, on our last night here, we woke up several times to the drunk guy in the next room pounding and kicking the walls and door. Security was called a couple times and they did come up, but it didn't really help. Then when we tried to get a late checkout because drunko next door kept us up all night, they have no record of it and are only willing to extend it 1 hour. I am very upset with the service we've received here and how this place has gone downhill. It needs a major upgrade and renovation, which probably hasn't been done since the Reagan administration. The only thing it really has going is the central location. Overall? If you like second class treatment, the late 80's non intentional nostalgic look of a hotel, a cheap hotel with a good location across from the beach then this is it. Just don't eat at the restaurant or get anything but a beer from the bar. Of the over 20 restaurants we ate at in Waikiki on our trip, this was the only one that had bland food and watered down drinks. Take my advice, check out the other hotels in the area with similar pricing.","San Ramon, California",3,1.0

Mid morning flight from Maui to Oahu & wow shock horror - allowed to check in at 12.20 p.m. - top marks Sheraton !!! - It is a big hotel so I guess there is always rooms available.Allocated room on the 7th floor in the main building, (not the newer tower) with pool view & partial ocean view, not bad really for $125 a night in Waikiki beach. Okay sized room, a tad dated & worm but well looked after & very clean. Bed was very comfortable as Sheraton beds normally are. Blackout blinds so no light at 6 a.m. - good marksBathroom was a bit old but very clean & useable. Plenty of towels & soaps. Fridge in room & coffee makers with 2 lots of coffee which was replaced every day. Resort fee was a steal at $12, which included free parking for the duration in the multistorey car park next to the hotel ( a relief really not to be driving around hunting for a space) 2 x 500 ml bottles of water, replaced every day without fail & 20 minutes of internet time on the computers in the lobby. Overall very good value. There was also a fitness room if you wanted to use it, it seemed ok. Maid service in the morning tended to start at 9 so Do not disturb Sign night before if you are a slow riser. Did not have breakfast at the hotel as it was not included in rate but there are lots of ABC stores & coffee shops nearby. The location of the hotel is fab, opposite The White Lady Sheraton & very near to all the shops & restaurants. Ideal. Pool area was fine, a little busy sometimes & it is very near the street but acceptable. Pool towels were large & great for the beach.Would recommend to stay again. Beware at night of the parallel street - Kuhio Avenue, it is a bit colorful, lots of ladies of the night wandering around, a bit imitidiating.Ate at CheeseCake Factory & California Pizza Kitchen twice - (please come to the UK) and also at Room Without a Key - okay if you like Asian style also ate at Lulus - good bar area in open are surroundings !!!

Sadly from there on in the service slipped, staff service was mixed, nothing major but a number of the staff didn't seem bothered and therefore failed to provide a friendly, helpful service. We also found that the free wifi service didn't seem to make up to the 3rd floor.. we also stood for 5 minutes waiting to see if we could get served at the bar before giving up. At the time there were 3 people at the bar.. with us and 1 other person waiting to get served. The nail in the coffin was the price paid for the breakfast and the quality of the food.

I am a Starwoods member, and frankly, it was a huge let down to stay here after stays at other properties. My partner and I are staying here tonight -- thankfully for only one night -- as we have a flight out in the morning. This entire hotel needs to be torn down -- which in fact is going to happen in 2013. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, especially those sensitive to noise, mold or mildew. We booked a ""deluxe ocean view"" room initially, only to find that it was a small, sad room with a very small bathroom. We could live with that, but soon we realized that the walls were paper thin and we could hear singing and conversations in the adjoining room, which was a deal-breaker. Down we went to stand in line again and ask for a change of room, which the front desk manager was NOT happy to accommodate. He finally gave us a key to a room higher up on the 25th floor, assuring us that did not have any adjoining room and that it also had an ocean view. But when we moved all our luggage up to the new room,we discovered it had no ocean view whatsoever, and furthermore it also had an adjoining room. Down we went again, had to wait once again in an even larger line, and only to hear that the front desk manager did not have anything else to offer, defending the move as having ""Iocean view status"" -- whatever that meant!. I told him there was no ocean view which I had paid extra for -- but he became mute and could not offer anything else, at which point a hotel guest service manager came out. She said she was so sorry and was upgrading us to the largest suite in the hotel, but we had to wait until after 8 to have access. When we did finally get into the suite, we found to be huge, basically a full apartment, but riddled with mold and mildew, and very dated. It did have a very large ocean view -- but this was somehow unappealing as the lanai in front must have leaked water at some point into the living room, as it reeked of mildew so strongly that I could hardly breathe. As I have severe mold allergies, my eyes started burning, but as it is late at night, I think we will be forced to simply o open every door and window to get air in to combat the mold situation as best as we can. Very upsetting, and a health issue -- but I have given up trying to secure a better room for the night. Cannot wait to leave!","Mill Valley, California",59,1.0

When we asked her to remove them she said ""Oh they're for the pigeons""The pigeons?? What did she mean. We soon found out. The restaurant was by the pool and was absolutely crawling with pigeons. As soon as a guest moved from their table they descended, ripping apart the scraps. This was a bit of a problem as it was a buffet breakfast and we had to get up. We went to get food in shifts, the other person defending our table from the flying vermin. Even if we had used the food covers I wouldn't be happy with the pigeons walking all over the tables and potentially peeing and pooing.Periodically a staff member would come out and bang banana leaves on the tables to scare them away, or throw a bucket of ice at them. This worked - for a couple of minutes and then they returned.I commented to the waitress that they were a problem and she told me ""Yes, we feed them in the morning so they really shouldn't come back""Hmmmmm, to me if you feed a scavenger that just means they know where to get food.

I found my High Oceanview room excellent. The view was wonderful (facing Diamond Head and the ocean). The room was spotless with the standard furnishings, wonderful quiet A.C. and a lovely welcoming fruit basket delivered by a nice staff member. The concierge and front desk staff were very helpful. Every other day I'd planned a tour and the front entry man made sure he watched for my tour group / pick-up shuttle. He was awesome. When you arrive, they tag your bags with your room number and they deliver them so you don't have to juggle them during your check-in which was fast and easy. The hotel is a 2 minute walk to the main street and beach. There is an abundance of cafe's, snack bars, fast food places and a ABC variety store right across the street. The only negative's I experienced was the traffic flow inside the hotel and the very pricy buffet meals. They have a main aisle to the elevators (4) but you are ""herded"" into a narrow walk-through due to some of the buffet food tables being on both sides and local artisians with display tables in the same area. Makes it very crowded and frustrating to get through. The buffet meals are costly ($65+ per person for dinner) but the foods offered are really top-notch. It was way out of my price range so I ate out. A really neat thing they offer is an option to not have housekeeping for up to 2 days in a row. On the days I was out on tours, I had housekeeping but not on the days I was in the hotel. Each time I declined, I received a $5 certificate you can use in any place in the hotel. I saved mine and splurged on a room service breakfast on my last day. I understand the hotel was to be closed for reno's shortly after my stay.

One of our friends that we were traveling with recommended this hotel as he had stayed there before. Be had booked a flight and hotel package. The package listed the room as a ""Standard Room"" which we were okay with since we really didn't plan on spending much time in the room. When we got there we were actually dismayed. We were told our rooms were in the Kaiulani wing. We asked if that was the main tower and were told no. We asked if we could move the main tower and were told no as they didn't have any rooms available. We decided to give the room a try. When we walked in the room I was shocked and my partner was more so. I now knew what all the reveiws were talking about. This room was in no way a Sheraton ""Standard"". The bed itself was surprisingly nice. However, it was the bathroom that really turned us off. The chrome on the legs of the sink were chipping, there were yellowing stains on the tub, the mat was peeling up, hard water stains covered the shower head, the floor tile was cracking due to age. There was no way we could be comfortable there for 6 nights! I do have to say it was clean, but it was run down and not taken care of at all. I have stayed in Travel Motels on the highway in better shape then that room. We went back to the front desk and talked to the manager and told them our complaint. They were gracious about it, but they were not able to accomodate us that night, but were able to move us the next night. An inconvenience, but worth it. They moved our luggage while we were out during the day and gave us new rooms. They considered this an upgrade (and didn't charge us), which from the room we were at before, it was like we walked into a luxury room. But the truth is, it was more along the lines of what a Sheraton ""Standard"" room should be. The view was amazing from the new room. The bathroom while still outdated, was much nicer.

We had an ocean view room on the 10th floor. Our Lanai also overlooked the pool area, it was nice to be able to watch the evening entertainment from it.Yes as others have previously said the decor in the rooms and the bathroom could do with a makeover. This did not impact on our stay what so ever though. The pool area was lovely and I really liked the open feel to the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We arrived at 12pm and as our room was available we were able to get checked in right away. This was most welcome as we were on the 2nd day of a long journey from the UK to Hawaii.The grounds of the hotel are pretty. The hotel is centrally located for everyrhing. The walk to the beach took about 3 minutes.We ate snacks on the terrace by the pool and had a few beverages during happy hour. Very good quality food. Wine was $4 a glass during happy hour.Travelling with kids it was useful to have a coin op laundry in the basement.I could not find any fault with this hotel and would happily recommend it to other travellers.","Cwmbran, United Kingdom",375,5.0

They had some kind of show/singing most evenings down by the pool. If your room faces this side, you can hear it loud and clear---no investment in soundproof glass or anything. In addition, some of the street dancers like to hang out right outside the hotel, so you can hear their music loud and clear also. This combo made the balcony significantly less pleasant for me at night.Internet---I got it for free through my conference deal, but they were charging others outrageous rates.All in all, I was happy with everything given the price I paid (a block rate), but will opt for something a bit more subdued next time.","New York City, New York",371,3.0

We stayed nine days and nights as it was out tenth wedding anniversary. We found the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani hotel to be worth every penny. It was near the beach, clean, comfortable and near the main part of Waikiki Beach. There is also an ABC Store just across the street and are plenty of places close by where one can have a romantic breakfast or late night meal. We also liked the fact that it has a work out facility that is better than most found in hotels and stands next door to the International Market Place. At the IMP, we bought probably half or more of our souvenirs. Excellent place to go for gifts or for that aloha shirt or two or 25 you want to take home. The hotel also has a pool that is lots of fun, where they give you free towels and where you can sun yourself and read, free from sand and the walk to the beach. My wife and I plan to stay here again some day. The only downer was that we originally were near the elevators in a small room, so I would advise talking with the hotel before you go to make sure you are not getting that room. Otherwise, you will find it hard to sleep as the elevators are noisy and unrelenting. We went to the front desk and spend $30 a night to upgrade, but it was worth it. The room we ended up with overlooked the pool and had a great view from about six stories up. The nightly entertainment was also good, for the people who went to the open air lounge area.

I appreciate the high quality of service and standards typically found at their hotels. My stay at the Princess Kaiulani was a disappointment. In fact, I checked out after one night and moved to a nearby hotel and was much happier. First, I will start with the positives. All of the employees were friendly and helpful. For example, when I requested a quiet room, they quickly moved me away from the International Market. The hotel is clean and only a short walk from the beach. I did not eat at the Sheraton, so I cannot comment on the restaurants.That being said, the hotel is in need of a major renovation. It feels like a large apartment building constructed in the 1960s. My room felt sparse and unwelcoming. Even the bed wasn't as comfortable as I'm used to at a Sheraton. One of my favorite hotels is the Sheraton at Poipu Beach on Kauai, which was also built a long time ago but which has be redone and now feels quite luxurious. The Sheraton Kauilani still feels dated and low end. The pool is quite small and unattractive--yet they charge a $12/day resort fee to use it and use hotel towels. You can find similar hotels nearby for more reasonable rates--and even nicer hotels for lower rates--I did and was much happier after making the move.

This is a much older hotel comparing to the rest of the Sheraton hotels. We did not even bother to turn on the ancient TV in our room, and had to keep the balcony door open for a couple nights to avoid the extremely noisy and old AC. When we first arrive, we asked the hotel staff for recommendations on restaurants in walking distant and was suggested to the more expensive places that we thought was not worth recommended. During our 5 days stay, we paid $15 each day for resort fees, and the housekeeper forgot to provide us the 2 bottle of water as promised twice. Since we did not rent a car, we did not use the parking permit at all (which also included in the resort fees) in the first 4 days. However, the hotel made us paid extra for parking our two mopeds we rented for one day at the tiny little spot with at least 5 more mopeds/ motocycles, and it was in fact just the extra space for handicaped parking. I was complaining to the front desk but was promtly said the manager would not waive the parking fees. We checked out the buffet at the hotel and not recommended it. The hotel does not provide airport shuttle which I am not so sure if it was a common thing among Waikiki hotels.On a positive note, the room was spacious and clean and has a nice balcony where you can people watching and enjoying the view from up high. The hotel provides some live entertainment by the pool at night and beach services for free for hotel guests although we did not take advantage of these offers. The location was great - just one block from the beach and all the fun shops in Waikiki. We also loved the food court inside the International Market Place right next to the hotel, where you can find good food at great prices.Overall, I feel like with the price we paid, we should have had a much better experience.

The minute that I got there, my mind was set at ease. We stayed on the second floor with a pool view. The room was very clean, (cleaned daily) thankyou Nely and one other lady that I didnt get her name. The beds were comfy and the room was very quiet! We stayed a week at this hotel and both kids said they would rather go back here than go to Disneyland! There was plenty to see and do right there in the lobby! Uncle Nate helped us make beautiful lei's, we missed the hula lessons but the pineapple carving demonstration was refreshing in the middle of a hot day, not to mention the local artists showing their talents off. Great souveniers made right in front of you. We loved that the location of this hotel was right in the middle of everything and a one minute walk to the beach. They have beach chairs to take down to the beach and towels so that you dont have to pack up sandy wet towels. Everyone that we came in contact with was very helpful. Especially during an unfortunate tsunami alert. Staff helped put us at ease, when we thought the worste! For the price that you pay for this hotel it is without a doubt the best place to stay in Waikiki. There is a 13$ resort fee per day but it included free parking for our rental car, as well as 60 minutes of free long distance calling per day! That came in very handy to call family that was worried about the tsunami. Also, because our flight home left late at night we could store our luggage in a secure room and we also used a hospitality room to shower and change before our flight. I couldnt have asked for a better place to stay!",BC,4,5.0

Actually there isn't any bell desk either. So don't expect anybody to help you with the bags or park your car for you. You can park yourself at the parking garage in the back of the hotel. Internet + Parking is approximately 20 bucks a day. So in terms of service I have to say that there is none.The location of this hotel can't be beat. Right across you have the Moana Surfrider and Hyatt Waikiki is next door. Both of these neighbors would charge significantly more money than Sheraton Princess Kaiulani. So if you like to be centrally located but not paying top bucks, this is the hotel for you.The room...what can I say. It is extremely, extremely small. We got the top floor ocean view room which is the most expensive room they have, and we couldn't walk in the room after we put all our luggages. It really was ridiculously small. I live in New York City so I am very used to small room and trust me, the rooms here are EXTREMELY small. It is pretty clean and the maintenance does a good job at keeping things clean in this hotel.The hotel can use more of a facelift. It feels a little bit run-down. The gym is nice it has all the essentials that you will need.Basically if you do not like paying too much for hotel rooms, but still like to be in the center of the roudy Waikiki, this is your hotel. You'll just need to make sure that you do not mind parking the car yourself, and small rooms don't bother you.",New York,24,3.0

It was also nice that the hotel has a computer so you can check your emails (fee is already part of the daily resort fee), and you can also print your boarding pass for free. Lastly, I forgot to sign in my name when I returned the beach towels on my last day. I was worrying a bit that I might get charged a super high fee even though I returned it but the hotel person was super friendly & said no worries with a smile :) staff is super friendly! Now hopefully I do not see a charge on my credit card since they did not take my name. :)Only gripes were that the Wifi's only worked first couple days & stopped working toward end of the trip & room-keeper didn't replenish our room with water bottles daily. It only happened 2 or 3 nights out of the 5 nights we stayed. Lastly, room was a bit small & we only got a queen bed even though we requested two beds & I have Starwood preferred card. All in all, any of the negatives weren't that big of a deal. :) Just know that you're not paying four or five star quality hotel so just be warned in advance, if you want a luxury hotel, you'll need to pay the extra and stay elsewhere. This place was perfect & fulfilled our purpose of coming to Hawaii. :)","Seattle, Washington",6,4.0

This is one of the worst hotels on the boulevard. The rooms are very small and dated. (The size of a big Closet) The paint and carpets are dirty and stained. The locals have nick names for the hotel and none of them are good. The two groups the hotel targets are Asians & industry workers who need to spend the night in town. The Atmosphere was like a motel rather than aHawaiian resort hotel. The staff main concern is the Asian travelers, you will not be served unit you ask. I was told by an employee that the Asian economy is good and that's there main target group. There's only one place to eat and it looked bad and overpriced 59.95 per person for a little buffet (no seafood) on lawn chairs. If you can find another hotel for same rate stay their you'll thank me.

We went through a Hawaiian Airline package and would have been relegated to a room overlooking a parking lot, except that when I asked about our room on check in and found out about the parking lot, I asked for an upgrade overlooking the pool (I had read about this from another TA reviewer). It was an additional $20 per night, but well worth it. We were put in the original wing overlooking the pool on the 7th floor with a view of pool, Kalakaua Avenue, Moana Surfrider Hotel and ocean. Incredibly, we have a painting of the Moana Surfrider over our mantel at home that we've had for years and now this was our exact view. The room was comfortable and clean. My only complaint was the bathroom door that is a super heavy wood pocket door that made a lot of noise when pushing it open or closed (not good during night); I think a plantation shutter type bi-fold door would be so inexpensive and look nice so I don't understand why Sheraton wouldn't make an easy upgrade to something like this.Other than that the room was perfect. Restaurant options were good and we lunched there once, but had so much fun heading out every night to try different places. And, this is the best part of this hotel....the location is fantastic right across from the beach and the heart of Waikiki.Staff at the front desk, bar and restaurant and concierge were all friendly and helpful.","Pleasanton, California",28,4.0

Check in was easy, staff was very friendly. The lobby was very outdated but still welcoming. We stayed in the tower with a partial ocean view on the 26th floor. The elevators were a little slow, but overall didn't really seem to bother us too much. The view was completely gorgeous and we enjoyed watching the sunset over Waikiki each night. We did not eat at the hotel so can't really comment on the food. The house keepers were great and never missed a night and always did a fantastic job. The daily service charge of 12.50 didn't seem so bad considering that it included parking, internet and also daily water in the room. For the price we paid, we got a lot of 'bang' for the buck. Having said all of this.... there were a few hotels across the street along the beach that were very updated and very nice. If I had the extra money, I probably would have preferred to stay in one of them. But, with what I had the stay was great. And no matter what hotel you stay in everything seems crowded. I visited pools where the rooms were $400/night and the guests still had to get up early for lounge chairs and wait for bar service.

I've stayed at this Sheraton Hotel previously several years ago. At that time they were promising millions of $$$ in renovations. This time I was expecting better rooms in the Kaiulani Wing (where the cheapest prices put you). Don't get me wrong, the Hotel is in an absolutely great location. Instead, I was greeted with the exact type of room with 20-30 year old bathroom fixtures, IKEA styled desk-shelves-drawer combo and a 26"" CRT (Tube type) TV. It faces the back of the hotel where, all late night long (2PM and after), you hear the trash compactor running or being exchanged and delivery trucks backing up to the loading docks.Due to the Northeast storm, I had to extend my stay an additional 2 days where I would have had to move to a different room. The other room was on a lower floor but the same wing and the same side of the building. Luckily, I had the fortune of getting a sharp Front Desk Customer Service person (Sharen) who talked her Supervisor into not having me pack and move.Read the fine print - they also hit you with a $12/day ""Resort Fee"" which gives you 2 bottles of water, parking, free internet, and a special place with some services on Waikiki Beach. Your SPG (Sheraton) card will not get you any points if you book through a 3rd party (Orbitz, Travelocity, etc.).My recommendation - if you stay, don't go for the cheaper rooms, get an ocean view room and upgrade to the nicer 2 wings of the Hotel or try another hotel.","Honolulu, Hawaii",66,2.0

The wall paper was pealing, the faucets were rusting, and the decor is not up to the Starwood hotel level. The good things about the hotel was the staff. Very pleasant.

However, I wish there were a few things that could be improved... Let's begin...I booked a hotel room at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani for three nights in January 2011. The hotel is situated right in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki Beach and right next to the International Marketplace. Upon check-in, I requested a quiet room as I have read in previous reviews that a few rooms tend to draw in noise, etc... I was quickly shot down with a quip, ""This is Honolulu, everywhere you stay is going to be loud."" I was a little taken back by that. I received a key and ended up in a room next to the elevator shaft. The room I was given, was in fact, noisy -- not because of street vendors or cars, but because of the elevators constantly running. I initially thought I could live with it, but alas, had to go back downstairs to request a new room. This is EXACTLY what I was hoping to prevent in the first place. A nicer, front desk staff member (Jennifer) helped and was able to locate a better room further away from the elevator shaft. Awesome! Upon returning from that evenings activities, Randi, an awesome Sheraton staff member left a very nice card and a small concession. What a great surprise and a perfect example of customer care by Randi. (Thanks, dude!)The rest of my stay there was very relaxing. The resort fees are water bottle inclusive and I had to request water twice. Other than that, staying at the Sheraton was pretty transparent. Did I mention that the location of the hotel was convenient? A simple walk across the street through the Westin Surfrider takes you straight into the Waikiki Beach. Towels are provided at the pool area. The pool staff were laid back, but attentive. It can get quite crowded during the day, so get to the pool as early as you can. Overall, I thought my stay was more than decent and if you're trying to decide wether or not to stay here, do it! It's a no-frills hotel with a great location. The room I was in needed a bit of updating (can we say 80's time warp?), but nevertheless comfortable and it did it's job. Except for the initial check-in staff member, the staff were very nice and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family.Mahalo for reading!","Newport Beach, California",50,4.0

I was very nervous after reading some of the other reviews but all of my fears were completely unfounded. Yes it is an older hotel, yes the walls are a little thin. But we didn't have any problems.

We have stayed at many other hotels in Waikiki, but love the Princess the most. Each time our visit gets longer because we leave thinking we wish we had a couple more days. Every year before our trip I read the reviews on Trip Advisor and I am horrified. I think to myself that it must have gone down hill and we are going to be stuck in a rotten room for 10 days. Then I get there and it is the same wonderful Princess it always is. I really don't understand these complaints --these have never been my experiences. Sure, it's not brand new, but the rooms are clean and comfortable. In fact, my husband has not had a good night sleep since we got home because he misses his PK bed!In the past it could be a bit nosy, mostly because of the awful drummer on the street below. Well, to my sheer delight the drummer is gone! (Drums are not a solo instrument!) He has been replaced by some dancers. This alone was a highlight of our trip.Yes, the Princess was as great as always. Same delightful staff. Same Aunties working in housekeeping. The bands are some of the best in Waikiki. The nightly entertainment is so excellent. Consider yourself lucky to hear Kapena DeLima who plays in the lobby. He has the most amazing voice in the world. I did catch his family across the street at the Moana & Royal. Do they ever play at the Princess anymore? Maybe I missed them. The lemony Mai Tai at the Pikaki Terrace or poolside is a great change from the overly sweet pineapple ones so common at many places. Each one is beautifully garnished. Every meal we ate was great and affordable.I have one concern: The Princess is slated for renovation. Will I still be able to afford to stay here? Will the wonderful staff still work here?

We got a good deal ($99/night)) and despite mixed reviews we decided to give it a go because of its excellent location. The location (right across the street from the beach, middle of waikiki, walking distance to great food) was by far the best thing about this hotel. The lobby/pool area was very nice as well. Our room had a nice view of the parking garage behind the hotel but I kind of expected that having gone through priceline. First off the wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls and we found a roach in our room the first night (and ya, I know, it Hawaii and its kind of hard to completely stop the insects but its still gross). I called and complained about the roach and they promptly sent someone up with a can of raid and sprayed it all around the room.Next, when you check in they inform you about a ""resort fee"" costing $12.50/day thats supposed to cover water bottles in your room, water and fruit at a specified area on the beach, beach towels, chairs, and one or two other things I can't remember. We didn't get any water bottles until our 3rd day there. We asked about 4 people at the hotel where to get the fruit and water at the beach and only one guy knew where it was. We spent 2 days on the beach in the ""designated area"" and saw nobody delivering the promised cold fruit and H20. To their credit they were happy to refund our resort fee when we checked out. The bed was average, sheets were good, the pillows were plastic and uncomfortable and the carpet wasn't super clean. One thing to note is rooms do not have individual thermostats so if you like your hotel rooms super cold like me then this might be a concern. The bathroom was nice and clean with ample hot water but the drain was a little slow. Despite the many problems we encountered the staff was nice and helpful throughout our stay.

What a disappointment, from beginning to end. I paid for the room in advance, to get the best price, so we were pretty much stuck once we got there. Here's the story: We checked in late at night, went to our room, and went straight to bed. When we woke up, we found small spider-like bugs crawling on the walls, the furniture, the floors, and inside the drawers. When I went to the front desk to report it, I had to wait for the desk person to go get the manager. While waiting, I heard a couple next to me at the desk check into the hotel, be told that their room was ready and that they could go directly to their room. When the manager came out to the front desk, I described the bugs to him, and he asked if I wanted housekeeping to come spray the bugs. I told him that I wanted a different room. He told me that he would look for a different room, but since check-in time was 3:00 p.m., and it was only 9:00 a.m., no rooms were ready, so we would need to pack our suitcases, leave them with the bellman, and then move them to a new room after 3:00 (despite having heard the couple next to me be given their room immediately). After I went back to my room to pack, the manager called the room and told me that a housekeeping staff member was coming to my room to confirm that the bugs were there. WHAT?!! The housekeeping person looked at the bugs, and said ""hmmm -- I will call the manager."" I asked the housekeeping person if they could please make sure our new room did not have bugs. His response was that it is a tropical climate, so they could not assure me that the new room would not have bugs. We were moved to an identical room, albeit on a higher floor (and thankfully, no bugs), but with no compensation whatsoever for the unpleasant experience and the inconvenience of moving. On the first day that the sun was out during our stay, the pool desk ran out of beach chairs for guest use, the usage charge for which is included in the daily fee charged by the hotel. When I asked the restaurant staff one morning to reheat my coffee drink in their microwave, they refused, and told me they don't reheat anything for guests in their microwaves. (?!) On the only afternoon we went to the pool bar, after sitting at the table for 10 minutes without having a server come to our table, I went to the bar to place my order. A server asked why I was standing at the bar, I told her I wanted to order a drink, and she told me that I needed to find a table and someone would be out to get my order. I told her I had already been waiting 10 minutes at a table. Her response was that I must not be sitting in her section, and she would find the appropriate server. After another 5 minutes, a server came to our table to take our order, and waited another 10 minutes to bring our drinks. On the day we checked out, I asked if we could use a hospitality room to shower and change before going to the airport at 8:00 p.m. The desk person said we could, and that we needed to give them about 30 minutes' notice before we needed the room. At 5:45 p.m., I went to the desk to request to use the hospitality suite. The desk person (different from the one in the morning), told me that both of their hospitality suites were in use, that they were issued on a first come-first served basis, that they did not take names for use of the rooms, that the earliest either of the rooms would be available would be 6:30 p.m., and that I needed to wait, at the counter, to watch for someone to return a key to one of the hospitality rooms. I waited until 6:35, saw someone return a key, and went immediately to the desk person to whom the key had been returned to tell him that I was waiting for the room. He said no problem -- that they needed about 5 minutes to get the room cleaned and stocked with new towels. After about 10 minutes, he brought me the key, and told me we were limited to one hour in the room. When we got to the room, there were no clean towels, there were dirty towels on the floor, and the bathroom had not been cleaned. We immediately called housekeeping (6:45 p.m.) to request clean towels, shower amenities (shampoo, soap), and a hairdryer. At 7:15, the towels and amenities were delivered, and at 7:40, the front desk called to remind us that our one hour was up. Yikes -- we will not be back.","Denver, Colorado",40,2.0

It does need it as the rooms are a little outdated. But they are comfortable and clean (except for the previous occupant's hair in the sink and bathtub; this is a huge annoyance to me, thus the ""2"" for cleanliness.) The balcony was WAY cleaner than the one I had at the Moana Surfrider where we stayed earlier in the trip. The location is great! You are not right on the beach but close enough. As far as I know, they don't have any beach chairs or umbrellas but you can get your own or a mat and enjoy Waikiki Beach right across the street. Two thumbs up and a shout out to the servers in the bar. They turned a simple drink into a really enjoyable experience. And it's really a nice place to sit and enjoy a drink, even if you're not on the beach. The pool area looked really nice though we didn't spend any time there. It looks like the sun is lost behind the Hyatt for part of the morning, at least during the winter months. Wish they could have done something about the pigeons in the restaurant during breakfast. Yuck. One even landed on our table while we were sitting there. We could not get on the internet in either of our rooms. You pay a daily resort fee which includes internet so we did feel like we were not getting what we paid for. The only thing that really irked me (and still does) is that we couldn't get a print-out of our bill. They apparently don't put them under your door early on your last day like 99% of the hotels in North America. I called and asked if they could mail one to us and was told they don't do that either. We didn't want to stand in line (which looked pretty significant at check out on December 31) so the only alternative was to receive the bill by email.

Everyone in Hawaii was amazing except for the staff at the front desk at the Sheraton. From the people who pick you up from the car rental to everyone you meet, afterall it's Hawaii and you come to expect this friendliness from paradise. Upon checking into my room at the Sheraton, I was given 2 double beds on the 2nd floor of the hotel. My reservation was for a King Bed. It didn't occur to me that the front desk did not say something like ""We have you in two double beds in our Standard Escape"", in which I would have explained that was not what I wanted. Instead, I went upto my room only to find 2 double beds. When I went to change this the ""supervisor"" had me sit off to the side and told me Expedia told them 2 double beds which was incorrect. In the end, he practically threw two new keys and although I got the King Bed I ordered it was not professional or hospitable at all. Later I realized I was in a non smoking room but obviously that was falling on deaf ears.  Overall, the place is in a noisy location with street performers all night.

Also, I paid for a ""deluxe ocean view room"".

Moving away from the beach was of course a letdown, but my initial impression of the Princess Kaiulani was positive as the receptionist greeting me was much nicer to look at than the hotel itself, to put it that way. Not only that, but after confirming with her manager, she kindly upgraded us to an ocean view due to our gold SPG status. Now to the negatives:1. It turns out the ocean room was actually a ""partial ocean view"" room, which is a big difference. The only way you could see the ocean was by going out on the balcony, stretching your head out like a giraffe and look to the left. In my opinion, if you can't see the ocean from inside your room, don't call it an ocean view room.2. At night you will suffer from horrible island pling plong music just outside your room, which on some nights continues until midnight. It is not the easiest environment to get your baby to sleep.3. The walls are paper thin. We could hear everything going on at the other end of the wall, and I assume they could as well. It was not a problem the first night when my parents-in-law stayed in the neighboring room, but after they left we felt we could not even watch TV in the evening as it would disturb the people next door (not that we would overpower the island music).4. The rooms are terribly old and seem ready for historic preservation. They have been equipped with small plasma TVs, but otherwise the rooms appear not to have been renovated since the beginning of time. The standard has sunk so low that Japanese school classes are using the hotel as a dormitory during trips to Hawaii. 5. The breakfast is a real downer compared to the food at the Sheraton Waikiki. The food is completely uninspired, not even the many pigeons flying around and sitting on the tables seem eager to eat it. With all the plush hotels around, you have to be a rather dumb pigeon to pick this hotel to dine at. Some of the waitresses are quite friendly though.6. I had a package arrive, but was not notified about this. Fortunately I asked if any mail had arrived when checking out, and was then told that a package had arrived two days earlier. No apology was given.7. The parking lot is extremely old and looks ready to crumble. Make sure to have your life insurance policy ready prior to entering.On a final note, if you are in Oahu, pay the extra bucks and stay on the beach. There is a small pool on the property that is absolutely depressing. If it is not better looked after than the rest of the hotel, the water probably has not been changed since the early 1970s. To end on a positive note, the misery of the hotel made is somewhat easier to leave Hawaii.

I went into Honolulu a day before to enjoy the area before my conference started, lookinf forward to a nice pool and beach experience. Honestly I've had better rooms at a Holiday Inn Express than this place. My room was a hodgepodge of mismatched furniture with two chairs stuffed alongside the curtain and bed. There was no desk chair at all. The lamp had a burned out bulb. The room safe was locked and I had have to have security come open it. Plus their ""resort"" fee for internet is a bit confusing when you go to log on in your room. They need to get that clarified ASAP. But a guide in the room so people know what to do! The benefit is that all the staff I encountered were very nice but this place is tired and in need of a serious renovation. I can't believe Starwood would let a property drop to this level. The location is great but invest a few dollars and make this a worthy Waikiki leisure and business property. Everything about my room was like the Bates motel.

Was accompanied by a teenager and young adults. First time to Hawaii and can't wait to return. Will make the vacation a 2 full weeks though and will venture to Maui next time. Our stay at the Princess Kaiulani was very good. The lower level tower that we stayed in (there is a taller tower) is dated no doubt but it is not horrible by any means. A three star rating is where I would but the room at. The walls are not the most soundproofed either so if you have quiet adjoining guests you are okay. The staff, houskeeping, front desk and conceirge are very helpful and pleasant. The location can't be beat right in the heart of everything. The beach is across the street but it is such an easy walk. The buffet breakfast is okay nothing special for the price ($14.00 with a half off coupon) there are other eateries outside to chose from. Easy to get around to attractions and shopping with the trolley bus system they have as well as the local bus system which does go up all the way to the North Shore. The North Shore is a lovely day trip stopping to enjoy the scenery and the different beaches along the way. Top it off with a plate of delicious shrimp from Macky's shrimp truck and then to the famous Matamotsu's for the delicious shaved ice cone - yummy! For this trip we rented a car and a GPS with a tour card and this made our day real easy. We should have started earlier in the morning - like 8 a.m. Parking is hard to find but we parked at a public lot and paid $12.95 for the overnight which was good until 7 a.m. the next morning. They number their parking slots so if you pay the evening rate and go out of the lot you have to ensure you get the same numbered spot when you return (but I reasoned with the attendant saying it should not matter what slot I take when I return because I paid already and they were okay with that). The day rate is $15.95 so a 24 hour rate would run about $30! Tons of shopping from high end Prada, Gucci to affordability of the local stores and markets. There is tons to see and do. If you are interested on the cultural aspect of Hawaii then you must do the day trip to the Polynesian Cultural Centre (PCC) gives you a taste of the different islands. There are different packages to chose from so do your research before booking it. It is really hard to wake up and look out to the beautiful blue skies, sunshine and blue water beach.

The hotel also offered free ukelele lessions (which we took part in) and had local artists selling crafts (i.e. wood carvings, paintings, jewelry etc...). There was also music/hula shows by the pool and bar, which offered a nice Hawaiian ambiance. One day, one of the head chefs gave a demo on how to choose a good pineapple, how to slice one up and had samples for us. And most importantly, the hotel is only across the street from Waikiki Beach.

Every stay was great until this one. (December 2009 - January 2010). The location of this hotel is excellent and the price has always been reasonable. Rooms are okay size for our purposes and we have always had a lanai with nice view, whether it is the pool or the city. There has always been adequate storage for clothing/belongings. We never noticed any noise from neighboring rooms.This trip it all went downhill. The room furnishings, which used to include tv armoire with large drawers for clothing etc. were replaced with a small stack of drawers attached to the wall in the closet. (kind of like small kitchen drawers). Not enough room to unpack. (We were staying for 2 weeks). We asked about this at the front desk and were told the old furniture had been replaced with this upgraded furniture from some other hotel in the Sheraton chain. So we lived out of suitcases for 2 weeks. The small refrigerator in the room was filthy on the outside. It was fine on the inside. The handle was so dirty, that I used a cloth to open it everyday.The noise at night from the neighboring room was horrendous. Every night the parents and small child came home around 11 pm and just starting to scream at each other for the next few hours. This went on for several nights until my husband knocked on the door and told them to keep it down. This could be a fluke. You never know who is staying next door, but I've never encountered people at this hotel who would be so rude as to scream all night. Staff was always extra pleasant on prior visits. They weren't unpleasant this time, just kind of neutral, which is okay but I missed the extra pleasant attitude. So, although you cannot beat the location and price, I will not stay there again due to the dirtiness and the noise.Also, this is the first time we used the gym.

First let me state that there are two Sheraton hotels in Honolulu, and although we asked for ours by it's full name we were taken to the wrong one. Not their fault but a very annoying start, and we had to get a second taxi down the street. The hotel is central and right on the main strip, so the location is good. However, checking in took a very long time even though there were a number of people serving at the desk. We were given two keycards - only one of which worked. We tried to get a replacement but were ignored at the desk for so long that we eventually gave up and just used one. We were also informed during check-in that the room/bed type we requested was unavailable (disappointing since we booked months in advance). They offered to upgrade us to a ""partial ocean view"", so we agreed.Well, if this was the upgraded room, I dread to think what the original must have been like! It was very small, with tired decor, dents in the wall, odd furniture including a metal bedside contraption that was out of reach anyway, peeling paint and the oldest TV I have seen in a long time. The bottled water was the high point. The bathroom was likewise very old with some broken fittings, peeling seals etc. It was very clean but just didn't feel nice.We had a flight to catch the next day so we were looking forward to a good night's rest. However, even though we were on a side facing room (off the street) and on the 25th floor, the noise from below was disturbingly loud until at least 2am. The windows just didn't seem to keep out any noise. The AC was also ineffective for such a small room!I lost a personal item during the holiday. I can't be sure it was even left at this particular hotel, but I sent a query anyway. The link from the hotel's own website took me to the central office, who took a few days to respond and then requested more details. My details were eventually passed back to the hotel (who I had been trying to contact directly from the start!) and another couple of days later they responded that it had not been found. Again, not their fault that I lost something, but not the most efficient customer service in response.Our overall impression was that the place had not been well looked after for a while. In a hotel that size I fully expect a long wait for the lifts and the occasional blip, but our experiences added up to a pretty poor stay. While it wasn't all bad, I wouldn't recommend it to a friend or stay here again - the premium you pay for the Starwood brand just didn't provide the experience you expect from the name. Compared to the other hotels we stayed at during this trip, we were definitely underwhelmed.","Studley, United Kingdom",32,2.0

Which is fine with me, since IMO Starwood properties are generally higher quality than Hilton or Priority Club properties. That said, a few always slip through the cracks....and the Princess Kaiulani is one of those hotels.This property is, quite simply, tired. Not at all deserving of the ""Sheraton"" brand...sticking Sweet Sleeper beds and LG flatscreens into ancient hotel rooms that look like they haven't been refreshed since the 80s just doesn't cut it. We booked a High Ocean View room, which are located in the higher floors of the newer (1960s) Ainahou tower....but when we arrived, we were told we'd been ""upgraded"" to a Deluxe View room in the older Princess tower. I was suspicious, but hey, an upgrade is an upgrade!The hallways were dimly-lit and bare....it looked like my college dorm. The room had completely bare walls, ancient green carpet, a tiny out-of-date bathroom, no chairs (!) and a view of....the pool. I double-checked the website and confirmed that, yes, this was the highest room category available...inexplicable. But since we were only paying $130/night, we decided to shrug it off, find some dinner and get to sleep.At 5:30am my wife and I were awakened by the couple next door. No screaming or shouting or singing, though....they were just speaking at a completely normal level. I could understand every word they said, even though there was a wall between us. Amusingly, they were talking about how they couldn't sleep. Neither could we, of course. :)We asked for another room in our original room category, and were moved to the 18th floor of the Ainahou tower. This building was clearly newer, and the view was incredible (see pics). The room was a bit smaller than our Princess Tower room, but had nicer furniture (still very old) and a larger bathroom. However, the noise level from surrounding rooms was still awful. Every time the phone rang next door, I picked up ours. I could hear their cel phone alarms. Once again, I could understand every word said next door, even at ""indoor voice"" levels. I could even tell what TV shows they were watching! It was so bad that we started taking Benadryl before going to sleep, which thankfully worked.So no, I don't recommend staying here. But if you must, remember to ask about the resort fee during check-in. For $12.94/day, it covers your parking, your internet access (at a woefully slow 256kbps) and two daily bottles of water. Separately, all that would cost you well over $40 ($25 alone in parking). It's the best deal in Waikiki. Too bad you have to stay here to take advantage of it...","Los Angeles, California",39,2.0

The location was absolutely perfect, central to everything. Our room was comfortable, no frills, but clean and cozy. We had a city view booked and they bumped us up to a pool view :) The hotel staff was incredibly pleasant from the front desk to the housekeepers to the restaurant wait staff. Restaurant was nice, but a bit pricey. Food was very good though! The only bone I have to pick is if you pay with a debit card (Visa/Mastercard drawn from a bank account), be prepared for the computer system to do funky things to you when you use it for the first time at either the restaurant or splash bar by the pool. I was not prepared for this, considering I had a $50 resort credit, and it kind of upset me. What the system does is it takes your first transaction and times it by depending many days you are staying. We stayed 6 days so it took one drink at $11 and multiplied it by 6. So it placed a $66 hold on my credit card, which is still being held a week later. That was $66 I had less of for my trip. They deducted the resort credit off my final bill, however.  Location is perfect. Across the street is some fast food places if you are on a budget like we were. Denny's is right around the corner as well as Chilis. You can cut through the pool to get to Kalakaua Ave where the International Market Place is just a few doors down and the beach is across the street. And, of course, there are ABC Store's everywhere.  Nightly entertainment by the pool was very nice and relaxing and over by 9:30pm, so no worries about being disturbed.  We would stay here again in a heart beat! Aloha!","New Bedford, Massachusetts",32,5.0

I've tested the competition, but always return to the PK for it's wonderful layout, veteran staff of delightful hosts, nightly poolside entertainment, and 50-yard walk to Waikiki Beach.I will agree that some of the rooms have aged, however the quality remains quite good for the price.We make a point of enjoying the somewhat pricey, yet delicious buffet one evening during each stay.Because the hotel is located in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, there can be significant street noise until the wee hours of the morning as vacationers soak up their share of aloha. I recommend requesting a room that overlooks the King's Village shopping square. Those rooms are on the relatively quiet Kaiulani Avenue and are better protected from the noise that emanates from the main thoroughfare and the International Marketplace (can someone *please* outlaw calliope playing??).Rooms facing the pool are particularly nice as you are able to sit on your balcony, enjoy the evening entertainment and watch the world go by.As a side note, I am very happy to see from the management comments below that Mr. Orr remains in charge of the PK. I had occasion to meet him many years ago and I'm sure his steady hand may be credited for keeping such wonderful staff members on board for years.","Saint Louis, Missouri",6,4.0

We could see the mountains, the buildings, the street, and the ocean. We even had a view of the pool. At night we could hear the music coming from the pool area on our balcony. Each day we saw huge, magnificent rainbows.  The hotel is in the perfect location to the beach, shopping, and restaurants. We were able to be a part of the activity when we wanted and retreat to our balcony when we wanted to be alone. The hotel arranged transportation for us when we needed it.It was easy to get a towel for the beach. We enjoyed the coffee stand just outside of the pool. The room was clean and comfortable. We were able to receive $5 certificates because we requested not to have our room cleaned each day.

Every elevator ride I took was crowded and stopped on as many floors as it needed to fill up. The gym was totally inadequate (too few free weights, too little air conditioning, no mat area for abs, ran out of towels and water, and very limited weight machines). The breakfast buffet had a good mix of healthy options (like omelets and fruit) and less healthy options (like waffles and bacon). The wind was very loud howling past my windows, but it didnt seem to keep me awake. There is only one computer and printer in the entire hotel for printing boarding passes (and no, the front desk wont let you email them from your room to print there).

Good rate of about $160 per night (including taxes) for an ocean view room on the 23rd floor (with AAA discount). Food is overpriced for what you get. Breakfast buffet was good, but not worth $23. Lunch menu advertised a burger topped with an onion ring for $14.50, but no onion rings came with it even though later that day I noticed someone getting the burger with it (very minor, but it show the lack of consistency). Dinner buffet was about $32 and was was nothing special to justify this price. The crab legs were small, the habachi steaks were also quite thin and nothing special. Great atmosphere for dining by the pool with a stage with live music in the evening. Room was fine. Balcony was great to sit and look down at Waikiki Beach (it is worth it to try and get an ocean view room). I did not pay for parking, I parked at Kuhio Towers a few blocks a way for $12/night, and it is a public parking lot. They did charge for Internet, which I did not use, for they had 3 computers in the lobby for free to check e-mail and Internet.

We paid for this trip in advance, and checked several times online to make sure our hotel reservations were set. They were. Upon arriving at 2:30 am, we were placed in a room with a double bed, no air conditioning or window to open, musty smelling, right by the clunky elevator that never stopped, and a room I could not walk around the bed with crutches. This is not what we paid for. We paid for a king size bed, room with pool view, small fridge etc. When told that our travel agent placed in the ""substandard room"", I was upset but too exhausted to deal with it that early with no sleep. Because of the elevator, we ended up going back down to the receptionist and asking what happened and what are they going to do about it? She offered us $20. off per night to upgrade. So, we upgraded. They still charged us for the higher price in the substandared room because it was technically the next day. After talking with several other couples staying in this hotel, 6 out of 10 had the exact same thing happen to them! Beware, this may be a scam is what we all came to the conclusion of what was happening.

In the six nights of my stay, I was awaken once at 5:00 a.m. by the guests in the next room. It was not that they were extremely loud, the walls are just too thin - so much so that I could hear their messages as they listened to their voicemail. My room overlooked the pool area. At first, I thought this would be a concern, but the nightly entertainment ended around 9:30 p.m. therefore it was relatively quiet except for occasional noise from the traffic. But who would want to sleep at 9:30 p.m. in Waikiki??? Food was also great! Everyday, local artists are located in the hotel lobby for those who love to shop for island specials.

Low speed traffic sounds did not enter the closed balcony door and the entertainment from the pool area was relaxing and unintrusive.

It ""could"" be one of the best hotels in the City - but it really does need upgrading/renovations as soon as possible/practical. We were quoted $106 per night as BCAA/AAA Members but opted for a partial ocean view at $121 (US) - a decent rate for Waikiki for sure!The entry/lobby pool area are really terrific, oozes ""aloha"" and feels very welcoming. These areas are clean and vibrant from the concierge desk to the small on-site craft fair (local carvings and jewellery were available each morning/early afternoon) to the poolside restaurant/stage area where Hawaiian entertainment played nightly - adding to the ambiance of the premises.Our experience with the Staff was generally very good. On arrival, we were met by the on-duty Bell Captain who was very friendly, courteous and promptly took charge of our baggage and had it up to our room in about 5 minutes! On the other hand, the fellow who met us at the check-in the desk should probably consider a career change as he seemed lethargic and a bit flippant (this is not typical of most Sheraton hotels that I have stayed in so this below average reception really stood out). That said, all other staff members (including the chamber maids) were friendly and displayed that aloha spirit that we have come to enjoy in Hawaii.We were first checked into the (29-story) Ainahou Tower which is supposedly the newer section of the Hotel. We were on the 16th floor but the noise from the adjacent properties air conditioning was quite noticeable. I had read about early morning street noise but thought being up higher we might avoid this pitfall - I was was wrong. At 5:30 AM the back alleys of Waikiki ""come alive"" with the sound of big trucks emptying dumpsters in thunderous procession (note some literary licence taken here). This sound reverberates up the buildings and with the single pane windows and we were easily awakened by this and ended-up being moved/upgraded to the the original 11-story Princess Wing with a deluxe ocean view - bonus! This wing has double-glazed windows and if you want to shut out the City noise (which is inevitable in Waikiki) - stay in the Princess Wing for sure.The beds are comfortable and the rooms decently appointed. The vents show signs of wear (visibly discoloured) and there were are some cleanliness issues which results in my ""average rating"" for this property which would otherwise be much higher. There is a plan (so we were told) to actually build/re-build a brand new Sheraton on this site as it truly is right in the heart of Waikiki with beach access across the street.There is a tour guide desk , a concierge for maps/bus schedules/directions and an ATM in the lobby. The large work-out room on-site is terrific with big screen TVs and modern equipment. The pool looks very nice and is the centre-piece of the Hotel's courtyard/restaurant & entertainment area.The beach, the dining and the shopping are world class and it is no accident that this little piece of urban paradise is such a grand destination (for a differing style of holiday - check out my installment on Maui for comparison). As most travellers to Hawaii soon find out, there are ""ABC"" convenience stores (a cross between a 7-11 and a gift shop) everywhere and we frequented this for our morning breakfast foodstuffs (fruit, milk & cereal) as well as our beach-lunches of sandwiches, snacks & beverages (they even sell beer, wine & other liquor - for the more adventurous - and the insulated mugs to put them in - hint - hint). All in all, we had a great stay here and I would recommend this hotel if a) you stay in the Princess Wing, or b) you stay in the Ainahou Tower on the side facing Diamond Head.I have attached a couple of photos to whet you appetite.Mahalo & good luck!","VANCOUVER, BC.",17,3.0

That did have an ocean view but it was more a horizon view over another hotel with no view of the beach. The room was tiny, smell and worn with two adjoining room doors and immediately in front of the elevator. I called the front desk immediately to get moved because adjoining room doors always mean loud rooms because the noise travels under and through the adjoining doors. Hotel said that was all they could offer since the rest of the rooms were being held for other guests. True to expectation, I was kept awake by the snoring man next door, then right before 5am, he started blasting his TV. I called the front desk to complain and about 5 minutes later, the TV volume was lowered only to be raised again to loud about 30 minutes later. Then, right before 7am, I was awoken again by doors slamming next door and the TV being turned on loud again. To be fair the the other guest, I'm not really sure if the TV volume was turned way up, but it was very loud in my room that I could hear the program very clearly.If the treatment and room I received as a top tier Platinum Member, imagine what your experience at this Waikiki hotel will be. My suggestion is that you try the Hyatt Regency (right across the street), the Marriott Waikiki (two blocks away) or the Hilton Prince Kuhio (four blocks away), but stay away from this dumpy Sheraton.","San Francisco, California",97,1.0

I am a self-admitted hotel snob, I enjoy the nicer hotels. But my budget doesn't always allow me to indulge my pleasures, so every once in a while, I am forced by my pocketbook to stay at one of these places. That's not an admission that I knew what I was getting myself into. It was probably my own fault though for not doing my homework on this place. But I figured the price and location would make up for everything else... boy, was I wrong!!I have found that reading through hotel reviews can be difficult without a point of reference, so I will write most of my review as a comparison between this hotel and the Westin Maui Resort and Spa, where we stayed for 3 days prior to staying in Honolulu. Room/Bathroom:The bed was clean at the Princess, with comfortable sheets that seemed to be clean as well. The Air Conditioner panel was simply a knob with a high/low/off setting that did not have the ability to control itself based on any room temperature. This was very annoying, since the night time was warm/cold at times. The in-room safe was large, but could only be used with a $3.50 fee, which was also very annoying. Talk about nickel and diming you all the way through! At the Westin, the AC was temperature controlled and worked very well, the in-room safe was free, and the bed/sheets were also clean. This may be due being on Maui instead of Waikiki, but who knows? The Westin also had a HD TV that was about 40 inches, whereas we had a 26 inch CRT at the Princess. I thought even 3 star hotels had HD TV's?! The patios at both hotels were pretty much the same, with a small table and 2 chairs and similar dimensions/space. An omission from the room at the Princess was a counter/mirror area at the Westin Maui where my fiance would do her makeup or anything she needed. This granite top counter was positioned outside the bathroom, next to the room door. It had enough space in front of the mirror to place all our toiletries, skin care products, blow dryer, etc. The Princess only had a sink and mirror in the bathroom, right next to the stinky toilet. This small difference made a huge comfort difference.Now, onto the bathroom. This was absolutely the turning point for me. The sink ran water that smelled like sewage!! My fiance and I laid down our first night after washing up for bed. We were in bed, winding down, only to find that we could smell a nasty stink on each others' faces. What an absolutely horrible experience, to know that we washed our faces in water that may have come from someone's toilet. The shower water smelled ok, so we had to use the shower faucet for everything the rest of our trip. Hotel Service/Staff:The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful for the most part. The concierge was absolutely an idiot, actually, all of the concierges that I ran into at the Princess didn't seem to have much local knowledge. They had knowledge about activities, restaurants, hot spots that I learned after only 2 days of speaking to other tourists!! A simple request for a local korean restaurant and I was told there were not many around and to go to the Waikiki Resort. The restaurant, called Seoul Jung, was absolutely awful with their commercialized food and awful service. I went online to find 4 korean restaurants in the area and one of them was right next door at the international market. Another request I made was for some info on trendy nightlife spots like a club where we could go dancing. The concierge said there were mostly bars around the area, but we should go to the Waikiki Trade Center. I speak to some other tourists and find that there's a popular club called the Level 4 right across the street at the Royal Hawaiian. I also had a big beef with the trip/tour booking person who is located near the concierge. In her quest for some type of credit for booking stuff for her customers, she told me to make sure I go to her in the morning of the Saturday that i wanted to visit the polynesian cultural center. I asked if I could go online or call to book a tour to the PCC instead, but she said no, I must go to her. So i did, only to find that she was sold out. So I ended up calling the PCC and they advised that I could have booked my reservation online during christmas day and ensured a spot. The selfishness... really?!?!Location:What I enjoyed most about this hotel was the location. It was right across the street from Waikiki beach. It wasn't on the beach like the Outrigger, Royal Hawaiian, or Sheraton (much nicer hotels by the way), but it was close enough. The International Marketplace is right next door, which isn't saying too much though. That market has many small stores that sell very similar items. Once you've gone through about 4-5 stores out of the 25 or so, you've pretty much seen them all. We did find a very good Korean restaurant near the opposite end (opposite to Waikiki Beach) of the marketplace called Mikawon. Hotel Lobby & Attractions:Many of the surrounding hotels (such as the Royal Hawaiian, Sheraton, Outrigger Waikiki, and even the Hyatt) had very luxurious lobbies with many stores (including name brand stores) and coffee shops. The Princess, on a scale of 1-10 with those other hotels mentioned being a 10, was a 2. The only reason it wasn't a 1 was because it had a nice, large christmas display in the lobby.The pool is absolutely ridiculous. It's a small oval, who's length you could cover with about 8-10 steps walking alongside it. That's about 25-30 feet in length, with about 10 feet in width. The shallow end was small, about 5 feet by 10 feet, which was particular bad for my fiance since she can't swim. You may not think you need a pool when you're in Hawaii, but you do get tired of swallowing salt water after awhile but still feel the need to be out in the sun. The Westin Maui hotel's pool, but contrast, had no less than 3 different pool areas, with all 3 pool areas having pools that were 4 times the size of the one at Princess. So I guess that would be a total of 12 times more pool area. Seems like an exaggeration, but seriously, it isn't. We walked by the pool at the Sheraton Waikiki and found those pool areas to be like the one at the Westin Maui. Needless to say, I was very disappointed with the Princess Kaiulani. I would not stay here again, nor would I ever recommend this hotel to anyone. I wouldn't wish this place on anyone that I know. I say if you go to Honolulu and stay on Waikiki, then arrange for a stay at one of the nicer hotels. It's a HUGE difference between places such as the Princess Kaiulani and the Sheraton Waikiki or Royal Hawaiian.",Silicon Valley,3,2.0

It was built in the 60's and they haven't updated it. The maids seem to try and clean it...but 50 year old bathrooms have 50 years of gunk in the tile and crevices between the walls and the tubs and sinks.The AC is from the 60's also and barely works. You wake up in a cold-clammy sweat as it is a chilled water system that isn't quite chilled, and the fans are anemic and clogged.The bathrooms have no exhaust fans. There is a vent, but it has no draw, so humidity from a shower sets back your room to tropical conditions.Staff- Everyone I ran into was nice. The maids tried, but again 50 year old rooms are tough to keep up. Front desk staff was nice and quick. Pool- A 50 year old pool, no hot tub, and anti-kid rules at the pool. I get that sometimes adults don't want to hear kids playing....but there is no 2nd pool for the kids. The pool attendant was a complete dick and constantly hounded the kids. There is nothing for kids to do.The reason my rooms were free was because I used a bunch of hard-earned Starwood Points from my other stays throughout the year. Where they screw you is on the ""fees."" Parking is $40 a nite ($25 for hotel guests) and Internet is $25 a nite. So, unless you work the system, you are paying $75 a day for parking and internet for a mouldy room, internet and parking, and wasting a bunch of your starpoints.I heard from hotel staff that Starwood knows that this hotel is crap, and they plan to tear it down in a year or so. I think it is apalling that they will still milk guests by making us stay in crappy-smelly rooms to leach a few more dollars out of a worn out building.","Chandler, AZ",19,2.0

But when I parked my car there, it was a whopping $25.- for overnight. (This is the discounted hotel guest rate, regular rate is $40.-). Paying almost more for the 'lodging' of my car than for myself, my expectations of the room were a little lowered. (Did I have so sleep in the Garage myself?) But at check-in, I was offered a late check-out (as a SPG Gold Member, even though I did not book through the SPG website.) and got a room with a view. (upgrade!). Thank You! Although the room is a little outdated, it was clean and comfortable. The same goes for the bathroom. But then again, you're in Hawaii and don't spend much time in your room anyway. The hotel offers free Internet access in the lobby (Link@Sheraton). Furthermore, there are several food outlets on property and there is a small pool. The Location of the hotel is the best, right in the middle of Waikiki, with the beach across the street. Food, shopping and nightlife are all next door.

Therefore, I changed our reservation to the Sheraton Princess, thinking that since it's a brand name hotel, it has to be a good one. WRONG!The lobby is absolutely beautiful. Now if only they would have used some of that money to modernize the rooms a little, it would be a great hotel.Upon check in, we were given a City View room. When we went up to our room, I immediately turned around and went back down to the lobby and asked to be moved. The room was horrible. It looked like something out of a bad 70's movie. Dirt and grime.We were moved to the Waikiki City View in the Tower and same thing. I called down to the desk and told them we were checking out. They didn't seem to have a problem with that, and even gave us back our deposit. I guess this happens a lot!I would not recommend staying here. If you want a hotel that in right in the middle of the hustle and bustle, I would pay more. There are a lot of great hotels a little farther away from everything.P.S.

We stayed there 2 days before the cruise and 3 days after the cruise. I am a hotel person and my wife is an outdoor person so for her hotel is a place to come back to shower and sleep. Specially in Hawaii when there are so many things to do outside you go to agree to that.We were once on the 8th floor and the second time on the 5th floor with partial ocean and city view. Clean room flat Screen TV and decent shower. No doubt the hotel needs rennovation from its old decotr its still clean and neat all the way.We bid the price throught priceline and we got a great dealand the hotel is just 3 mins or say 2 mins walk to waikki beach and food is available right outside the hotel almost 24 hours burger king subway and right behind the international market place a fun place to shop.The only thing expensive is the parking $ 25 for 24 hours.

Stayed in the tall tower on 16th floor with ocean view and i must say it was a great view with sun on the deck from 9am to 2-3pm. One king sized bed and a crib leaves little room left in the room but was manageable. Overall the room was clean but a bit dated. dripping faucets in the the bathroom and a motion sensor activated AC so when sleeping it can get rather hot in the room. Live entertainment everynight betweeen 6-9 approx. could cleary hear from room was loud at times when trying to put the liitle one down.There is a buffet style restaurant and a bar style food menu. Never ate at the buffet was 30$ per person but had the food at the bar and was approx 14$ per plate. Both are open concept with seating outdoors. The buffet breakfast is also expensive but you can opt for the take out breakfast for 10$ and they give you a container to load up what you want easily feeds 2 people.Pool was a little on the small side but with the beach is only a short walk away so didnt bother with it. All shopping and restaurants are easily within walking distance. Overall i would rate this a 7.5 out of 10.

I was very dissappointed with the hotel. The rooms are old and the plumbing is not up to date, the sink in the bathroom has no ""stopper"" to hold water in the sink, so when shaving, I just let the water run.The air conditioning was not working very well, so we opened the patio door to get some air when we went to bed, but a band playing somewhere below, we were on the 22nd floor, kept us awake till very late. The pillows on the bed look nice, but when you lay your head on them they go down like you just let the air out, they become flat where you head is on the pillow and the pillow curlsup on the ends. Since I have a neck problem and use two pillows all the time, the two pillows there were not equivalent to one normal pillow. I could not sleep, so I ended getting up at 3:30 Am and going outside the hotel and found some coffee at a 24 hour Burger King across the street. The comforter on the bed is also extremely ""lumpy"".WIFI is $14 a day, which is sort of expensive, since many hotels now have free WIFI in the rooms.The location of the hotel is good, but I will not stay there again.","Santa Cruz, California",127,2.0

Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by courteous bellman who quickly unloaded our bags and led us to reception. Upon arrival at reception had a short wait before we got to the front desk. They had a ""standard deluxe room with ocean view' assigned for me despite being a platinum member and being entitled to a suite or ""best room in the house"".

The tub/shower needs to be replaced, as well as the sink. There was no counter and no hot water in the shower! The rug is worn out and the balcony could use some paint and tile. We paid for an upgrade, so we did get a free buffet breakfast and a partial ocean view, which was nice. The bed was also very comfy.

Perks such as left luggage and hospitality rooms were all a part of the package, and the package was jammed full of features. Our room was large, airy and comfortable, and faced the pool. There was free Internet, thoughtfully limited to 15 mins per visit. Honestly, if anyone needs the Internet more than 15 mins while on holidays, then perhaps they should just bring a laptop. As well as the Internet, free newspapers are provided, plus comfortable chairs to read them in. The pool is large, warm, surrounded by lounge chairs, and the beach towels are free for guests. An outdoor shower ensures that you can wash the sand from your toes before heading up to your room. Happy hour brings cocktails to your lounge chair, encouraging the indulgences. There's much more at the Sheraton, but I'll end here and say two thumbs up.My husband was on conference and I was at the pool. Really, life could not be sweeter!We also visited Pearl Harbor, and took TheBus. If I had to change anything about our trip, I'd say look for a shuttle to get you there, or consider banding together to hire a cab.

The room was rather small but did have a nice sized balcony. There was no Sweet Sleeper bed but it did have a nice floral print bedspread circa 1985 :) The TV was the exact same TV I had in college, all 20"" of it.

I arrive at around 10am from Japan so we were really tired. The front desk agent gave us an early check in and we paid for an upgrade with Breakfast and internet which was very reasonable $45.00 per night. The breakfast was very good. Omelets, fruits, breads, pancakes, french toast, juices. It was enough to keep you up until late afternoon. Plus it was served until 11am so you can sleep all morning. The beach was 5 minutes away. You could walk basically everywhere in the Waikiki Area, however, we rented a car to go to Pearl Harbor. There was a happy hour and music everyday in the pool area which was really nice. And there is a show ""A polinesyan journey"" right in the hotel. The show was O K. Overall I would comeback. My only complaint is that I called room service to bring me 2 empty glasses of champagne for a bottle I bought and they were not able to bring them to the room because that ""was not their job"" and housekeeping couldnt do it either. A second complaint is all the birds walking on the tables during breakfast and eating from plates while people were in the buffet.

We were both a little worried after reading other reviews, but upon arriving we were SOOOO surprised. You have to remember that this is not a ""5 star"" hotel......if you want that then you should stay at a ""5 star"" like the Royal Hawaiian or a Ritz type property. I will start with the positives........We stayed in room #1256 in the newer tower......try to avoid rooms in the Princess tower as it is very old and MUCH smaller balconys.*Front desk staff was great. We are Starwood Preferred Guests (gold) so we got to go to the Preferred Guest line. We were originally assigned a corner king room but it was a smoking room so we were then given the option for a partial ocean view but it was 2 double beds. We took that and we were very pleased. WHAT A VIEW!!!! *Great location, right next to the Internation Market Place. The Westin Moana Surfrider and the Outrigger Waikiki are directly across the street. If you have already done the island before and you just want to hang out in the Waikiki area the is no need for a car. *Plenty of restaurants around ie. Cheesecake Factory, Duke's, Cheeseburger in Paradise, Subway, Roundtable Pizza (be careful of the bartender named Robert.....), KFC, Burger King, Senor Frogs, Hawaiian Cookie Co. (you gota check this place out), P.F. Changs.*Very clean room, you just need to remember that the turnover at resort/vacation destination hotels is very high. Maid service was wonderful (eventhough we didn't use it). The maid staff was very friendly also.*Awesome balcony.......a table and 2 chairs and there is plenty of room.*Wonderfully comfy bed. Down comforter. *Fridge and safe in room.Now the negatives............none of them were really a big deal and they would not stop us from staying here again. Really it just prevented me from giving this property 5 stars.*The room is not spacious. A little cramped, but you are in Hawaii, how long are you really in your room?*Very crowded pool, should be bigger for the size of the hotel.*Although we only had 1 drink during happy hour (I believe it was 3pm-5pm) we did walk through both the breakfast ($19.95) and dinner ($29.95) buffets and for the selection of food didn't seem worth the $.*You can not charge the coffee to your room at the coffee bar at the pool.*Terrible shower head....especially if you are over 5 ft. 5 inches and the shower wouldn't drain.*If you have a car (we didn't) they charge $20 a day to park.O.K. here is some additional ""general"" information........Happy Hours and area restaurants, bare with me, this info is what I remember but may not be %100 accurate. You will at least have a general idea.*P.F. Changs- 3pm-6pm 1/2 priced select appetizers and some drinks are discounted, just check.*Top of Waikiki- 4 or 5pm-7pm $4 martinis.....try the 1st one on the menu, it's ginger and awesome. Select appetizers, sweet potato chips, some sort of chicken and a few others.*Senor Frogs pours a mean drink.....just remember that it's a tourist trap but worth checking out.Duke's-$14.95 breakfast buffet......AWESOME 7:30am-10:30am Made to order omeletes, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, eggs benedict, biscuts and gravy, rice, toast and bagles, pancakes or waffles, french toast and fresh fruit.Duke's bar-wings, waffle fries, quesadillas, burgers, pizza and great calamari......you gota check it out!! The bar staff is awesome too!*Big Kahuna-3pm-6pm 1/2 price appetizers and drink specials. We also ate breakfast there. Great!! $8.95 for 2 eggs, ham, bacon, sausage and either rice of hashbrowns.The Shack-don't bother unless the 20's scene is your thing. Drinks are weak and the zuchinni we had was way greasy.*Don't bother to go to Moose Magilacuties(sp?).....BAD drinks and service.All in all our visit was great!!! We would definately stay here again!! One last tip, we went and checked out a room and the Westin across the street to see if it was worth 16,000 Starwood pts. ( when we booked at the Sheraton PK it was 7000 pts. and was raised to 10,000) We asked to see a standard room. It was nice but VERY small and dark with no ocean view. Not worth it to us.

To love or hate the hotel will depend a lot of what do you expect your vacation to be. Let me start by saying that we got a terrific rate of $98 booked directly from the hotel site, with AAA discount (they did ask for my AAA card at check in). No resort fees but you pay $20 for self parking. It is a pretty good deal for Waikiki, especially for the location so close to the beach and to the ""action.""Check in was very easy, everybody was very friendly and polite. I was upgraded to a room with a view of the swimming pool. The room was not as small as I thought, but it was sure in dire need for a renovation (the door seemed to have been forced). The room was a prime seat for the performance they have at the pool (singers, hula demos etc.). The problem is that we had two kids exhausted from the flight that needed to sleep early, impossible with show. So I asked the receptionist to change rooms. She was very helpful, but she mentioned that rooms facing other sides could be worse in terms of noise because of the particular location (in particular, rooms facing the international market tend to suffer most from noise, as they always have something going on there). She said that rooms facing the pool would be the quietest after the end of the show (by 9pm, which was true). However, she offered to move us to another room that was available at the same building, also facing the pool, and left me a key so both my wife and I could see it before we decide to move. The other room was actually better, the music from the pool was still loud, but it was quiet right after 9pm, as promised. Plus, the new room was in a little better condition and we actually had a bit of an ocean view (actually the view is obstructed by the Moana Surfrider right in front of the Sheraton PK, but you are able to see a little bit of the ocean at the left side of the Moana. It was actually quite nice.We had a car rental, so we paid $20 for parking. The parking is a 5 store structure without elevator adjacent to the hotel. Some reviewers mentioned that the layout of the staircase is kind of weird. Make sure you learn which stairway will lead you the closest to the hotel - if you find it, you won't have any problem. They have coin-operated laundry at the basement - very convenient, we used it twice. Free computers on the lobby was also very useful (limited to 15 minutes of use). They also have stands selling souvenirs, and tons of (free) activity during the day.Location is great, just steps from the beach park - the Moana Surfrider is just across the street on Kalakaua - the beach is to the left of the Moana. There plenty of shops and ABC stores surrounding the hotel. The International Market is on the same block, just a couple of steps from the hotel. The place is very lively, and where a lot of ""action"" is located. Lots of interesting street performers (like those you see in Santa Monica's promenade). On the minus side, there are plenty of ""professional ladies"" walking through the area around 9pm, so if that bothers you, you may want to reconsider the location. I thought that, all things considered, the hotel was a tremendous value, although I am not sure if I would stay there again, especially considering that we did most of our sightseeing and beachcombing outside the Waikiki area.","Sunnyvale, California",207,3.0

They chose the Princess Kaiulani because of staff discount privileges. All in all, it's exactly how everyone else describes it: an older hotel that's rather dated looking. The hotel and our room was clean and tidy however, and nothing was broken or in disrepair (except for the ice machine on our floor, which forced us to go to the next floor every time we wanted ice). The location is very central and it's a 5 minute walk to Waikiki Beach. Other than that, nothing really stood out about the hotel, either good or bad. I was continually annoyed at how two computer stations in the lobby were missing (one was gone, the other marked ""out of order""). And for whatever reason, the cleaning staff is really chintzy about replacing our tea bags--I called once to complain after not receiving any refills for days. The bags showed up promptly, then not again for the rest of our stay. Equally chintzy is the lack of replacement of our tiny bars of soap and shampoo. And I was a bit surprised to find that they don't drop off complimentary newspapers, like many other hotels I've stayed. The economy must be hurting.For whatever reason, the hotel pool closes very early. There's nothing like a refreshing dip in the pool after dinner, when it's nice and cool. But guess what? The pool closes at 7 p.m.! I guess it's so that pool patrons don't disturb the show going on, but almost no one was watching the show anyway. The alternative is hiking to the beach at dusk. For some reason, having salty sea water splash your face in the dark is not entirely pleasant. We dined at the hotel restaurant once for the dinner buffet and once for the breakfast buffet. Standard fare, but again they took the food away way too early (9 p.m. for dinner and 10 a.m. for breakfast).

My overall opinion of the hotel - it's a pretty good value for the price. It's not a new hotel, so don't expect much from the interior. But, Waikiki and Oahu is great, so you shouldn't be in your hotel too much anyway. Think of this hotel as more of a home base. If all you want to do is stay at your hotel, then the PK would not impress you. Pro's:- You're within 100 yards of the Ocean, just across the street. Great value.- There are three other 5- and 6-star Starwood hotels within 5 minutes walk (Moana Surfrider, Sheraton Waikiki, Royal Hawaiian). You can relax at any of these hotels and charge food/drinks to your room at the PK (Princess Kaiulani). Pay for the cheaper room here and hang out at the others...they're incredible.- Most of the hotel personnel are very sweet.- Right on the strip. Much fun watching the street performers and people watching.- Lots of neat free activities on weekends - crafts, painting, hula dancing, pineapple carving.- bands play every night by the pool until 9:30pm, then a solo acoustic guy by the bar until 11pm'ishCon's:- If you are a light sleeper, do NOT stay in an odd numbered room in the tower. The street vendors, particularly the steel drum player, will keep you up until 11pm. (keep in mind, I was on business and had to be up early)- It's a kinda old, tired hotel. Don't expect too much in the interior- The buffet is not worth the $40-$45. Average food. Suggestions:1. Ask for a even numbered room in the tower. Great views of the ocean and quiet.2. Stay here, hang out at the other Starwood resorts. If you have the money, upgrade to Sheraton Waikiki. If you have even more money, go to Moana Surfrider.3. Food is a little more expensive in Waikiki. I was on a cheap per diem, so my recommendation for food would be: - Cheescake Factory. It has mainland prices, not hawaii prices. It's very busy, so you might have to take it to go. No problem, eat at the tables near the beach and watch the sunset. Why not? - Duke's - this is probably the most happening spot for happy hour. Ate fish tacos and watched whales breaching in the ocean. - ummm...that's about it. Nothing great going on in Waikiki for food.Things to do:- Surf. Surf, surf, surf. Surf! It is the easiest break possibly anywhere in the world, but still fun for advanced surfers (I'm intermediate)- Hike to the top of Diamond Head (yes, it's about a 4 mile hike to there and back from the hotel)- Take a catamaran around the corner of Diamond Head- Rent a car and go see the North Shore, sunset beach, Waimea Bay. See the turtles on the beach, basking in the sun.",Virginia,52,3.0

Yes the A/C was not ice cold because the cleaners turn them up every day so I just turned them down again. The staff were all pleasant and courteous and manaemant were surprised we stayed 9 days and sent us a couple of gift baskets, but unless you are going to stay on another Island the location is perfect.Across the road from the beach with so much in walking distance, next door to the International Markets across the road from The Cheesecake Factory, The Rock Island Cafe and so much more. A short walk to the Zoo and A must see is their ""Creations"" show we skipped the dinner package and just had the drinks option, we even had a photo opportunity with the cast afterwards.Make sure you grab a meal at the food court great value and something very different try it all, I can sum up by saying we didn't expect or pay for five star but demanded much better than back packer accomodation we got the standard I expect when travelling oversea's.","Brisbane, Australia",28,4.0

We combined starwood points with cash to bring the nightly room cost down to $60. I was nervous that the rooms would be very tacky, or we would hussled around like classic package tourists. Not only did those fears not happen - we had a great time in this hotel - thanks in large part to an amazing staff that went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. And the room was simple and white - but not tacky. In one of my customer service interactions, I went to the front desk to get change for using the guest laundry facilities. I mentioned that my newlywed wife had a cold and asked where could I get her some tea. The front desk clerk asked me to wait a moment. She left and personally brought back a cup of hot water, teas, honey packets, and lemons - rather than referring me to the restaurant, etc. The hotel general manager also heard that we were on our honeymoon and sent us champagne - not only on our first night, but also on our last! All in all, the staff in this hotel exhibited a true genuineness of spirit that transcended the box hotel expectations.The dinner buffet was good (including all you can eat yummy crab legs). The evening poolside Hawaiian music was REALLY good. The hotel is popular with Japanese wedding parties, which made for fun people watching.

Loved the complimentary flowers at reception to tuck behind the ear. The not so good stuff: Price of meals at the restaurant were exceptionally high. The room was fairly small, and the bathroom could have used more cleaning. The mini balcony faced onto a parking lot, when we asked how much extra to get upgraded to a better room, though the price quoted of $20 per night was reasonable, none of the rooms had an unobstructed view of the ocean, which was dissappointing, especially so because this was our honeymoon.

The Sheraton PK is in line with British standards a very good 3 star hotel if not a 4 star hotel.Our room was very good. It was light; adequately furnished and had a huge bed that was so so comfortable. An absolute delight to sleep in!The flat screen TV ( hardly used as no BBC world news channel); the tea/coffee making facilitieds and the bathroom provison were all aceptable.Our balcony had a partial ocean view and looked down onto the International market. It was good to watch the sunset from the balcony; with a view of the ocean and listening to the sounds of the entertainers below whilst enjoying a cold beer or glass of wine that you have kept chilled in the room fridge. We did not hear our neighbours at all during the stay and simply cannot underatand the other reports of this being a problem.The location of the hotel is excellent. The beach is a short stroll away- only a few minutesk; acess to all the shops and resturants all within easy reach; and the ABC store on the doorstep for the aforementioned beer & wine.The hotel lobby is comfortable with a number of activities taking place each day which contributed to the Hawaiin feel of the hotel. The availabliity of hotel towels was very good as these could also be taken to the beach with no limit on the number.The pool area was fine although I did not swim in the pool during our stay.We also did not eat in the hotel at any time as we felt the cost was over priced and we found nearby places to eat offered far better value for money.There may be better hotels - such as those on the ocean beach front - but I am certain that you will pay a far higher price for your stay.I would have no problems recommending the Sharaton PK.","Durham City, England",159,4.0

After reading the Sheraton Waikiki postings on travel advisor with construction noise complaints, etc., my husband and I selected the Princess Kaiulani. We made an excellent choice! Our room was on the 5th floor facing the pool. It was very clean, comfortable and relaxing. Our pillow-top bed was great! We were also able to enjoy our balcony in the evenings and listen to the free evening entertainment. The Princess has a great location - close to the beach, center of Waikiki, numerous restaurants and convenient access to public transportation. The concierge, front desk, housekeeping and other Staff were always helpful with our questions/concerns. They even had onsite activities and I made a beautiful orchid lei.

After 5 nights a group of partiers moved in next door to our room. We were on a non smoking floor. The balconies are very close and the guys having a party next door were out smoking on the balcony despite it was not allowed even on balconies.It was early Saturday evening and the smoke just flowed in into our room. Normally we would sit on the balcony and enjoy a drink before going out to dinner but we couldn't stand the smoke and had to leave a couple hours earlier than we would have liked. My wife couldn't even dry her hair after the shower. It was our last night in the hotel before leaving the next evening. We went to the front desk to let them know we were disrupted by the smoking and had to leave the room. The Manager on duty Ben really couldn't have cared less. He told us ""the hotel is not liable for it's other guests."" I told him we really were not happy and maybe since we were inconvenienced he could allow us a 2 hour late check out the next morning which is only 1 pm anyway. He said sure but he would charge us for it. I never met such an arrogant and rude manager in any hotel I have stayed. This Ben manager guy was so rude he actually ruined our evening more than the smokers. He simply didn't care. Just the worst customer service I have ever seen. How this guy becomes a manager at a Sheraton I don't know. It is too bad because we really enjoyed Waikiki so much and the Sheraton Princess was such a negative. The hotel is actually in a good location. The rooms are very dated and worn. The facilities are poor and the pool is disgusting to swim in. We didn't eat at the restaurants but they didn't look too appealing and heard from other guest the food was the worst they had in a long time and some of the most expensive in Waikiki. We will be going back to Waikiki every year but will avoid the Sheraton Princess for sure. it just is not up to the standards of other hotels we have stayed at and there are too many good ones in Waikiki to waste time with here no matter what price you pay.

We chose it because of the location and rate compared to others in the area. Here are the positives we experienced:Great location in downtown Waikiki if you want to stay where the action isWe had a fantastic ocean view from room 1960 and from 2060 on our return trip.Really comfy king bedFriendly enough and efficient staffThere were a couple of free computers to surf the net and check emails in the foyer area available for guests for 15 minutes a pop. Always a queue of course but better than nothing.And the negatives:Walls must be made of cardboard. We could easily hear our neighbours next door on both our stays. The first time we put down to bad luck. The second time we had booked for 5 nights but moved to another hotel after the first night. It wasn’t just bad luck. Management did not penalize us for departing early and the receptionist mentioned the connecting doors might be a factor in the noise. We could still hear the people next door talking until 1.30am.Our toilet blocked and overflowed. It was fixed very promptly though.This hotel seems to have more plumbing noises than the average hotel. Night time is when they are more obvious of course when we are wanting to sleep.When we were having breakfast pigeons were trying gallantly to land anywhere they could get a free meal. Staff were trying to guard peoples tables if they left their seats for a few minutes. I really didn’t feel like breakfast after that.Outdated tired looking rooms and bathrooms.$20 per night parking. Though this seems to be the norm in Hawaii.$10 per 24 hours for internet in your room if you have your own laptop. Though again this seems to be the norm at least in Hawaii.If it wasn't for the noise factor we would probably stay there again because of the rate (I would just avoid breakfast with the pigeons) I haven't noticed other reviewers complaining about the thin walls so maybe we had unusually bad luck.

As other reviewers have noted, the rooms are old and dated. However, our room was clean, and the bed was nice. The location is excellent -- although the steel drums do make a lot of noise outside (ask for a high up room if you can). We spent a bunch of time at the Sheraton Waikiki across the street -- they have an excellent bar right on the beach with live music from 12-3 daily, I believe. I would also recommend the Mai Tai cat -- they do sailings right from the beach and it was a lot of fun (there are several cats that leave from the beach; I am not sure that it matters which one you use). We also found the concierge to be extremely helpful -- but it can get really busy in the lobby, so you may have to wait. Lastly, note that parking is $20/day. Overall, this hotel is a good value in a good location, and so-so rooms.

In that regard, this hotel was perfect. We were extremely pleased overall since we knew going in that it's not a chic, renovated hotel. We knew we'd be mostly out and around Waikiki and only use the hotel room sparingly. So if you're going to Hawaii to enjoy Hawaii, and don't mind 1980s feeling everything haha, I highly recommend this hotel.Room:We had a High Ocean View room that we got for only $10 a night more than a standard room. Soooooo worth it. View was outstanding. Not as good as the rooms closer to the ocean, but it meant we were away from people being to the north side of the building... and some on here have complained about noise which wasn't a problem for my girlfriend and I. We were going to sleep at 9pm Hawaii time and didn't find the noise a problem at all. The bed was super comfy and big. TV was a nice flat screen with normal cable that came in handy a few nights before bed when we were bored. Balcony was ugly, as in hideous, but you're looking at the ocean and not the ground in front of you. I knew the prices of the Hilton across from us, and laughed every time I thought what they were paying for essentially the same experience. All furniture from like, 1974. Clean. AC works well and kept me cool at night.Location: Excellent spot, as it's literally across one street to the beach. Saw like, two hookers because someone mentioned it on here and my girlfriend was LOOKING for them haha. But it's central Waikiki and much closer to the beach than many other hotels in this price range!Food:Didn't try the food because it's expensive. Tried drinks at the poolside lounge, which was nice. Service there wasn't so great, but the drinks were tasty and I'm chalking up the bad service to a bad day for our server.Services:Concierge was brilliant. Went there something like 4 times throughout our trip with questions and they were EXTREMELY helpful. Very, very happy with their service. Maids were good. Internet system was horrid. Two computers for the entire hotel when we were there. Good computer over by the concierge for flight bookings/look ups. Normal email checking was basically an impossibility. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to someone who compulsively checks their email every day and still would want to in Hawaii.Synopsis:Overall the hotel is no frills, nothing fancy. But it's right there across from the beach and if you don't mind sacrificing trendy new furniture for older style, ugly furniture, you'll get a view that's worth the exchange. I wanted to wake up and know I'm in Hawaii because I had never been; not be in some city-view room where I couldn't tell if I'm still in Vancouver because all I could see are buildings!!!

As a Platinum SPG member we got an upgrade to a suite on the 28th floor with wonderful views. The hotel is across the street from the Ala Moana Westin also a Starwood property so we enjoyed their amazing public spaces and hung out on the beach. The staff was nice and friendly. We received Starwood points. We were thrilled to only be staying one night. We had a flat screen LG tv in our suite. I have no idea what the general rooms have. The sheets and towels were clean!Here are the negatives. The place was built in the 70's and is in deep need of refurbishment. Carpets are worn and easily at least 10 years old. The hallways and public spaces are dreadful. The breakfast buffet is $23.95 a complete joke given it's set up is mostly for the hordes of budget tourist groups from Japan that the hotel books. There are also a bunch of airline crews that overnight at this property. The pool is ultra small with cheapo pool furniture. Pool waiters are few and far between. The drinks and food are almost as much as across the street at the sister property so you might as well spend your money over there. The dinner buffet was $39.50, again completely overpriced, especially in relation to the other restaurants in the area.There are two dinner shows offered at the property. We didn't even consider them given the food we saw being served at the buffets.We also met some people who were staying on a package bought online from one of the most famous hotel bidding sights. They paid well less than $100/night. Our rate was $109 and that's as much as I felt comfortable paying.The location of the hotel is great, even though it's across the street from the beach. I would wonder when if ever Sheraton/SPG will demand the owners shut down and remodel. My guess is they never will as the hotel is simply going after the budget set of travelers, cheapo tour groups or SPG members who book without realizing how dated this property is. We stayed on a Friday night and the pool/bar area had entertainment until around 10 pm so there is a noise factor even up on the 28th floor that will drown out your tv. We left a generous tip for the housekeeper because we felt sorry she had to work in such a dump and because we're guessing the tourist groups don't tip very well. We bought a bottle of wine and after coming back to enjoy it in the room found there were no wine glasses or cork screw and hence no mini bar....it's the wrong clientele. When I called the front desk to ask for wine glasses and a cork screw they laughed and said room service doesn't open until 5 pm and on top of that they never bring cork screws to the room. They had me take the elevator down to the pool bar to cork the wine and pick up two wine glasses. The bartender was very nice and no they did not try to charge a corking fee. She had obviously corked a number of room's wine bottles previously. If you're looking for a budget hotel and don't care about ambience or the rooms and public spaces, then this is your place. Our bathroom did not have the typical Sheraton double headed shower system or curved shower curtains. It did have a colored jetted tub from the 70's with sliding glass doors and a broken temperature adjust knob. Literally nothing was updated except maybe the pergo floors in the bedroom area. I'm guessing they used to be carpeted. I wouldn't pay anything more than the $109 we paid per night, otherwise I'd feel we got taken. This property is advertised as a 3 Star property so I would hate to see what is considered a 2 Star or 1 Star property. I would rate it a two star property.",Portland,466,2.0

The hotel honors the late Princess Ka'iulani with many paintings and displays. It was our first time staying at Waikiki and found the noise and throngs of people a bit overwhelming after 2 previous weeks in remote locations on other islands. After a nearly sleepless night the first night on the 4th floor above the hotel driveway and the Kings village, we went to the front desk and asked to know our options for moving to a quieter room. They allowed us to view a couple of rooms and we chose one on the 8th floor above the pool. We had a partial ocean view that was lovely and could hear the music from the stage down below. The crafters and free activities in the lobby were wonderful and they brought a total Hawaiian feel to the place. We loved the band and hula dancers who performed most nights! If you get a chance to see the DaLima family perform, they are amazing!We were close to many shops and the beach.

I chose the hotel for several reasons - SPG member, a good rate for a guaranteed Waikiki Beach view, location for my partner's first time to Honolulu.Couldn't fault the staff, all very friendly and helpful. We were able to check in straight away just before midday after a very delayed flight from Sydney. We had a high floor (28?) with a fantastic view over Waikiki Beach. The bed, linen and tv were first class, the rest of the room very ordinary and dated but clean. The railings on our lanai were extremely rusted - a bit hesistant to actually stand on the lanai at all - and the door to the lanai did not close properly so we had whistling wind the whole time (only here for the night so didn't complain). We had a non smoking room (which included no smoking on the lanai) on a non smoking floor but our neighbour obviously couldn't read. I did mention it to the receptionist on check-out and they sent housekeeping up to check. Can anyone tell me why a smoker would book a room in this section of a hotel and completely disregard both the rules and the comfort of other guests? We witnessed a guest at the Coconut Waikiki doing exactly the same and it is a completely 100% non smoking hotel - I hope he copped the $200 cleaning fee.","Sydney, Australia",23,3.0

Many times it would take 5 -10 minutes just to get an elevator.The hotel staff was kind, but gave us a smoking room instead of non-smoking. While they fixed this issue in about twenty minutes; the new room was not very clean. The room was very simple but cute and with a nice view. However, there was quite a bit of dust and the bathroom was really gross. I went to the corner ABC shop (would recommend) and bought something to clean the bathroom myself (hair on many surfaces).The pool looked nice but it was very busy and normally the hotel in general was LOUD.My husband and I went to the International Marketplace and it was very interesting.

The in-room internet charge is $4 for 2 hours, or $13 for the day. The safe has a note on it stating that it costs $3.25 a day for use, though we weren't billed for it at the end of our stay. The restaurant buffet is $40 per person for dinner and $22 per person for breakfast. Staff was friendly and helpful when directing us to local restaurants that weren't on Waikiki's ""miracle mile"".

This was definitely the factor that led to me catching a cold, which is odd when it's +27C outside.Location is alright. Not on Waikiki beach, but a short walk away. Close to bus stops for easy access to the rest of the city. The hotel has free internet in the lobby, but of course has wireless access for a pricey fee. Not a big deal, since you don't come to Hawaii to surf the internet but rather the waves!

Reservation desk informed me that room request was a ""preference"" not a guarantee but she did find another room with a king bed -- and an ugly view of the city. So we were basically given the choice of two rooms, neither of which was the one we had reserved. We escalated the complaint to the general manager of the property, and that office gave us the same ""preference not a guarantee"" song and dance and basically left us with a room that was inferior to the one we had reserved. Too bad for us!I followed up later with Starwood customer service, and it turns out the property was WRONG. A reservation at a Starwood property IS a guarantee, not a preference, and if the property can't accommodate, they are supposed to offer some sort of compensation. This one did not, and as it turns out, they actually lied to me about Starwood's policy. I don't like to do business with liars. Starwood did offer me some points after the fact, so I appreciated that much.As for the hotel itself... the beds and linens were okay, and the view really was spectacular.Everything else was kind of dumpy. The decor had a 70s/80s feel about it. The walls in the public areas and in the room were scuffed beyond belief. The furniture was old and banged up. The wallpaper in the rooms was coming off the wall in my spots.The hotel REALLY needs some investment.

We suggest finding a nice restaurant in Wakiki, money better spent.Parking is $20 bucks a day, although all the hotels get at at least that a day for parking.Overall I would suggest it for a short stay. Great location!","Stormville, New York",26,3.0

I had purchased a HIGH OCEAN VIEW ESCAPE room. The booking agent told me that the room would be located somewhere on the floors numbered in the 20's so that we would be able to see Diamond Head, Waikiki Beach, and a grand view of the ocean. The booking agent also was careful to point out that he could not assign a specific room number but I could be guaranteed a spectacular view because of what I had purchased. However, the hotel placed us on a much lower floor in the single numbers without the Diamond Head View, beach view, and a limited view of the ocean -- even though I presented my written confirmation at the check-in desk specifically stating that the room I purchased was a HIGH OCEAN VIEW ESCAPE location. This was very disappointing that the hotel did not honor my reservation that I had made.",NewHampshire,8,2.0

We were with a group and some of the other people were in the newer part which was an improvement, but not great, but what you would probably expect for the price. Our room/ wing is BADLY in need of a remodel or tear down. I think the bathroom is literally from 1950... the toilet is the kind that you get at a publlic restroom that you flush with your foot... the bathroom was not clean and it was gross. I did not want to take my sandals off and walk barefoot on the gross floor. The sheets were incredibly scratchy. The tv barely worked-- we constantly had lines and static, also it was an old 19 inch tv. The room was tiny as well. You might think that the room doesn't matter much since you don't go to hawaii to stay in your room... well, we thought the same, but it ended up being really rainy (pouring) for several days so we were stuck inside. The pool is pretty small and closes at 6pm. Parking cost us $200!!!! We didn't eat at the buffet in the hotel-- it was $40/per person and did NOT look worth it.. we instead went to a really nice steakhouse for the same price. Also, there is no spa at the hotel. Overall, I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone... I think there are nicer hotels for the same price range. We thought the fact that it is a Sheraton would help and make it nicer... disappointment. The staff seemed pretty friendly though.",Salt Lake City,16,2.0

The staff was very friendly, and without asking we got our Starwood Gold upgrade to a partial oceanview room. From our balcony we were able to enjoy the nightly live entertainment by the pool.My one complaint about the hotel is the slowness of the elevators. We had a very large group staying in our tower, and we often waited a very long time to ride in a jam-packed elevator.The fitness room is quite large, clean, and with decent equipment. We never ate the breakfast buffet, though it looked quite good, because we walked a couple of blocks to Duke's (on the water) for their excellent $15 buffet. We did eat the dinner buffet ($40) one night during the live show -- average, but we just didn't want to go out and wanted to see the show. You're only a block away from the beach, and we sat in the reserved area for the other Sheratons that are right on the beach. It certainly didn't see worth paying $100 more to avoid a short walk. This hotel is also right next to International Marketplace and lots of other shops and restaurants. Our room was clean and our Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed wonderful.","Newton, MA",217,4.0

The rooms and service have certainly improved. This is a tourist class hotel. Don't be mislead by any website's star rating. It is a solid three at times and a meager two at others, but not a bit more or less. The people who posted the worst pictures paid the least. In an ideal word this shouldn't be, but in the world where we exchange money for services it really is. Even SPG rates it a cat 3 out of highest 7(not five).Don't expect to book the cheapest room on the block in a tourist class hotel in this area of waikiki and expect luxury. If you pay for a standard, expect one. They will usually move you to a better room if they have space to improve your experience. Sign up to be an SPG member beforehand and book through their site, their price guarantee is good. It is a large hotel, something like 1100 rooms, and has varying levels of comfort. There is the tower, 29 floors, sweet sleepers, flat screen tvs. The ocean view odd number rooms don't get much sun, but the even numbered ones do. There are very comfortable suites on the top two floors called 'series 71' and 'series 82'. But there can be housekeeping issues in the suites as well-once, we actually looked up at the ceiling lights over the bed, suite, 2871, and there were giant balls of dust around the lights, The a/c vents were nasty, and mold in the bathroom tile grout. But, in general, basic housekeeping is efficient. I don't think the maids climb up on beds to dust the 10' ceilings. Almost all rooms in this building have some sort of ocean view above the 12th floor. Four elevators generally very quick.There is the middle building, I think 12 floors, which has sweet sleepers, but I don't think flat screens yet. On the highest floors of this building are various suites of varying quality. Here you are directly across from the pool, with a good view of the Westin Moana and an ocean view if you are far enough up. On the backside you are out of luck. You are low to the street and the noise can be brutal, and quite frankly the view stinks. On the city side there are no lanais.And there is the wing on the right of check-in, usually reserved as 'crew' rooms for flight crews and 'bulk group tourist getting the cheapest rate' types. These are your two star rooms which have no sweet sleeper, 12 inch tvs, and even the sinks are on two aluminum stands(you can actually lift the sink up). The housekeeping is generally good because they need the aircrew business. The rooms are old but amazingly efficient with fantastic use of spaces. But this building is really your last choice.I've also heard of something called the annex, with extra cheap rooms, but I've never risked it.Contrary to what some other reviewer posted, there is room service. There just isn't any past 2130. A small pot of coffee adds up to about $9.53 by the time the service fee (17%) and deliver fee ($3) get added on. And the breakfast is a bit expensive by the time you add on coffee and juice. But people order room service for a reason so if you want to splurge-splurge, and don't complain.The prime rib buffet is always good downstairs, but I think it gets a bit expensive for everyday. There is always as much snow crab as one can eat. They always offer a seafood, poultry, and pork option in the buffet. There is always a pasta choice. And it's a good opportunity to try some japanese style salads, sushi(very limited), and tofu's. There is always a good selection of breads. There is a very good selection of fresh locally made deserts. The usual ice cream bar and melon and pineapple choices round out the dinner buffet. There are also a-la-carte options to choose from. There is also the requisite Waikiki hula show, every night.The breakfast buffet is interesting. You can have anything made to order by just asking-they don't tell you this, but I've done it several times. One can also treat oneself to the japanese style breakfast. Most people are the usual bacon and egg type so they pay for the buffet and complain there are no choices and it's not worth the 22 bucks per person. But there aren't many places where one can get 'all you can eat' salmon for breakfast or fermented soy beans with mustard. Momoya can be great, just be prepared for smaller portions. The service is good, it seems to me the same staff have been there for a few years. The prices are reasonable.The pikake lounge. Well, what can I say? Land of leisure suit Larry's and lounge lizards. Kidding. The staff are obviously union and not worried about being fired for customer complaints. They understandably don't remember all their clients, but as a returning client I certainly remember them all. They can be downright rude. I've waited 25 minutes for a server to even acknowledge my presence. And I've had to put up with several of them giving me attitude or just plain non-chalance. The drink qualities are inconsistent, invariably. But then again there have been times where they have been downright fantastic.Hint, if you want to have a few drinks at one of the partner hotels, compare prices for drinks and apps with those at the PK. The menus are the same, but the prices about 20% lower at PK.The front desk staff is there to help. There are times when they can be short, but, in general, they are friendly. They always seem to have a way to help me with my issues. There was a time when the front desk supervisor and a few of the clerks were miserable sods, but they seem to have all moved on to greener pastures. I tend to remember people by name. Good job Sherri, James, June, Shauna. Not so good job new guy working nights(forgetful) and day-girl whose name sounds like the Indian word for tea but slightly different(very short). Always, Always, Always, check your bill before you leave. I had the experience, three years ago, of having them (their accounting department) contact me 7 months after my stay to say they hadn't charged me fully!!! Stick up for yourself, but don't be rude to them, ie realize that although this is your vacation it's their job(tourist class hotel, not five star)The pool is there, always clean, lifeguard on duy, and always colder than the ocean. The towel and chair attendants are always great except the female whose name begins with Y. Never had luck with her. Sign in and out for towels with your room key. Really cool new thing is the ability to sign out beach chairs for the day. These have to be back by 1730 or kept till the next day, but they stop taking them back at 1730 no matter what.The Hotel location is fantastic. The public beaches are right across the street. The Westin, Royal Hawaiian(currently closed for renovation), and Sheraton Waikiki beaches are also available for PK customer use.There is a fee for internet, around $14 and change per day. Tough to find wireless, but if you are on the oceanside of the tower you can pick up the new Apple store's wireless. Or you can sign up with the skywave and have wireless everywhere, it's much cheaper than hotel internet. Forget about using the phones.Overall the hotel is dated and nowhere near the quality of her sisters along the beach. But it is a family friendly hotel. We stay here because we're platinum SPG - thus we can book a low-medium priced room and expect the upgrade, although that's also no guarantee.","anchorage, ak",17,3.0

The hotel is right in the heart of Waikiki, the beach, restaurants and shopping are all walkable. The pool is nice, cleaned every morning, entertainment at the pool every night. I ate at the dinner buffet one night, and it was very good. There are so many restaurants in the area, you can make your choice of just about anything. There is even a Burger King and KFC right across the street for those on a budget or just want something quick. There are also the ABC stores on just about every block that have premade sandwiches or salads, soda and beer, or there is a small grocer one block away. If you have a car, there is a Safeway grocery store not too far.My room was large, I had a regular sized dresser, large closet, large bathroom counter, and a great ocean view (upper floor). Small refrigerator to put your groceries or soda in, and a safe that is an extra charge if you use it. Internet service was high, 14.95/day but you can use one of their stations in the lobby for free, with a 15 minute limit. Just be prepared to wait for one to open. I tried my laptop in the lobby and was only able to get online once and it was very slow, every other time I tried it I couldn't find a free wifi signal.Staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. Dukes in another hotel across the street is the happening place to go day or night, they have a great restaurant too! The International MarketPlace is right next door where there is a small food court, and plenty of shops. I was there for Halloween, I had to work that night and couldn't participate, but the main street was crowded with people in costume until at least 2am. It looked like a good time, but driving was horrible that night, it took me 1.25 hours to get back from somewhere that was 10 minutes away.I travel every week, this was my first time in Hawaii and being a female, alone, I felt very safe in the hotel, parking structure and in the neighborhood walking and driving.","Port Charlotte, Florida",64,5.0

The room was tastefully decorated and updated - had the most comfortable (king) bed I've ever slept in. Was like sleeping on a cloud. The room also had a small 2 seater couch, desk, wardrobe with iron and safe (at a charge!), TV and large mini fridge.The bathroom was smallish but lots of towels and shower over bath. The shower had good pressure but when filling the bath the water didn't seem to get hot enough.The lanai had two chairs and a table, which was great to sit out on at night and listen to the music playing from the pool side.We were actually staying as part of our honeymoon, and returning to our room on the second day we had a lovely bottle of sparkling wine waiting for us, which was really nice and thoughtful.The pool is a good size and there are lots of lounge chairs to sit on. The strange thing is that the pool is incredibly deep - starts at a meter and then goes to almost 2 meters deep. the water was over my head after leaving one end of the pool by a meter or so. In otherwords, watch your kids - there is no kids pool either.Lobby was huge and lots of internet stations.

We had to ask to switch rooms because it was so old. And when we opened the ""cover"" that hid the a/c - ewwww. Can you say dust bunnies? People with allergies would've probably had issues.3rd: The hotel is located right next to the International Marketplace.

We booked the Sheraton Princess because the location is good and it was a cheap last minute option and we had some starwoods points to go towards the cost of our stay. Let me assure you there is nothing princess about this place. I noticed a lot of older people at the property (60's and 70's) and lots of flight crew. The hotel gave me what they call an upgraded ocean view room in the nicer tower which starts with an A. I would hate to see what the other regular rooms looked like, because the room I was in on the 23rd floor was pretty bad. I will attach some photos. The balcony was good and the bed was decent. There was lots of mold on the bathroom floor under the sink area. I rate the room a 2 and the lobby a 3. They charge $10 per hour for every hour one stays after the check out time. Do not pay more than $129 per night for this hotel. Do not get suckered into the $36.50 breakfast buffet or the $39.50 dinner buffet. You can eat for a third of the price right across the street on the ocean at Dukes. Hamburgers at the pool were $18 each. I don’t mind paying $18 for a good hamburger at the Ritz or a JW Marriott, but at the ghetto Sheraton Princess, give me a break. I think the hotel capitalizes on the older folks who don’t have the ability to leave the property.We did have a pretty good time. The staff was nice. The weather was great. You must get a rental car to do your travels around the island - if not you will start to feel claustrophobic in the city after awhile. 3 nights in Waikki is enough.

My first impression was that I had stepped into one of the deeply discounted hotels I sometimes stay at when backpacking in Asia. The room was small, the furniture somewhat beat up, the cheapo chair under the desk would be perfectly at home in a typical massive conference hall. But after the first negative impression, I found the positives: there was the Sweet Sleeper bed and nice comforter & linens. And the air conditioning unit was nice and loud, which drowned out the music from the bar only a few floors below. And after the sun came up the next day, everything looked different (and a little better). The courtyard was a nice lush green, and the room they had given me (562) actually had the largest lanai (balcony) in the hotel. When I left, I noticed that a little bit of the ""International Market"" seemed to be spilling into the lobby. Right across from the front desk, there was a long table with ladies and sewing machines sewing pillowcases. And other tables nearby selling various little knickknacks and collectible junk. good:The location of the hotel is great, right in the middle of Waikiki. My room on the 5th floor had biggest lanai (balcony) in the new towerNo fridge in my particular room, but there was a room safe and coffee maker.good & bad:airport shuttle bus can be convenient and cheap (for $9 one way per person), but the hotel is positioned near the end of the Waikiki strip (right before the beach). 3/4ths of the bus can exit before you reach the Kaiulani and by then it's been between an hour & 90 minutes of weaving around Waikiki streets. Taxi ride from the hotel to the airport came out to just under $40. Internet is accessible via wired connections in the room. I saw a sign posted downstairs that stated if you paid for an upgrade, internet would be free. In my non-upgraded case, the rates were: $4.14 for 2 hours, $13.56 for 24 hours, and $67.80 for a full week's access.Half the amenities in our 5th floor room bathroom were of the upgraded ""Shine"" variety, the other half were of a standard generic variety. The bathroom tiles were stained and the linens were tired (not fluffy). Hair dryer in room (yay!)Hotel appears to be in dire need of a renovation. Posters around the hotel tout shows that might be better suited at a Polynesian themed venue in Vegas, with photos of performers with bad 80's hairstyles. If Vegas style entertainment is your thing, then this is good; if the 80's are a pleasant memory best left as a memory, this may not be so desirable. If you want to watch TV, the one in our non-renovated room seemed tiny (15 inches or less). Perhaps the televisions in rooms on higher floors are larger?badThe beat up furniture in our room wasn't a good balance to the nice bed. I suspect all the rooms in the tower are of the smaller size like the one I was in. I don't think it would be a very comfortable stay for more than 2 people per room (a single room probably couldn't comfortably hold a 3+ person family).A few days prior to our stay, I received an e-mailed offer to pay $75 (per day) for an upgrade to a better class of room. Since we were only staying one night, I declined. The room we ended up being placed into was on the 5th floor of the 29 story Ainahau tower. There are four guest elevators for the Ainahau tower, but the cabs are surprisingly small for the height of the building. If you're put on a lower floor, you might have to wait for a few full elevators to go by before you can step into them with your luggage. Because I was staying on a cheapo rate and because I hadn't paid for an upgrade, it looks like my usually magic SPG Gold card had next-to-no influence here. No SPG guest floor with upgraded amenities, no bottles of water in the room, no robes, etc. I did get two newspapers in front of my door while other occupied rooms got none (so that might've been a SPG benefit). The rate I paid was $129 (before taxes) for my one night stay. Would I stay here again? Maybe for another one night crash pad, but for a longer stay, only if this property invested in a significant renovation.","San Francisco, California",627,3.0

However, I was able to find a $130/night on Expecia, so I thought ""ok, one more time"".Upon my checkin, they put me on the 5th floor on the old building (right of the checkin and they claimed it was an upgrade). So instead of a ""standard room"" they gave me a ""city view"". Granted, they gave me a king bed, but I heard the traffic every morning around 6am. The hallway carpet and the room were very dilipated. Very old. I had to turn the shower head to massage mode to stop the high-pitch sound.Having said this, this hotel is very centrally located. In the heart of Waikiki Beach and close to hip bars and resturants. Yes, the hooker corner exits. It cracks me up but I coud see older folks being offended.So if you're looking for an ordinary, old hotel that has great value then this could be it. However, if you're looking for a fancier hotel with the frills, this isn't it.","Denver, Colorado",6,3.0

The pool scene is unusually crowded since Waikiki Beach is across the beach, but I guess, the crowds on the beach can be daunting. Staff is quite engaging and friendly. Live entertainment nightly.

We had an high ocean view room with a king bed. It was on the 19th floor and had a fantastic view of the ocean! Room service and maid service were both great!Pool:The pool was gorgeous. There were shady areas as well as sunny areas to relax and the water was a perfect temperature. No complaints here!Beach:Waikiki beach is waikiki beach. If you're looking for a secluded paradise...keep looking! It was crowded! But we would go to the beach in the early morning before the crowds and have a wonderful time. It was basically across the street from the hotel and around a corner. 5 minute walk - max!Service:The hotel staff was great! The concierge gave us tips and advice to get all around the island. The excursions desk booked tours for us. **Many of the tours don't pick up at every hotel...however, PK is right next to one of the big bus stops! For instance if you go to Germaine's Luau, the buses only pick up behind the Hyatt which is next door to the PK. Convenient!Food:We didn't actually eat at the hotel at all. The food was priced similarly to other hotels in the area. There are a lot of good restaurants walking distance from the hotel.Noise:Here is where things go downhill. There was a band that would play by the pool. Great if you're looking for entertainment by the pool. However, our hotel room faced the pool area and it sounded like the band was in the room with us. AND we were on the 19th floor. I ended up buying earplugs. The music would stop around 11pm, but we were early to bed/early to risers. Not very romantic on your honeymoon. The walls were also paper thin. Our neighbours could be heard at all hours of the night.Location:Well...the location is excellent for the most part. Close to the beach, shopping, food, the Zoo, aquarium, etc. However...the locals call the corner next to the hotel ""hooker corner"". We had a few different tour operators and shuttle drivers tell us this. I didn't notice at first, but once they mentioned it, we did see these girls on the corner. They did not approach my husband, but I did see them approach several men who were either alone or with other males. If you have children, this might be a draw back...but they probably won't even notice!I would go again! I would stay in the exact same room again and not worry about the noise.

From front desk, corridors, rooms, bathrooms... oh mine~ its a very old fashion hotel. I have to agree with other reviewers said, this hotel is nice in its name only.

After reading some of the prior reviews we were not expecting to be awed by the hotel. We were pleasantly surprised!! The hotel itself was pleasant and well maintained. The hotel room was exactly what we expected too, nothing too fancy but a very reasonably priced place to rest( and a very pretty view from the balcony).The hotel staff was very insightful and helpful. We took advantage of the on site travel/activity coordinator. We obtained wonderful info from this person regarding rental car, luau's, snorkeling.Having gone to this hotel during prime time summer vacation, we were expecting to not find any lounge chairs at the pool. We were again pleasantly surprised, not once did we have any problems finding two seats next to each other. Although it was extremely busy/crowded in town, we did not feel the hotel was overbooked or crowded. Some MAJOR points to note: The hotel offers a hospitality guest room. Basically if your airline happens to fly out late on the day you check out, the hotel offers a complimentary room for you to shower/rest before you head off to the airport. We found this to be invaluable! And all you have to do is ask!If you happen to go to this hotel and are looking for more than just a convenience store(ABC store). There is a ""Food Pantry"" grocery store located one major street east of the hotel (2370 Kuhio Ave). We happened to stumble upon it after our 3rd day. The prices are much better at this store for things like snacks, bottled water beer, soda, candy, ice cream. It is a full functioning grocery store. Overall we would return to this hotel.

We were in the high tower initially on the 8th floor but upgraded to a higher floor to get a better ocean view. Room was spacious and had a shower and bath in the bathroom.Didn't eat at the hotel as there are lots of options within walking distance. There is a Denny's if you turn left out of the hotel main entrance and then turn left at the next major street and walk around 200 yards it is on your left. Also there is a cafe if you turn left out of the hotel (on the way to Denny’s) as your approach the man street which does a simple breakfast for $3.95.For dinner we highly recommend the Cheesecake Factory (we ate there twice). The portions are huge and the prices low, especially when you consider you are in Hawaii. Also doing great food is Dukes. We also ate at Nobu as it was our first wedding anniversary. This was pricey (total $240) but worth it for that special meal. Also worth mentioning is PF Changs which is a chain of Chinese restaurants. This was good food and was very cheap too. In terms of tours we did the royal circle island tour which is a full day visiting various sites on ohau including the north shore, pineapple plantation (BTW! the pineapple in Hawaii is the best you will ever taste), look out point from where you can see a large part of the island and a fantastic coconut shrimp place for lunch. Well worth the time and money.We also went to Paradise Cove Luau which was $75 each which sounds a lot for dinner, show and a couple of drinks coupons but it was worth it. If you want to do a luau and get better value you could go to the Polynesian Cultural Centre which also has a series of seven villages that you can see shows and make crafts. The Luau is in the evening. I think the cost of this was $125 but we were put off by the length of the tour 10am and back at 10pm.Waikiki is a really good place and the beach was only a couple of minutes from the hotel. We chose to go to the beach to the left of the hotel and walk about five minutes down the road. It is much less crowded. There is also a Subway, Burger King, McDonalds and an ABC convenience store right across from the beach where we spent our time so it was easy to get something to eat for lunch. The sea was lovely and warm too.To sum up, the Sheraton PK is a mid range hotel in the middle of Waikiki, we were very happy with it and knew it wasn't a five star hotel.

Almost everyday, there were activities in the lobby such as making flower leis,quilting,pineapple cutting, that gave it a sense it was a family atmosphere. Its not a glamorous hotel, but it allows families to experience Hawaii that may not be able to stay in more expensive hotels. The location is great to the beach, and is central to the area activities. The food is expensive-we did not eat there. The one thing I didnt care for was the pool closes at 6:30 pm for the outdoor entertainment but heard many hotel pools close early.

Not only could we hear loud music until late into the night, it sounded like we were in the middle of a construction site with dump and delivery trucks showing up at the crack of dawn. Not to mention that we could hear everything going o in the rooms next to us. After the 4th day of no sleep, I went to tell the manager who wouldn't even come out to speak to me and told the front desk clerk that if I wanted to move, I would have to pay more money. I ended up calling their corporate office to complain and the manager called me on my cell phone and told me I could move at no charge. You could still hear noises on the other side of the hotel, but not as loud and the music broke up much earlier at night. There is nothing special about the rooms at all, from what the staff themselves told us, the food was nothing to rave about, so we never did eat there. We did enjoy meeting for drinks by the pool in the evening. They have live entertainment nightly, however, you'll spend plenty of time waiting for cocktail service out there. One night we made the huge mistake of taking in the hotel's comedy show. It was horrific and sooooo not worth the money. I don't know where they dug these people up from, but it was a huge rip off. If you want to use their hotel gym, you have to go to a different Sheraton and pay money. Also, I felt that the $20 a day to park was outrageous, but in all honostly I'm not sure how that compares to other hotels. The conceirge only wanted to make reservations at restaurants where he would benefit from making the call himself. For the almost $1400 we paid for 7 nights...I'd definitely keep looking around.

This building is the shorter tower which runs parallel to the ocean.We stayed there for six nights and found the room to be clean and comfortable, but, as many mentioned, there are some issues which may make me decide to stay somewhere else in the future.PROS- Beds very comfortable- Rooms kept very clean- balconies- Very short walk to Waikiki Beach (2 minutes) and the Waikiki 'strip'- Pool area looked nice- Nice Hawaiian music poolside nightlyCONS- NO valet! upon check-in we pulled up to the curb and a tour bus pulled in behind us, the single 'bell boy' rushed to the tour bus and didn't even look at us - we had to unload our bags ourselves and I had to go park my car in a multi-storey parking garage next door which was ALWAYS packed with cars and had no elevator! Plus - i had to pay $20 a day!- Understaffed - not only the lack of valet, but the front-desk staff seemed overworked, the concierge was almost never there or was inundated with Japanese tourists. I was even told on two occasions, ""we're short on staff right now""- THIN WALLS - we could hear our neighbors conversations through the vents.- Noisy at times - Waikiki Blvd. gets noisy on any day of the week, especially at peak tourist times. if you are an early sleeper (before 9:30pm) the live music down by the pool is very audible every night!All-in-all, i think we got a great rate, but I would probably pay an extra $20-30/night and stay at the Kaimana Beach hotel which is right on the beach and has very friendly and personable staff and a proper valet!","Honolulu, Hawaii",88,3.0

Had orginally contacted hotel to ask questions and ended up joining their Starwood Program. Got the room for a decent rate. We upgraded to an Ocean View room. Let me tell you, the view was incredible!!! We were on the top floor, 29, and view was of Waikiki Beach and north and also some city/mountain view. Awesome!Check-in had some problems, though. We arrived early and left bags with bell hop in front of hotel. Went and checked-in in case we could get in early. She went ahead and did all the computer work and told us to come back at 3:00, two hours later. That was fine, we went to Dukes and had lunch. We came back at 3:00 and was told that one of our rooms was ready, but someone must have taken the other room because it now showed as filled. Okay, give us another room......She finally found one,we had requested ajoining room, on the top floor, but the second room would'nt be ready for another 2 hours; it had had a late checkout. We asked that all of our luggage be brought up to the room that was ready. We got half of it. Okay, that's alright, we'll just wait until the other room was ready. She called and said that she had accidentally reset our room key and would need to come down and get a new key. I went down there and asked if the other room was ready. She said it wasn't and offered us drink coupons for their lounge. I went ahead and took them and we all went and sat in the lounge for an hour. Room was finally ready and we went back up to make sure our luggage was there and get ready for the evening. Our room key didn't work! So back downstairs and they reset it again. Worked this time!The rooms were a little ""tired"", but clean. The beds were incredibly comfortable and pillows nice. We were in the ""Ainahou"" Tower. Much nicer than the other, older tower.We got 2 papers every morning at our door, complimentary. Because we were Starwood enrolled and stayed 4 nights, the 4th night was free and we got a $100 food coupon for each room. We decided to use that for the Mother's Day Brunch at $40 a person! It was good, but not worth the $40 ,so glad it was free.They had a great show, Creation, A Polynesian Adventure. We would definitely stay here again, but only in the high ""A"" tower.",Oregon,19,4.0

We stayed in the north tower and could see the Royal Hawaiian hotel from our lanai and a bit of an ocean view. The room was very basic - two queen beds, one chair and a desk with the TV. We were a bit crowded because we also had my 19 month old son's travel playpen with us that was set up between the slider to the lanai and the bed. The furniture itself is old, outdated and in need of replacing. The beds, however, were very nice. Upgraded linens and very comfortable.We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants because it was kind of pricey. We did sit out and listen to the entertainment by the pool one night and have a few drinks. Nice atmosphere. Can't beat the weather in May.The tower we stayed in only offered dial-up internet connection and it was spotty. The in-room safes did say there was a daily charge for use, but we called the front desk to ask because literature in the room said the safes were available free of charge. The front desk said they don't charge anymore, it's an old sign, but we double checked at the end of our stay and there wasn't a charge, so we were pleased.Other than that, the hotel was perfect for our stay and met our expectations.

We were originally booked for a city view room but arrived late on our check-in date and were bumped up to an ocean view room. The view from the balcony on one of the highest floors made this a much better hotel experience! Otherwise, we would not have had a view overlooking the gorgeous Waikiki beach! The hotel has a great location a block off the beach. It is walking distance to many great restaurants (try Duke's!!!), shops, and the bus stops. We did not rent a car here and did not need one. The hotel has a small outdoor pool but we didn't mind as the beach is almost right across the street! The front desk staff were extremely courteous and helpful. The hotel has a delicious buffet breakfast which we loved, especially with the outdoor patio tables, but we weren't as crazy about the dinner even thought it was much more expensive. The hotel grounds were beautiful. Overall, a very nice, clean hotel-- if you can get a room on a higher-up floor, I would definitely recommend! The view is more than worth it :)",New Jersey,15,4.0

(It is not close to the convention center, but this conference was running a shuttle between the hotels. It would be about a 20 minute walk to the convention center.)I don't have anything really bad to say about it, but I don't have anything really good to say either. The location is very convenient to Waikiki Beach, shopping and dining. The hotel itself is a pretty basic business type hotel. It is across the street from the beach. From our balcony, we could see a sliver of ocean between the other hotels closer to the beach. The rooms were clean and the staff was polite. The main negative I'd say is that they really seem to nickel and dime you for everything. For a business oriented hotel that was about $175 a night, charging for WiFi seemed stingy to me. There were some public internet terminals in the lobby, but they were usually occupied, and it's just not the same as being able to use your laptop.What seemed even more ridiculous was the $3/day charge to use THE ROOM SAFE. There's just no excuse for that. I have stayed in hotels before where you had to pay for internet access, but never for the safe. That just strikes me as gouging, and I socked away my valuables in the sock drawer instead of playing along. I would not stay here again unless I had Sheraton points to cash in, or all other affordable hotels were booked up. We attended a couple of functions at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and it was much nicer for only slightly more per night. Based on talks with other people from the convention, if we did it again, we would stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, Ala Moana, or Westin Moana Surfrider (although the Westin would likely have been out of our price range)It's not bad... but there are better choices. If you get a good deal on it, it's a decent home base to do things around Hawaii, but you will not find yourself spending time on the hotel grounds like you might at the Hilton or Westin which have their own beach areas.(Parking was $20/day which did not seem unreasonable for the middle of Honolulu.)","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",76,3.0

I chose the cheapest website with the cheapest rate, upon arrival we were upgraded several times to a room with a pool view (nice in the evening with every night a hula band by the pool) The hotel is a little tired looking in parts but not the communal areas...i get the feeling if your not happy about something, they will attempt to do something about it like moving you're room. The pool area is immaculate and will give you towels to take to the beach... Which is just a 2/3 minute walk away, Its also close to bus stops, shops, car rentals in fact anything you could really need... I had one lunch time snack around the pool which was ok, didn't eat much there though.The room was cleaned very well every day and all the staff seemed fine...

I was considering this or the Ohana and ended up choosing this one because of the pool area and the fact that I could tell that it was directly across the street from the Moana Surfrider. Although the hotel is not one of the new luxury hotels it ended up being a great choice. The location is excellent. We were given room 718 which overlooks the pool and even offers a small view of the ocean. (nonsmoking and king bed as requested) While the room decor itself was fairly old fashioned and basic, it did have a small balcony overlooking the pool and the nightly entertainment. There is a small stage and local bands provide music nightly until 9:30. The weather was perfect for sitting on our balcony and listening to the music. Very pleasant. The room comes with a small tv but we never even turned it on. There is a small fridge, a inroom coffee maker, an iron and ironing board, and a hair dryer. The bed was comfortable and when we called and asked for a lighter blanket and foam pillows they arrived in less than 30 minutes. If you like granite countertops and brand new furniture you might not be happy with the room but we were fine it. We brought our own laptop and verizon internet connections but did think it odd that the hotel doesn't offer free wi-fi. They also charge for the inroom safe which we didn't use. One of the best things about the place is the location. It is right in the middle of the best part of Waikiki (IMHO) Plus we were extremely happy with our view of the pool. The hotel was reasonably quiet and everyone was very friendly and helpful. We would stay here again if we could get the same room and the same price.","La Quinta, California",99,4.0

This is my third stay. Room 918 in the main tower is my favorite!! While compared to other hotels, some will say it is 'older' in appearance, but it includes all the amenities I needed. Only complaint is no wireless in the main tower. Although I was able to get it from the Hyatt T-mobile signal though while sitting on my lanai. Location, location. Awesome pool. Fresh pineapple in the afternoons, chair rentals, towels. Great sister properties. I used the gym down at the Sheraton Waikiki and also the beach chairs/area over at the Moana Surfrider. It is a short walk to EVERYTHING!I can't say much more great things about this place. For those that complain, I think they might be expecting more for the $140/night price tag.

Unfortunately, we read them and booked at the PK partly due to these reviews, and we were extremely disappointed. Maybe our expectations were just too high, having stayed at nicer hotels in the past.To say that the PK is old and run down is understating the truth. If you want a hotel that is clean, new, nice, modern; Then this is not your place. Our arrival in their drive up area was greeted by a mob of people also arriving, but not a single solitary valet, and not a single, solitary bellman. I was finally told that they don't valet, and told to pull around back to their self-parking garage. For the privilege of parking my own car in their dilapidated, crowded garage that has NO ELEVATOR in it, I was CHARGED AN ADDITIONAL $20 A DAY. So if you plan to have a rental car, factor that into your costs.Our ""ocean view"" room on the 19th floor (also paid $50 more a night for the ocean view) was a view of buildings, but if you walked out on the crumbling deck and looked 90 degrees to the right, you had a ocean view, so I guess that counts. The elevators to get to the 19th floor were always crowded and slow, and stopped on the 12th floor (with no passengers waiting) every single time you went down.The lobby and pool area were a constant area of activity, and the free pineapple was a nice touch, especially when waiting in the lengthy lines to check in and check out. The TV checkout system doesn't work, and the business center computers are nice in that they are complimentary, but not nice in that they are not connected to any printers, so you can't print boarding passes or anything like that.The hallways, corridors, carpet, EVERYTHING, has a musty 1960's, run down feel to it. Sheraton/Westin have 3 other properties within walking distance and all of them, especially the Sheraton Waikiki just down the way, are nicer and classier. The PK is obviously the poor stepchild of the rest and they have not put a dime into the place in 30 years, I guarantee that. The room was a joke. Standard size, old furniture. I didn't know they still made color TV's as small as the one in this room, it was like 10 inches, in a terrible old cabinet. The bed was actually fairly new it seemed and comfortable, but the A/C worked very poorly. I called maintenance about it after the first night and was told they would look at it. Not sure if they did, but it did not improve. The bathroom was dingy and the tile and counters were old, old, old. The whole place is badly in need of a makeover, or the wrecking ball.We also booked on a package where we were offered $100 ""dining credit"" for any of the restaurants in this hotel or the sister properties. We had 2 great meals at Rum Fire, at the OTHER Sheraton, only to find out when we checked out, that the $100 was for ""food only"". No drinks, none of the tax, nothing but purely food was covered, so we didn't even make it to $100 on our stay. What a scam! This was nowhere in the fine print, but what can you do at this point?","Rancho Bernardo, California",63,1.0

The beach is a few minutes away and just across the street. Also close to bus services.2) Rooms were clean and a good size. We stayed in a high ocean view room (on the side which does not face the pool where there is nightly entertainment and hence may be noisier). Our ocean view was limited however, as there were so many high rises on the beach front which stood in the way. 3) Free pineapple between 2 and 3 pm and if your plane is late, there is a hospital room which you can use for an hour (after you've checked out). Allows you to shower and clean up before hopping on the plane.4) There are free computers (about 4 working stations).

My first stay with PK was back in 2005 and its a hotel that we keep going back to. (I'm returning again in a few weeks time for my fourth time. Once you've been to hawaii its very easy to keep going back time and time again). Waikiki Beach is one of my favourite places in the world. The food, the beach, the people, Diamond Head the massive volcano crater at the end of the beach... theres nothing like it. ME:To set the scene Im what you could call a ""value"" traveller... certainly not a budget traveller but I like to see my money go a long way. My first stay at the PK was arranged by my partner but the subsequent few stays by me. I'm 28 and my other half is 36 we're from Sydney. BOOKING:Tip One: After paying a travel agent a nice commission the first time around, we now always book online direct with the hotel . You'll find some of the best rates rather than having to search and AAA members can sometimes get better rates. I've only stayed partial and ocean view in the past - good to escape any street level noise. ARRIVAL:Tip Two: outside the airport the HNL airport you can get a shuttle to the hotels in waikiki. The shuttle comes regularly and is about 12 bucks or so. During our last trip we got stuck in traffic for a while so may be a better alternative than having the meter in a taxi clicking over. My first experience with PK was like a few other reviewers arriving on an morning flight from Sydney. Being excited about going on holiday didnt sleep much during the over night flight and really wanted to have a rest but our room wasnt ready. Check-in is around 3. So you dont have to go rummaging through your luggage in the reception take some summer/beach clothes (and sunblock) in your hand luggage. Dont worry if you've forgotten anything though... Honolulu is covered with ABC stores - (A Hawaiian institution that sell everything you need for a hawaiian holiday - its easy to become a fan! I guarantee you'll be visiting just about everyday for one thing or another) There are a couple across the road from the hotel. They also sell Washing Powder and fabric softener if you want to use the coin operated laundry in the hotel. ROOM:When our room was finally ready on our first stay, we received a complimentary upgrade to a higher room (very happy about that! ) Staying in Sheraton before I had reasonable expectations about the room but can say was a bit shocked when I stepped in. More fool me for not reading up first. The decor is ""Classic Hawaiian"" (classic as in hasn't been updated in a long time).The rooms are clean and tidy. If you come with this expectation it wont be a shock! Quite frankly it really didn't matter once I saw the view. PK is one hotel back from the beach (behind the Moana Surfrider) but towers over it. The views were stunning. I'll try and attach a pic or twoAfter familiarising yourself with Honolulu you realise the location of the PK is what makes it and is one of the biggest reasons we keep going back, its so central that you dont have to spend all of your time walking long distances and it comes at a reasonable price. The last time we stayed they had added complimentary internet access in the lobby. Accessing online banking and flight info was so much easier than having to use in-room internet or having to go looking for an internet cafe. STAFFThe staff at PK are very helpful the concierge can certainly give you all the tips on things to do.EATING:There are plenty of places around where you can get food if you dont want to eat the buffet in the hotel. If breakfast isnt included in your room rate it is much cheaper to eat out. We discovered a place called 'The Cheesecake Factory' nearby. This place is heaven for food lovers. Australia has nothing like it but they have a few other restaurants throughout the states. You cannot go to honolulu and not eat here, the menu and the food is amazing I cannot recommend it highly enough. But be prepared to wait during peak times it is tremendously busy. Appetizer or Entree size is the same size as an Australian Main so dont over order. POOL SCENEIn the afternoon when you are tired of the beach, the hotel has a great pool area. The tiles are hot so remember your flip flops (they are thongs if you are an Aussie) A great place to relax in hte afternoon.. make some friends over a couple of Mai Tai's (the delicious local cocktail - yum). THINGS TO DO: We had an amazing experience a couple of days into our first stay. For a couple of dollars we bought inflatable Lilo mattresses from the ABC store and were floating around in the surf at the beach across the road (getting a hawaiian tan) when a woman on a nearby shrieked ... it took a couple of seconds before I realised that she wasnt getting eaten by a shark... it was a half a dozen giant sea turtles were feeding around us.. and this is at one of the busiest parts of the beach, directly across the road from the hotel. Relaxing in the sun in the aqua blue warm hawaiian waters. You cant get better.. Tip Three: you can have your mattress inflated at the ABC store or to save the hassle there is a guy who sells them already inflated in the beach access lane next to the Royal Hawaiian.)CAR: If you have a hire car there is a parking station attached to the hotel. If you hire a car you can go to:The Arizona memorial - Pearl HarbourNorth Shore - be mindful that there are a ridiculous amount of rental car break-ins on the north shore. The Waikele Outlets - Diamond Head- You can walk to the top of the massive crater at the end of waikiki beach, amazing views, not for the faint hearted some of the stairs on the trail are almost vertical!SHOPPINGThe Ala Moana shopping centre .. not far from the hotel you can jump on the Pink Trolley (open air bus) which will take to you to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre. Its 2 bucks a ride. I think I could live here... shoppers heaven. Waikele outlets - best to get there by hire car, that way you can leave when you've had enough, if you book a tour you have to return at a certain time. Print down a voucher online and pick up a book from the info desk for some great discounts. Stay at PK for the location, the hotel itself is a bit dated but with so much to do in you wont be spending a lot of time there anyhow!","Sydney, Australia",26,4.0

Only one sore spot, when we arrived there was a long lineup at the Check-in-Counter and were told the rooms would not be available until later in the afternoon. After approximately thirty minute wait, I found out this information and asked to be upgraded. They were able to accomodate our request for a little extra. They should have informed everyone earlier due to the fact there was a number of older people in the lineup. We were happy with our room and spent our time enjoying the pool. We explored the sites of Oahu and were satisfied with our surroundings. Our room faced the pool and each night we were treated to music from the poolside.

The hotel is in a fine location (although not right on the beach, it is walking distance to a lot of shopping and eating), the lobby was nice...but that was it. I got there pretty late, so I was tired and hungry - sorry room service ends at 9pm. Mini-bar with snacks? Nope. Vending machine? Nope. Try the ABC market across the street. It was a little irritating that one HAS to leave to hotel for a snack after 9pm. Okay - I get off the elevator and the first thing I see is the ""Starwood Preferred Guest Floor"" sign, I immediately think that this actually means something...wrong again. The floor was filthy as were the walls in the hall way. I got to my room and it had a balcony - staring at 4 other buildings/hotels. I do realize that I didn't book an ocean view room - but I guess I expected that the city view room would have a view of the city - and not be 25 feet away from the hotel next door. After getting in bed - I think I realized that the best part of this short three day business trip to Honolulu would be the comfy bed. Although I didn't hear it the first night, on the second and third nights, the faucet in the bath tub dripped all night long. The last morning I decided to go down stairs to try the breakfast buffet. I was okay - nothing spectacular - but acceptable. I ate and proceeded to the check out counter - because I was tired of waiting around for the waitress to take my check - what a mistake that was. The cashier was sooo mean. Everyone that approached her got their heads bitten off...you are better off waiting for the waitress.To wrap up - The PK Hotel wasn't the worst hotel I have stayed at, but I definitely left feeling dissapointed after so many wonderful experiences at Starwood hotels.Side note: I think that was my first and last time to Honolulu. Not because of the Sheraton PK - but because Honolulu has got to be the worst place in Hawaii. I have been to Maui and the Big Island several times each, and I guess I was just spoiled by their natural beauty and lack of sooooo many people and traffic.","Los Angeles, California",1,2.0

We basically received a room that was not as described in the original reservation and the only accommodation the hotel had available was for an upgrade which we had to pay for. The only explanation the front desk could give us was that all basic rooms are described as a ""Cityview room with balcony etc."" and that a ""Cityside room"" which is much smaller with no balcony can also be described as such. I feel this is very deceptive and we would not have stayed there if given that option. We actually had reservations at another hotel but cancelled because we thought we were getting a certain level of accommodations.

This yr was our 40th anniversary so thought we would stay in a little swankier place. What a disappointment. Like all the bad things the other reviewers wrote Id have to double it. First we are smokers, ya I know, and had requested a smoking room, which we got if we would have arrived on Sunday as planned but due to flooding on the big island we went to waikiki on Friday and conviently they had no smoking rooms but we sure could upgrade and get one. ( other hotel reviews on here people write all the time about a free upgrade) for a price. Thought maybe since it was our 40th they would give us one HUH they sure did for $25 a night (5 nights) so we took it. Got to the room and as one reviewer on here said what a disappointment that isnt the word. For what you are paying the room wasnt as nice as the ohana west and for twice the price. The wallpaper was coming loose from the wall in many places, if you looked where the floor met the walls, there was dirt and waste and the bathroom tile floor was a mess, grout was all dirty and corners dirty, the toliet was sitting on the floor at a angle and when you sat on it you thought that you had to hold on so you didnt fall off, There are no dressers just a small set of drawers not enough for one person in the closet, also in the closet was 2 bottles of water with the ice bucket the bottles had a sign on them only $4.25 each comeon high priced room and you have to pay $4.25 for a dollar bottle of water?? Your morning coffee isnt free either in the room, our coffee maker was screwed up open the lid to pour the water in and the hinges were broke so you had the lid in your hand, after the coffee was made there was no way you could remove the pot without opening the filter basket and the same trying to put the pot away. The mattresses have seen there better day and thought that I was going to fall out of bed several times the center is higher then the sides,. Unfriendly very unfriendly staff EXCEPT for the maids and bells very nice people, we went back to the room one day to put some purchases away and the maid was in the room. We told her what we wanted to do and she stopped her work moved the vacuum out in the hallway asked for our room key and shut the door and then used our key to open it, you dont find that at many hotels!!!!! Maid was very security minded. Now the good parts Location Location Location and when we upgraded it was called a ocean view room which it kind of was, you could see the ocean if you stood at the lanai railing but not if you sat in the chairs and the sun set between two hotels and it was very nice. Every day between 2 and 3 they give away free slices of pineapple in the lobby and they have 5 computers with internet that you can use for free. Have to wait your turn and sometimes that was 30 or 40 minutes. So for our 6th trip you can bet we wont be staying at the SPK I could write more but dont want to take up your time as I think you get the point, IT'S NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!",Iowa,5,1.0

After our early morning flight there coming from the winter cold, we were expecting warm greetings when we arrived........ I mean, you would think the guest services could at least have a smile on their face when they say ""Aloha""!? Instead, it almost seemed like we were just a complete hassle when we asked any form of question at all, nice, really nice:) So, we went about checking in and went up to our rooms to see how they were, and quite honestly it was a disappointment when we opened the door and realized we were paying a ridiculous amount for a VERY AVERAGE room:) Now, one thing I do have to admit, besides the awesome location, we did have an amazing view:) The next morning we thought it would be nice to attend the breakfast buffet in the Pikake Lounge, considering we had a bunch of family fly in to meet for a special occasion. After finding out it was $21.95 EACH, we decided to sit down anyways and enjoy the beautiful atmospshere (so we thought!)

We were scared considering some of the reviews, but we really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were dated, and a little rough around the edges, but overall our room was very pleasent and clean. The room had a late 1980s feel. The staff was genuinely friendly and helpful. I can see how where you are located can affect your stay. We were in the Princess tower and our room overlooked the pool and the Westin Moana across the street. It was nice. There is pool entertainment noise at night, but we were so exhausted at night, it didn't bother us. Try to avoid street rooms at the lower levels due to bus noise. This is not a hotel for you if you if you are finicky about your room, or you like to spend a lot of time at your hotel, lounging at the pool, lingering over room service meals, and relaxing. This is not the place for honeymooners. The hotel has a small pool and a busy atmosphere and the rooms are for showering and sleeping. I personally found the atmosphere festive with a ""I'm on vacation!"" feel. We are active travelers, who are gone all day, and the room was perfect for us. The beds are comfortable. I like the small Hawaiian touches the hotel provides. Flowers for you hair at the desk, which my daughter loved, pineapple slices and juice in the afternoon, lei making and hula lessons and craft sellers in the lobby and Hawaiian entertainment at night. Though sometimes the night entertainment was very lounge lizardy. We had a discount for the morning buffet that we used. It was very good, with a wide variety of breakfast foods. Our price with the discount made it reasonable, but if your on a budget I would skip it. Avoid the waxy doughnuts, not worth the calories. Yes the name says Sheraton, but with a room rate of about $150 - 200 in expensive Waikiki, you should know that you are not going to get a top notch room and you won't. When they do rehab it, prices will go up accordingly. I felt our room rate was fair for what we got, a clean, comfortable room in a great location.  A hint for those parking with luggage, go to the top part of the parking garage that is labeled ""additional parking."" There is an elevator there that can take you to the lobby. The lower levels do not have an elevator and you have to lug your luggage down stairs. We had a great time in Waikiki, which I usually avoid for the North Shore, and I would definitely stay here again.","Illinois City, Illinois",16,4.0

The check in was quick and professional, so no complaints about that part of the process.We stayed in room 236, a king room at the end of the hall with a lanai overlooking the pool, and just immediately over the reception area. While the lanai sliding doors did a pretty credible job of blocking out the noise, if they were open to allow in the lovely breeze, it was VERY noisy. It seemed that there was a tour bus loading up every morning and it was a constant cacophony. The hotel is one block off Kalakaua Blvd, the main drag in Waikiki, so lots of road noise, and at night, lots of noise coming from the street performers as well as the nightly poolside show. In retrospect, I probably should've asked to stay on a higher floor, and perhaps some of it might have been filtered out.The bed was comfortable, the bathroom pretty standardly sized with a pocket door for privacy. We were pretty exhausted the day we arrived from the long flight there, so I didn't notice it immediately, but when I went out onto the lanai the next morning to enjoy some fresh pineapple juice, I noticed a large crack in one of the sliding glass doors, and several bloodstains on the curtains. Now, to their credit, once I pointed it out to the housekeeper, they immediately got to work on it and the front desk called up and offered to move us to a different room, but my partner was ill and uninterested in repacking just to unpack again, so we declined. But it did make me wonder how long it had been there and how often they inspected such things.It seems to be a global trend for hotels to nickel and dime you to death for amenities that should come with the room, which annoys the ever-loving daylights out of me. You have to mount an exploration to find the free channels ( I was looking for CNN) on TV; the menu button on the remote leads you directly to all the pay services. Wireless internet access is expensive, and the signal wasn't that great; you could take advantage of the free desktop computers downstairs, but be prepared to wait, as there was always a queue. There was an in-room safe, which has been free everywhere else I've stayed, but I believe they were charging something like $4.95 a day to use it. There is a free computer solely devoted to checking in for flights and printing boarding passes - but it closes at 9:00 pm when the concierge leaves, and if you want to check in for a flight back to the mainland which leaves at say, 10:45 pm the next night, you can forget about doing anything about it until the concierge returns at 7:30.The breakfast buffet, while tasty, was a ridiculous $21.95 per person. We did it once, and for the rest of our stay opted to go across the street to the ABC store and get fresh fruit salads and sodas there for $5.00 per person, which we could eat in our room, free of the annoying gulls who set up shop in the open-air dining area. As soon as a diner would get up from the table, the birds (who had long since lost any fear of humans!) would swoop in to devour any leftovers on the plate. That was just too creepy for me to deal with, personally. The wait staff tried to shoo the birds constantly, but were overwhelmed by their number and their tenacity.Waikiki Beach is across the street. There are two public beach access points convenient to the hotel; go left (towards the ""Duke"" statue and the Police Station), and there's a little snack bar, restrooms, surfboard rentals, etc; there is another if you cross the street at the Moana Surfrider and head up the street towards the Cheesecake Factory. You can check out beach towels poolside with your room key and take them to the beach and then sign them back in when you return.There are several shuttles that pick up across the street - the ""pink line"" will take you to Ala Moana Mall for $2 each way; there's also a free Hilo Hattie's shuttle which will take you to their flagship store on Nimitz Blvd. After you've dropped some bucks for the quintessential touristy souvenirs, the shuttle driver will, on request, drop you off at Ala Moana Mall, the Aloha Tower, or the Ward shopping center.The one thing I really liked about the hotel was at 2:15 every day, you could taste fresh pineapple or drink a cup (or two!) of fresh pineapple juice. It was wonderful, and can't recommend it highly enough.","Durham, North Carolina",31,3.0

We had a great room but it was pretty expensive.This time I took my mother and decided to stay at the Sheraton Princess K or as I remembered it ""the Sheraton with the hookers out the front"" as it was more centrally located (so easier for an older person with mobility issues), much cheaper (USD $185 per night) and was pretty well reviewed on this site. As it was apart of the Sheraton chain I figured it would have to be pretty decent too. This hotel is good value for money especially when you compare it to a lot of the other hotels that are pretty much in exactly the location. We stayed around Thanksgiving and I was surprised at how cheap it was considering it was a peak holiday time in the USA and there were plenty of guests. It is a short stroll to the beach and surrounded by good shops, restaurants and close to the Food Pantry supermarket on Kuhio Avenue.The lobby and pool area is great and I was pleasantly surprised with our room on the 29th floor. It wasn't the Marriott and as others have commented, the hotel could do with a refurbishment soon. The beds and bedding were wonderfully comfortable and the room was clean and in good condition with a good size lanai. That said the bathroom reminded me of the shower scene in Psycho (very 1950's) and after a few days there seemed to be a bit of mould near the top of the shower rail that was mysteriously never cleaned by housekeeping. The room faced the International Marketplace (not the ocean like it was supposed to but you could technically see the ocean) so it was pretty noisy until midnight and I had to sleep with earplugs a couple of nights. We didn't eat at the hotel as it was expensive and there were so many great restaurants within a short walking distance. The free Overall it was good and I would stay here again and recommend it as a mid range accommodation. I have stayed in much worse places than this!!!! Some of the hotels off Kuhio Avenue looked pretty rubbish in comparison so I think the Princess K is pretty good considering that hotels tend to be pretty expensive in Waikiki.

The Sheraton is in an L configuration with the patio, pool and performance area in the open space to form a rectangle on Kalakaua Avenue, the main street of Waikiki. The best part of Waikiki Beach is just across the street and east or directly through the Moana Surfrider, about 25 yards. The International Marketplace is just west of the hotel and other major shopping centers are within a few blocks.While advertised as a three-star property, this hotel should definitely should be rated higher. The lobby is open-aired, well-staffed and the room was in excellent condition. We were upgraded from the lowest priced room to a front location overlooking the pool, Kalakaua Avenue and over the palm trees, the ocean. The room contained a king bed, sofa and dresser/desk. The balcony was small but both sliding doors could be opened to make it part of the room.The evening buffet was expensive but we ordered ala carte at the bar at a more reasonable price. Entertainment is provided each night from 6:30-9:30 in the form of a trio with dancers. As a promo for a Legends show, performers like Elvis, Chuck Berry and Whitney Houston also drop in to sing. There is a parking fee of $15 a night but the parking attendant issued a pass after the first night. Free internet is provided at stations in the lobby, however, wireless can be found on the balcony.The price, quality, location and ambiance make for an excellent value in Waikiki.

That's part of the deal. If you want to avoid this, go to Maui. Yes, the hotel buffet was expensive, but this is Hawaii people; everything is expensive!

Free, public internet computers, available for 15 minutes at a time, contain viruses, are very slow, and most were out of order.

The room #2956 could do with some updating, but its decent enough - I've definitely had better 3* rooms in new hotels, but the Kaiulani easily possesses a 3-4* feel in the lobby.Great view from the room (top floor, facing Diamond Head).Good location, and at $185 I'd say it was very good value. Check in was nice - drop the baggage off from the car, park (in their car park), obtain keys within 2 mins, nip to the bar for a cold pint while the missus arrives and the bags get taken to the room.We stayed Thanksgiving night. I'm British, so don't care and didn't even know it was Thanksgiving until 2 days before, but was grateful for the accommodation. We were tired after a long day and needed to eat dinner. I was tempted to order dinner using room service, but there was a disclaimer that said 17-18% service charge would be added to the price. What's that about?? In the end we ate at the Thanksgiving buffet around the pool as we couldn't find anything we fancied nearby. Reasonable food $38 each though, not including any drinks.",london,22,4.0

The central location was great with the beach just across the street. Lots of restaurants and shops were adjacent and the short blocks made walking around town quite easy. The public bus and paid trolley stops were nearby. Bus/organized tours picked up right outside the hotel.The pool was only open from 9am-6pm and there was no hot tub to warm up in after swimming at the beach. The hotel itself didn't have a gym, though the sister Sheraton hotel had facilities where you could pay to get in, if you wished. There were some restaurants at the hotel which we did not visit (there are so many around that were less expensive). At 2pm, the hotel offered ""pineapple carving"" where you could help yourself to fresh pineapple juice and pineapple slices (delicious) <even if you're not a guest, you could stroll in and induldge!>. During the day, there were a few vendors selling crafts by the pool.The rooms were small, but very clean. I loved the pillows though I found the mattress a little firm. Our view towards the west wasn't much. Unfortunately, we were located on the 3rd floor which TOTALLY SUCKED BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY NOISY FROM 4AM unti 11PM. The people traffic wasn't bad - the problem was that shuttle buses and tour buses would idle outside on the street picking up passengers. Very annoying. We did ask for a room overlooking the poolside when we checked in, but apparently, they didn't have anything available. Because we wanted two adjacent rooms, we elected to stay where we were. Although some rooms had connecting doors, ours didn't so I guess that we should have requested new rooms on the second day. Oh bother!Hotel summary: good location, clean rooms, nice staff, and good price BUT request rooms towards the poolside and remember that this is not a resort hotel - there's so much to see in Oahu - don't plan to spend much time at the hotel. Go experience Hawaii!Recommended outings: Germaine's luau, Giovanni's shrimp truck, Duck tour - Pearl Harbor, Hanauma Bay, Kailua kayaking, Diamond Head, Happy Trails horseback riding, Waimea Audobon Center (waterfall!), Waikiki Aquarium, Makani Catamaran","Escondido, CA",115,4.0

I was alittle surprised by how small the room was. One of the cabinets is taken up for the frig and the safe, so you were left with very little space to unpack. There are drawers in the closet, but they are quite small. I guess it just was hard to keep the room very tighty with so little storage space. We did have to deal with the noise, but I was so worn out each night, I really did not have any trouble sleeping. What I would really want you to know is, if you are looking for a resort type enviroment, this is not the place for you. It is a hotel and no more. They try by having bands by the pool and bring in vendors to sell hats, jewelry, etc. They also have a few classes such as lei making, but they are in the middle of the day and most people are already out and about. The location is great if you are looking for shopping and yes there does seem to be an ABC Store on every block! The beach is not far and the hotel is great about letting you take their towels from the pool area to the beach. As a Starwood Preferred guest we are suppose to get late check out, when I went to the front desk the day before we left, I was told they were totalled booked and would not get late check out. I called the next morning and was told ""no problem"". This really helped as our flight did not leave until late that night so we were able to visit the beach one last time and really enjoy our last day in Hawaii. I visited with one of the clerks at the ""Thor"" store and she told me that Honolulu is not what Hawaii is about, you really need to visit the other islands to get the true ""aloha spirit"". We did take a one day trip to Maui and really enjoyed it. The only down side is the hurry up and wait at the airport. We had to wait over an hour and a half each way at the airport. So, if you are going to shopping, spend alittle time at the beach and site see this hotel will work for you.

I've been in 3 star hotels in Mexico that were nicer and better equipped than the Princess Kaiulani. The staff are all very nice, but the room was fairly cruddy - all the bathrooms were very old with floors that had very questionable, moldy looking stains in the grout and it was very cramped - if one person is standing up in the room, you'd get claustraphobic just looking in from the doorway. I had to sleep in a room where water dripped from the ceiling onto my head for 2 nights before they felt it was appropriate to move me. The hotel is very conveniently located right across the street from the beach, next to the International Marketplace, but I was almost embarrassed to tell people where I was staying. Bottom line - good location explains the rates, but overall, it's a rundown hotel that you wouldn't expect to find in the hotel zone right along Kalakaua Avenue next to all the expensive, high end retail shops.","Clayton, California",15,2.0

However, when we arrived at the Princess we were pleasantly surprised. The front desk were helpful. The rooms were cleaned well. Our room had a pool view. Every evening we would listen to the live Hawaiian music playing downstairs as we got ready to go out. Beautiful !. My husband loved the pineapples that were served to eat or as a juice. This took place daily at 2pm in the lobby. I loved chatting to the local Hawaiian people who came to sell souveniors. The Princess Kaiulani is in a fantastic location. Close to the shops, beach, restuarants. I see what people mean when they compare it to other Sheratons.

Maybe we just got lucky with housekeeping for the time we were there. I am very particular with cleanliness of rooms! I usually always call the front desk on my first entering a room.

I could not afford to spend a great deal. The location is great . The beach is a block away, and all the good restaraunts are in the area. We went to the Luau at The Royal Hotel. Not to be missed.

Hotel will be on the left of the one way street and is across from the Moana Surfrider. You must turn left at the light for the front entrance. Great input from others such that we knew to pull up to the hotel and drop off our luggage with the bellcap BEFORE parking the car. We then parked next door on the 5th level. Make note -No elevators in parking deck!!!You enter the hotel from the first floor over the parking deck. You enter into an open-air area. To your left is check-in and lobby, directly in front is the pool, to the right is a lobby area and dining. We took our parking tkt to the front desk with us. We were given some kind of receipt so that we would have in-and-out access to the parking lot. Cost is $15 daily.We booked our room for one night via Expedia for $98 and used Starwood points for the other night. Check-in was quick. There were yellow plumeria leis and flowers for your hair on the counter. We were assigned room #1471 in the tower. It was at the end of the hallway facing Moana Surfrider. Based on past reviews, I was a littleconcerned. However, the hotel was great. It is not luxury, but it is nowhere near the worse I've stayed in. While it is not new, and neither are many of the hotels in Honolulu, it was clean and the staff was great. The room is avg size with a lanai. It was extremely clean (see pictures) with a Hawaiian theme. We are happy with our decision to stay here. Originally, we were going to splurge and stay somewhere else. We spent so little time in the room, staying here wasthe best decision that we could have possibly made.There is high-speed access, coffee maker, and a safe in the room. Not sure of the cost for high-speed, but there is a cost for the safe. The safe sits on the closet floor and takes up half the space. If you have more than one large suitcase, you will have to put it up against a wall or something. Our room had one King bed (looked like a queen). Double rooms maybe different.Now, about the location...it was absolutely FABULOUS! We parked the car early each evening and hit the sidewalk.

We where definitely happy about that. We where given a room on the 7th floor.The room was clean, and the furniture and the carpets didn't seem worn out. The bathroom was clean too, and not worn out. The air conditioning worked perfectly and was very quiet. The room had a nice partial view indeed and the noise from the street and the nightly show was not a factor at all. The only complaint I have was that the hall way smelled like smoke.Overall I have little to no complaints. We got fresh towels everyday from the cleaning lady. We borrowed hotel towels everyday for the beach (Don't know if that was allowed but we did return them). We enjoyed the free computer access in the lobby.Now the little complaint I have is the lack of recommendation by the concierge on a great place to eat. We asked them to recommend a great Japanese Restaurant, and they suggested the ones in the Hotel. Each time I asked for another suggestion they keep reminding us on how great the Hotels Japanese restaurant was. That was the disapointing part, but after a bit of searching on the internet we found a gem. If your ever in the mood of GREAT Japanese food head to Sushi Sasabune.My experience at this hotel was pretty good, and would definitely stay here again. Hopefully the next time we stay at this hotel it would have been renovated.Thank you for reading my review, and hopefully it helped you decide whether this is a good choice for you.","Los Angeles, California",68,4.0

Otherwise, do the right thing and choose another Starwood property. The only reason to stay here is because you can't afford the rates or the points for a better property (i.e. Royal Hawaiian, Moana, Sheraton Waikiki or W). My partner described the noise level of this hotel as 'metropolis.' I have stayed in much quieter hotels in downtown Manhattan. All night we heard trash trucks and sirens and traffic and harleys. I think the issue is that the hotel has no sound insulation at all. Many street performers gather in front of the hotel area at night, and they can bang on drums until late into the evening which will keep the entire hotel awake. The elevators are painfully slow and small. The rooms are old and tired. They don't have Sheraton sweet sleaper beds here, and they do very little in my opinion to cater to Starwood Platinum members here, including a marginal upgrade and not allowing a late checkout. Every other hotel we went to made this place seem like a Best Western. When you call to complain (i.e., the maid never brought more towels an hour after calling the service promise desk), they really don't seem to care much. The hotel lobby itself always seems to smell like raw fish and moldy carpet.

The cooking smells could be better, at least the evening I was there - but I cannot comment on the food as I ate on the plane. Being a big hotel, everything is fairly busy - but the crowd seemed well behaved.

I actually stayed there on Starwood Points and it was only 7,000 points per night - not bad since the other Sheratons nearby were 12,000 per night and up. The staff was friendly, the location was good (right next to a ABC store, a few restaurants, and the International Marketplace) and I rented a car so I could escape Waikiki when the tourists got overwhelming. There were a lot of tour groups and school trips there, which got a little tiresome (MUST you scream to your friends down the hallway at 3am??) but overall - good value for the price, and it doesn't promise a 5 star experience, so I knew what I was in for.","Albany, NY",3,3.0

The hot water and air conditioning did not seem to work that well either. The view was nice.

There are only four elevators for the tower wing. The day we were checking out we waited 25 minutes before we able to get onto an elevator with our luggage.

The location can't be beat. Waikiki is the best place within Oahu to stay in. Everything is so close and convenient. Buses run everywhere.First off the location of this hotel was great because: we were among the first people to get off the shuttle from the airport and last people to be picked up. Nothing worst than taking a shuttle and be last to be dropped off or first to be picked up. If you have a car rental or can take a taxi then great for you but I'm sure most people would like to save where they can. Bad thing about car rental is that you have to pay for parking which can be expensive!Check in and out was quick. Wasn't a long line at all. People weren't bubbly but friendly. They had free internet access downstairs and 3 different FREE newspapers! SWEET!!Our room was on the eighth floor. Room was fairly small, not that much longer than the bed but they did have a full size mirror which made it longer and a nice balcony. AC was a bit noisy, not horrible but definitely not one of your quiet newer models. We didn't lose any sleep due to that though.Room was clean and fairly well kept. Our tub's drainage was a bit slow though. I find that's an issue in quite a few hotels.The concierge were helpful. The buffet they offered was a bit expensive. I wouldn't recommend unless it's a Friday when they offer lobster and steak for $3 more than normal. That would be a great value but we didn't stay there long enough for that.Beach, shopping, food all nearby. Don't try the local food places. They are either small in size or lacking in quality. If you see a small price, know what you're getting. I would stay with the more established and well known. We love Denny's for breakfast.

Since it was just a one night stay before heading back home, we weren't looking for an expensive hotel. Most of the hotels in Honolulu seemed to be older so we weren't expecting too much.

But it does have a very nice swimming pool and is relatively less crowded than Wikiki beach on a nice day. From the airport, you can take a shuttle to the hotel for US$9 per person (contact the hotel to arrange a pick up time) or a taxi wlll cost about US$40 depending on traffic. There are lots of restauants and shops just along the strip so you won't have a problem finding places to go. The only negative about the hotel is that they have a live band who plays at night till about 9:30 or 10pm, which can be heard on the floors above (we were on the 22nd floor), but you can request a room on the other side of building if you wanted a quieter room.

Surprisingly the hotel is very nice, 3-star hotel. Obviously there were some room for improvements (the carpet was old, the hallways were old as well), but the room was manageable (it was a little small, but since we weren't there much except to sleep, it made no difference to us). The location is extremely convenient. It's across the street from the ABC store, as well as the King Street Shopping. There were plenty of things to keep you entertained at the hotel (live band nightly by the pool, and music going on 'til 11 pm most weekends). It's about a block and a half from Waikiki Beach, so the location is just top notch, without having to pay too much for it. We were located on the 4th floor, with views of the street (no pool view, no ocean view), and it was fine. I think there were other reviews complaining of the noise/music, but when you're in Hawaii, nothing less should be expected than some occasional street performers, and people walking late at night. Besides, the shops are open late (usually 11pm or later), so it's expected to hear the cabs, cars, and pedestrians mingling about.All in all, if on a budget (~$150 or less per night), this is the perfect choice.","San Francisco, California",7,3.0

We finally figured, for two nights we could handle anything.There was no need for hesitation or concern. From the moment our airport shuttle pulled up to the hotel we were embraced by what we considered to be the Aloha feeling of old Hawaii. The beautiful garden and tropical causal elegance of the lobby made it the ideal place to people watch. The room was a standard American style three star hotel room, clean, comfortable and practical. It was the ideal place to use as a base of operations for avid sightseers as we were who weren’t planning on spending a lot of time in the room.

We went to the cheese cake factory for dinner about 4 times ( go early as it gets very busy around 6.30 on 1/2 hour wait) as the meals were just wonderful if not a little big but they do doggie bags( dont be shy to ask as they are very happy to do) not cheep but you could get any of the meals and share if you wanted to as the meals are very big., went to Danny around the corner its good for hamburgers etcAs for tours we went through the tour desk , lovely lady helped us with all of the tours we did and she also foud out informatiom about Wheelchair access for us she was very helpful all in all we had a wonderful time. cant complain",sydney australia,16,4.0

Liked it enough to try it again. Had no reservation this time. My wife did the walk-in thing the day before check-in and was quoted a rate of $139 plus tax for each night of a three night stay beginning December 28, 2006. Orbitz was the only web travel site I found that could match that rate. Others, such as Travelocity and Expedia were higher or showed no availability.For that price, we couldn't ask for much consideration at this time of year, although I requested something high or away from street noise. No luck in that regard due to a very full house, I was told. And, as I feared, the third floor room (372) faced the street, so we did get some noise. A loud, heated verbal exchange among a small group of young men did awaken me the first night; it was short-lived, however. Foam earplugs served well. One of the aspects that brought us back to the Princess Kaiulani was the atmosphere and general lively ambiance of the open, spacious lobby area. Great for people watching. Several airline crews stay there. A number of tours leave from the Hyatt Regency, only a half block distant.Free copies of USA today and the local Honolulu newspaper were available. Three computers in lobby's soft-seating area are set up for free internet access. Signs indicate to limit your time to 15 minutes if others are waiting. Didn't experience any problems getting online; users were considerate.The pool area was roomy, clean and well maintained. Plenty of reclining lounge chairs were set up all around the pool. Nightly entertainment included local, professional-quality, small combos on the stage set to one side of the pool. The restaurant's Friday night seafood buffet had an ample variety; quality was just average in my view. Cost: around $80 (tax included) for two without alcohol.Less than a five minute walk to the active, crowded beach. Lots of shops -- low to medium end -- on the street adjacent. Burger King, Subway, KFC within one block. Cheesecake Factory a few short blocks away. Airport shuttle - $9.00 per person each way or $15 round trip. Friendly, helpful staff.We requested and were granted a two-hour late check-out for 1 p.m. at a cost of $20. The bell desk held our luggage until our 7 p.m. airport shuttle. We didn't make use of the hospitality room, but were told it could have been used for us to clean up if needed.Overall, a very pleasant experience.

Considering this was a business trip, I didn’t contribute to the price. So here are my thoughts on everything else. LOBBY: Beautiful, inviting, nice set-up. Pool area was right next door. You can sit in the lobby and enjoy the breeze from the outside pool area. You have to pay for internet access and it can only be accessed from the lobby. They do hourly rates and/or daily rates. I was there for ten days and paid around $68. ROOM: Well, the room looked petty dull with it’s green color. I was afraid to walk on the carpet barefoot, our toilet leaked and the air condition was broken the first two days. LOCATION: Great….right across from ABC store (there’s one on every corner) a Subway, Burger King and KFC. Waikiki Beach is also across the street.PARKING: Garage parking is $10 a day. So I paid $100.

That about sums up the true strong point of this hotel. Magnificently located just steps from the beach this hotel offers a ""center of everything"" location in Waikiki. Travelling with a friend, we were fortunate to get a room in the newer, tallest building in the 3 tower hotel complex. Our room, on the 29th floor, had a spectacular view of the ocean. The room itself was fair-sized and well kept with a terrific balcony overlooking the beach. The hotel itself looks a bit tired and we have since learned that the other 2 towers are scheduled to be torn down and replaced with condos, while the building we stayed in will be closed, renovated, and reopened as a more luxurious property.Even though this in not the Ritz, I heartily recommend staying here while you can, since at the rate we paid (less than 50% of the rate for a similar room at the nearby, bigger Sheraton hotel) is, all things considered, an absolute bargain.

We were in Oahu for my nephews wedding, our sister & brother-in-law (Nashville, TN.) & cousins(Paris, France) also stayed here. We were all pleased! The Lobby areas & Pool area were very nice, always a lounge chair at the pool. Pool bar frozen drinks were close to $8.00, but hey your on VACATION. We did not do the breakfast or evening buffets $20-$30 per person, though the presentations were very nice & food smelled delicious.

The drain plug for the tub was inoperative. The hotel caters mostly to Japanese tour groups. The pool closes at 6:30 PM.

The hotel is one of the older ones in Waikiki, which we didn't mind at all, BUT after we stepped out of the elevator on our floor (the 11th in the tower) we really were shocked at how old and worn everything was. Rugs, wall paper, signage...all really shabby. Our room was just as shabby, but even more unpleasant was the bathroom. Mildew was clearly evident on the ceiling above the tub (no fan in the bathroom!), the hand-held shower head was so grungy and probably 15 years old, the grout on the tile floor was really dingy, and the counter top looked slightly mildewed to where the top veneer seemed worn down. I really wished I had shower shoes to wear in there! and to make matters worse, our tub was clogged and didn't drain so the hotel plumber was sent up and spent an hour getting the clog half cleared for us! The rest of the room was okay, shabby like I said, but not as attrocious as the bathroom. the one grosser thing, however, about the bed was that our bed was short-sheeted! so there was 2 inches of exposed mattress and mattress pad (again, very old and gross looking). I slept with my feet on top of the top sheet! And of course removed the bed spread completely.At least we had a view, and it was only one night, but I would recommend you avoid this hotel unless you're a group of college kids looking for a lower priced room.

Do you think hotels act on these reviews? When I filled out a computer survey of my visit expressing disappointment, I never rec'd follow up. Does that reveal anything?Am platinum level Starwood member, and room was not available for check in until 3 pm. Then at 3 pm, the special line for Platinum and Gold Starwood members was closed and there was an 8 minute wait in line to check in - you'd think loyal clients would get rooms prepared first.So during the wait I paid for internet wi-fi access about $13 - then discovered it's only good (at best) in the busy, noisy lobby area - not in the room!! That's not clear when you sign up and pay the fee. There is no high speed internet access in the rooms.The management doesn't care about the guests very much - the clientele is largely Japanese groups. ""Turn em and burn em"" is a hospitality industry term. Room door had smudges, air conditioner didn't work properly and when reported someone came up, tried fixing it and nothing could be done until next day, so instead of sleeping with the patio door open to the noisy sounds of Waikiki, the sleep was in 74 degree heat. Room was changed next day. No accommodation for the discomfort - nor did I ask - if they don't have the courtesy to offer, am not going to request it. Yes, parking is inconvenient - I wondered what elderly banquet clients do - no valet parking and access to elevators and hotel takes more effort than many are capable of. This is not hospitable.The smell of the foods in the buffet get strong - and one has to cross this area to get to the tower rooms - it's not welcoming. The smell of fish on the seafood buffet is unpleasant.  The doormen and bellmen are helpful, seasoned, really nice. Some of the front desk staff are terrific and probably embarrassed by the level of service. Haircut at the hotel was pleasant experience. $3 for use of in room safe - ??? Come on.This is a huge hotel - no room service after 9 pm?Yes, breakfast across the street and at Cheeseburger in Paradise are also good and with ocean views, but the breakfast buffet is good quality here. Breakfast buffet is good - Patty was especially accommodating waitperson - many of the employees of the hotel have been there 20- 30 years. That made quite an impression - one employee had his last day after 40 years the day we were there.There must be better values close by - this is not a hospitable, accommodating place of Aloha - it's a discredit to Sheraton Hotels - you might feel 'taken' with the service and blah rooms.

The place is worn down and tired with it's carpet from the 80's and small rooms with paper-thin walls. We stayed in the main part of the hotel on the 8th floor ... I guess the 'towers' are newer and a little nicer (or so they claim) but they didn't look much nicer to me. Our travel agent told us that free parking was included, which is typical at the nicer hotels, but we got there to a snooty receptionist that informed us that they charge their guests $10 a day to park in their POS parking garage with no elevators and then they reserve half of the first floor for their employees so ALL guests are walking and most are trekking up and down stairs. The restaurants are nice and you can use any of the neighboring (MUCH nicer) Sheraton hotel restaurants and charge it directly to your room. Sadly enough, they consider this perk one of the great benefits of staying in their hotel. If you get a chance to stay at any of the other three Sheratons on the same block, I highly recommend it. We could hear everything from our neighbor's room ... we heard their afternoon chats, their party and every TV show that they watched. Luckily, we didn't stay in the room much but with 3 different groups in that room while we were there, and none of them overly loud, we heard each one of them so it wasn't just a case of one loud neighbor. The one group that threw the party even invited us over because they knew that the walls were thin and they planned on making some noise ... we declined but appreciated the offer and took a midnight stroll on the beach instead. The best thing you can say about the hotel is that it is centrally located on Waikiki beach. If you get bored, or can't sleep because of all the noise, just step out the front door of the hotel and you are on the main drag and a great touristy-type surfing area with rental boards and all is located right across the street. Some websites, and our travel agent (Our ex-travel agent) rated this as a 4-Star hotel ... that's not even close to the truth. It's a 3-star at best. They claim to be cheaper than the other hotels in that area but that's like comparing apples to oranges. They ARE cheaper than their neighboring competition but that's because they're not as good as the hotels that they're comparing themselves to ... they compare their prices to 5-star hotels across the street ON the beach. If you think you found an awesome hotspot at a great price then keep looking because you'll only be disaapointed. I also found it interesting that the hotel's comment service on their TV didn't work and when I asked for a comment card at the front desk they couldn't seem to find one ... so I wrote my comments on a post-it note and gave it to them. Speaking of which, we voiced our concerns only about items that we felt management would be able to correct, in order to avoid sounding like a whining guest and in return we were treated like a whining guest complete with rolling eyes and deep sighs. Nothing was done ... not a shocker at all. Overall, we had one of the best vacations of our lives but that was no thanks to anything the folks at this hotel provided. We spent very little time in our room, which is a good thing while you're in Hawaii, and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. Go to Hawaii and have a good time, but if you're looking at the Sheraton Princess Kiaulani for a room you might as well save some money by booking a complete dive and avoid the let-down. This place was not very Sheraton-like at all.","San DIego, California",19,2.0

Normally we stay at the Outrigger on the beach (right accross the street from the Princeess Kaiulani) and have had absolutely great service.We booked a last minute trip for June 2006 at the Princess Kaiulani and found the experience dissappointing.The main problems:1. Parking has no valet, and the first side of the paring structure has no elevators, so you could end up climbing 5 flights of stairs to get to your car. It wasn't until our second day there that another guest told us to drive to the top of this parking structure and then drive to an adjacent lot that provided access to elevators. It would have been nice if the hotel could have communicated this in the beginning.2. Any item billed to your room is sent for a credit authorization of the original dollar amount times the amount of days you are staying. For example, our parking was $70 so the cc authorization was $70 x 7 days or $490. We had room service the first night for $108, so that authorized $108 x 7 or $ 756. They had tied up over $1200 of our money in two transactions. This is obviously not something they tell you at check-in so be aware.3. The pool was shut down two days due to contamination.4. Small room, small tv, small fridge.5. They charge extra for items we received free at the Outrigger on the Beach i.e. $3 for the safe, bottled water (complamentary at the Outrigger).On the plus side:1. The hotel did make an effort to resolve the credit authorization problem.2. The staff was polite.3. This hotel is centrally located4.

We where asked to come back at 3pm which we did and they still were not ready. We where given a drinks voucher to thank us for being patient. That was a nice touch. We where given our room keys about 30 minutes later and made our way to the elevator. As soon as I stepped into the elevator I knew that this was not going to be good. There was a musty smell about it. We got onto our floor (9th) and it was apparent that this was the original part of the hotel. The carpets where old and worn, the walls where much the same and there was that musty smell. We gingerly opened the door to our room and it was just as I expected. It had a musty smell for starters, the room was tiny, it had 2 double beds and very little else. There was not enough room to store our suitcases on the floor, we had to double up so we could walk through the room without banging our shins on the furniture. Our view was overlooking part of the city. The bathroom was small and poorly decorated, there where cracks in the walls and the wallpaper was peeling off. The sliding door to the balcony kept coming off the runner and I could not open it or shut it without my husbands help. I was terribly disappointed and decided to let them know. The sheraton have a policy that states "" if you are not happy, then just say so"". I called the customer relations number and told the lady of my concerns. She asked if I wanted to put my complaint in writing. I said I would like something done about our room. She replied that I needed to speak to the room manager, so I was put on hold for about ten minutes and then was told that he was busy and he would call me back. I waited for half an hour and the call came. I explained how disappointed I was and with 3 people in the room it was very uncomfortable. He offered to send a maintenance person up to address my concerns but also said he could upgrade us to a pool view room that was a tiny bit bigger at a cost. This was not what I expected and we refused the costly upgrade. My son was also disappointed with his room. He found pubic hair in the bath. They sent someone to fix his problem.

The hotel is very centrally located to Waikiki Beach. The area where Waikiki beach is unobstructed by all the oceanfront hotels is less than half a block away. Trust me, if you want to get to the beach and you aren't staying in one of the oceanfront hotels it can be a real chore. It's also centrally located to all kinds of shopping, Coach, Chanel, Dior, and other high end shops are right down the street. The hotel is also right next door to the International Marketplace. This was not so good. Don't be fooled by the name, it is a total tourist trap. It also happens to be the gathering place for a number of street performers, a couple of whom bang on drums until 12-1am in the morning every night. Even on the 16th floor the drums were rather loud and sometimes made it hard to get to sleep. The lobby area was open air and looked out over the pool which was very nice. There were plenty of chairs around the pool and there was also a nice lounge/restaurant area around the pool. The lounge served a $20 breakfast buffet every morning, overpriced for breakfast if you ask me. We went across the street to the Hula Grill for breakfast, it was less expensive, had great food, and a fantastic view of the ocean. They also served dinner buffet style or a la carte. Either way, at $33-35 for the buffet and $17+ for entrees it was also overpriced. If you intend on staying near the hotel for lunch/dinner, I suggest Duke's which is across the street a level below the Hula Grill. Now to the room, for $200/night I expected a little more, but based in comparison pricing for hotel rooms, $200/night doesn't get you much in Hawaii. At $200/night we've stayed in much, much nicer rooms/hotels than this. The room was a little small and the decorating was dated, but all in all it was acceptable. We had a partial ocean view room and the view was spectacular. We got lucky and had a room right on the corner of the hotel closest to the water so I can't guarantee all partial ocean vews are this good, but ours could just as well have been a full ocean view. The maid service wasn't great, they forgot to refill our coffee, replace towels, vaccuum, or take used dishes on different occasions. Other than that the staff was courteous and very helpful with directions, etc. Overall, the hotel was adequate. We got about what we expected and I would say at this price range it's a fairly safe choice.","Minneapolis, MN",7,3.0

In addition, they only have dial up and if you need high speed; you'll need to truck it to the main lobby. Do not eat at this hotel - the food is not very good and is overpriced. Duke's across the street is great and they have a bar right on the beach. If you want breakfast (at breakfast prices) walk towards the back of the hotel from the main entrance and there is an Outrigger on the corner with a restaurant on the corner that has a nice Island breakfast for around $7.00 a far cry from the crummy buffet at the Kaiulani which is offered at $20.

Then we heard a baby cry for an extended amount of time too. They sounds were very clear. And the street noise is very loud. I agree with the other poster. There was a drummer outside that banged those $%$% drums every time somebody put money in his hat!! We were tempted to pay him $50 to move to another block!!! Like I said the staff are exceptional, but the noise was a little too much, and the beds too hard. I would probably not stay here again, unless of course, they replaced the mattresses, and worked on some sound proofing.","Victoria, Canada",14,3.0

It had been over 30 years since my wife and I had been there so we decided to go to Waikiki. We chose the PK because of it's location - right across the road from the beach and in the centre of Waikiki.We can't blame the hotel for the weather (it rained every day). Our room was classified as a ""high ocean view"" room"". When we first checked in our room was on the 23rd floor facing downtown with a view of the International Marketplace. I checked to see if we could see a couple of other rooms and the desk staff were only too helpful. We decided on a room on the 15th floor facing Diamond Head. It was right on the corner of the building overlooking Kalakaua Avenue. Please note if you have a room overlooking a main street there is noise 24 hours a day. Again this is no reflection on the hotel itself but just an observation. Garbage and delivery trucks operate all night on the strip and the buskers are out until at least 11pm. (a particularly annoying drummer took up residence right outside our window)We were disappointed in the restaurant and bar facilities at the hotel. The hotel only offered a buffet for both breakfast and dinner with table service for lunch. Neither my wife and I are fans of buffets so we found a great restaurant up the street that served a great breakfast at a reasonable price. For dinner we tried all sorts of different restaurants. The bar did not have the ambiance that I would expect from a hotel in Waikiki. Again we went to different restaurants on the strip for afternoon drinks and pupus.The hotel staff were great and the lady that cleaned our room every morning was fantastic. If she saw us going out for our walk in the morning she made sure the room was cleaned up before we got back. If we had any special requests she made sure we were looked after.The room itself was fine. We could hear a bit of noise from our next door neighbours but nothing outrageous.We had a great view in a fantastic location. Our next trip will probably take us to somewhere quieter but I think we got what we paid for on this trip.",,32,2.0

Room decor was not my taste, but most of the hotels in Waikiki are somewhat dated unless you're going for a luxury hotel. Room service was available only certain times of the day, but we prefer to go out most of the time. There was a slight musty smell in the hallways, but I wrote that off to the humidity.

The Princess Food Court is a fairly inexpensive place to eat and a great place to people watch sitting on the corner of the street.Other reviews mention concerns about prostitutes in front of the hotel.

This hotel was the first one I missed the mark on. Based on location, cost, photographs, and previous reviews I was certain that this hotel would be a good one, but I wasn't that impressed.The staff is very friendly and courteous, which was a plus, but friendly staff doesn't make up for the rock hard mattresses and moldy washrooms. My room was on the 14th floor (Starwood Preferred Guest floor) but was noisy at all hours of the day and night. They have some kind of music playing from about 9:00 pm until some hour of the night (I always was able to somehow fall asleep while it was still blasting) and the sounds of traffic and people are very irritating.I never utilized the pool since it was always packed full of people, so instead of swimming shoulder to shoulder with all the other SPK guests, I opted to spend time elsewhere.The one good thing about this place is the access to all of Waikiki, which is very convienient. It is within walking distance to so many things (Zoo, Kapiolani park, aquarium, Waikiki beaches, restaurants, shops, Internation marketplace, etc.) which really cut back on the taxi fares that I broke my bank on when I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which for $40/night more is far superior and recommended by me.I wouldn't return to the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani again if I were to go back to Waikiki, I would rather re-do my research and find another place to stay since I wouldn't think it would be that difficult to find something more satisfactory.","Los Angeles, California",25,3.0

The price difference was only about $35 a night but it felt like you dropped 3 stars in hotel class.Where to begin.. the hotel seems pretty old and not maintained well. After check in, the elevators are tiny and there's only a few, so the wait is long. My room had a standard foam mattress with the thin mattress cover/blankets you find at cheap motels. The bathroom was extremely tiny with a sliding door and the showerhead and tiles looked incredibly dirty. I really felt grossed out by them. The worst part is, there was a mosquito in my room and after spending 40 minutes (unsuccessfully) swatting at it, I gave up and had to endure this unwelcomed guest. After talking to some other friends that ended up there, I found out that I was actually ""upgraded"" due to my starwood status as my room had a small couch and a balcony overlooking the pool. I checked out the ""standard"" room and it's even worse. Never again... for the type of money you'll spend going to Hawaii, you want to feel relaxed and comfortable at the hotel.

In hindsight, that was the second best decision we made right after our first decision to get married in Oahu. We totally loved our time at PK. We really, really loved the band that played at night. We would sit on our lanai and just listen to the great music the band played which ranged from Hawaiian to contemporary songs. We so enjoyed the music that we spent out last night at the hotel downstairs by the bar to actually see the band play (we would have sat in the lounge chairs by the pool like we did the night before, but it sprinkled that night). Along with the music, we had a great view from our room of the pool and the street.

I noticed a chambermaid spraying disinfectant on the telephone and cleaning it with a small brush -- I was impressed and I wonder how many hotels do that as part of their regular routine. The decor was fine, and the view was unbelievable, of both the ocean and the rest of Waikiki. If you stay here, it might be worth paying more for a room with a great view.

Some cheaper rooms look onto a parking garage and nothing else, although those rooms probably get less exterior noise than mine.I thought the staff had a great attitude. I wish I could remember the guy who checked me in and checked me out, beause he seemed to genuinely enjoy interacting with customers. I wonder if some of the negative reviews here are because customers are reacting to the fact that the overwhelming majority of tourists are visitors from Japan and the people who live in Hawaii are overwhelmingly Asian-American. Deal with it or stay home.The location is very urban, which is what I wanted, with buildings packed together closely and the sidewalk at the front entrance. You cross the street to go to the beach. If you want a self-contained beachfront resort with more green space, try a place in western Waikiki such as the Sheraton Waikiki or the Hilton Village.Negatives: Some people might enjoy the free nightly show by the pool by a lounge singer, but it drove me up the wall! I hated the music. Even with my balcony door closed, the overamplified music reverberated through the room making it impossible to do things like watch TV, and this went on until 10 or 11. Noise from the adjoining room, filtering through a connecting door, was also a big headache even though my neighbor wasn't doing anything out of line. For some reason this particular block attracts prostitutes who are very aggressive toward solo male pedestrians after 10pm, even when in sight of police officers!

The hotel provided us with a coffee maker and a refrigerator. We had a walk out balcony where we spent several evenings listening to the music coming from the lounge (they stop the music by 10PM). The A/C is efficient, but we found we were able to shut it off at night and leave the sliding door open to let the trade winds blow through and cool the room.On June 11, 1955, the hotel opened it's doors.

Kaiulani was Hawaii's last and most loved princess, who died at an early age of 23.It is apparent that the spirit of Kaiulani still exists throughut the hotel. The lobby of the hotel was beautiful. Many artifacts from the Princess Victoria Kaiulani's life were all about the hotel. Many photographs and oil paintings deicting the Princess and her life.Every morning in the lobby, local artisans will come and display their wares: Local flowers woven into leis, a ukelele maker, and other various sorts of arts and crafts.The hotel is centrally located to many areas of interest and the neighborhood in which it sits is quite safe for those who may be traveling alone.The hotel also offers a ""hospitality suite"" for those who check out early but have a late departure time the Kaiulani provides a room for travelers to take a shower or just kick back unil your departure time.

Loved it as much as last year. This hotel has a beautiful lobby, nice pool area, rooms that go from small to large (some with a crappy view of the parking structure, some with a great view of Waikiki), and LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION at a GREAT price. If you're on a budget that allows for a mid-priced Waikiki hotel, choose the PK. If you want luxury, try one of the other Sheartons, the Halekalani or the Hyatt. Since you probably won't spend a lot of time in your room (which may be small but will be clean and have a parking structure that's close by and only 10 bucks a day for hotel guests), I'd recommend the PK! You can be on the sands of Waikiki beach in about 53 seconds after walking out the door of the PK, it's close to great shopping, an inexpensive food court is 50 feet from the pool, and, compared to other similar priced hotels in Waikiki, the Princess Kaiulani doesn't have that musty, old hotel smell.

This was our trip of a lifetime and needless to say that the hotel and location was a HUGE disappointment to us. Since the day we were married we often thought of this being our ideal anniversary vacation. WRONG. I have to agree with some of the other reviews, saying that the hotel staff catered to the needs of Japanese clients and made any American feel as if we were unwelcomed in their hotel. I would definitely say that I felt like a minority just walking around the lobby. Rarely would you see a smiling face, helpful person, or anyone speaking english without a HEAVY accent. I have no problem with other cultures or Japanese people but I do have a problem with how unwelcomed I felt.  The worst thing about this hotel is the location. I guess it's true that location means everything and this hotel really proved it to me. We had paid for an ""oceanview"" room and all we saw was one high rise building after the other. If you looked really hard, you may see the ocean between two other high rise hotels that were ON the beach. This is the LOUDEST place that I have ever stayed at and I felt very unsafe at night. We stayed in a higher room, second floor from top, and I could still hear music and noise booming until 1:00 a.m. I was looking forward to a relaxing, romantic trip and my nerves were on edge from no sleep whatsoever.  Oahu is a beautiful island, but I was certainly dissappointed in Waikiki. I will never stay in Waikiki again. Some people may love it, but I tend to hate commercial areas, and it has taken over. If you do go to the island of Oahu, spend most of your time on the NORTH shore of the island. This part of the island is gorgeous. Waikiki is too commercial and not the Hawaiin paradise I hoped for. One thing that I do recommend is the picnic basket that you can order from room service the night before. My husband and I took a picnic basket (which was absolutely wonderful and fresh) to the North shore for some privacy and relaxation, and it was the best day we had. We also had room service the night we arrived, and it was one of the best meals we had the entire trip. Another recommendation would be to go to Germaine's Luau. The staff was so friendly and it was an absolute blast. This is a great Luau and you can't leave Hawaii without going to one.  The Sheraton P.K. is a loud, unfriendly hotel with very limited accommodations. Don't expect much with your room. But I will have to say that my room was clean and consistently so during my trip. Dresser space was almost nil. My clothes were either hung(limited-no hangers/room) or in my suitcase. Positives- Room service, cleanliness and staff was friendly as you arrive in front of hotel. Unfortunately, that is where the friendliness ends as well. I hope if you are going to Waikiki that you will have your Hawaiin paradise. I was certainly dissappointed in mine.","knoxville, tennessee",13,2.0

From the moment we pulled up to the front entrance to the minute we left, they were courteuos and friendly. The bell man helped with our luggage and since we were early, tagged it and stored it for us. After grabbing a bite to eat, we checked in around 3 pm. First off, being a Sheraton Starwood Preferred member, our room was upgraded from an ""Ocean View"" to a ""Deluxe Ocean View"". We stepped off one of the four quick elevators and walked straight ahead to room 918. The room was beautiful and clean and had an AWESOME VIEW. We booked a hotel ""across from Waikiki"" to save on cost but also because we didn't plan on spending a lot of time in the room. But this was soooo great for the money. Our lanai was directly above the pool and had a perfect shot of Waikiki ocean and the stage downstairs where the bands perform. Instead of going out, we ended up spending most nites by making some cocktails, getting our deck of cards and playing rummy 500 in the warm hawaiian air, listening to the bands on our lanai. I couldn't have asked for anything better...I think we spent every nite we stayed there on that lanai.Other good stuff was great cleaning service, nice pool and friendly staff. Down at the pool they give you nice big towels to use, in the afternoons they have fresh pineapple (and it is sooo yummi!) and also later in the afternoon, ice cold hand clothes they pass out to each of you. Even the food was good at the Moyohama Sushi restaurant. We had a 15% off coupon from the menu, which made the already average pricing for sushi even better. I really would love to stay at this hotel again...and get this exact same room.Pricing was roughly $150 plus tax a nite and we stayed from Monday the 27th until July 1st.","Cape Cod, MA",33,5.0

Being a Travel Agent I received an amazing rate that I certainly couldn't pass up. I mainly chose this hotel due to the location and star rating (compared to other places in the area and prices available for travel agents during that time of the year I planned on going). We were upgraded immediately to a partial ocean view room upon checking in, which was a nice surprise during all of the excitement of finally going to Hawaii! The area around PK is awesome if you're looking for a tourist hub -- relaxing when you want it to be and hustle-bustle if you want it to be. Hawaii is not only beautiful but everyone in Oahu was SO NICE to us. We felt completely pampered! Those working at the PK were accomodating, relaxed, and enjoyable. Japanese tourists definitely seem to rule the roost in Oahu - but we had no problems at all.. things weren't too busy tourist-wise. The AWESOME thing was, that this hotel offers a Hospitality Room/Suite for use by guests that have flights that depart late in the day. The room features a HUGE bathroom w/shower, sink, toilet etc, the sitting area has comfortable couches and lounge chairs and a coffee table, etc. You have the room for a full hour, which gives you time to shower and relax a bit before heading back out to catch a taxi to the airport. I would definitely stay at the PK again. I give it 4 stars out of 5 due to the excellent service and surprisingly easy trip.. everything went without a hitch and it made the trip well worth it --- This truly was a VACATION.$ Tip: Food in Hawaii is up there price-wise... depending on where you go, you can get some wonderful deals on Seafood.. so keep an eye out! Food cost wasn't too big of a deal for us since we'd saved so much money for the trip ahead of time, and we'd gotten such a great deal on the room.Tourist Tip: Go snorkeling in Hanauma Bay! Many tours are available for purchase at the Concierge desk... the agent working is more than happy to assist and answer questions. For less than $20 per person we received a bus transfer round-trip to and from the Bay, snorkeling equipment, etc. The only thing not included is your food -- you can bring your own food or purchase from their snack bar (pricey but ok when you're starving!). Keep in mind that there is a small additional fee per person to get into Hanauma Bay (as it is a state park and wildlife preserve).","Las Vegas, NV",45,4.0

One thing you can come not to expect very much of in Hawaii is service so make sure you at least enjoy your hotel. The Sheraton Princess is one of the very few Sheraton's that doesnt utilize the Service Promise philosophy. The rooms were very basic, the walls were paper thin and the staff were very difficult to deal with.

Overall: Average. Ambience was pretty good, sometimes live night entertainment for their almost daily pool-side buffet (plenty of food and variety was great -- must have the SWEET pineapples!). Small-Med Pool is closed at night and early morning during breakfast time. Staff was nice and helpful. When we arrived, they had to fix double booking error (no problem). Our room was disappointing, old decor, and beds were too soft, and sagged in the middle. Clean enough, but not spectacular bath. 2 or 3 of our 4 lamps didn't work so we called down to fix, which they did while we were gone and surprised us with a nice complimentary basket of snacks. Balcony view wasn't great - got the side of a building. Lobby sells fresh leis for 5 dollars, which we took back on our 5 hr flight for family members. Location was pretty convenient: easy walk to the beach, and walked several blocks for shopping and other eateries. We went on one of those Bus Day Tours, and one shuttle tour. Our tour guides were great, but the tours were not...most of the time is spent on the road, looking out the window and about 5, 10 or 15 minutes at stops. Luau was fun (sorry don't remember the name), but we paid $100 ea. and it was about an hour drive to another beach on a bus (FUN RIDE, great people). Be prepared to tip every driver and tour guide you use (they expect it). TIPS: Recommend exploring sites on bus or trolleys and enjoy at your leisure. P.S.

The hotel is in a great location in terms of access to the beach and shopping. If you are expecting a typical Sheraton, you will be extremely disappointed. The outside of the hotel, lobby, bar, and restaurants all looked fabulous and the staff was very warm and welcoming. Shock was the room. VERY poorly maintained. Bedspreads are thin, decor is horrible, refrigerator barely worked, and the room was quite small. If the winds are blowing you will be up all night as the wind shook our balcony door so hard that it just continually rattled.Didn't feel as cheated the first 7 nights of the stay because I had a conference rate of $105/night, but it really hurt to pay $150 for the next two nights in the same room...I had no problems with parking and I thought that $10/day was reasonable. However, traffic in Waikiki is horrible so think twice about renting a car if you plan to just hang around downtown.Food was o.k., but VERY pricey. Dinner buffet at the hotel was 32.50/person and the breakfast buffet was 16.50/person. Both were good, but not worth the price.According to one of the Assistant Managers, the hotel is scheduled for an upgrade this summer, so if I ever go back, I might stay just to check out the difference. Your best bet is the Hilton Hawaiian Village (little further uptown) or the Sheraton Moana Surfrider which is right across the street.Also, be prepared for the Japanese invasion. I found that the staff seem to cater to them more than Americans. Most of the Japanese folks that I encountered were friendly, but a lot were obnoxious about cutting in front of you when standing in line and they seemed to have a real sense of entitlement--that did not apply to anyone else...","Elmira, New York",62,3.0

The hotel even has a complimentary room for you to use if you have to check out and your flight doesn't leave until late. So- we freshened up prior to leaving for the airport.

If you are looking for a romantic get-away, this is NOT the place to stay. Go for Halekulani. But if you are looking for a comfortable accomodation at a great price, this is the hotel for you. About around $120-$150/night, there's not a lot of service to speak of, but it's a clean room and a clean bathroom - which is a lot more than I can say about some of the other hotels around the area (i.e. the various Ohanas). But if you want a nice swimming pool, this is not the place for you. Then again, the ocean is 30 seconds away. Why would you want to be sitting by the pool?

I heard bad reviews about the Kaiulani Tower and I knew I didn't want to stay in that tower. But I read great reviews re: the Princess Tower, so I knew that I wanted to get a room in that particular tower. Well, the first day we got there and the clerk booked us in the Kaiulani Tower which I refused to go to, but the clerk was really nice and managed to find a room available in the princess tower the next day. So we were to spend 1 night in the Kaiulani tower and then the following day they would move our suitcases to the princess tower which we wanted. Well.....the reviews for the kaiulani tower were right, the room was awful. We were on the 5th floor, balcony facing a dark parking lot, the room was dark, the room was so small, the bathroom was old and the beds looked really small and we were 4 people. The air condition was so noisey throughout the night, that we didn't sleep well at all. The next day, they moved us in later on in the day a the princess tower, wow.......what a transition......the room was bigger, we were on the 5th floor, facing the poolside and the street, the room also had a small couch and it was much more spacious and brighter with sunshine coming through our window. The air conditioner was newer and quieter, we didn't think it was on, thats how quiet it was. We stayed in this room for 2 wonderful weeks.

The room I had was extremely small and the bathroom appeared as it did in the 1940's (i.e. pale yellow floor tiles, a public restroom type toilet, old sink that hasn't seen a can of Ajax cleanser in decades). What really threw me were the millions of TERMITES found crawling along the baseboards, in the light fixtures AND a few on the bed! This room is not fit for anyone to stay in!!! I immediately called the front desk and was moved to the newer wing on the second floor. It was somewhat of an improvement. The carpet and bathroom were clean. No termites, however there were these tiny black bugs that seemed to appear out of nowhere and then disappear just as fast. Gross!! The guest services manager sent up a food basket, but not for the bugs...he sent a basket for an AC problem that we called about...hmmm, we hadn't even complained about the A/C!

That way, you don't have to lug them down from the ramp. The bell hop/porter person was very good with service and friendly. Also, I learned that getting a Starwood card before leaving on my trip helped at check-in. The young woman was very courteous at the front desk. We were late checking in because of a HORRENDOUS car rental experience with Alamo (also set up by the Travel agent). I was dreading seeing the room and as we went down the hallway, I realized we were not in the newer tower part! But as we entered the room I was pleasantly surprised to find we were in a corner room and up high enough to watch surfers on Waikiki from our balcony! I nervously peeked into the bathroom and...glory be! No bugs! No mold or mildew! Everything looked like it had been scrubbed and was quite clean, freshly painted, wallpapered and the carpet looked shampooed! The beds were 2 doubles put together, but since my husband snores, I didn't mind- they were comfortable enough. My only complaint was the stupid street performers below and the terrible noise one of them made with his boom box playing such stupid lame-o music! His act was uncreative, untalented and dumb, yet he attracted lots of Japanese tourists for some reason. Even with the doors and windows shut and the heavy drapes pulled that awful music was blaring and finally stopped at 11:00 pm! With the Waikiki police station practically across the street one would think these pests could be controlled! Other than that, we enjoyed our time in Honolulu. The breakfast buffet was fine - our waitress was so nice and suggested fresh papaya for my tummy. It works! We ate in the hotel restaurant for dinner and the food was so-so. Someone earlier mentioned that they cater to Japanese tourists and I think I agree, but that is the case ALL over Honolulu!","Saint Paul, Minnesota",49,3.0

First of all, the ""Oceanview"" room that we paid a premium for $325/night looked directly into another hotel, if you strained your neck from the lanai you could catch a glimpse of the ocean. The agent downstairs would only respond by saying ""well those are the ocean view rooms"" This was room 2467, ask them to see it if you don't believe me. It probably was ""oceanview"" when it was built, but since then many many many more developments have gone up around this place, and your views are of urban sprawl. Do not let them con you into one of these rooms.Secondly, their policy of ""pay at one, play at all three"" is a flat out LIE. My wife and I went across the street to the Sheraton Moana Surf-Rider, which was on the beach.....we told the attendant that we were from their sister property and their response was ""okay, you can swim in our pool, and use our beach BUT, DO NOT use our towels, DO NOT sit on our chairs or pool furniture, and DO NOT lay on our beach....if you would like to sit, there is a patch of grass in the corner"" I had to say I have never felt like a 2nd class citizen until this point.Never EVER will I stay at a Sheraton again. The only people who were cordial were the waitstaff/bartenders in the Pikake lounge, and that is probably because we were paying $2-3 more for drinks than we could get a few storefronts down the road.So not worth it. Trust me, don't stay here.The rooms themselves were miserable, and don't even get me started on the nasty bathrooms.Please, don't end up having to apologize to your new wife all week long like I did.......when all I was trying to do was give her a nice week somewhere.......","San Francisco, CA",8,1.0

The rooms were small and a bit musty smelling but we were upgraded to an Ocean View for some reason (Maybe because I am a Starwood Preferred Guest). This gave us a balcony overlooking the pool and the ocean could be seen over the other hotels. One of the best perks we were provided and I have never been offered anywhere else was the availability of a hospitality room. Checkout was at 11:00 and they could not extend it because they were in a sold out state, however, they offered us a room that we could check out and use for 1 hour to shower and clean up before we had to leave for the airport.

Basically, there are two main ""areas"" of the hotel building -- the low rise wing buildings, and the high rise single building. The lobby area is very luxuriously appointed and certainly holds true to its 3 star rating. This hotel caters largely to the Japanese tourist package market, and as such, the hotel really only cares about them. The best rooms are therefore located in the high rise tower, with the rooms being larger and more recently renovated. The old low rise buildings are for the most part, very old and in dismal condition. I got a chance to stay in the low rise section and was shocked throughout my one night stay. Just stepping into the room will reveal the old, dirty, carpeting. The air conditioning unit looked like it came out from the WWII era, all dusty, rusted, and just hideous for being in a hotel room. The bathroom screamed Welcome to 1965, being disgustingly dirty with old water stains everywhere. On the positive side, there is a true balcony for all the rooms on the low rise side, albeit there is not much to see as the ""views"" look towards the city streets and adjacent buldings. Because this building is so low, street noise is an incredible issue if you want to turn in early. All I heard until midnight was booming stereos from nearby clubs, cars burning rubber, sirens, and the occasional drunken pedestrian shouting. Oh well, at least you'll get some fresh air. The staff works hard to make the experience even less appealing for you. Not once did any staff member smile at me, or make me feel welcomed in any way. Upon check in, I was treated like an annoyance to the desk clerk. And even when I left the parking structure (adjacent to the hotel), the attendant was extremely rude when I passed him the parking voucher indicating I already paid for the room through the hotel directly. All in all, I will not stay here ever again. The low rise buildings are representative of a 1 star establishment. However, I did visit a relative on a later date in the high rise tower and their room was a lot cleaner and larger, but like I said, this hotel caters to the tourist package market so good luck trying to get a hotel in the tower at a decent rate.",,366,1.0
