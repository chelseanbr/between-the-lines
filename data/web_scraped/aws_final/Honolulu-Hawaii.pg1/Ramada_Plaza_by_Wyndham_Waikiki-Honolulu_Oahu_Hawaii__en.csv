We chose it due to location (great), decent price, no resort fee, and that it had a microwave and mini fridge in the room and washer/dryer on the premises. All these things were great, but-This place needs a major cleaning/overhaul. Our window was basically ""open"" due to age/decay. Since we faced the street,our sleep was disrupted every night. Also, while noticing an odd look to the wallpaper, I investigated. Much to my dismay, I discovered a thick layer of dust all over the walls and the drapes. I wonder how many years since these rooms have been cleaned thoroughly? I don't blame the housekeeping staff for the immense amount of dust, but they also did only a cursory job of cleaning our room ( hair in the tub, and no toiletry refills for 2 days).There are also only a few balcony rooms, which we didn't have, and a week in the room at night became claustrophobic.When we return, I'll be looking for a new place.

The night we arrived, we wanted to walk out. I have an 18 year old and 16 year old, the family rooms are nowhere close to big enough. The photo’s make the beds in the family room look queen size - they are NOT, only double. When we checked in, surely the staff could have questioned whether a double sized bed would be big enough for two 6 foot brothers to share?... We went and bought a blow up mattress.It is certainly one of the cheaper options in Waikiki, but as always, you get what you pay for but even at this price, you are not getting enough. Air conditioners are useless; the wardrobe also contains the fridge and microwave so no space to hang clothes and store luggage for four people. Maybe put in beds that you can store luggage under. Cruise ships utilise space well, maybe your room designers could look at maximising the small space you call a family room. We were tripping over luggage, shoes, clothes for 5 days. If you are two couples, think about staying somewhere else, if you are a family with two young children, the family room option MIGHT be ok.The lift - many have mentioned it, nothing you can do about it and I get that. But.... the worst morning was the one where I was waiting on level 17 for 30 minutes to get onto a lift. The problem is that people are so desperate to get a lift that they will press up and down buttons, then get in regardless of the direction they want to actually go. It came to level 17 three times with so many people, it was full. I gave up and stayed in my room. You can respond that I could walk down the 17 floors by the fire escape, not everyone can do 17 flights though. The absolute worst though, was the day we attempted to get into our room to get things needed for a day out driving around the island. The door key entry unit’s battery was flat, our key wouldn’t work, and absolutely nothing was done to get us in. Reception staff told us if we needed to get in ‘right now’, we would have to go and find maintenance ourselves. We had a day planned and didn’t have time to run around looking for people, your staff, who could have helped us, especially given the state of the lift. We had no idea when we came back if we could even get inside our room. Then when we returned at around 7.30 pm or so, we parked our rental in a space while trying to get into the room, needed to leave it for about an hour before returning it to the rental office and despite the fact it was YOUR fault we were in this position, we were denied a car space for one lousy hour even though the car park was only half full - if we stayed more than 15 minutes then we would be charged ONE FULL NIGHT. If you want good service, a good nights sleep, confidence you can get into your room at any time, remotely interested staff, any kind of empathy, and even the slightest bit of flexibility, then I suggest you stay anywhere else but here. Honestly, it may be cheap but for what you get, it is too expensive. Actually, the ONLY good thing I can say is the housekeeping staff are polite, and friendly. And they have my sympathy, working with one lift and under these conditions is tough.","Woy Woy, Australia",2,1.0

Breakfast is my only complaint.The hotel claims a buffet breakfast is offered at $13.95 but restaurant is not part of the hotel - it is a small Chinese restaurant just outside the hotel. We went once and that was it. You are greeted by a sign that says breakfast special $8.95 - we assumed that was the buffet. The buffet is simply awful!!! the eggs were like rubber, shrivelled up sausages that have been cooked hours ago - everything lukewarm at best - most cold. coffee overbrewed luke warm - no bread for toast - corn flakes or cherrios for cereal - we were there one hour before breakfast was closed so there is no excuse for this condition. Got to the cash to pay the $18 (2x8.95) and was presented with a bill of $33. Deceiving advertising at best no mention anywhere that the buffet is more than the only signs in the restaurant showing $8.95. IT was awful - there is an ihop two doors down $10 for senior breakfast. I note that the Chinese restaurant is open for lunch and suppers and every time we passed it nobody in it.

You are right in the middle of Ala Moana Shopping Centre and Waikiki with a 15 min walk in each direction. The hotel offers free coffee in the lobby every morning (which is a blessing) and a fridge and microwave in each room. The real prize of this hotel is the staff, we had requested an early check in as we arrived in Honolulu at 6am after a full day of travel. I was aware that early check in was not guaranteed but on arrival the staff went out of their way to get us into a room as soon as possible. They were upfront with extra costs of early check in and did offer to hold bags at no cost with concierge if we preferred to wait. I had a parcel sent to the hotel with no problems and they were strict with ID and Hotel key for parcel collection which was amazing. If you can book a tour with Yogi (or even just have a chat) do so, he booked us with a couple of tours that were affordable and amazing, he also didn't try and sell us tours he knew we wouldn't be interested in. Another HUGE plus Is this hotel has NO resort fees! Trust me, for Hawaii this is amazing! he rooms are very dated and AC/Bathrooms are in need of an upgrade but honestly it's what you need and another big plus - They have a laundry mat on premises that we had no problem with!

The staff was very efficient and friendly, which was a great welcome for us to Hawaii for the first time. We had two nights booked in a King Room after our cruise ended (Dec. 14 and 15, 2019), and because we disembarked at 8:30am, we arrived at our hotel by 9am. Because we were early, our room was not available yet (which was understandable). The hotel desk staff suggested that we could leave our luggage with the porter in a secured area (at no charge), which would allow us to walk around Waikiki until our room was ready. Because we had already eaten breakfast on the ship, we weren't hungry, and we were just looking forward to checking in, so we decided to sit in the lobby until our room was ready. Check out wasn't until 12 noon, so we knew we could be in for a lengthy wait. As we were sitting in the lobby, we decided to talk to the concierge and book the Oahu Grand Circle Island Tour for the following day (which turned out to be a great tour). The concierge was very friendly and helpful.At 10:30, we were told that our room was ready for us, so we checked in. The staff apologized for the long wait (which was out their contol), and again were very nice and friendly.It wasn't until we got to our room that we realized that we had been upgraded to a King Balcony Room, which was so nice, and completely unexpected!!Because our flight wasn't leaving until just before midnight on Dec. 16, we decided to go to the front desk to see if we could have the room for an additional night (Dec. 16). They had a look at the reservations, and saw that the room we were in was already booked for someone else for Dec. 16. Because our room was set up as an adjoining room, and the people that made the reservation for Dec. 16 had booked that room along with the adjoining room, the hotel staff began looking at another adjoining room set-up that they could move that reservation to, so that we could stay in the room until we checked out late on Dec. 16. The reservations clerk was successful in shifting that other reservation, and we stayed in the same King Balcony Room for a third night (at no extra cost to us for the upgrade).The trouble that the reservations person went through to grant our request went above and beyond what we expected, and made us so happy that we booked this hotel for our stay!Although this hotel is older, it is well-maintained and well appointed.We would recommend this hotel to anyone who may not want to spend an exorbitant amount on accommodations (when really, you shouldn't be in your room very much, other than to shower and sleep) - you are in Hawaii, after all!!Thank you to all the staff at the Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Waikiki...keep up the great customer service!!","Edmonton, Canada",8,4.0

We don't need the finer things (but we like them), however, everything comes with cost. Hawaii is expensive. So, we researched hotels extensively and we are huge believers of Trip Advisor. Ramada was a perfect hotel. The price was very reasonable - with a fridge and microwave. It is a 15-20 minute walk from the beach, so that is a deterrent for some, but not us. We enjoy the walk. We arrived early (and the staff held our bags - no cost. We checked out late - and the staff held our bags - no cost). The room was large and comfortable. It is your standard hotel. It is clean and staff are awesome. A special shout out to Sui, the concierge, who looked out to our luggage (and my laptop - in which I fretted. A true gentleman!!). If you love to travel, are on a budget and need something reasonable and not in the perfect location, then you will not be disappointed here. I travel quite a bit for business and this hotel is great. I highly recommend and will be back - hopefully if we get back to Hawaii!","St. John's, Canada",48,4.0

The restaurant at the hotel was ideal for breakfast and the staff was very attentive, unfortunately my food was barley warm. My room was clean but the refrigerator had a horrible odor. The shower head was spraying in every direction, and it took a very long time to ""tweak"" the faucet so the water was tolerable. It was either freezing or scalding. The a\c was also not up to par and the curtains blocked the very little cool air from circulating. I tied them up hoping the room would cool more efficiently but it seemed like it was always warm. Adjusting the temperature lower on the unit didn't help and even after leaving and coming back, the room was still not cool. As a matter of fact I noticed the unit was off upon walking into the room and once I was in, it would kick on. That didn't make sense to me, the fan was completely not running let alone the compressor.

An ABC Store is around the corner. Parking is at ground level which makes parking easy and fast and is 23 USD/d. Lobby is nice and updated. Coffee service is offered there until 10a. Rooms are clean, for my personal taste a little dated but absolutely acceptable for Ramada standards. Staff was overall ok - I missed the aloha-spirt. They are overall very stiff and I would not call them remarkably nice.I did not appreciate that my room has not been serviced for 2 days in a row as housekeeping wanted to do that after 5p when I needed the room. I told them one the first day that 5p is far too late which they did not understand because on the second day we had the similar situation. When I checked out, I told the lady at the front desk that I did not enjoy living for two days in an unserviced room. She did not seem interested just said sorry and swiped my credit card to charge me in full for my room and parking. I personally think that this is rude and inappropriate as I expect to receive full service for full payment. So, I contacted the management of the hotel later by eMail and received the copy-paste-answer (sorry, discuss with responsible department, hope to get a second chance) that you can read here in every negative review. I felt really offended by that because I take my time do describe a problem and receive an arrogant and standardized reply that demonstrates that even in management there is not seriously interested in customer claims. Later that day the lady sent me another eMail and copied the service report of the housekeeping in order to prove my a liar as the report stated that on the first day the do-not-disturb-sign was on all day (which is not true) and that I ""refused"" service (well, in the evening I need the room). That really turned me angry because I do not like to be called a liar based on untrue facts. Therefore, I contacted that management lady again and told her that I do not accept being treated like that and paying full price getting reduce service and I want to talk to the general manager. Then she offered me a refund of one full night or a free night for a future stay or reward points. As I'm decent I told her that I fell a full night of refund (150 USD) is too much for that incident and I would appreciate two days of no parking fee (46 USD) for two days of no service and that I do not want reward point as I don't use them and don't know if I want to return to their hotel again soon. Then she took her refund offer back, refused contact to the general manager of the hotel and just offered me reward points instead. Now that is completely weird and a mess and I personally feel fooled by that lady and ripped off by the hotel. They still owe me money. Contacting this management lady was the worst and most frustrating experience I ever had in customer service. She proves that the hotel is inattentive and not interested in the customers, their needs, their expectations and their claims. That really was a crazy and unique experience. Maybe corporate can handle that.","Frankfurt, Germany",10,2.0

The check in staff were friendly and even told me my room would be ready an hour early, so that was exciting. Check-in is at three and the check out is noon.

I was also impressed that the window in the room opened a bit. The windows weren’t in the best shape but did the job.

It's a small hotel compared to some others but it has everything that you need for a comfortable stay. It has tea & coffee making facilities, a mini fridge, microwave, hairdryer & iron in the rooms. Because it's a smaller hotel it's much quieter than the larger ones like the Hawaiin Village Hilton, so for us that was a plus. What made it such an enjoyable stay was the staff, from the housekeeping who made sure our room was immaculately clean, to the concierge who helped us deal with a couple of problems we encountered with transportation. The front desk staff were very welcoming & happy to answer any queries we had. Every staff member we met were happy to chat and very accommodating, we felt very welcome. I have to have an injection to fly & upon my return flight i was concerned about where to put the used injection as i didn't have a sharpes box with me, and the nearby pharmacist was unable to help me. I spoke to the front desk & explained the situation and between us we came up with a solution & they were happy to dispose of it for me. The hotel is in an ideal location, right opposite the Hawaiin Hilton Village and the AliKai hotel, both of which you can walk through to access the beach. There are plenty of eateries nearby if you want to eat out, but there is also the food pantry just around the corner that is like a mini supermarket. The food is really fresh and there is a lot of choice, i would highly recommend, especially for the fruit. A bus stop is located right outside the hotel & all of the tour buses pick up from the Alikai hotel over the road, so everything is on your doorstep. The pool area is small, but is more than suitable for the size of the hotel. The only downside to our visit was that to book trips you cannot pay by cash, they only accept credit/debit cards, but after looking around this seemed to be the case in the majority of the hotels. Unfortunately for us we'd taken cash, but just around the corner by McDonalds is a tour stand run by a lady by the name of Cindy & she does accept cash. A taxi from the hotel into Waikiki can cost anything from $7-$10 dollars depending on where you're going.

Transport is right out the front for The Bus and Trolleys. $5.50 gets you a day pass to use on all the buses which was very handy for getting downtown and out to Diamond Head as well as Pearl Harbour. Plenty of dining options within walking distance or just get the bus if it's too far to walk. So easy. Close to the beach as well without the Beachfront Resort price and no resort fee as well.

Finally, I was able to journey out to Hawaii for a week in 2018 from late February to early March. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. For example, a staff member taught me about an app to use for my cellular telephone in order to learn about the bus schedules. The hotel valet assisted me in how to open a coconut; obviously, this role was not a part of his job duties. Also, when I called the front desk to ask if I could obtain some shaving cream, a staff member actually brought the shaving cream to my door! I frequently conversed with staff members, housekeeping, and parking attendants, and everyone was always a pleasure to be around. The pool is beautiful and it is surrounded by coconut trees. There is a gym on the premises which is always open. There is a business center, and the views from the rooms are incredible! Most of the major sites in Honolulu are within walking distance, and if one is able to walk a few miles, he or she can visit most of the major attractions without the need to use a bus. Moreover, a bus stop is conveniently located right next to the hotel. One of my favorite features of the hotel is that it is roughly a five (5) minute walk to Waikiki Beach. Despite this hotel's location which is so close to the action, there is fortunately not much noise. The hotel was very clean, and my room came with a television, telephone, coffee/tea, microwave, and a refrigerator. The housekeeping staff would come by each morning to make the beds and to clean the bathroom. I thought that based on the excellent service and the fact that this hotel is in such a central location, I was very fortunate to pay approximately $150.00 per night. Many of the adjacent hotels charged much more money than the Ramada Waikiki. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone, and I would definitely stay here again.

We stayed in late July and early August (during US school holidays). As it was late summer the hotel was fully booked for early check ins (which is not guaranteed prior to arrival as most hotels) so if arriving early book an extra night to guarantee an early check in.We arrived 10 hours prior to check in and were lucky to check in at 12:00 instead of at 3pm. The hotel has no onsite eateries but you do get a 30% discount at Wok Kiki all you can eat chinese buffet. There's heaps of places to eat locally so step out of the resort and explore.Waikiki is a short walk and it's opposite the Hilton Hawaiian village which is great for a browse. There's a bus stop right in front of the hotel and most of the trolleys pass by as well. Ala Moana shopping centre is a 5 minute walk and Honolulu is on the other side of the hotel so I find it a great spot to get to and from especially from the airport.A very reasonably priced hotel for the facilities including Gym, pool, laundry etc. The reception is 24 hours. It does need a little face lift in the rooms but it's no less than the equivalent of Hawaiian hotel rooms. We would definitely stay again.","Tugun, Australia",32,4.0

Lots of good restaurants and activities in the area.The hotel room itself was spacious and had everything we needed. Most of the other reviews do a great job of listing the pros and cons so I won't be redundant.One point of annoyance, though, was that twice we ordered a taxi as we were running quite late (once for an excursion, the other to get to the airport for our departing flight). I didn't have my phone available so I couldn't hire Uber so we asked the concierge to book us a taxi. Both times, once we got into the car and got to our location, the taxi informed us that they don't take credit cards. I'm not used to this arrangement as in nearly every country we travel (and we travel a lot) taxis offer credit card transactions. Both taxis they ordered were cash only. We live in Australia so we don't carry US currency with us and this put us in a real bind. I had to end up paying a big fee and it cost us tons of time both times trying to get this sorted. I almost missed my excursion. I don't know why the concierge doesn't ask if we have cash or try to arrange a ride that accepts credit card. This may seem minor, but we were put into a real bind twice and it seems like a very fixable issue. Other than that, though, we don't really have any complaints.

What I got was a fair size room with all you could need, free internet and local calls, fridge, microwave, coffee machine, iron and ironing board, laundry facilites. I have stayed in swankier hotels where you have to pay for the internet. Coffee is provided in the lobby and the pool is a decent size so I was able to do a few lengths to beat my jet lag but it did not really get the sun. Location wise it is close to but not on the beach but it is only a short walk. You can also walk to the Ala Moana shopping centre and the centre of Waikiki very easily. As I was not driving the reception staff provided me with information on the city buses and I was able to catch various buses to Pearl Harbour, Diamond Head and Hanauma Bay. Loads of restaurants and bars nearby and the ABC store is just across the road. I really enjoyed my stay but as others have stated it does need sprucing up. I noticed it was used a lot by airline staff and if you are more of an independent traveller and you don't fancy resort style hotels then this is a good choice.","England, United Kingdom",43,3.0

It is set back from a busy street, with almost no frontage on teh main road across from the monster Hilton Village, but the location makes the Ramada both quieter and smaller than the average Waikiki hotel while being well situated for access to the beach, the bus, and restaurants. The front desk is across from the entrance, so the staff are right there to greet you and maintain security. The hotel is small enough that the staff recognize you. There's free coffee in the morning--until 1 p.m., unlike my previous hotel, which took away the coffee at 10 a.m. The lobby has marble floors and classic rattan and bamboo furniture. Rooms are not stylish, but they are comfortably and well furnished: the brass lamps have pineapple details that are repeated in the green-and-gold (pineapple-colored) bedding, upholstered armchairs, and drapes. We had a balcony overlooking the pool and street, but set back from both for privacy and quiet, and enjoyed eating breakfast out there (room had fridge, microwave, and coffee-maker). The room had lots of small comforts: no desk (chose not to exchange the balcony for a desk), but the table was adequate for work (sigh--not a vacation); good free wifi. Good bed, pillows, and sheets. Two comfortable stuffed armchairs. Quiet toilet for middle-of-the-night use. Even a retractable clothesline over the tub. (And a tub, not just a shower.) Ample big towels. Exquisitely clean bathroom: the prefab shower is not fancy, but the walls had perfectly white silicone sealant, and a tub soak was not marred by the sight of dirt in any corners. Highly recommended!","Athens, Ohio",3,5.0

I think Waikiki is a sub-par Hawaiian vacation experience. Frankly, I think it's nuts to fly thousands of miles to a ""tropical paradise"" and spend your vacation in the concrete jungle that is Waikiki. Not that the place is completely without it's charms. But as far as I'm concerned, if you're spending more than 2 days of your Hawaii vacation in Waikiki, you're wasting your money.With that bias in mind, the Ramada is a reasonable place to stay in Waikikl for the price. I'd classify it as a 2 1/2 star hotel. Location is good, a little more than a 5-minute walk to one of the best Waikiki beaches. Staff is friendly and helpful. There are even some streets nearby you can park your car on for free (requires some effort to find a space though) if you want to save the hotel's $20 parking fee. For an older hotel, the elevators are zippy. Rooms are small; I don't recommend a family of four stay here for more than a night. And while the rooms are reasonably clean, some refurbishment is sorely needed. Like we had 2 arm chairs in our room that wouldn't cut it in a fleabag motel (fabric worn down). It's weird that management would think it was OK to leave them in a guest room. There were also some gaps in the bottom of the window panes that let Waikiki's considerable noise into our room (particularly bad if it's early morning garbage truck day).Bottom line, there are a lot of mediocre but acceptable places you can stay in Waikiki. Pick the Ramada if the value is better than the alternatives (if you have Wyndham Rewards points, consider their cash and points rates). Expect an OK place to crash. Do not expect a fancy hotel stay. Unless you're strictly a ""city person,"" limit your stay to a couple of nights and get out and explore the rest of Hawaii.","Philadelphia, PA",1182,3.0

Does not have any food service within the hotel, though they do provide free tea and coffee in the mornings. We also had to pay $25 a night for parking, which for the price of this hotel seems outrageous (thankfully only did this one night). Staff were mostly really helpful, but we had a few interactions with some rude staff too.

Minimal street noise but also, minimal views.  Parking is self park, $25 regular price but (a) unlimited in and out and (b) its on the ground level, no ramps to maneuver. 3 Different Airlines use for the hotel for their Flight crews so mornings are busy with them in/out but they don't have cars, so parking shouldn't be a problem. Located at one end of Waikiki, so depending on what you're looking for, keep that in mind. Easy access to bus transportation and the shopping center is a 10 min walk or so away.

The hotel is just across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village, with its associated shops/restaurants. It's a 8-10min walk to the very large Ala Moana Center (check out Poi Bowl in its food court for tasty Hawaiian food at a steal). Waikiki Beach is 20-25min walk away. The room is large, clean, and comfortable; it comes with work desk, dresser, TV, armchair and ottoman, closet area, microwave, fridge, and coffee maker. The king sized bed was nice. The bathroom is a bit too plain and white, but fine enough. I found the coin operated laundry really convenient, and it was one of the reasons I chose this property. The pool is on the second floor, and has a bunch of chaises and separate dining area; towels are provided; pool was a bit cold in November though when I visited. I loved that the hotel is just across the street from the entrance to Kahanamoku Beach, which is beautiful, and imo, more peaceful than Waikiki Beach. They gave me late check-out, but it was only 1hr later (1pm instead of 12pm) -- there is an option to extend your stay to 5pm if the room is available for an additional $75. Delicious Kona coffee was available every morning in the lobby. This Ramada seems more amenity heavy compared to other Wyndham properties, likely because of its location in Hawaii. At about $110/night, I found it a good value, and would recommend it.","New York City, New York",78,4.0

I stay at a lot of Wyndham properties, and this one is a winner.The check-in was quick and the staff was very friendly throughout my stay. My room request was granted and I enjoyed the welcoming gift for Diamond members of Wyndham Rewards. The room faced the rear of the property and was well appointed and exceptionally clean, with great views of the neighborhood. The pool area was nice and I was surprised how despite the hotels location, received a lot of sun each day.I had breakfast around the corner at McD's each day (I love their Hawaiian Big Breakfast with rice, eggs, Spam, and local sausage) and then walked the length of the canal to the zoo, had coffee on the beach at The New Otani, and then walked back across Waikiki by a different route each day.I then sat out by the pool until late afternoon to get some sun, then walked over to Ala Moana Park for the sunset views, and then to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and Ilikai in the evenings for entertainment. The Ala Moana Mall and the Ward Center are both an easy walk and have great shopping and fantastic food court options. The fort is down and across the street and makes for a nice stroll.I liked the morning coffee service in the lobby and there were a lot of airline crews staying here, so you know it is a safe place. They also have a discount price available deal with the all-you-can-eat place next to the lobby.In other words, this is a great place to stay, surrounded by more expensive places.For meals, I recommend the pink chiffon pancakes at Cinnamon's at the Illikai, and everything at the Wailana Coffee House - both nearby.I can't wait to build up some more Wyndham Reward points and come back for a full week.","Kettering, Ohio",207,5.0

It's a central location between Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana Shopping Centre - an easy walk to each. The Trolley Bus and The Bus stop just out the front. (Just beware on the way back that there's a bit of a walk because there's no close crossing over Ala Moana Blvd to the Hotel.) There are a number of restaurants close by including a 24hr one and there are two close ABC shops!The rooms are clean and whilst not huge the bed is and it's comfortable to boot!There is a laundry with washers and dryers.The pool and gym are ok - although our one complaint with the is that the pool closes at 9pm (which is fine) but we were sitting out by the pool waiting for clothes to dry - it was a hot night and we didn't want to sit in the room with the dryers. The door of the laundry was opened out onto the pool area in any case. The security guy had been past a couple of times and spoken to us - I was reading and my husband drawing and we were clothed and fairly obviously not going to jump in the pool and on his third swing past he told us we had to go in. I pointed out that we weren't in the pool and were waiting for clothes to dry and it was really hot in the laundry but he was not interested - so we ended up in the hot laundry with the door to the pool area still open! So maybe there needs to be a bit more flexibility!Also, although the staff are great with looking after your luggage it might help to perhaps try and have some rooms for those of us who arrive at 7am after the long haul flight from Australia.

The location is wonderful, we walked to dinner and shopping every night and the beach is just right across the street through the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which is a nice walk. The staff at the Ramada was extremely warm, welcoming, and helpful. We didn't have any problems with our room, everything worked fine except on the second to last day the TV remote stopped working but we were able to get assistance with that right away (replaced batteries). The shower head is adjustable and there is plenty of hot water. Ice water is always available in the lobby and in the mornings, they provide coffee and tea. Even when we slept in and didn't leave our room until after noon, our room ALWAYS got made up (housekeeping was wonderful).There is a 24/7 parking lot attendant which is nice so your vehicle is safe. We originally planned to park on the street for free to avoid the parking fee, but quickly found out that street parking is hard to come by - there are a lot of condos and hotels around so it's difficult to find a spot on the street and frankly isn't worth the headache. By signing up for the free Wyndham rewards program we saved $5 per day on parking which was a nice deal since we stayed 7 nights.

Waikiki is busy and noisy so we were not able to take advantage of opening the balcony door to get fresh air when sleeping which is what we like to do when possible. The air-conditioning worked fine but probably equal to the cities noise at night. We spent two nights at the hotel and it seemed like most every guess was asian including many flight crews from asian airlines. We didn't spend much time in the room so it worked fine for us but be aware that the hotel lacks any real amenities so if you plan to spend much time at a hotel the Ramada would not be a good choice.,"Edmonds, Washington",1,3.0

Within walking distance (about 15 mins) to the largest outdoor mall, Ala Moana Mall and the Ala Moana Beach Park. The decor of the place is a little dated though the rooms are generally comfortable and clean. However, on a couple of occasions, I found strands of hair probably left by housekeeping staff on the bathroom floor and on the towels on the towel rack. But I guess this is not a big deal.Though I do have to agree with some of the reviews I have read while researching on the hotel that the hotel has a very hostile and unwelcoming atmosphere from the moment you step into the lobby and checking in. As I had arrived earlier than check-in time (arrived at the hotel at about 12-1pm), I was just told by the front desk that they do not have a room now as their check-in time is 3pm. Without advising what I can do or even if they can help store my luggages, I was just told to come back at 3pm. No smiles on the face of staffers and the staffs are nonchalant, unhelpful and at times close to rude and impatient with basic of questions and will simply give you a map without any directions, recommendations or advises. As I have forgotten to bring along a razor for my trip, I left a note in the morning to the housekeeping for a razor. But instead i got a reply note saying that she does not have a razor in her cart and ask me to call the front desk for one. So I called the front desk upon my return in the evening for a razor, I was curtly told on the phone to call the housekeeping or go to the front desk to get it. When I asked if he could help transfer the call to housekeeping, I was again curtly told that there is a housekeeping button on the phone and he ask me to call myself. Though I understand that the hotel is very popular with large Chinese tour groups, I am not sure, and I certainly hope it is not due to the fact that majority of the guests are Chinese and Mandarin speaking. and so the bad attitude Attitude of staffers needs to be improved which I seriously find unacceptable in the service and hotel industry.","Singapore, Singapore",3,3.0

There are no complimentary shuttles provided by the hotel from the airport, which tells its own story.Located in a 'seedier' part of town, on our walk to the hotel (and around the local area in search of a place to eat) we were accosted on several occasions by homeless people asking for money. There are very few decent places to eat within the immediate vicinity of the hotel, and instead it is surrounded by diners, tattoo parlours and seedy sports bars. The hotel itself is *very* popular with large Chinese tour groups, to the extent that the buffet attached to the hotel has signs around it written only in Chinese/Mandarin. We didn't bother going inside as looking through the window from the outside we could see that we would have immediately felt very uncomfortable once seated inside.As a result, the whole atmosphere of the hotel feels very unwelcoming. As there was only 2 of us staying overnight to visit Pearl Harbor this wasn't too much of an issue, however I would strongly advise against staying in this hotel if you are staying in Oahu for any decent length of time, particularly if you have children and/or value an 'inclusive' and welcoming atmosphere.","Paris, France",4,2.0

Facing the right direction to catch the breeze off the ocean. Concerning the car: another reason to be a Wyndham Rewards member: you receive $5.00 off a day for parking so instead of $25.00 per day it's $20.00. The parking is monitored... seemed like they allowed no more cars than rooms so I always found a place to park no matter when I arrived back at the hotel.Arrived at check-in time and was quickly given my room so that I could relax. Had gone grocery shopping (room equipped with microwave and refrigerator) so wanted to cut down on meal expenditures. Bellman handled all the items plus my luggage while I went to park my car.Normal routine was completed... nothing there but me:-) and I went outside to sit on the lana'i (balcony) and got a pleasant surprise: either the pigeons know NOT to come here or they just weren't around... FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. Because usually when I sit outside to eat, I usually have at least ONE land on my railing... none appeared. Lana'i was extremely clean as well as spacious. I even had an area that could be used for either outdoor tanning or sleeping: I'm not sure what it was supposed to be for but I used it to stretch out and sleep underneath the stars... wonderful.Another great stay at a great place with a fantastic location.

The cost of a bus ride, no matter how far you were going was $2.50US.There was plenty of good eating places which surrounded the hotel that served breakfast, lunch and dinner. Our favourite was Snappers as they served Cider on tap. We had and excellent experience at the Ramada Plaza Waikiki and would be happy to recommend this hotel to anyone who was looking for comfort and homely rather than Ritzy and expensive.","Melbourne, Australia",11,5.0

We weren't going to spend much time there except to sleep and to get ready for our day on the island, so the hotel was perfect for us.The facility is clean, up-to-date, safe, and the staff is friendly. I noticed airline crews staying there which I think is a good sign about a hotel. It was an easy walk to the beach, restaurants, and other attractions of Waikiki but without the noise and chaos over closer to the beach. The mall is only three blocks away but we didn't go there. The ABC stores (convenience stores) are close by, but I think they are everywhere over there.We were in a balcony room and I really enjoyed sitting out there early in the morning and at the end of the day. We had a city-view room which I think would be quieter than the rooms on the other side of the building facing the busy road the hotel is on. The area our balcony faced seem to be mainly residential and condos. There are normal city sounds (car horns, sirens occasionally, construction noise in the day), but I left our sliding door open all night to enjoy the fresh air and could sleep with no problem. Looking left out of our balcony you could see just a tiny patch of ocean. I think the rooms on the other side may have a bit bigger patch of ocean visible, but the view is mainly blocked on that side too due to the highrises and hotels between the Ramada and the water.The bed and pillows were comfortable and the room was made up well each day. There is a mini fridge and microwave in the room. Water pressure and temperature were good. They have ice water and coffee available in the mornings in the lobby. We had a car and parked at the hotel for $20 per night as Wyndham Rewards members; I think it is $5 more per night without the card. The city buses also stop right in front of the hotel. Parking seems safe as there is a person on duty and actually patrolling the lot all day and night.We didn't use the pool but it looked OK and seems like only a few people were using it at any given time. It wasn't an issue for us, but there was a sign on the gift shop in the lobby saying it would be closed until May. There is also a concierge / tourist info person in the lobby, but we had made our own plans.The only problem we encountered was the hair dryer outlet in the bathroom didn't work and wasn't fixed while we were there. We tried resetting the GFI button on the outlet but that didn't do the trick either. I had told the front desk about the problem the first morning of our stay but nothing was done to repair it before the end of our stay.All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.","Palm Coast, Florida",41,5.0

It is a cheap mid-level apartment block hotel. It is situated within a short walk to Waikiki and the associated bars and restaurants (which is really good).It is slightly tired in places and the $15 a day parking fee was steep. The outdoor pool was on the roof of a lower floor so was overlooked by hundreds of hi-rise apartments, so no sun after 3pm.For all that, the Ramada was a good price when it comes to staying in Honolulu. Don't knock that. A reasonable room and a slightly less than perfect location at a less than £100/night is not to be sniffed at.The problem with Honolulu is that if you want to be near Waikiki, you need to pay through the nose for an airport shuttle or taxi. If you have a hire car, you pay for parking. Oh, by the way, traffic in Honolulu is horrendous come the rush hour.However, my criteria is always ""value for what we paid"". So £110 (including the parking) for a small room in a tired hotel cannot really lead to a good rating.

Also, a late 8am opening means no early morning swim before the kids come out...- judging by the smell wafting out, the restaurant (Wok-kiki - geddit?) was a greasy Chinese place. For breakfast (and other stuff) you're better off checking out one of the excellent nearby options like Goofy or Kimobean, or something in one of the other hotels.","San Francisco, California",10,3.0

So why do we stay in a hotel for half the trip? Because it's Hawaii! You have to make a vacation of any trip to this beautiful state.

It's across the street from Hilton Hawaiian Village, one block from the sands of Waikiki, a short walk to the mall. It's the quietest part of Waikiki.The rooms are clean, the staff is courteous, helpful and treats us like we're in a higher priced hotel. Some people will call the stay average. I call it a bigger bang for my buck! You have to put the hotel and service in context. This is Hawaii. It costs up to $7 for a half gallon of milk. The Hilton across the street, $400 a night minimum! So for about $100 a night I get a clean room, friendly service, 1 block beach access and not a lot of tourists. How could I ask for more at these rates?

Taco Bell is also just a short drive from the hotel and has a the dollar cravings menu but the prices are $1.39 an item. Kmart downtown has a Little Caesars in store which has large Cheese pizzas for $7.00.

We were extremely comfortable and happy with our stay!Yes, the property is a bit outdated but the rooms are comfortable (best nights sleep I've had in a long time thanks to the super comfy beds!) and well maintained. We were on the ninth floor with a view of the buildings and parking lot out back. I wasn't happy with the view but will remember to ask for a different room the next time!I've read other reviews which complained about the street noise. Not an issue for us. We hardly noticed it. Maybe because we were on the back side of the hotel.Housekeeping was on top of things. We were always greeted with a super clean room when we returned at night.My only real issue was the coffee pot. I'm admittedly a bit of a coffee snob. The coffee provided in the rooms was incredibly weak. The coffee maker took forever to brew a small pot of coffee. I was disappointed as I thought there would be a Kuerig in our room. No worries. I purchased a pack of coffee filters from one of the many ABC stores in the area and brewed coffee from one of the plantations we had visited!The wifi was incredibly slow. It was a pain to constantly be required to sign in. But the service was free, so we can't complain too much!The hotel is located right across from the Ala Moana beach, and within walking distance from lots of shops and restaurants.The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.Overall, this was a great place to stay if you're on a budget and don't care about the glitz and glam of the other hotels in the area.","Marysville, Ohio",22,4.0

Further, when you attempted to click on their ""Terms of Service"" (which is required to connect to internet), the link does not work so you can't tell what you're agreeing to.

Overall, the Ramada is a great hotel based on it's location and price -- we were literally within walking distance of the Ala Moana Center as well as Waikiki Beach and all the restaurants in that area. As for the hotel itself, it's an average hotel with nothing special. Perks included the free Wi-Fi that was not slow (you can watch YouTube) and free coffee/tea in the lobby in the morning. Parking around the Ramada is terrible -- there was construction that took up a whole street of what would have been free parking, and Ala Wai is always packed. Hotel parking is $25/night (aka until 12PM the next day) and $20 for Wyndam members. Housekeeping was very nice -- I left a note requesting extra towels (for the beach and to avoid having them come in every day just to exchange the towels) and they gave us 6! We were also on the 12th floor and our room was at the end of the hallway so it was super quiet -- no view though, but we were never in our rooms anyways.The only trouble I had was when we checked out, the front desk charged me for an extra night of parking because THEY wrote down the wrong date. Thank god I saved my receipt/parking card to prove exactly when I parked in the hotel. We paid roughly $105/night and for the location and the fact that the hotel was just a place for us to store our stuff, shower and sleep, the Ramada is a great deal.

The excuse was that the manager had a family issue, but can not the manager on duty give the information to another manager on duty.POSITIVES.......we received chocolates from management as a apology.we asked for a night back in money as we did not get any sleep the first night, we received that.The cleaners were always saying good morning.so please make your own mind up, but if we ever went again we would go to vrbo and book a condo. so much more cheaper and can get them overlooking the ocean for $150 per night. we looked into it while we were their, and condo's are the way to go.We thank the management in finally getting back to us, and also the cleaners, who seem to be stressed to work for this company, but still find a smile and a hello.

To begin, the positive attributes of this hotel are the following: refrigerator & microwave in room, pool, close to restaurants and a short walk to the beach. The negative attributes to the hotel are as follows: confusion upon check-in, parking problems, not located directly on the beach. Upon arriving there was confusion about my reservation. I had the paperwork and confirmation number. However, there was a delay in getting me checked in due to difficulty in finding the reservation. Fortunately, the front-desk employee asked for a manger to help and things got settled quickly. The manager actually ""upgraded"" my room to the 17th floor, or the ""penthouse"" floor. The room was a regular sized room with a small refrigerator, microwave, and balcony. The main problem I had with this hotel was the parking situation. Upon arriving, the ""valet"" employee told me to park in a certain space. She pointed to a space and instructed me to park there as I got checked in with the front desk. Within approximately 5 minutes, she came into the lobby and asked me to move my car. It is hard to multi-task and check in and move the car at the same time. Therefore, the front desk employee and manager told me it was fine to continue the check-in process and to not worry about the car. I understand the valet car-park employee was just trying to follow procedure and do her job. However, throughout the course of my stay, I came to realize that I don't think this particular employee even had a driver's license. Not once did I ever see her physically valet a car. Furthermore,this particular employee was from China and her English was not very good. It made it very difficult to communicate with her and fully understand the parking rules and expectations. That evening I went out and returned at approximately 1:40AM. There wasn't anywhere to park. The only place to park was in the ""Reserved, Do Not Park, For Restaurant Only"" spaces. Fortunately, the valet employee named Bridget, told me to valet the car with her and not to worry, that she would park the car and move it to an appropriate spot when one became available. Bridget was the most professional car-park employee whom I encountered. She was sure to mention her name and give me a claim check to retrieve the vehicle. I wish all valet car-park employees were as courteous as Bridget. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The following night I left and returned late and this time was an elderly American woman working the car-park. She was reading a book. When I asked her if where I was parking was permitted, she looked at me as if I was bothering her. After all, I just wanted to be certain I was parking in an authorized area and following the rules. I didn't want to have my rental car get towed. Upon checkout my rental car was blocked in. I tried explaining this to the Chinese employee and she had no idea what I was saying. Therefore, I went to my rental car and took a picture of the other car blocking me in and returned to show it to her. She had no idea how to solve the problem. I don't know exactly why Diamond Parking had employees working who more than likely did not have a driver's license. I thought the purpose of a valet at a car-park was to juggle cars by taking keys and moving cars as necessary. Since she walked around the parking lot not knowing what to do, I brought this parking fiasco to the attention of the front desk. They explained that the valet employee would help me get the car moved. Wrong! This fiasco continued for nearly 45minutes. What if I had to be at the airport for a flight? I would have missed it. With this parking disaster being stated over the past few paragraphs, I find it absolutely ridiculous the hotel charges $20.00/night for overnight parking. Actually, the price for parking is $25.00/night, but as a Wyndham Rewards Member it is $20.00/night. Regardless, I believe $20.00/night was too expensive considering the hassle. Out of 3 employees of Diamond Parking with whom I encountered, only 1 employee was worth the title of ""valet employee."" Bridget actually drove and moved cars, took keys and gave claim checks whereas the other employees (the Chinese woman and the older American woman with the book) were just there. I didn't see them actually working. Oh, it turns out the car that was blocking in my rental car was the car of the owner of the restaurant that shares the parking lot with the hotel. The woman came running out saying in her accent, ""Oh, sorry, there was an emergency in the kitchen."" Um, yeah...an emergency that took 45minutes? I ended up in Hawaii ""by accident"" because I was stopping in Honolulu for a layover on my way home from Australia. Hence, when looking for a hotel I was looking for something in Waikiki that was reasonably priced. With that being stated, the hotel is fine for a short stay. However, if you are looking for a hotel to spend your ""once in a lifetime paradise vacation"" I suggest you consider other options that are perhaps directly on the beach. Unfortunately, I don't think I will stay here again if in Waikiki.","Tarpon Springs, Florida",115,3.0

This hotel was conveniently located for what we were there for (a concert at the Blaisdell Arena) and everything about it was great. The fitness room was great and the pool, though it's small, was clean and would have been great to swim in but it was a cloudy day on the day we were going to try it out, so the water was cold and we didn't get in. The only thing I didn't like were the pillows. But that's just a personal preference. I have a hard time sleeping well if I don't have my own pillow. There are like 6 pillows to choose from on the bed and they seem to be different thicknesses. So maybe for others it works, although my husband also couldn't find the perfect one for him. We will probably bring our own pillows next time. There is a restaurant downstairs, but we didn't try it. There are also other nearby restaurants you can walk to like IHOP and Buffalo Wild Wings and more.

Only complaint about the room is that the coffee pot was in the bathroom literally 2ft from the toilet. We are coffee drinkers so this was very disgusting to us. We were up at 4am both nights and asked the front desk person if he would please make us some coffee in the lobby and he told us to just move the coffee pot out of the bathroom. Which did not solve the problem in our eyes. The only time that anyone ever greeted us was when we checked in any other time we came into the lobby we were never spoken too.

Of course, with so many budget hotels going upscale, Ramada has raised its rates significantly in recent years and may soon be unaffordable too, particularly for longer stays. Housekeeping remains the strong point here as there isn't a speck of dirt in the rooms and everything is done promptly and professionally. The hotel claims to be environmentally conscious with the usual cards about towel and linen reuse but that really doesn't ring true. There are only paper or Styrofoam cups wrapped in plastic bags for coffee and bathroom use. And the lobby, for some unknown reason, is excessively air conditioned to meat locker temperatures. Most hotels in Waikiki, including luxury properties, have open air lobbies. The Ramada, owing to the building's ancestry as Holiday Inn, chooses to refrigerate the lobby, especially by the elevators. By keeping the front doors open and replacing the window near the elevator with louvers the delightful island breezes would waft through and countless kilowatt hours would be saved.

The hotel itself is nothing spectacular or luxurious, but a good, solid, quality place to stay. The location is pretty good, a little bit out of the main tourist hustle of Waikiki, so a bit quieter. However it is only about a 5 min walk from Waikiki Beach and about 10 min to Ala Moana Mall and park. There are a number of handy shops and restaurants within a few minute’s walk from the hotel. Give the Wokkiki Chinese buffet out front a miss – definitely not worth it.The room was a bit smallish and we didn’t have any view from the 10th floor, but it was clean, comfortable, and functional with all the usual amenities (coffee maker, safe, microwave, AC, etc). The large, modern flat screen TV had a great selection of channels, and there was free, unlimited Wifi which is a major drawcard for us (we won’t stay places these days that don’t offer free Wifi). My only complaint was that we got a room with 2 smallish beds rather than 1 king size bed. Another thing we really liked about this hotel was the fact they had a fitness center. Although it was small, there was enough quality gear, both cardio and weights, to get a decent workout. We used the fitness center every day and applaud the hotel’s decision to install and maintain the fitness facility. It’s often hard to find a decent gym in the Waikiki hotels.Breakfast was included (from the Wokkiki Chinese buffet restaurant out front) in the room price. We tried it on the first morning and found it to be so awful that we went elsewhere for breakfast on the following mornings – disappointing. Our clothes ended up smelling like a Chinese deep fryer from just sitting in there for 15 min. There’s an IHOP just a few yards down the street so a much better option.Overall we had a really good stay at the Ramada and wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again in the future.

I showed him the pictures again so he could see what we found, and then went back to the room.When we checked out, the day receptionist gave us a box of chocolate (according to her, it was a gift from the day manager to make up for the roach).

The only comment with regard to location is a slight annoyance of reaching the beach by heading a block mauka (inland) to go makai (towards the sea) to get to the beach. This involves the pedestrian crossing light at the corner of Ala Moana Boulevard and Kalia Road, which may be the longest “Don’t Walk” in the history of pedestrian crossings.

It was remarkably clean and very quiet - even though on a very busy road. The location to beach, Marina, Ala Moana Center and ABC Store made it super convenient for us. The $20 parking fee was a bit steep per day - but parking in general in the area is a problem. In the end, we probably did not need the car as most everything was within walking distance and the traffic is no fun in this area. The pool was very small but adequate we only used it end-day for a quick cool off. The laundry room was terrific as we brought our own beach towels and they were pretty sandy and nasty at the end of each beach day. The front desk was adequate we really did not need too much interaction with them. I did want to upgrade to a balcony but decided the price was not worth it as the baloncy room available looked out over a construction site and parking lot. We were not really in the room much - only to crash at the end of very busy active days. We don't normally stay at Ramadas but got this one via PriceLine and in the end, it worked out perfectly. Plenty of places nearby to walk to for dinner but most nights were were so wiped from being in the sea all day that we got take-away from some awesome ethnic restaurants or salads from ABC store. Our only complaint was the safe in room #901 did not work very well - it took a million tries each day to get it locked. But - we were too busy to bother to move rooms so just dealt with it and allowed extra time before we left the room for the day. I'd definitely stay here again in Waikiki and next time, forget the rental car. The bus service and trolleys come by every 2 minutes so that would have been the better choice than the car.","San Jose, California",189,4.0

I recall the hotel as being certainly adequate and clean and the bed comfortable. I did have some trouble with the WiFi as it kept going in and out. Anyway, it was a place to stay and by the time I booked, was the last place available. It doesn't have all the amenities that other places on Waikiki have and is not on the beach side which was annoying. I don't recall how much I paid but I have to say it was a disappointment when I saw the hotels where other members of my association were staying for a little more money. Sigh.

There is a small pool (we didn´t use it), coin-operated washing machine, ice machine and a gift shop. WLAN is free and you can use PCs and a printer free of charge. The hotel doesn´t offer breakfast. There is free coffee - or rather: there should be free coffee in the morning, because most the time it was empty. We arrived early and were able to check in immediately to our standard room (without balcony) on the 11th floor. Our room was really nice: two very comfy double beds, two armchairs, large TV, microwave, coffee machine, fridge and a free safe. Wardrobe space is quite limited. The bathroom was average-sized with a very good showers. Toileteries and a hairdryer are provided. Beach towels can be borrowed at the reception.Room and bathroom were very clean and furnished to a good standard with Hawaiian decors. However, it´s a rather a city hotel room than a beach hotel room (I think this is what ""Ramada PLAZA"" is about...). Location of the hotel is very good. To the beach or to Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon, it´s best to go through Hilton Village, it´s a ten minute walk. It´s about 12 mins to go to Ala Moana Shopping Center (highly recommended!).

Starting with the room -- it was clean, comfortable and had all the necessary amenities. There was plenty of closet and drawer space, comfortable seating available, a desk, coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator, ice bucket and blow dryer. The decor was pleasant enough as well. We used the pool once and that was nice too. It seems to be shaded much of the time, but is not too crowded. There was also coffee available in the lobby each morning.The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful and take good care of guests. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, but they worked quickly to prepare it. We came at the end of a HUGE conference and all of the hotels in the area were scrambling.The beach is about a five minute walk. The closest beach is at the Hilton Hawaiian Village -- it's right across the street and their beach is one of the nicest in Waikiki. There are plenty of options for food right around the hotel. The Ala Moana Shopping Center is an easy walk with more food options and a Foodland Grocery Store that is really nice and has takeout food too. If you don't rent a car, many buses to anywhere on the island stop at Ala Moana so you can get around easily for sightseeing from there. You can also walk to most places around Waikiki -- including the International Market and the Convention Center is also within walking distance.Parking is cheaper if you are a Wyndham rewards member, so if you are renting a car I recommend that you join (free) before staying there.

It’s an easy walk to the Ala Moana Shopping Center in one direction and Waikiki in the other.

The staff at the desk are professional, helpful, efficient, and friendly. And, in all of our travels, we have never encountered such cheerful cleaning staff. The free wifi is great, and there is a laundry room for guests, which is a bonus. Some things that were less than optimal: the water in our room was not hot enough; the shower was tepid at best. We mentioned this at the front desk and they said they’d try to fix it but it still wasn’t hot. Also, we would have liked some materials/brochures in our room to see what was available to see/do. However, the most major downside for us – and this was not the fault of the hotel – was that we were on the side of the hotel facing a construction site. The noise from that (trucks, clanking materials, beeping from backing up) started at 7am every day except Sunday. If you are planning to stay here while the construction is going on, make sure you ask to be on the side of the hotel away from the it.

The coffee making facilities are poor and there are no glasses or spoons, only paper cups. So if you want to enjoy a wine or stir your coffee, bad luck.

Also, there are no bed bugs and the room was very clean. On the negative side: 1. The included breakfast is disgusting. The restaurant is located at the front of the building and is semi detached. No cereals, no milk, no juice, no bacon. Caters only for Asians and there is the ever present smell of cabbage and sewage; 2. The congregation of smoking people outside the front door.

Therefore a hotel directly at aWaikiki was not that important at this time. We choose the Ramada, because of its better price than beach front hotels and its location between the beach and the Ala Moana shopping centre, which worked out very well (both beach and shopping (which is fantastic) are about 15 min of slow walk away). Our room on the upper floor was standard ( why it is called penthouse is beyond our understanding) and it had a nice smallish balcony. Maybe the best of the hotel is the Chinese buffet on the premises on the ground floor (it does not belong to the hotel) which serves fantastic, fresh and cheap food for dinner and lunch (and breakfast?) - we ate there twice an loved it both times. The staff of the reception of the hotel is typical American for basic chain hotels - when checking in they are professional but after that no more eye contact during your stay which is okay for that price.

The comment about airline stewardesses giving this place their patronage was borne out by there being a dozen or so in reception when we checked in. It IS a good sign. We found the location to be convenient, with all amenities (shops, restaurants, beach) all close by. This side of town also seemed to us to be slightly more upmarket than the Waikiki end. By way of confirmation, my wife developed a dislike for Honolulu when we stopped over at the Waikiki end 2 years ago (admittedly not in a great hotel). This time she fell in love with the place!The hotel reception area is tastefully finished with marble flooring and a comfortable guest lounge with complimentary iced water and coffee. Complimentary wifi both here and in the room plus printing facilities.The room is not large, but easily accommodates a king bed and a small lounge area with table and chairs. Smallish bathroom, with shower over the bath.Cleanliness beyond reproach.At the time of our stay (Feb 3013) construction had begun over the road at the rear of some condos. This included pile-driving, but they didn't start before 9.00am and I can honestly say that it did not affect our stay in any way whatsoever. In fact it was quite interesting to observe their progress. If you need to be sleeping after 9.00am however, you might have a problem whilst this is going on!There is a rooftop pool at second floor level which didn't seem to be very much used.

The hotel responded to my email, and when we arrived, we were placed in a room on the 15th floor, and the traffic noise was faint and definitely acceptable. However, the walls are a bit thin and you can clearly hear your neighbors if they are just a tad loud. Having just visited Tokyo, the room is very large in comparison.

There is also a small refrigerator and a microwave in the room which is very convenient if you buy food from the neighboring ABC stores. There is a safe in the room large enough to fit our iPads and valuables. The shower is spacious and water pressure good, with plenty of hot water. Gym is small with a treadmill, a glider, a stationary bike, and weights. It would be nice if there is more than one treadmill. Equipment all work fine. We didn't use the pool.

I was really excited to get to stay in beautiful Honolulu for five nights. Upon arrival after a ten hour flight which i managed to get no sleep the room was actually ready at 10am which was really amazing and much appreciated, the porter on duty took my bags to my room for me which was lovely, in fact the entire stay i found the porters to be really exceptional at their job. After a much needed rest i decided to unpack then go and explore, i found that the safe in the room was not working and the sign told me i had to obtain a piece from reception to make it work. I went down to reception and the lady told me that the safe was old and they no longer work. Unfortunately for me i was traveling with $7000 in Canadian money due to my move. I had booked activities with the concierge for each day i was there, some of which i was gone all day, this caused me much stress as i had to hide the money in my room and avoid my room being serviced daily due to not wanting anyone in there as my money was un-secure. It really affected my experience though it all worked out in the end. The hotel seems to do a lot of corporate trade and i found that whilst waiting for my tour bus on two mornings the lobby was full which was great for the hotel but left little to be desired with different cultures wearing hospital masks inside in fear of contracting or spreading diseases only to walk out the front of the hotel lift them off their face and spit on the side walk. Obviously this isn’t the hotels fault for bad manners, just a major turn off. On many good notes though the hotel is within walking distance to everything, The beach is a five minute walk away for those who are seeking to stay in cheaper accommodation but close to the main attractions. I walked and had dinner at beachside restaurants each night of my stay. The concierge I dealt with went above and beyond for me in booking and referring me to the best activities that Honolulu had to offer (I forget her name though I remember she was from Michigan).

Rooms are clean, quiet and fairly spacious. It's not on the beach, but is an easy less-than-ten-minute walk to the beach. There are plenty of dining options nearby, Outback Steakhouse, etc., and a couple of ABC stores for convenient food or other items.

On the whole, unless you have an overwhelming desire to be on the beach with an ocean view, this is a good place to stay that will save you $$ that can be spent on other things.

Hotel staff was very helpful providing tourist info (restaurants, shopping, etc...) and arranging return transportation to airport. Cons - one of the hotel's two elevators was out of service and apparently had been all summer, resulting in long waits. Our room had no balcony and window only opened a couple inches. Our first trip to Hawaii and we couldn't have a drink on the 'lanai'! The free breakfast at the attached restaurant is very Oriental with only a few western items.

The easy walk to Waikiki for sunrise was a bonus. The ‘bus’ was stopping right at the entrance but we had our own car, so didn’t avail it. Parking was $15… I guess the norm in Oahu… we always found parking space… so no problem with that…we always quickly unloaded our bags at the entrance, otherwise you’ll have to roll your bags from the parking lot to the hotel…they do their best to discourage parking even for a few seconds in their entrance but it is not an attractive proposition when you have to face busy days of sight seeing…..Their lobby is kept at freezing temperature… may be they can adjust the thermostat a few notches higher for customer comfort also saving themselves unnecessary wastage of electricity The free breakfast at the next door Chinese restaurant has had such bad reviews but we found their vegetarian options … fried rice, spring rolls, roasted potatoes and the roasted peanuts quite tasty... loved the pineapple as well. You could toast your slices of bread as well, though we never did. It was good ambience to sit by the glass windows and watch a couple of resident red breasted birds jump about in the small patch of green. the owner lady’s cheerfulness started off the day right for us…. All the spread was ready at 6.30 am when we walked in… commendable I would say. If they can put out some yogurt and juices, it’ll be great. May be they can also change the numbers they play… it became quite repetitive… esp the Hawaiian rain song… which we found ourselves humming after being forced to hear it umpteen times…Can’t really think of any negatives… may be the gift shop could have been open…it had attractive stuff but was always closed when we left and when we returned each dayWill totally recommend Ramada… we had a great stay … when one’s in Hawaii where’s the need for the frills of a resort hotel with its attendant exorbitant prices?

It's not a resort destination by any means. However you can go across the street to access the beach through the Hawaiian Hilton hotel complex. It's a short walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center. The rooms were clean and comfortable with microwave, fridge, and good sized TV with lots of channels. The one thing that's interesting is that they are the lay over hotel for Japan and China Airlines.

To reach the hotel entrance you walk along a narrow covered walkway that's about as attractive as the loading dock at Walmart. Restrooms for patrons of the malodorous Chinese restaurant add to the squalor. Had I not had a pre-paid reservation, I would have probably made a U-turn and looked elsewhere. But don't let first impressions matter. Despite being air conditioned to the same temperature as my refrigerator at home, the hotel lobby is rather comfortable and inviting. And the warmth of the staff more than compensates for the wasteful air conditioning. The elevators were speedy and my room was spacious, very clean and very comfortable. There are 14 rooms per floor and the lower numbered rooms are closer to the Chinese restaurant. The even numbered rooms face the rear and are quiet and pleasant. The bed was super comfortable and the safe, refrigerator and (unexpected) microwave were a big plus. The towels were thick and plentiful and the shower powerful. Free wired and wifi is now in all rooms and each room has a wifi router attached to the cable modem so you're assured of a strong signal, when there is one. The service is provided by Oceanic Time Warner and frequent brief outages are not uncommon. The fitness room was adequate and the coin laundry very good. The pool area was also quite pleasant and relaxing. The only real drawback to this hotel is the location. Ala Moana Blvd is probably the most pedestrian unfriendly street in Honolulu other than the H-1 Freeway. The bus towards Ala Moana Center and downtown stops right in front of the China Buffet. But to get the bus towards central Waikiki and Diamond Head, you have to either turn left and walk a good block to Ena Road / Kalia Road, cross there (where the signal disfavors pedestrians) and then walk along Kalia all the way past the Hilton to get to the bus stop. Alternatively you can turn right from the hotel and walk 1.5 blocks to Hobron Lane, cross and then back 0.5 block to the bus stop. There is a signalized intersection right near the hotel (Kahanamoku St) but it's designed for cars only - no pedestrian crossing allowed! In fact there was once a bus stop across the street from the hotel but it was removed as Honolulu seems to favor private cars over people and public transit nowadays. In any other country there would at least be a pedestrian overpass, but not here. There is an ABC store directly across the street from the hotel, but getting there can take 10 minutes given the lack of a pedestrian crossing. A better solution is to walk up to Ena Road, turn left, and you'll find a smaller ABC store there without crossing Ala Moana Blvd. Another recommended option is to exit the rear of the hotel onto Kaioo Dr., turn right and then just after the road curves there's a shortcut between two buildings to the Eaton Square Food Pantry supermarket. Look for the blue roof. So, all in all, this is a well run hotel offering good value. If you can deal with the pedestrian unfriendly location and don't mind frightening your guests by the sight and smell of the tawdry Chinese restaurant, this hotel is for you. Having stayed in a variety of hotels along Kuhio Ave., I would only choose this hotel again if I got a good rate.",USA,372,4.0

They are all rated 3 stars but one is better or worse that other. Out of all 4 hotels, Waikiki Marina Resort at 1777 Ala Moana Blvd is # 1 in terms of condition and price. The building is more that 47 yr old plus but the condition of the room is very good, if you look through the a/c vent hole then you you might be able to see the old dusty structure. The furniture and kitchen equipment are up to date. My room is on 23rd floor facing the street so I did hear quite a bit of street noise. Ramada Plaza Waikiki at 1830 Ala Moana Boulevard is #2. The room is much smaller and the condition of the room is OK, the price is higher than #1. The biggest problem is noise from next rooms. I can hear people talking and I can smell liquor through the locked door that connected to next room. My kid were frighten with all the cursing, screaming, and banging on the wall from throughout the night. I have to call security twice to settle the disturbances. I suppose next time if I smell heavy liquor in the hall way then that should be a big red flag to ask for room exchange. Aston At The Executive Centre Hotel at 1088 Bishop Street is # 3. the room and is spacious and stylus but very dusty smelling. Cabinet, wall paper, and capet are very old. Sheet and carpet had spots. Lot of dust and smoke buildup around the air vent. My room is on 27th floor and the view is very nice. The price on this one is highest of all. Best Western Plaza is # 4.

It is a little far from the beach and you do have to ride the bus to get to most places. If you walk then plan to walk pretty far, but that is why it is priced lower than the other hotels near the beach.Our experience with hotel staff was fine, except an encounter with the hotel concierge. She was polite and informative when we arrived and gave us information on some of the sites and tours. The next day when we told her we booked our tours online ourselves she became very rude and was pretty much done with us. We were really shocked at how rude she was and dismissive. We had no idea that she wanted us to book the tours through her or we probably would have, but that wasn't communicated to us. We took the brochures and figured out our schedule for the week and then started booking. Her behaviour was uncalled for and frankly put us off the hotel, but we were determined not to let it ruin our time. We avoided her the rest of the trip.Otherwise, we recommend the hotel. It was clean, the pool area was great (except the water is freezing cold!), and for the money it was a nice stay. The only other complaint was that there was a sewer smell outside the hotel just in front of the Chinese Buffet. It was there everyday and only in that area by the bus pick up. It would benefit the hotel to check into this and see what can be done because it is unfortunately a negative even though it isn't the fault of the hotel. The free breakfast was at the China Buffet out front and they did serve some American breakfast food. It was clean and they did a pretty good job of keeping up with the buffet.The internet service is not wireless in the rooms and it is a bit slow, but it worked fine once we figured out how to get on the system. I did call down to the main desk to ask questions about logging on and the person that answered said they were a temp and didn't know. Otherwise, we did receive our wake up call on time and had pizza delivered to the lobby and they called us when the driver arrived.Overall, it was a good experience and if you are on a budget then this hotel will serve your needs.

The lobby staff were helpful and friendly. We asked for some restaurant suggestions from the desk staff and found some excellent restaurants in the area as a result of their recommendations.My only negatives would be the cost of on-property parking and the restaurant. The parking cost is a little ridiculous at $20 per day. I understand the need to control parking in a dense urban area like this, but that is stupid expensive. It would be much more customer-friendly to give out a parking pass or other indication that you are a hotel guest and have a staff member walk the lot every couple of hours to ensure compliance.The hotel includes a free breakfast each morning. This is provided by the attached restaurant which is oriental cuisine. The food was good but was a bit lacking in variety especially for multi-day guests. They offer eggs, sausage, pancakes, toast, fresh pineapple, cereal (limited choices) and milk, and a few oriental items (wontons, etc.). It tastes fine and the staff is very friendly, it just gets a little repetitive if you stay more than a few days.","Orem, Utah",15,4.0

I knew this when I reserved my room, however I was under the impression that the restaurant would serve some traditional American breakfast items. It does not!

The Ramada is an older hotel (former Holiday Inn?) with no attached restaurants (other than an Asian buffet near the entrance). It was clean and, when I checked the Bed Bug Registry online, was one of few Honolulu hotels I checked with no registered incident reports. There were fresh flowers and orchids in common areas, and a small but attractive lobby. A concierge is on duty daily to help arrange tours as needed, the bellmen were friendly, and they had an enclosed room to store our bags while we waited for an evening flight out. The Wailana Coffee House (and bar) is just down the street on the corner for a Denny's-type breakfast, and IHOP is even closer. Coffee is available in the lobby in the mornings.

I also booked the rooms for my family who came from overseas. The hotel itself is undoubtly very good value for money. The beds are quite comfortable (not the pillows, I have to say I stayed at the Aqua Palms and had the best sleep ever there), nice tv, bathroom is small and the actual bathtub need renovation but overall the rooms are clean and nice.No balcony in our room which is not great but for the price one can leave without it. The swimming pool is big and cleaned everyday and there is a gym also.I did find that the customer service was great at times and poor in other occasions. For example, in one of the rooms that we booked the beds weren't made for 2 days in a row, I complained and the bed was then made.... next day bed wasn't made again... The excuse was that we left something on the bed and the staff isn't allowed to touch anything at all (not true in one of the occasions).I think given the fact that for 3 days we didn't receive the service, we should have been compensated but no, didn't happen.. it was just a sorry and thanks for your feedback even when I send the review through the survey that I was sent after the stay. On the other hand, when we arranged for the car space, we were told tht we were going to be given a lower discount than what I saw online and when I told the receptionist she was very kind to honour the discount I'd seen. So I pretty much think customer service here is a hit or miss. As with the location, I personally love the fact that it's just a short walk to Ala Moana mall, and a short walk to Waikiki and a bit of a longer walk to the Ala Moana Beach Park. I am not sure I'd go back there, purely because I had previously had such a great experience at the Aqua Palms in terms of customer service but great value for money and overall I would recommend it.","Sydney, Australia",8,3.0

I have booked Ramada Shanghai more than once because of the great experience we've had there.. Great value for money yet never compromise the quality of their rooms. So when i stumbled onto the hotel having a deal of about $109 per night incl breakfast, I immediately booked it for 3 nights.The hotel is along Ala Moana Blvd, which is abt 10min walk to the Ala Moana Center with lots of shops and also Ward Center just behind. You can take a bus to Waikiki for $2.50 per person but i will suggest taking a cab if you're not too tight. It costs around $7-$10. There are many shops but still not as lively as the main Waikiki area. Seriously, the breakfast is ok only if its complimentary, I wouldn't pay $7 for a buffet breakfast even with this quality. This place is full of chinese tour groups.. hardly any walk ins. But the good news is food is so readily available around the corner. There is a bar around the corner which serves breakfast for abt $4.. and then there is Macdonalds and ABC store which sells everything from microwavables, sandwich, spam musubi. The hotel has a microwave so it becomes so much more convenient. If you need to rent a car anytime during your stay.. there is National, Alamo, Enterprise within 3min walk at Discovery Bay Center. If you wanna save some money on parking, Red Lobster offers $7 for 10 hours.. so if you come back around 9ish and head out early, you'll save a bit instead of parking at the hotel.I got a king bed which was very spacious and there was a couch with a leg rest. The air con is by the window which can be quite irritating and the don't understand why they didnt make the curtain able to close fully. There is wifi at the lobby and internet cable in the room which runs at reasonable speed. But as another reviewer mentioned.. it'll be better if they had wifi in the room too. Sometimes for international travellers who have no laptop..being able to communicate back home via whatsapp serves as a big convenience. tried the wifi at the lobby though, pretty laggy.We booked shuttles from the hotel to the Waikele outlet and airport for $11/pax.. pretty reasonable. If you're going to Hawaii to enjoy beautiful beaches right outside your window, Ramada might not be able to offer that.Overall, Ramada has continued to impressed me and I will definitely be back the next time I visit hawaii or anywhere around the world.","Singapore, Singapore",73,4.0

Several reviews have mentioned a free breakfast. We were not offered one, but rather were given a coupon for a nearby Chinese buffet for about $7. My suggestion is to go across Ala Moana Blvd or around the corner to the East and go to an ABC Store. They have several good breakfast options including fresh fruit bowls and heat-up snack items at very reasonable prices. (Try the rice cake with Spam on it. It is surprisingly good and quite filling!) Back to the hotel, it was fine for our purposes. Our hotel was not our destination. Out of two elevators, only one was operational, and I got the impression that it is permanently that way.

(I always read the bad reviews first!)However, it's clean, the staff are friendly and everything worked as it should. It's very close to the GOOD end of Waikiki beach. It does appear to be one of the oldest in the area however, and the 'complete renovation in 2009' did not include new windows. We were at the back of the hotel so it wasn't a problem - and I'm a light sleeper.I fail to see how anyone can say it's 'difficult to find' - it's right on Ala Moana Boulevard and even has a sign that's visible from the street!The Chinese/American buffet breakfast was good, but got boring after 3 days - I hope that the hotel manage to persuade them to vary the selection. (I read Pattie Furtado's comment). Don't lose the scrambled eggs though; when fresh from the kitchen they were the best ever! Bottom line: I would stay here again. If you want a clean room, comfortable bed and a hot shower for a good price, this is the place. It's a 10 minute walk to the shore, so don't stay here if you want to be in a giant anonymous resort right on the beach or if you MUST have an ocean view!",Pinner,26,4.0

I was immediately impressed by visitors' comments on the Ramada Plaza. What impressed me even more, however, was the fact that the manager had the interest in, and made the time to, reply to comments that were both positive and negative in nature. This demonstrated a real commitment to meeting the needs of those travelers who stayed with them.I am happy to say that I was not proven wrong!From the moment of our late midnight arrival, when Keola - manning the front desk - took the time to track down our forgotten Rewards account number, and had it waiting for us in the morning - to the helpful concierge desk, to the comfort of our room (as promised, on a higher floor) through our easy check out - everything was smooth and easy. More importantly the staff were polite and helpful. I wish I could remember all the names - was it ""Griffen""? who had his name tattooed on his arm? Very helpful, always smiling- nice folks.There's not much I can add to the other positive comments about the hotel's location and proximately to the beach (which my wife thoroughly appreciated while I was in the classroom). And parking - if you are so inclined - is reasonable (though I'd really recommend trying to do without a car and using public trans. which is what I would do when if I return).Two minor quibbles: First, the internet. Yes, it's available, but not in your room unless you have an ethernet port/cable. This means that if you're traveling with an iPad, as I did, your access to the internet is restricted to the lobby and pool areas. Not a big deal. You're in Waikiki - you shouldn't be spending too much time on the web anyway! But I was maintaining a daily blog of our trip for family and friends, and making the daily pilgrimage to these two areas did get a little tiresome.Second, and this was more significant, was the continued ""software"" problems that took one of two elevators out of service. We were staying at the the Ramada from July 2 - 13, perhaps it's fixed now? I know that this problem had been posted for months. I also realize that the elevator ran intermittently when operated manually by a staff person. When there was only one elevator available it was a major annoyance, and frankly, something that guests should not have to deal with at a reasonably priced hotel of this calibre. The standard explanation is that a software update was required, and that the work was being done on the mainland. But frankly, this made little sense. More importantly, if one of two elevators is known to have problems that will take it out of service I would strongly suggest assigning staff elevator duty on a rotating basis - perhaps one hour shifts. Not pleasant, I know - but necessary. Thoughts?I just want to close by saying that I would very definitely stay at the Ramada again, and would recommend it highly. In fact, I recommended it to a colleague while in Waikiki, and he left another hotel he was staying in to move over to the Ramada and was equally impressed.Bottom line: book it! Unless you have enough money, and the desire, to bath yourself in the lap of luxury at one of the ""over-the-top"" Waikiki resorts (which ironically, are about as un-Hawaiian as you can get) stay at the Ramada. The money you save could be better spent on the dinner, or snorkeling trip, or luau you've always dreamed about.Practice aloha!",NH / VT,24,4.0

I don't like the Honolulu/Waikiki area, it's much too congested and you cannot see the beauty of Hawaii. But we had a 3 night stint here on our way to Kauai, so it served it's purpose. The hotel is very clean, the beds were comfortable, and it felt very safe. Staff was very helpful. The worst part was the breakfast. They have made arrangements with a Chinese food buffet restaurant next door for breakfast for their guests. This restaurant has a combo of American breakfast foods and really bad Chinese food. It's kind of grungy and the steam tables definitely do not keep the food warm. The eggs, sausage, potatoes, and pancakes were good, but, as I said, they were luke warm at best. You can save money by eating here, but I preferred the iHop for a cheap breakfast just a few doors down from this buffet. This is really the only negative about this hotel.If you are staying on Oahu, I'd suggest another part of the island. The west side, near Disney's Aulani Resort and Paradise Cove Luau is gorgeous and much more remote and calm. You'll pay a bit more, but you'll be out of the rat race and you'll be able to see the true beauty of this island, unlike in Honolulu/Waikiki.","Detroit, Michigan, United States",56,4.0

Stop for TheBus and the 'trolley' is right outside the door, so very handy if you don't want to walk!

I only ate the breakfast once but it mostly catered to the Chinese guests with a large assortment of Chinese foods. Don't get me wrong, I love Chinese food, just not for breakfast. Add in the fact that the Western selections (eggs, sausages, pancakes) were often cold-ish, didn't help the situation any.

The laundry room was well set up and the washers and dryers worked well. I love the fact that all the rooms were non smoking. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've been in any hotel. The staff were very helpful about giving directions and suggesting places to eat etc. It was a very satisfying experience. We inadvertently locked ourselves out and they were super nice about making us a new door key. Would highly recommend this hotel.","Austin, Texas, United States",0,5.0

I like to travel first class. I like resorts with lots of amenities. I expect great service (I work in the hospitality industry). This visit to Hawaii was a little different. We had just booked and paid for a cruise to Vancouver from San Diego and an additional 4 nights in Vancouver. That was going to be our Summer vacation. Then....it happened. Our favorite airline emailed us about a killer deal on airfare to Oahu and we could not resist. We booked it right away and 2 weeks after we returned from Canada, we were on a flight to Hawaii without a lot of extra vacation money. This leads us to Champagne tastes and a beer budget. I cringed as I read the reviews of hotels in our budget range in Waikiki. People claiming mold, mildew, awful service, theft etc. Then I found the Ramada Plaza Waikiki and nervously booked and paid for 6 nights. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a bellman that helped us unload our bags and get them to our room! (hello, five star service!). Parking was a bit tight, but it worked. I was a bit bothered that they raised the parking rate on June 1st and we checked in on the 3rd and there was no mention of the increase on the website. The room was clean and looked out to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV). The walls were solid (even with the adjoining room, ugh) and we never heard any outside noise even though the hotel was full. The staff was friendly and the cleaning staff was always on their game. As a former housekeeping manager, I know where to look for ""missed"" cleaning spots and they passed my entire room check. They were very generous with towels to take to the beach. They gave us a crib to use for free. I was beyond pleased with the service we received while staying there. It is a great location near Ala Moana and HHV. When we wanted the resort atmosphere we headed over to the HHV and enjoyed a cocktail or meal. The Ramada does have a pool, but we are a DoD family, so we used to pool at Hale Koa for free, so I cannot comment on that.Seriously, if you have champagne tastes and a beer budget for your trip to Waikiki, I would suggest this hotel. The only (sort of) bummer was that the traffic light almost directly in front of the hotel does not allow pedestrians to cross so it is a little bit of a walk to get across the street to the HHV or the harbor.Thank you Ramada staff for making our budget vacation feel a lot more luxurious!",Bahrain,46,5.0

The furnishings were as pictured on the web site with large flat screens TVs and very comfortable beds. All our rooms were clean and fresh, honestly, I felt like I was at a Marriott Courtyard. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The laundry room on the second floor was very clean and brightly lit. The parking fee was much less than other Honolulu hotels I looked at. The lot is a little small, but they always had a parking space saved for me. I had a Ford Edge SUV and had no problem parking it. Walking to the beach is no problem for a normal healthy person, however, it was about as far as my 74 year old mother-in-law with a bad knee could walk.On the evening of day 3 one of the two elevators went out of order. The elevator repair truck was in the parking lot the next morning, later that day the doorman told me a circuit board went out and a new one was having to be made in Texas. The out of order elevator actually worked but someone had to stay with it and push one of the floor buttons to get it to go. During a busy period I noticed one of the staff acted as an old fashion elevator operator taking people to their respective floors. We were on the 16th floor and even with only one elevator working we never waited more than 10 minutes for an elevator. Usually the wait was only a few minutes, actually I was impressed how fast that one elevator was. We had such a fantastic stay at the Ramada Plaza and Waikiki Beach, I highly recommend it.

We used Mark at Hawaii23 Transportation 1-888-598-5751) and he was great. Only $23 each way. They were waiting for us when we arrived and on time for our departure. Check-in was quick and after settling in we walked around the Hitlon, along the beach and through the park before selecting a place for dinner. The Ramada is well situated - close to the Hilton Hawaiian VIllage, close to the beach, close to Ala Moana mall and close to small bars and restaurants. The pool is above ground floor so you have privacy from foot traffic. The beds were comfortable, the sheets like silk and the bathroom had everything you might need. We had planned to stay at the pool the next morning but the weather was iffy so we walked to the mall instead and had lunch. I always struggle to find a good place to stay when on a layover.

Ten minutes stroll to the Ala Moana Shopping Mall; 15-20 minutes stroll to the nice shopping area and beaches of Waikiki. (3) Nice, comfortable, professional hotel. Nothing grand or fancy, but good value and service, and a friendly feel to it. The room has a fridge, ironing board & iron, and big screen TV. There's wired internet for those who like cables. This hotel is the Hawaii base for flight attendants on several airlines, and I'll very happily stay here again next time I'm in Honolulu.Things that could be improved:(1) They forgot to do my room after the first night. When I queried this, they said it was because the ""do not disturb"" sign had been on the door all day -- but it hadn't been (it was removed at lunchtime, and I was told the staff clean rooms till 6pm). This seems to have been an oversight and the room was done properly all other days. (2) Free wifi was only in the lobby. There was no wifi access in the rooms.

They didnt have a king room for us but the front desk staff was very pleasent and told us we could move the two doubles together which actually worked well we had a super large bed! haha - but again staff was super pleasant, the pool was the only downfall we saw and it wasnt a total downfall because who goes to hawaii to sit in a pool at the hotel when u have some of the most beautiful beaches in the world!! The Coffee House on the Corner is Delicous and decent prices, they are also open 24hours! , Todai is a japanese buffet right down the street that is also very good! and if u go down Ala Moana just a mile or so and you will be right infront of Ala Moana Beach Park & the mall is right there also, which has some good resturants and shopping.

Everything about it was awesome! I reserved my room and paid for it 6 months in advance, so I was able to lock in a $99 a night rate for a stay the first week of June. Our room had a refrigerator with a small freezer in it - this came in handy as we went to Food Pantry across the street and bought cereal, milk and sandwich makings so we could make our own breakfast and lunch every day. You are right next the Wailana Coffee House, which has a great variety of food and is very affordable compared to most other restaurants around (plus it's open 24 hours). The wait staff there is very attentive. Highly recommend this restaurant.The staff at the Ramada were extremely helpful with everything, especially Pam at the Concierge desk. She really knows her stuff! We did activities every day, and she was able to recommend some great suggestions, transportation, and restaurant options. She is warm and genuine, and made me definitely want to return to the Ramada for future trips. Lisa was also very helpful at the concierge desk.The room was clean and quiet. Our view was just of a dirt field, a parking lot and a bunch of other hotels, but we didn't care, as we were just using it as a place to sleep. There is a 24-hour laundry room (washer and dryer are $1.50 each), and a small fitness center (that needs a fan!).The only bad thing was the cold lobby... it was windy with some rain during our stay, so the A/C didn't need to be cranked so high in the lobby.

Fitness center was more than most hotels offer. It is the basics, but kept up nicely, not dirty or worn out. I could easily walk the 5 minutes to the conference center.

While at the hotel, you can take a right and hit the shops (literally 1 block then continues from there) or take a left and walk two blocks to the trolley stop.

The price was great. The location we thought was fine because we wanted to shop at Ala Moana and, in the other direction, we knew Waikiki was only a short walk away. We just worried that if we booked something so much cheaper than the Hyatt it might not be very nice.On arrival we were still unsure. The first room we went into was on a low floor and seemed very noisy (traffic) so we asked to change. We were given a higher floor which was still a bit noisy but with the air con on the traffic was drowned out.Very quickly, though, we settled in and decided this hotel was actually an excellent choice. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was not brand new but worked perfectly well and everything was clean.I really liked the laundry located right next to the pool which was right next to the gym, so you could wait for your clothes to wash/dry without wasting time or having to leave them there and go away. We enjoyed lying by the pool as did a few other guests.As mentioned the hotel's an easy walk to Ala Moana shopping mall which we loved. We also actually walked all the way across Waikiki, up to the top of Diamond Head and back to the Ramada. I wouldn't recommend this, though, unless you're on a crazy fitness drive like we were.A couple of other recommendations: go to the Wailana coffee lounge for breakfast. Old school American type diner which we (as foreigners) found kind of charming. We liked the i-Hop too! Both these restaurants are on the street outside the hotel (turn left and walk a few metres). Also, there's a car hire place really close to this hotel where we picked up a vehicle for the day and drove up to the North Shore and back via the pineapple plantation.

What do you expect? if you want to have a place to stay right in the heart of Waikiki yet cheap and clean you can not get it from Sheraton or five star hotel. Who would want the hotel to be a part of your vacation? You do not want the hotel to ruin your vacation but it does not need to be extra special. They provide free internet, free ammenities. Internet is super fast. There is a 15 dollars parking fee but you go to other hotels where you do not pay for parking fee but yet you will have to pay for other stuff which turn out to be the same. The one trick people do not bring up on here is from this location, it is very easy to drive your car around town which is a big plus. It is easy to get in and out of the hotel which I can not say for other hotels. For us, a family of two and a small kid, the room provide two full beds which is more than enough. If I come back to Hawaii which I will, I will stay at this location again. if you are rich and wanted to be treated special stay at the big hotel and pay more. This hotel is not for the super rich who want wine service to their rooms but it is for people who want to go around the island during the day and go shopping at night in the waikiki area and then come back to nice comfortable beds and friendly nice staff. Some people ask for Kids activities inside a hotel. Why do you want to kid activities inside a hotel when you are on vacation in Hawaii??????????This hotel is across from the Hilton and you can just walk your kids over there and see all the Koi fish and just walk down the beach.","Garland, Texas",7,5.0

The management was extremely accommodating to us, as we arrived early from Kauai and they allowed us to check in when we got there, before 12:00!

The hotel is quite old but then again, most hotels and buildings in this area are so I'm not sure what I was expecting. The room was a good size and it had a safe and mini fridge which is a good feature. We were given a low level room with a terrible view of the back parking lot but to be honest, I didn't really care. We did ask for a late check out due to the fact that my son wasn't feeling well and our flight didn't leave until 11 pm. We were 'allowed' to stay for an extra 2 hours until 2 pm. The only think I didn't really like is that the room didn't have any 'on demand' movies.

It used to be the Holiday Inn and was bought out and renovated over the past 18 months.The prices are good, and if you can get one of the Jnr suites located on the PH (penthouse) level do so. The 2 bed suite on the side away from Ala Moana is quieter- as the road is always patched with metal grating so you can hear cars driving over the metal at night, the other side of the building is MUCH better. The staff are great, my only complaint- THEY DO NOT HAVE BOTTLE OPENERS in the rooms- how weird is that and reception suggested I buy one or come down stairs and they will open bottles- it's just odd.The beds are great ,pillows comfortable, pool usually empty because the beaches are so close- so if you don't like salt sand and crowds you could have a pool to yourself.There is a fantastic Indian restaurant 1 minutes walk away, an ABC store for milk etc for your rooms kitchen, and of course the Ala Moana Shopping centre is 5 minutes walk. If you need to mail postcards, there is a US mail box on the corner near the back entrance to the hotel.The rooms are super clean, and the JNR Suites have decent balcony's with views (but not of the beach).

After reading the reviews (quite a few written by people in Honolulu/Waikiki which should have rung a bell) I expected a hotel that was above the standard expected of a Ramada Plaza/Holiday Inn Express/Marriott Courtyard.Instead I got my least enjoyable stay for a long time.Climbing out of a taxi at the end of a 20+hr journey, the last thing you need is inefficient front desk staff. That is what we got. The issue was simply a Visa card that the night desk staff didn't recognise, and instead of running the card to get pre-authorisation, they simply dug their heals in and said they didn't recognise the card. To resolve the situation I had to resort to saying that I would simply go and book in to the Hilton across the road and take the issue up with the manager the next morning. Hey presto! They ran the card and it worked. Grrrrrrr.The ""restaurant"" for the hotel is a chinese buffet which is at the front of the property. Our rate included breakfast. This was a chinese style buffet breakfast, which seemed to cater for coach groups of Chinese and Korean tourists. Coffee and tea was not included! If you wanted coffee without paying, you had to walk back outside and into the lobby of the hotel and get coffee from the coffee pots there! For most people Breakfast is Coffee - I certainly will forgive a lot if my first cup of coffee is a good cup.The rooms were nothing special, normal size and as clean as you would expect for this level of brand. My room didn't appear to have been upgraded recently. It was a high floor but all I got for that was a view of the high floors of the surrounding tower blocks, and a slight separation from the main road (6 lanes) which goes straight past the front of the hotel. In addition my room was next to the lift, which annoyingly makes an alarm at every floor as it moves up and down the lift shaft.The hotel asked for my positive Trip Advisor Report - so here it is and I have been generous, as the hotel was by far the worst element of a 36hr stopover in Hawaii. I doubt I will use Ramada Plaza as a brand again - I certainly will not stay at this hotel again and having looked at some other hotels as I walked around Waikiki, I would book the Holiday Inn Express Waikiki (genuinely renovated), the Best Western Waikiki or one of the Hiltons, all in roughly the same price bracket.","Fredericton, Canada",143,2.0

The cleaning crew was super nice, and fun to talk to. : ) The only problem with the room was the location of the chairs.

It is also a 10-15 minute walk to the Ala Moana shopping center which has tons to offer. The room was clean and the staff friendly. If you are looking for a place to lay your head and can get a good price, this Ramada is just fine. The cons: The two computers in the lobby that have internet access are very slow. Don't plan on doing anything more intensive than checking email and allow about 10 minutes just to open up yahoo mail. The fitness room consists of one treadmill, one bike and one elliptical plus some free weights. You're better off taking a jog in Ala Moana park or along the Ala Wai canal. Now, I've stayed in inexpensive hotels in Hawaii before (Castle Ocean Resort) and they all had a doorman that could get you a taxi to the airport really quickly. When I checked out of here and asked for a cab to the airport (thinking it would be fairly easy) the guy at the front desk asked me if I had already phoned for one. He then had to phone for one for me - I think I could have just walked out and flagged one down easier. I cannot recommend this place for first time visitors to Hawaii. If it's your first time, you would be well served to pay a little extra to get a balcony and someplace that makes you feel like you're actually in Hawaii. While it's true that you are not in Hawaii to spend time in your room, it would be nice to have a place with a balcony or some type of view or bar or garden or entertainment to come back to after a long day of sightseeing.

But this is Honolulu, so that's just par for the course. You pay it and don't complain. (You do have permission to get irritated when you STILL have trouble parking thanks to the attached restaurant - though, again: Welcome To Honolulu. ;) )(2) The high-speed wireless internet didn't work at all from our room, even plugging it in via Ethernet. You can get a wireless signal from your laptop from the lobby, though.(3) No oceanview, although (a) you get what you pay for, and (b) there's a nice city view.(4) Rooms are your standard-size American hotel room. In other words: cramped, if you've packed for over a week for the next leg of your trip to Maui. ;)(5) And that's about all the Cons I can think of.Overall, a nice experience for a quick pass-through on O'ahu if you're ultimately going to stay most of your time on one of the Neighbor Islands.

We had a mini fridge to keep our drinks and snacks, which was really nice. A microwave would have been nice to have, but not having one certainly wasn’t a deal breaker. The room wasn’t super huge, but it wasn't tiny like a cruise ship cabin either. The staff was always friendly and accommodating. We did decide to rent a car during our stay, which meant we had to pay $15 per day for parking, but I suppose parking fees are standard in big cities. We got the 16th floor (the only floor higher was the penthouse level). Our room faced Ana Moana Blvd - I don't believe there are any rooms with an ocean view in this hotel.

I was also told by a staff memeber that they are currently upgrading the Fitness Center, Conference Room, and other surrounding areas. I cant wait to see the upgrades done when I return in June. Finally, If you are a repeat guest of this hotel, you may wnat to try contacting the hotel directly to make a reservation. The agent there offered me a very good deal not advertised on the web or through Priority Club.","Kaneohe, Hawaii",21,4.0

Whilst the rooms are on the smaller side, the new fitouts of the room bring a more modern and much needed update to the older/drab look i found last year. Things such as the aircondiitoning, tv and bathrooms are still from the original rooms and so bring down the comfort a little.The service from the staff of this hotel is generally on par with what you would expect to find from a Holiday Inn.Rates were a little on the higher side compared to other hotels around Honolulu (i stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Wave, see review). Its location is a bit further from most things, within walking distance from Ala Moana shopping centre, but probably too far to walk from the main waikiki tourist area/beach. The benefits of this however, is a much quieter location. Ihop, maccas, starbucks and abc stores nearby.There are no powerpoints located near the internet connection for laptops/mobiles etc, so a bit inconventient to hook your computer up.Would stay here again if the rates are cheap next time and because of the added bonus of priority club etc, but there are others such as the Wave that have bigger rooms and a more central location for similar or less.","Sydney, Australia",26,4.0

We were facing Ala Moana.I'm not sure what the bad or mediocre reviews are about for this hotel. It's a perfectly acceptable Waikiki high-rise and we thought a great value for the price. The room we were in had obviously relatively recently been refurbished. The bed was a bit firm but comfortable enough. The bathroom is small, but that's due to the fact that the building is obviously older. We found the whole room well maintained. We never had any issues with waiting for the elevators while going up or down, which was surprising given other experiences at older properties in Waikiki and given that we were on such a high floor. The hotel isn't on the beach (but come on -- for the rates on offer, would you really expect it to be??) but it's a quick stroll to get there. There is decent shopping nearby, and a 24 hour coffee shop for quick cheap eats. In addition there is a great Thai restaurant up the street (Singha). For the price we paid I was actually pleasantly surprised. We would definitely consider staying here again when we're in Honolulu and want to be in Waikiki, but don't want to pay 4 times as much to be ""on the beach"".","San Jose, California",85,4.0

Yes, the rooms are clean, but they are also small. It is not as close to the beach as the state, I believe it is because the path to the beach is blocked by a new hotel being built. The atmosphere is one of a city hotel, no paradise feel. No lounge or restaurant, unless you count the lousy Chinese Buffet connected to the hotel. The bed was uncomfortable, the pool was small and uninviting and the staff was mediocre at best. I have no complaints about the service, however, it is definately no frills all around. This was my first trip to Hawaii and I would recommend trying to stay on Kalakaua Blvd, this is the main drag near the beach. Ala Moana connects to it and the hotel is practically on the corner, however this is not the end to be on. I consider this a trial trip and next time will definately spend the extra money to stay on or closer to the beach. I have stayed at many Holiday Inns and this one is substandard. My husband travels quite a bit and is priority club for this chain, he commented that he has had better stays at Holiday Inn Express. If you do stay here, just plan on sleeping(if you like a rock hard mattress) and showering in the room only! With my husband at the desk checking email, I had to climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room!! All of this and no balcony either.

There is a nice beach across the street at the Hilton Hawaiian Village which also has free fireworks on Friday nights. I think most of the other reviews are pretty spot on about this hotel. The rooms are a bit dated, but do have refrigerators which is nice. The staff is very friendly and helpful. My AC was not loud and blocked out some of the street noise. There are two computers for guests in the lobby, but are busy most of the time. There is also an Asian restaurant at the hotel serving all day. It is buffet only.

There is no restaurant on the premises. The staff is friendly and accomodating (they held our luggage in the back on the day we arrived early, and the day we checked out and then went sightseeing.) The rooms are basic, but clean. Ours had a refridgerator. The A/C unit was kind of loud (not unusual for this category of room.) We had a room that faced the street (Ala Moana Blvd) which added to the noise level at night. (Tip: Try to get a room that faces the back of the hotel. This might cut down on the noise.) The hotel has a pool, but we did not use it.In addition to the restaurants on Ala Moana Blvd, there are restaurants and shopping in the Hilton complex across the street. There is also an ABC (convenience) store there where you can buy an OK breakfast or lunch and sit at outdoor tables next to the pool. We weren't shy about this, and no one ever chased us away for not buying the outdoor cafe food.One last observation: pilots and flight attendants from China and Japan airlines were staying in the Holiday Inn while we were there.

The rooms are average, but I couldn't find a free wireless signal for my PDA...there was only a wired option in the room. :(","Denver, Colorado",32,4.0

If you want a place to have a week long Waikiki vacation, forget it unless you are broke and need this price. If you have money and really want to stay here, get one of the two penthouse rooms. We booked online at the Holiday Inn web site and got a great price per night, pre-paid. So what I'm writing below is not great, but the price for being near Waikiki was great. Next time we will trade this location for higher prices.It's near Waikiki, not in Waikiki proper. You are at the very very end of Waikiki, across the street. You can't cross the street because it is fenced down the middle. You have to walk to get around it, then go through another hotel property to find the beach. Watch out while crossing six and four lanes of traffic on your beach journey. This takes about 20 minutes each way. Bring a cart/daypack for anything that you want to take instead of carrying it in the hot sun. Unless you go to the lagoon next to the other hotel, you will have to walk very far to the actual Waikiki beach.Some of the Holiday Inn staff were great, and some of them could have cared less. We called from the room about pool towels. We were told that they were in the workout room next to the pool. Kids went into the pool, I went over to get towels. No towels. I called from the workout room and was told that I had to now go down to the main floor and get them from the front desk. So I went there soaked, in the elevator and into the front lobby.Don't use the laundry room to dry your swimsuits and beach towels. There is no place to sit and watch your stuff and no room to stand. Most people stood outside in the hallway watching others go to their rooms.The rooms are small, really small. You have about 2 feet around the ends of the beds to walk, and about 3 feet on the far side where the table/window/lanai is. The pictures on the web were taken with a fisheye lens. The living area with two beds is about 12x18 feet. That holds two double beds, a lamp table, a desk, a dresser and a table with two chairs. We all had to stand up to move someone from one side to the other.The bathrooms have no fans. If more than two of you take showers, be ready to breathe humid bathroom air until it soaks into the bedroom area. You can also imagine what other smells (trying to keep this clean yet real) are also NOT going to leave the bathroom and surround you in the bedroom area. Parking after 6pm is not good. There are about 30 parking spaces for 199 rooms. That's 30 spaces for parking AFTER the resturaunt closes. Otherwise it's about 18 spaces, which are usually all filled. This is not a joke. We learned the hard way to show up early to park and then walk for the rest of the night.As of 2/05 they have highspeed internet, for $20. Local calls are a $1.","Waikiki, Hawaii",252,3.0

Pool was small and on the first floor above the reception and was in shadow for much of the day, as a result there were only one or two people using it. Would we stay here again? No, it was reasonably cheap for Waikiki, but we felt the lack of balcony, small concrete pool area and location let this hotel down. I have also stayed at the Royal Garden which we prefer.

The Holiday Inn met all our expectations and more.First, we were very happy to see how easy it was toget to the registration desk with all our luggage.(The night before the cruise we stayed at a more pricey hotel and that was a horrible experience.} The people here were very friendly and helpful. They even have a small area to buy tickets to site seeing and activity places. All the help was friendly and helpful.Our room was very nice with a king size bed. There was a lot of storage space for your items. There was a refrigerator, safe, ironing board and iron, and coffee pot. The shower had plenty of water pressure. The room was clean and kept clean while we were there. Although our room was near garbage trucks and a construction business, it was still very quiet. This was very important to me as I am a light sleeper. The view out the window was terrible, but that was not important to me. I could have changed rooms if I wanted to like my sister did, but I was quite happy where we stayed as I just wanted to sleep there.As others mentioned there is a resturant right below the hotel that has meal buffets. The food is good and the price is cheaper than at home. But there are even better resturants just a short walk away. Also the international market place is just a short walk away. Although the hotel is not on the beach, the beach is very close. We mostly walked to the one at the military hotel. It was very nice. Also there are many ABC stores nearby.(like a Turkey-Hill or 7 -11) We bought soda there to take to our room. Also we bought equipment to go snorkeling there. They have the best prices.WE got our reservation for our hotel room way ahead on the internet. We payed 87.50 per night plus taxes. We thought there may be problems when we got there getting our room on the internet.But there were done. We didn't even have to show anything they were already expecting us and could not have been nicer. In fact we were surprised to find out that we now belonged to the priority club for booking this way. That gave us free coffee and newspapers in our room everyday. Also it gave us automatic right to late check out. That was real nice since our flight home was in the evening. Also they put our luggage in a locked room for us until it was time to leave. When we departed for the airport a shuttle bus just drove up under their carport to pick us up. (We paid ahead for round trip ticket to airport) My sister and her husband also stayed at this hotelwhile we did and they were very pleased also.The only negative thing they thought was that the parking was limited, but they always found a spot for their rental car.I think one of the best features of the hotel is it's ideal location.I would recommend this hotel to all except those who prefer to have a luxery one. If I ever get to Hawaii again, I would stay there again.

We preferred going to the coffee shop around the corner to eat (I think its called Wailana Coffee Shop). Also a great value at $6.00 per meal. Who says Hawaii can't be affordable? We chose not to stay in a resort on the beach because we didn't plan on spending a lot of time on Waikiki beach during the day. We had a lot of site seeing to do (Pearl Harbor, USS Missouri, Diamond Head, etc.). After site seeing during the day, we would walk to the resorts on the beach and have cocktails and watch the sunset. The Royal Hawaiin and Halekelani make the best Mai Tais. For those of you who stay at Holiday Inns frequently, you are used to a good hair dryer in the room. For this hotel stay, bring your hair dryer. The one in the bathroom acts like a reverse vacuum cleaner and looks to be very old. Other than that, great hotel.","Denver, Colorado",35,5.0

Tucked off in quiet seclusion across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village, it provides the same convenience as larger hotels for about $100/night. Parking is $6/day - another bargain. There's a pool, a great exercise facility, and the China Buffet Restaurant is open very late. But best of all, this is where the flight attendants for China Airlines stay during layovers. Nothing more need be said.","San Diego, CA",15,5.0
