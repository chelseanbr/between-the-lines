The elevator was really slow, we took the stairs most of the time (10th floor). The hotel is at a very good location, near Waikiki and there are many restaurants and shops around. Staff is kind and helpful. We felt scammed with our bill because it didn't match the price stated in our booking... They charge you one extra night, but don't worry it's just 160 dollars! We were not told we had to pay to use the parking either. However, we did know we had to pay a daily ammenity fee, I still wonder what ammenities we paid for... I hope it wasn't for the use of the swimming pool which was really small and we didn't use. We had other options to stay at and if we had known all these aspects we wouldn't have chosen Aqua Palms.

There is so many accommodation options to chose from in Waikiki but this little gem will have us coming back to stay every time! It may not be the most newest looking accommodation but it certainly isn’t the oldest; we didn’t come to Hawaii to look at the walls. The hotel is a quick walk to the beach, Main Street and Ala Moana shopping centre. The beds were very comfy and spacious for our family of 4. The shuttle service to the shopping centre was very welcomed and ihop next to the entrance was a great spot to eat. The managers drinks and nibbles on Wednesday afternoons with beautiful live music was such a treat that I’m not sure a bigger or fancier hotel would be able to capture the intimacy of such an event that made us feel part of the family. The highlight of our stay here was the concierge Charla! Charla helped us book activities for the duration of our stay and really catered to our families needs! Her friendliness, expert knowledge and professionalism is an asset to the Expedia group.

The only real drawback for me was the disruptive street noise and the loud air conditioning system. I turned the AC off at night, which helped, but street noise was something I couldn't do anything about, I was on a lower floor in a room over looking Ala Moana Blvd., so those staying on the other side of the hall or higher up might not have been as impacted by noise as I was. Having said that, I'd stay there again, but I'd be more sensitive to my room location and request a room change if the noise was again an issue.","Keaau, Hawaii",13,4.0

Overall the facility is well maintained and we were very comfortable whether in the lobby, our hotel room or traversing the hallways. This hotel is clearly ""old Hawaii"" but nothing felt broken, overly worn out or so outdated that it was distracting. In fact I was very please with the look and feel of the spaces we were in during our stay. The location is great! No, it's not right on the beach but you get a great value and you're just across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village with all the touristy shops, eats and beach. One of the highlights was the friendly and helpful staff. We were well taken care of and always had quick answers to questions. They have beach towels and chairs that you can checkout with no charge so it makes a day at the beach simple and care free.The one thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is that in some places around the edges you could see some significant damage from usage. An example of this is all the elevator door frames and even the wall in the lobby elevator hallways had many scuff marks and even gouges. The interior of the elevators themselves were updated but really ugly. This however is a small thing and for the savings in cost we would absolutely stay at this hotel again!","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",1,4.0

Mismanagement of Holiday demands seems to be the culprit here. Check-in was hectic and delayed owing to a crowded reception area and long lines. We were forced to stand in line twice because no rooms were ready for us by 2 PM when we arrived from the airport. The first time, I filled out paperwork and signed for the room. The second time, after we had taken lunch while waiting for the room to be prepped, we had to stand in line again in order to get the room key. 30 minutes into our official stay, while attempting to enjoy a private moment, my wife and I were interrupted by housekeeping. No knock was heard; they simply opened the door and began to enter the hallway before quickly turning back. Both staff members seemed apologetic when I dressed myself in a towel and ducked outside the room to confront them. Their explanation was that they were checking to see whether or not the room was yet occupied. Communication between reception and housekeeping/service seems to be poor. Another example of this was the following afternoon, when we attempted to use the safe to store our computers. Upon finding that it was malfunctioning, we called for assistance. We were told to expect assistance in 5-10 minutes. After waiting 15 minutes, we left for our tour and spent the afternoon preoccupied with the fact that both of our laptops and other valuables were unsecured. Nothing was missing upon our return, but that is not the point.Everything about this place feels small and cramped. The lobby is small and very easily gets crowded. The elevator platform is in a tiny halfway, where it is nearly impossible for parties with luggage - simultaneously checking in and checking out - to move past each other. The room was tiny, but everything functioned properly except for the safe. The pool/deck area is tiny, busy and crowded. A barbecue area in the corner is sufficient for one medium-sized party or family at a time. The pool itself is more of an L-shaped in-ground tub. It was fully commandeered by 5-6 unsupervised kids entering, exiting, and chasing and splashing each other. Most available deck furniture was not out of splash range. The view from our balcony was away from the ocean, even though we payed an ocean-view rate. Our window faced the mountains and other resort/condominium towers. If we avoided looking down, we could avoid seeing unsightly disposal & personal patio/storage areas associated with at least three residential structures. As of the second evening of our stay, nobody has followed up with us about our safe or touched base with us about yesterday's incident. We are looking forward to spending the rest of our week at another establishment at the other end of Waikiki. ","San Francisco, California",5,2.0

First the good is on-site parking, nice somewhat updated rooms with comfortable beds, and close to Waikiki Beach and shopping. The biggest not-so good... the noise from Ala Moana Blvd, and the pool area, was relenting. So, if you are in an even numbered room giving you a filtered view of the water and Diamond Head, you will get the traffic and pool noise. Consider a room facing away from the street or bring ear plugs if noise bothers you. I tried to turn the fan to run continuously, but it would shut down to automatic after some time. Also not all rooms have balconies. I had room 708 with sliding balcony doors and a concrete pillar right in the middle. Rooms on either side of me had a nice sized furnished balcony with good access.There were a few other annoyances. The cold tap water is warm. There was a small pitcher in the mini-fridge to fill with water, to make cold tap water available. The shower water pressure is a fine mist at most. While the room received some furnishing updates, the night stands desk and lamps looked pretty beat up. The lamp shades were brown and cracked but did work. Outlets were at a minimum.

We had to get our stored things out of a storage facility and send them off island and needed a nearby 'staging' location. We live on Oahu. If this hotel had been priced cheaper, I would probably have given a 4 star rating, because the staff is friendly and helpful and it is well-located. However, at $140 a day, I would have expected more meticulous cleaning - the windows had previous-occupant kiss marks on the windows and the bathroom mirrors were not cleaned consistently. I have paid more in Waikiki and gotten more, so at this price, if I were coming to Hawaii for a vacation and expected to be out all day, paying more might not make sense. Expecting more at this price is the problem. I guess I had the same feeling I have when I get a coffee at a restaurant and there is lipstick already on the cup. Seems they're just not careful and maybe a little run down. I noted that the tub had been resurfaced and the surface was peeling (though the water pressure and temperature were amazing!), the coffee maker left a mildewy taste to the coffee, the microwave had dark stains that looked like mold (though I tried to clean it and it seemed embedded, not surface) and the beds sometimes looked like a kid had made them, e.g., with lumpy sheets under the blanket. A couple of nights I was awoken by loud noises from the room next door and somebody smoking pakalolo on the next-door lanai, but that isn't the hotel's fault, I guess. I love Hawaii and I and most visitors are delighted to get a chance to be here, so if you think these observations are picky, look at the good stuff - fresh apples on the reception desk for free, a water and coffee station in the reception area, a manager's night with free snacks and music and free DVDs and, as I said, lovely staff.","Honolulu, Hawaii",3,3.0

We stayed a week at the Aqua Palms. Hotel staff responded quickly every time we called for help, whether it was extra towels or fixing something in the room. They fixed a slow running bath drain and a toilet issue both efficiently and completely to our satisfaction. They gave us a tutorial on how to use the room safe as there were no instructions and we couldn’t figure it out.  We had a free movie rental and couldn’t get it to play on the PlayStation in the room. Maintenance came and literally took the tv off the wall to get the wires hooked up correctly and working. Every single person on staff was warm, friendly and helpful. There was a basket of free apples in the lobby every day at the front desk. They had a dispenser on the wall by the front desk filled with free reef-friendly sunscreen. We rubbed some on every day and it worked great. We got the ‘free’ breakfast package. You get to eat at the IHOP next door or the coffee shop on the corner. Both provide basically the same choices for your breakfast. You select from a specific list of eggs, meat, carbs like toast, hash browns,pancakes, or French toast. Those are your only choices. I can’t eat a cooked breakfast every single day and would have loved to just have a bowl of Cheerios and fruit but that wasn’t allowed. I ended up buying some at the ABC convenience store around the corner and some milk for the room fridge and ate my breakfast in the room. On Sat morning when we needed to check out the dining options were so crowded we couldn’t use our free breakfast. So basically we wasted quite a few of our free breakfast certificates. Only choose the free breakfast option if you want a hot breakfast every day. Also you can only get coffee OR orange juice. Not both. WiFi was the best I have ever had in a hotel. Worked great. We used the beach chairs and beach towels several times and greatly appreciated that. We took the free shuttle to the mall/Walmart one day and it went smooth. Later in the week we wanted to head to Waikiki beach (it is a hike) so we waited for the shuttle. We could see where it was on their app. They say they run two shuttles but we never saw two. We knew the route they were going so we headed down to a nearby stop at the Ilikai hotel and waited for almost an hour for a shuttle bus to stop. We could see on the app map that the shuttle was finally getting to our stop and we were absolutely shocked when the shuttle drove right past the stop and didn’t even slow down!! We had just wasted an hour out in the blazing heat. We went back to the Aqua Palms and complained and the concierge lady explained to us how to take the trolley. After that we used the public bus and the trolley. Before our trip I had researched transportation because we didn’t want to rent a car every day and selected Aqua Palms due to its free shuttle and proximity to the bus and trolley stops. I am giving this only a 3 rating because the hotel contracts with this shuttle service and then has no way to satisfy the customer when the shuttle service only runs one shuttle a day or doesn’t even stop to pick up people. This supposedly is part of your $25 day amenity fee you pay in addition to your room rate so we surely did not get our money’s worth on that. They have a few washer and dryers in the hotel but they were always in use so we ended up walking down the block with a suitcase full of dirty clothes to a laundromat instead. We had a balcony room and a nice partial view of the ocean. It was right on the street and there is constant traffic and noise so not a pleasant balcony to just sit out and enjoy reading a book or watching the ocean. It stays busy til all hours of the morning. I slept with ear plugs in. The location is great. You can walk to many places and it is close to the Ilikai hotel where many tours pick people up. There is a outdoor shopping village across the street which was nice to stroll through, a couple ABC stores within walking distance, an Urgent Care around the corner, and a beach close by. We walked to several restaurants for dinner during our stay. It has an air conditioned lobby, which surprisingly not all hotels have there and that is such a wonderful welcome while waiting for a taxi or after a day outside in the humidity and heat. Both my husband and I slept well on the mattress and the air conditioning worked well in our room. The shower had really forceful water pressure which I enjoyed but if we had brought our son when he was younger he would have freaked out. Although it was always busy outside with traffic and pedestrians, the day we ventured down to Waikiki beach we encountered wall to wall people on the streets and the beach. So in comparison, this location was much easier to get around and the beach close by became our preferred beach. All the beaches on the island are public beaches so you don’t have to be staying at a hotel to use the beach outside their property. Even though Aqua Palms was not directly on the beach, it was no problem to walk to a beach or cut through an ocean front hotel to access the beach. Nobody questions you walking through other hotels so even staying at the Aqua Palms a few blocks from the beach is not a disadvantage.

Everything was smooth and we got the room very quickly. As we enter everything was very clean and neat. The view from there was impressive; you could see the beach not far away and that beautiful sunset in the afternoon. They have there a little gym, a little pool and a comfortable dining room. Breakfast was great at IHOP which is right there inside the hotel and you get 15% off in you bill if you decide to go there . The lobby was cozy and always they had lemon juice water for the guest to get refreshed. At the lobby there is a little booth where you can get information and also get booked for any tour you like to take. Outside the hotel you can find lots of attractions, food and souvenirs stores. Also the beach is very close.To me that was enough to feel myself relax and comfortable in this place since I only staid one night before I start my cruise vacations. AQUA PALM is an excellent choice to stay to start unforgettable vacations. Mahalo !!Thumbs up!!","Hormigueros, Puerto Rico",71,4.0

I travel a lot and stay in many hotels but never in my life have i stayed at a hotel that didnt give complimentary water in the room.. our linen was never changed in 7 days, i know because my daughter spilled some of her milk on the bed and it was still crusty on day 7. Even after asking housekeeping to change the linen nothing happened. Yes the hotel does offer beach chairs, towels to take to the beach plus the complimentary shuttle to the local malls etc, however that does not compensate for their short comings. There is no eatery in the hotel you have to eat at the ihop, or other places around meaning no room service. Lucky they do provide microwaves, so you can buy from other places and heat it up later.

The hotel is just about 'okay', in some ways above and below that mark. The staff (other than housekeeping) was efficient, friendly, and had a good grasp of hospitality. The location is about a 10 minute walk from the Hawaiian Convention Center, and the beach. There are good dining and shopping options within walking distance. The room itself had a few issues. My wife noted almost immediately that there was a small (about a two inch smear) splash of dried blood on the dresser. We noted it, didn't use the dresser, and noticed that it was not found and cleaned during our three day stay. The sheets and towels were regularly replaced and cleaned, but that stain was pretty heinous. The king bed was on the firm side and and the pillows were just about average. There was no fan in the bathroom which is a really odd oversight in my opinion. The cable television had a decent range of available options and there was the option to use free DVDs available from a vending machine in the lobby.In all fairness I have stayed at worse places, but this was below average and the price was a bit high considering that. I would give the hotel a 2.5 out of 5 but that isn't an option but I would say the current 4 out of 5 average is far too high a rating for this hotel, so I give it a 2 for the purpose of balancing.I did not call the blood to the attention of the desk staff because honestly, I really want not to have to do that. When I had questions about bus lines or hiking locations and when we asked for a bottle opener we were really pleased with quick, helpful staff response.

They have reef-safe sunscreen 'on-tap' and fresh apples and lemon water in the lobby and your resort fee does get you hotel towels, umbrellas, and beach chairs to borrow. The pool is very family friendly, no deeper than 4ft and quite small, but nice. The pool deck has a barbecue, and tables and chairs and lounge chairs, which is nice, but there is absolutely no shade and no protection from the rain if you are trying to barbecue. It could really use umbrellas or another option for shade.The room we had overlooked the Hilton, and this partial ocean view, so that was lovely, but Ala Moana is one busy, LOUD street. Constant traffic noise and sirens every 5 minutes, and the balcony door did not shut all the way at the bottom, so the noise never really stopped.The room itself was fine, reasonable sized and very clean when we arrived, if a bit worn at the edges. The lampshade was torn, the towels were fraying and the ceiling had a multitude of tiny holes just above the bed, but it was clean so we just moved on. Unfortunately as the week progressed, housekeeping deteriorated. On the final full day, they did not even bother to make up the sofa bed our daughter was sleeping on and they left a dirty rag on the little coffee area. Our sheets they put on had stains more than once and large parts of the floor never ended up getting vacuumed, as evidenced by the very obvious crumbs left from a small spill on day 3 that were there when we left on day 6.The room was very clean on the first 2 days, so I am not sure what happened after that, but it didn't inspire a lot of confidence after that point.The room was in need of some minor repairs, as both the sink and the tap plug did not work and the bathroom fan sounded like a chainsaw, but considering how attentive the maintenance staff was for other issues, I would expect they will be fixed shortly.The location really couldn't be better, there is a grocery store on the back of the block, there are great restaurants all around and it is a very short walk to both Waikiki and the Ala Moana shopping centre. I would still recommend this hotel, especially to travellers on a budget, or with children, just be persistent if there are an issues with housekeeping. ","Pouce Coupe, Canada",13,3.0

We also did the Circle Island Tours with Aloha tours with Ian. What a great experience! We went with 17 other people and got to know each other well. Ian is very knowledgeable and provided us with information regarding Hawaiian history, politics, and knew so much about the sites we visited. We also discovered Magic Beach which is a 20 minute walk or a 5 minute shuttle to Ala Moana Mall, walk across the street and head towards the ocean. It is shallow, great for snorkeling with tons of fish and there is a monk seal who has made her home there. Look for her on the rocks and do not swim too close to her as she is protected by law. There is also a restroom and change room there. Best of all its free! Grab a snack and go.

You can pick up a healthy snack or breakfast at any ABC store which can be found on almost every corner.

The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens soft. Everything was very clean. We stayed four nights and could have stayed longer. It also has a pool (I didn't try it) and a self-laundry which came in very handy. It was also very convenient to have towels and beach chairs available. Our rate included breakfast at either IHop or Wailana Coffee House. The selection was limited but perfectly adequate and worth the money.

When they realised I was booked for 8 days they miraculously found a room.The staff were generally polite and the tours lady was lovely.Do not stay here if noise bothers you. The hotel really needs to install sound proof doors and windows. At 11:30PM the restaurant across the road (Kobe) appeared to have drains (maybe cooking oil?) cleaned. It went for over an hour and the truck was soooo loud that we couldn't sleep. Ridiculous that it is allowed to happen at this time of night!Housekeeping was OK but not thorough. There were obvious places that were not cleaned. Several days they took our dirty towels but forgot to give us new ones, other times they forgot to leave us coffee and tea etc.The toilet wouldn't turn off on one day. It flooded the bathroom. We called maintenance and they came quickly. We left the room. When we came back the toilet was fixed and the water in the bathroom cleaned up, but it had obviously kept flooding for a bit as the carpet was wet. They hadn't done anything to dry it and it caused the room to smell.There were also ants in the bathroom and kitchenette area. We couldn't put anything in the bin (eg empty soda cans etc) as the bin would be overrun with ants.The beds were OK but not super comfy. The pillows were hard.The lighting in the room wasn't great.It is great having a fridge although the shelf inside the door was broken so couldn't be used.The microwave was great as was the coffee machine. The air conditioning was good.The elevators are sloooow!They now have a free shuttle between the various Aqua hotels and Ala Moana, but despite having a live tracking ap, it was impossible to work out where it would be and when as it didn't show Aqua Palms on the ap, so we never used the shuttle.The noisiness of the room sealed the deal re me not coming back.

My room also came with a free dessert (you must request the coupon for free dessert when you check-in). I had trouble cashing in my dessert coupon as the restaurant was closing early for maintenance, so the front desk made a special call to the restaurant and got them to serve me after closing time - had fantastic free fried Hawaiian ice cream!

I walked through the ""village"" twice (which is really just a mall full of expensive shops) and it takes a good 15 minutes to get to the beach. They do have Friday night fireworks there and that's really fun to watch. We stayed here because in our vrbo deal, reserved parking was included and we had a rental car and a disabled relative with us who needed to be driven most places. The Waikiki stuff that we wanted to do was quite far from the hotel. I drove my friends down to the Kuhio Beach area and then came back to park and walked back to the Kuhio area. It took almost 25 minutes every single time to walk there no matter what route I took--and I was going as fast as I politely could. Driving there is about 15-20 minutes altogether including the garage and traffic. (I think we were on level P3 of the garage which is four sets of ramps.) It takes a good bit of care and time to negotiate all the ramps and corners...THE PARKING GARAGE is a NIGHTMARE. The initial ramp to get in is almost straight up! If you go to fast, you may smash right into cars parked at the top of the ramp. If you go to slow, you will eventually have to gun it a little to get all the way up. It's dicey every single time. The ramps that go from floor to floor are extremely narrow with tight corners you must get around. People hit and/or scrape the walls a lot--there are grooves and chunks of concrete missing from the walls and corners. The paint is severely scraped off and streaks are left from cars scraping by. It is just flat out DANGEROUS.Twice other guests mentioned the crazy garage to me while we were in the elevator. We were so relieved when we made our final descent down that steep final ramp! On the plus side, the staff is genuinely helpful and polite. The air conditioning is often not working well in the reception area--which is not a big deal unless you are waiting in line for help. Then you feel like you are trapped in a sauna.Our room was on the third floor, and there is no view--just other buildings--in case that's important to you.There are more restaurants off the side streets if you walk down past the front of the Hilton area. (Chains like Subway and other sit down places--it's going to take 10 to 15 minutes to get there.) There are a couple of real cheap souvenir shops down the street from the hotel, but we only found IHOP and the Wailana (?) close for restaurants. Walmart has cheap t-shirts if you need them as well and fairly cheap groceries for Hawaii as far as we could tell.Anyway, just some points to take note of.

I run short-term vacation and corporate rental properties and I can tell you cleanliness is not rocket science if you spend the time and have a good process. This room was anything but clean. I understand its by thw beach but a strong musty smell and black mold spots around the ac vent did not give me a warm fuzzy upon check in.Also the floor sloped badly towards the kitchen area which indicates structural issues with the building. The staff at the front desk were very cordial and attempted to be helpful especially the night supervisor Gen. However after multiple requests to have the hotel manager, Ms Maher, call me, she has yet to do so. The icing on the cake was the pull-out couch for the eight-year-old.

We aren't people who sit around a room and we got tired of waiting on them to come. We went to dinner and came back to find the plumbing still squealing. The room was extremely small especially since I had to pull the couch out. There was a snack machine on the 7th and 11th floor but NO POP MACHINE! We stayed for 2 nights before going on to Guam.

Make sure it's done in advance and recorded; Because we booked two seats on our 2nd day and was told it's to early to book ????I was avised to book a day or two before.....ok....we did.

The location is perfect, right at the gateway of Waikiki. First off, the parking spaces are a bit tight, so anything larger than a full size car would have a difficult time. I am thinking that $25 a day for parking is normal in Waikiki. The staff is polite and helpful. If you check in late, Larry is there to greet you. If not, the others are nice too, like Venus. The rooms are adequately sized and amenities are plentiful; mini refrigerator, safe, coffee maker and an iron are all there. There was also a game console for the kids. The last room I was given had a sofa bed and a queen size bed, a desk and a little table to lay out my belongings. The tv was mounted on the wall so ""counter space"" was abundant. What I appreciate is the black out curtain. Some mornings, you want to sleep in without the sun waking you up. The bathroom is of average size. Shampoo, conditioner and lotion are all there. I don't mind the fragrance of the soap, but my friend said it smelled weird. I like it. Hair dryer is there too. The toilet is elongated (not round). I hate round toilets! The shower tub was ok, but the last room I had could use a bit of resurfacing by the drain. On the positive note, it has an anti-slip surface. Little things I appreciate, especially almost slipping in the tub at another hotel. The shower head wasn't the best and pressure could have been just a bit stronger. I think the hotel is taking steps to conserve water.There are rooms with a balcony and rooms with just a window. It's great to have a cup of coffee in the morning on the balcony, but depending on the floor, the street noise can be loud. Finally, the central air conditioner is nice and strong.

There were just too many stalls in the garage that said - RESERVED--On one evening after returning past 10p.m, we needed to do that and found out that the flat rate of $15 was charged and there were no in-out privileges once you park in that space and if you needed to move out of the space, you would need to pay another $15.

You should note that this is not on the beach and it is about a 20 minute walk to the Waikiki beach. There is a closer beach that you can go to as well which is also great for swimming.The check-in and out were both quick and easy. The lifts are slow but the room was spacious, had a nice balcony and was clean. They also provided beach towels (with a deposit) at the front desk. You can get straight to the car park in the lift which is very useful. The service at the front desk was friendly and we noted a stand for recommended activities and tours.Beware of the 'free car hire' package with Alamo. Alamo car hire is not at the airport, you need to get the (free) Alamo shuttle from the airport to the car hire. Also with all of the extra taxes and charges, this is NOT free car hire, it cost us about $150 for two days. However, it is definitely cheaper than booking a car separately so if you were going to get a car anyway, then it is probably worthwhile.The car park is narrow. We had a midsize car and just about managed to get around the corners, if the car was any larger, we would have had difficulties.We didn't have trouble finding a space though (in October). The car park is $25 per day.I would recommend this to travellers on a budget. It is not a luxury hotel but the room was modern and clean and the service was good.

I found the staff wonderful to deal with, and the room was excellent. I highly recommend asking for room 1115, because it is high enough to avoid the noise, and I loved sitting out on the balcony enjoying the view. The first day I was quite dazed from my 11 hour flight from NY so I didn't notice that there was a slight ocean view looking off to the left on the balcony. I enjoyed being in the back because it was incredibly peaceful at night. I don't like freezing AC so I left the patio doors quite wide open to get a breeze, there was only one brief incident of noise the final night just as i was about to go to sleep where someone was playing loud music but fortunately it died down quite quickly. I found the bed very comfortable, I can't bear a hard mattress, and the pillowtop was perfect. The elevators were better than last time, worked quite smoothly, only one time on my final day as i went out to breakfast the elevator was crowded with about 8 people possibly due to a major convention in town. I went out to the coffee shop nearby and it was too crowded at 8AM so came back at 9:20 and had the place to myself. (and a 10% discount when I showed my room card) I felt very safe in Waikiki and enjoyed going down the street that resembles Bev Hills in LA with Dior, Fendi,Harry Winston Jewelry, Cartier, etc going along the beach. (Kalakaua Ave.) I did find Waikiki more expensive than last visit but I noticed if one ventured out via McCully to go to downtown Honolulu the prices were better. I highly recommend a tiny unpretentious place where I had an excellent garlic shrimp and rice and bottled water water for $11, it was called Regal Diner and it was in that first shopping center as you get over McCully on the bridge and hit the first intersection of Kapiolani Blvd. 1960 Kapiolani Blvd is where you will find Regal. Unfortunately I discovered it on my last night of my 8 night stay. I did have some nice meals at a Korean Restaurant right near the hotel but it was pricier. (closer to $30) Honolulu reminds me a lot of LA, it has the sad aspects of LA and the good parts. The homeless were very tragic and I didn't notice them at first as much as in 2013 but they were there. I never felt confronted by them however. I walked all the way over the bridge on McCully over Highway 1 and walked way up a hill and had a nice view and also reached the University of Hawaii. I also took bus number 57 to go to a lovely suburban town of Kailua, which I caught at Ala Moana Shopping Center. The trip with the gorgeous mountains was breathtaking. It seemed most of the people on the bus were bored by their usual commuter trip but I loved it, despite rainy weather. Anyway, I digress from the hotel experience, I would say my only tiny bit of criticism was how difficult it was to initially open the patio door, maybe it needs some oil, once I got it open about 6 inches then it was easy. The view of the high rises and the mountains were lovely from the terrace. I wish I hadn't missed the Hawaiian music in the hotel Wed night, because I made the mistake of thinking it was Thurs night. I did catch a fun dance performance on Kalakaua Ave, put on by the Polynesian Center, where they invited a few audience members to participate with repeating tribal screams and banging drums. They wore colorful costumes and were most entertaining. I wish I could remember the names of all the people at the hotel who were so gracious and helpful to me. The lady with the long hair on the tourism desk was especially pleasant. The ABC stores all nearby were so helpful and a yuppie ish grocery store around the block, Food Pantry, although expensive had everything I needed including fresh diced pineapple that was out of this world, I learned from my 1st visit how one has never truly ""eaten"" pineapple until you are in Hawaii! I never used the hotel pool but I did peek in and it looked great. It seemed the walls of the hotel were thick enough to not hear any neighbors. (the music mentioned earlier I heard from a neighboring balcony) It was a cheerful room very clean with plenty of towels and a half fridge and a microwave. The TV was good with lots of channels and no problem with the cable connection. The shower head was strong and there was plenty of hot water. Considering the reasonable price they gave me for my 8 night stay I was pleased with being placed on such a high floor. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonable place to stay, but there were no corners cut here, it was first rate. I had one tiny issue with a non working toilet a few days in and they sent the maintenance guy up promptly to fix it. He was polite and did not intrude. I also was very pleased with how well the safe worked, I don't have a laptop but I did have other stuff that was quite valuable to me, and securing it each day was comforting. This place is not the ritz but it is clean, and well run, and I dread to think of what being in a lesser hotel and having a problem with the toilet working would have been like. Before I close I also want to say how much I enjoyed finally going to the royal palace, which was magnificent and also I went to the Honolulu Art Museum twice, and the Zoo was great. There is so much to do in Honolulu, give yourself at least 8 nights. The hotel is right near a bus stop that will scoot you to the airport, take either the 19 or 20. It took only 40 minutes to get there for a paltry $2.50 and the driver was super nice, and so compassionate towards the many homeless who were riders. He was such a gentleman and really cared about his riders and valued them. DON'T bring on a large carry on bag, that it not permitted, I had a gym bag sized bag which was fine. I hated to leave and long to go back someday and I am certain that I will stay at Aqua Palms again. I also like that I got double airline miles by paying my hotel bill with my Hawaiian Airlines Mastercard. That card bonus miles paid for my entire round trip flight. (35K bonus miles) PS. I highly recommend Speedi Shuttle which was professional at getting me from the airport to the hotel quickly and at such a low rate ($16) I gave the man an $8 tip because he earned it with his maholo spirit! I was so exhausted after the 11 hour plane trip and seeing that Speedi Shuttle was so professional eased my jangled nerves. They even have a desk in the Honolulu airport baggage claim area. The driver was very entertaining with all of us including a family from Australia. It is apparent he loves his job. Anyway I will be back to Honolulu one of these days!!!","Bronx, New York",23,5.0

Also, this year we wanted to use the in-room safe (which we were being charged for using in the resort fee) but we found that we had to get on our belly to even be able to read the instructions on how to use it...so we didn't get to use it. In the past it has usually been my husband and I in the room but this year we had our daughter with us and the room was just too small for 3 people. There are other comparable hotels in the area that have bigger rooms without having to pay an upgrade fee. Since we were paying for 3 people in the room, why does housekeeping always leave 2 towels?","Columbia, SC",15,3.0

We wanted to be able to have a few cocktails and not worry about a ride home, so we started looking at hotels to stay just one night. The event venue was a FORTUNE and the Military hotel next door was booked. Enter the Aqua Palms Waikiki. Directly across the street was super convenient and didn't make me regret wearing super sweet heels. Check in was super easy, although they do post a $50 charge on your card in case you damage room or whatever. Got to room, and sliding door was wide open making it CRAZY WARM in the room. We closed the door and cranked up the AC. Took a few hours to cool off but it did. Bed was comfy but one side was up against the wall, so when I woke up in the middle of the night to use bathroom, I had to crawl across my husband to get out of bed. The next morning, we went downstairs to the cafe located on the corner (somewhere I've always wanted to try but never made it to Waikiki for breakfast before). Overall, room served its purpose of providing a safe place to crash after a long night of celebrating. Clean, good size and great price.

Needed a hotel room fast. The nice lady at the SpeediShuttle desk ($29-$30 roundtrip airport shuttle to and from hotels) had stayed at the Aqua Palms and had a pleasant experience, evidently. I typically stay at nicer properties, but hey..... any port in a storm. The price was a reasonable $158 (Kama'aina rate) including taxes, and my expectations were geared accordingly. The front desk staff person was polite and pointed out the IHOP next door. No in house restaurant i.e. no room service. The first room smelled of something burnt, maybe popcorn. The rooms feature microwaves and a small fridge. I called to the front desk from the room and requested a new room, suggesting that as long as someone was coming up to the 7th floor to check out the burning smell, how about bringing a new room key. The desk clerk was sympathetic and agreeable. A staff person showed up quickly and nicely assisted me in relocating to another 7th floor room. The next room was smell-free. I noted a plastic toothpick wrapper on the floor. Other than that the room appeared clean, but clearly had seen better days and is need of renovation. In addition to the bed, there was a sofa and a small round top cafe table and two chairs, a bureau and a desk. The lamp on the desk had a plug-in for electronics, but not the two bedside lamps. Two plug-ins were available on wall outlets. My room had windows facing the street and there was traffic noise. I congratulated myself on having a white noise app on my cell.

Until resort fees become illegal (and they will soon), you could do worse than what they charge here. In summary, go hang out at the beach and don't worry about the hotel too much. If something is wrong, let staff know before getting angry.","Portland, Oregon",19,3.0

It was only a 15 minute walk to the start of the marathon and this was an attraction. When we checked in my wife was upset when we discovered our room had no balcony. We were so looking forward to having this in our room. I immediately asked for our room to be changed and it was done so straight away. This time we were on the beach side.

It wasn't a great start to our Hawaiian family vacation. On the first day, we were given our room key. We got up to the room and the key didn't work. I walked down to the front desk and told them about the problem. They re-issued a new key and again, it didn't work. Luckily, a member of housekeeping was there and was able to get in. Once we were in the room, we decided to try again with the key and couldn't get it to work. At this point, after traveling 17 hours, we were a little discouraged and a little mad. We called the front desk and they said they would send a maintenance person up. My dad and I went out for a walk on the beach and my mom stayed in the room. She said the maintenance man didn't come up for another hour. He couldn't figure it out, so we had to change rooms. You'd think that was the end of the key debacle, but it wasn't. In the new room, the key didn't work either.I could go on even further about this, but suffice it to say, the keys are unreliable (the front desk staff has no problem acknowledging this) and we had to get a new key every single day we stayed here.Now, onto everything else:- Good location, about a five minute walk from the beach- No restaurant (but we knew that) but an iHOP that is connected to the hotel had good food- When we stayed, the air conditioning was out of service. We were given a fan for our room. With the fan on and the door open, it was fine. When we checked out, they kindly refunded us some money (parking and the resort fee), so that was very nice and we appreciated it.- Overall, the hotel needs a remodel and a good throrough cleaning. It's sort of dingy and there are only a few elevators for the whole place. Getting anywhere took a little while.So I guess in conclusion, I will admit that you get what you pay for. It's not an upscale place, it's not a rotten place, it's just sort of OK. If you're looking to do Honolulu cheaply, this is a good option. And if you're out of the room more than you're in it (like we were), it'll do.",,13,3.0

Good location and close to food, shopping and the beach though you are not paying for beach front room (across the street through the Hilton Villa). Staff and housekeeping are super nice, friendly and talkative/engaging. Relatively clean. CONS: it may have just been my room but this place is starting to get pretty run down. It seems like a neglected child of a well-to-do family. Perhaps we got a run down room because we were so last minute. The other locations in the area and the ads on TV and the internet look way more modernized than what we experienced. The construction was just shoddy. Things like the bathroom vent being held up by sticky strips; the bathroom didn't have a full counter/sink but a wall sink and there was what looked like an old nightstand moved in the bathroom to put stuff on. the tile work seemed slapped together and the curtain rod seemed like it was supposed to be one of those that bows out to give you more room but instead there was a hobbled together extender rod that was rusty and the shower/bath was so narrow it was awkward though the tub was a super long tub...none of our furniture matched in the room and it was like a shabby chic beachcomber's décor hobbled together from the eighties and nineties. The sheets were a little threadbare and didn't smell like detergent was used in the wash. I know they send the laundry out but though the fact that ""palms"" was stamped in black ink on everything was a little odd. The towels, though, were nice and white and of good quality. Finally, if you have a sugary drink - get rid of it and don't bring it in the room as our one drink attracted teeny tiny ants which mostly went away after we got rid of the drink.

My wife and I would not use the pool after the first night as it was not really clean, we went for an early evening swim after dinner, it was full of hair and to many floaties for us, the condition really didn't change for the week we were there, which was very disappointing. The elevators are very hit and miss, there was three, but only two ever worked while we were there. The other thing that annoyed us was the fact the staff use the same lifts as the guest, they would have trollies and tubs on wheels and would force there way in to the lift, even if there were several guest already in them, very unprofessional. The last thing was the fact the carpet in our room was filthy, very much in need of a shampoo, when in our room I like to kick off my shoes and go bare foot, but if I did this, my feet would turn black from the grime. The time the rooms are cleaned are very unpredictable, one day the room would be cleaned at 10am, the next it would be 2pm, very annoying when you want to just relax in your room for awhile. All in all, we would stay here again, it's not the Hilton, but it is very adequate for the money.","Bathurst, Australia",13,3.0

The views are also good as we had a partial view of the ocean and Diamond Head from our balcony. The sea is about five minutes walk away and there are buses going from just outside the hotel - they also have a free shuttle which was useful although we only used it once. There is also an Ihop next door which is very convenient if you don't want to go far to eat. The staff gave us lots of useful information and we also booked one trip through the concierge - it was to Germaine's Luau which was really good value and also great fun.

Military rate restrictions meant I had to adhere to the allowed TLA-rates, which isn't easy in Waikiki. The Aqua Palms accepted the rate (as is typical for them, apparently) and I was able to easily get a room for 10 nights. However, it wasn't the greatest experience.There is parking ($25/day regular, $10/day TLA rate) in the garage; no valet, which isn't a big deal. However, there's not really anywhere in front of the hotel to park and unload baggage unless you park on the sidewalk. The garage is small and somewhat difficult to park in if you have a larger vehicle, and it's not the most convenient parking of the Waikiki hotels. I was able to check in without any difficulty after making a same-day reservation. When I got to my room, I found that the key reader wasn't working well; throughout my stay it often took 5-6 swipes of the key to open the door, and there were a few other people having the same issue. The room was pretty small, probably as a function of the TLA rate. However, there was enough space for baggage and to unpack. Furniture was pretty old and all looked like it came from a thrift store, but it was functional. The bed and pillows were surprisingly comfortable and the AC, controlled by a wall thermostat, could be ICE cold if you wanted it, which was nice given the heat wave. Also, had a microwave and fridge which functioned well and were clean.The room as a whole looked well used; it was obvious that no recent updates had happened. The bathroom looked like a truck stop restroom and handicap-accessible shower collided. There was no counter/vanity. The sink was public restroom style, mounted to the wall with visible pipes underneath. There was a busted and peeling piece of furniture which looked like a nightstand that acted as the vanity and could be moved around the bathroom. Also, it was very sterile/white/bright; no granite or anything nice. Water pressure in the sink was terrible and it was difficult to get hot water, which made shaving difficult. When I checked in to the room, I noticed that there were other peoples hairs (based on color and length, probably from at least 4 people) stuck to the bathroom and shower walls, as well as on the floor. There was also a piece of broken glass on the floor, and the housekeeping folks forgot to stock some wash clothes.To be quite honest, other than the bathroom, the room was clean enough and without major issues.The hotel has 3 elevators, only 2 of which functioned during my stay. For a 12 floor hotel with 5 additional levels for parking and lobby, this was inconvenient. At one point, all elevators stopped working, though this was related to flooding and was relatively quickly fixed. No word on why the 3rd one never worked.There is an IHOP; no other restaurant. No bar. No spa facilities. No beach access. The pool is very small, but usable. Laundry facilities exist, but were nearly constantly busy. This is NOT the hotel you are looking for if you want a luxury vacation. Go across the street to the Hilton or the Modern. If you want Oahu for cheap, then this is probably your place. On the plus side, it is pretty well located in Waikiki and you can't really beat the price. The internet is also free and very fast, so if you need it for business, you'll get it here.","Holly Springs, North Carolina",17,3.0

The rooms are pretty basic but we didn't care, as we are outdoorsy and on the go most of the time. Returning this year for a family vacation, my husband and I searched all the affordable yet well rated hotels in Waikiki. And we decided to return to Aqua Palms. Why? The location near the shopping district, beach and Hilton Hawaiian Village and its many amenities can't be beat. Another plus is the large public salt water lagoon at the HHV that is perfect for families. The staff is friendly and the concierge very knowledgeable and helpful. And there are two family friendly restaurants and a great variety of others literally right downstairs or across the street. Again, nothing fancy and the pool is really tiny but it's a super little hotel for travelers looking for a great location. ",,17,4.0

We were very pleased with the fact that there was a refrigerator, microwave and coffeemaker in the room so we didn't have to eat out every meal for a week! The room also had a sleeper sofa and a small dining table and chairs which was nice and I loved sitting out on the balcony in the morning drinking my coffee! Had nice views of the city and mountains and could even see the ocean between a couple of buildings! The hotel is located just across the street from Hilton Hawaiian Village (which is very upscale and just beautiful) and you can walk through their lovely grounds to the beach ... there are many restaurants and shops right there!The hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly. Right down the street from Ala Moana Mall which is lovely and adjacent to an IHOP where we are a couple of yummy meals! Also there is plenty of inexpensive public transportation to sightsee in the area so you don't really need a rental car. The weather was amazing the entire week we were there and we had a rental car so drove all over Oahu! Really enjoyed Waikiki Beach, Diamond Head, Pearl Harbor, the north shore area, Hanuma Bay (beautiful snorkeling) and the Dole pineapple plantation. So many lovely beaches on Oahu, Kailua and Lanikai were my faves!

That being said, the rooms are clean, albeit on the small side – more European-sized than American-sized. Your odds of getting a room with a balcony are two in three (for either ocean or city view), and we unfortunately lost that lottery when we were assigned our room.Beds are on the firm side; expect numb arms if you sleep on your side. The bathroom was a little cramped, and while well-lit over the counter/sink, there was no lighting directly around the shower, which means you are showering or bathing in very little light. The room included a small refrigerator and microwave.We had a problem with our room, specifically the air conditioning unit. The A/C was very ineffective, barely able to cool the room 1-2 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of several hours. Our room was on the north side of the building resulting in a lot of sunlight hitting the window and heat accumulating during the day. I spoke with the front desk about this, and while the person said they would contact their maintenance people, the problem was never fixed during our three night stay.Parking is available on-site (garage) for $25/day. The hotel has the usual (for Hawaii) resort/hospitality fee of $15/day which basically gets you Wi-Fi access.Location-wise, the Aqua Palms is located towards the western edge of Waikiki which has its advantages and disadvantages – you’re away from the main hustle and bustle of Waikiki, but it’s a short drive, trolley, or bus to get there if that is what you are interested in. You’re a five-minute walk from the Ala Moana Shopping Center.As the review title indicates, you get what you pay for. The Aqua Palms is one of the less-expensive hotels in Waikiki, and the trade off is a small room (possibly without a balcony) in a slightly dated hotel away from the main beach and shopping in Waikiki.

Looks like we picked a winner! Friendly staff, good accommodations. We stayed on the 5th floor facing Diamond Head. We were also able to see the beach from the room. Traffic was noisy but the hotel provides an alarm clock with nature sounds you can play as you sleep to alleviate that issue, which I thought was a very clever way to solve that issue. There's a nice pool if you're too tired to head for the beach. A big grill is near the pool if you're inclined to cook instead of eating out. Wailana Coffee House is next door with great meals and mai tais! There is also iHop next to lobby. ABC stores close by for anything you may have forgotten.Others have complained about the resort fee. This was explained clearly in our check in process and is common here. No problems with that at all. Malea, the concierge, helped plan our luau and was very friendly.

All the staff were very pleasant and helpful. There was a $15.00 per day fee which we were aware of before travelling. We thought this was fine as the hotel has a shuttle service which goes between about six of the hotels within the chain and the Ala Moana shopping centre. With how the hotels are spread out you could easily get to all different parts of Waikiki on this service. So that saved us $10 cabs during the day and evening. They stopped running at about 9pm. The only small issue we had whilst starting there was one of the lamp shades was broken but that didn't faze us as we were out and about most of the time.

Room and facilities do need a makeover -- it is time for that as it is in the life of any hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful during entire stay. Off street parking was adequate but, like others, we did get a warning under our windshield wiper for forgetting to put a placard on our dash when parked overnight. We also had to have the same conversation with the front desk 3 times about hospitality fee and parking charges before all was right. But, that was relatively minor in the overall stay and we had a decent experience there. Oh -- somewhere else, I think I saw it written that they have a business center -- I don't believe that they do.

I had previously stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village but did not want to spend $300+ per night! So knowing the area I picked the Aqua Palms. I was not disappointed! The rooms are clean and the staff is really wonderful! There are a few things they could work on like a broken lamp shade and a slippery tub (could use something nonskid) but over all the location and the price can't be beat! They have a shuttle that will take you to any of the other properties they own in Waikiki for free so its an easy way to get around the city without paying for a taxi or a trolley. Tip: If you want to rent a car but don't want to pay the outrageous parking fees in the garages, located 5 minutes away are Alamo and Enterprise where you can rent the car and then return it that same day! We did it and did our own circle tour of the island for a fraction of what the tour companies cost.

Not so this time. I feel very disappointed to be writing this review but I need to share this so others are not caught in the same trap my husband and I found ourselves in.Due to positive experiences in the past, we booked directly with the Hotel. We received an Invoice which appeared to be in order though the break-down of the room rate and other charges etc. were not disclosed properly. We trusted the Hotel to do the right thing by us since this was our fourth stay with them. When we arrived at the Hotel at 10.00 a.m. on the 7th of May, our room was not ready. That was understandable. We were able to leave our luggage at the Hotel and told to return at approximately 2.00 p.m. When we arrived at 2.00 p.m. the staff were not able to tell us if our room was ready. They had to check and we had a further 10 minute wait. We and the check-in staff at the Hotel were under the impression that because we had booked our room last year, we were not going to be charged the $15.00 per day Hospitality fee. We were told the fee was ""optional"". The fee is outrageous. It covers many things that used to once be free at the Hotel.First appearances seemed to indicate that our room was fine. But after a few days in the room, I noticed the drapes were quite dirty and dusty. The furniture and room is now very dated. Air-conditioning is very noisy. My husband walked around our room one day without shoes or socks on. By the time he came to have a shower that night, he noticed his feet were quite dirty presumably from the carpet.We chose to hire a car for one week of our stay and were aware of the $25.00 parking fee. That was fine with us. What we did not expect though was to receive a Parking Violation notice from the Hotel advising us that our vehicle was improperly parked because ""vehicle has no valid parking permit"". Seriously??? The Hotel had the Licence plate number/registration of our car. Because we forgot to display the sign one day, you chastise us like some over zealous parking officer. The Hotel knew we were guests.We stayed in Room 1024 which adjoins the Maids' Closet and the back stairwell. Even after 11.00 p.m. at night, the doors would slam often. Presumably staff were in and out of the Closet storage room or guests using the rear stairwell.By the time our check out date came around, I felt a big sense of disappointment that our visit to the Aqua Palms Waikiki had been such a let down. To add insult to injury upon paying our bill, we saw that we had been charged the $15.00 per day Hospitality fee! Given that our cab driver was waiting to take us to the Airport for our flight home to Australia, we did not have the time or the energy to dispute this with the Hotel.Sadly, we will no longer chose the Aqua Palms Waikiki again when we holiday/vacation in Honolulu.",Melbourne,12,1.0

Worst of all was the fact that they would not compensate me for two days lost at hotel because of cancelled flights by Jetstar. They were informed within 24 hours and still had no empathy for me for the lost days. Still charged ""resort"" expenses for not being there. Not happy at all. Also, when finally arriving it took receptionist such a long time to even find my booking and was so confused and unapologetic at not finding my booking. Rooms very small for such a high price. I know Aqua Palm is considered a 3.5 star hotel but I expected more for my hard earned dollars. Loved Waikiki Beach and surrounds but will certainly look for a better deal next time.

The building is a combination of hotel rooms and rooms that are owned/operated by private owners.We stayed in a room that was owned by a private owner/operator, so I don't think it was kept up to the standards of the rest of the hotel. But I don't think it was much different than the other rooms and the amenities were all the same.ROOM - Our room was a good size, there was a queen sized bed that was actually pretty comfortable, a sleeper sofa, a dining table for 3, a dresser and a desk. There was also a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker and a toaster with some plates/cups. We thought it was kind of dark and dingy looking and could definitely use some modernizing and updating of the decor. In general we thought it was kind of dirty feeling, which could have also been due to the darkness of the room. The washroom was very small, and the tub did not drain well. In fact it sometimes wouldn't drain at all until you opened and closed the drain quickly a bunch of times. There was a flat screen tv, but we didn't use it.WIFI - The hotel had free wifi. Sometimes you had to sign in with a code, and other times it would connect automatically. It was very random, but nice to have when it worked.LOCATION - The location was the best part about this place. It was walking distance to all of the attractions downtown and directly across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village for shopping, restaurants and if you can sneak in to use their pools, I would suggest it!POOL - The pool was located on the second floor and wasn't usually busy.There were reclining chairs and patio tables and chairs for the guests to use. These were very old looking and the tables were always dusty/dirty. We used the pool two days and were always able to get seats in the sun. There weren't options for shade until later in the day. It would have been nice if they had umbrellas at the tables and cleaned their stuff every morning. There was a BBQ at the pool that you could have the hotel staff start for you to use.LAUNDRY - There were laundry facilities located in the parking garage (a random place) we saw a few people doing laundry while we were there, but there was nowhere to really sit, and due to the location, I wouldn't leave my laundry unattended if I were to do any.Good to know - During our stay we didn't see a single bug. My husband thoroughly checked the bed for bedbugs and didn't see any. We also left food out a few times by accident, (and because we were not official hotel guests we had to empty our own garbages) and there were no cockroaches. Elevators were VERY slow no matter when you were calling them. This hotel is on a main street (Ala Moana) which is very loud at night, but also very convenient for shopping, eating and getting around. Bus stops are directly in front, IHOP is on the main level, there is a great diner at the end of the block and the ABC store is around the corner.STAFF - The front desk staff were helpful and there was an onsite activity/entertainment person who could help you book activities and excursions.PARKING - Paid parking is available at a daily rate. The parking garage is terrible to navigate, so smaller cars would be recommended. We had free parking because our rental included a spot.OVERALL - Perhaps if you were an official hotel guest, the rooms might be a little nicer, however all of the amenities are the same regardless of which room you are in. Basically, you get what you pay for which for this hotel isn't much. If you plan to just sleep in this room, and not spend a lot of time there it is worth the money you will save.","Toronto, Canada",106,2.0

There was a weekly manager's reception with pupus (appetizers) and music. I would suggest at least stopping by the lobby for this, if you're around when it's going on. There is an IHOP downstairs, and a diner style coffee house just next door. The hotel provides a shuttle to the mall, wal mart and other Aqua properties. They provide towel and beach chairs, which was very convenient. This property is not beach front, but the beach is only a short walk away.

Rooms need some updating, the furniture was worn and mis-matched. The lamp shades were in horrible condition. But the room was clean and comfortable. It had a refrigerator and microwave in the room. The lowest price rooms don't have a real balcony, they have a sliding glass door with a railing in front of it, and a large column right in the middle! But, since it overlooked the street, there really wasn't much of a reason to sit on a balcony! The pool was small and not heated, so it was almost too cold to get into. Parking was marginal....very tricky to maneuver the garage, and not enough spaces dedicated to just the hotel. I had to park one night in an IHOP space, which the guy at the desk said was fine.... By the time I paid for parking and resort fee, the good value rate wasn't that good (although I knew in advance of these fees).

We had a partial ocean view suite, which was perfect for us. It was wonderful to look out onto the ocean (and the Hilton Village). The hotel is walking distance from all of the little shops in the Hilton Village, as well as several beach parks. It's also walking distance from the Ala Moana shopping center and Waikiki, both of which we walked to several times while we were there. For those times that our feet were a little tired after a day of activity, we were able to catch the Aqua Hospitality shuttle that runs between the different Aqua properties and the Ala Moana shopping center, and is included in the daily hospitality fee. We also used the beach towels almost every day. In hindsight, we wish we would have asked for two towels per person--one to lay on and one to dry off of, especially since they don't charge you per towel (unless you do not return your towel cards at check out).The room itself was very roomy. It's definitely not a luxury hotel, but it is so functional and very comfortable. The fridge was helpful for storing leftovers, and the coffee pot helped with making oatmeal breakfast. There was also a microwave. The only slight issue I had with the room was the bathroom. It had a full-sized counter, but because of the layout of the shower/tub, we only really had access to half of it. Also, there was no direct light in the shower, so it was kind of dark when using the shower. On the plus side, while it was a short tub, it was really deep, which was nice!In addition to the hotel shuttle, we also found that Aqua Palms was located near several bus stops for the local bus that we opted to use in lieu of renting a car or using the Waikiki Trolley.Overall, we were very, very happy with the hotel. My husband says he would give this a 4.5 rating, and we would definitely consider staying here again.","Kalamazoo, Michigan",26,4.0

I ordered pizza to be delivered and although the pizza place said I'd have to meet the delivery guy in the lobby, it came right to the room which was amazing as we were feeling very lazy. The fridge and microwave were also helpful when it came to our leftovers.One day I forgot to put my parking pass in the window and received a ticket which I took to the front desk and they took care of it. Laundry was pretty straightforward but nice to have access to.I'll also note that Monday night I added Tuesday night at the front desk and the gentleman said that we might not be able to stay in the same room.

It's on the main street with nearby bus stops leading in/out of Waikiki and within walking distance or a short shuttle ride to the Ala Moana Mall. Situated across from beach front hotels near the marina, the Aqua Palms is perfect for less crowding and still a close walk for access to the beach and plenty of reasonably priced shops. The staff here were very good. Ryan at the front desk was very accommodating and showed us how to use the transit system and plan trips. Oscar was a diligent maintenance guy who was prompt and persisted until problems were resolved in quick order - and kept us informed every step of the way. As its on the main strip, the traffic noise is loud until about midnight, and then the trucks start up again around 4am. There are partial beach views and small balconies available, so we could see the weather and waves. We could also see part of Diamondhead from our room. There is free Wi-Fi in the rooms; free movie rentals; a free shuttle to the mall every half hour or so; a free morning paper; free low-quality apples; free tea, coffee or cold water 24/7 (we got tea in the lobby because the room stock was rarely replaced once used); and a manager's ""Swing"" on Wednesdays at 5pm featuring a free snack and a special Hawaiian drink (be there at 5pm for the snack of chips and dip, some cheese and salami slices - not a meal but some tried to make it such and it goes fast). There is also a $15/day Concierge fee for very little to no service given, but who will give advice or book tours (also being paid commissions from the tour agencies hired through them). We used the internet and bused to all venues at much lower cost than tours ($2.50 each) and more time to explore than any tour will allow - so this Concierge money was wasted on us and accounted as a needless surtax to our room. The room itself was large, with king sized bed and sofa hide-a-bed, which would have easily accommodated 4 people for sleeping but little else. It had a microwave (needs cleaning), small fridge with freezer area, iron and board, coffee maker, and a blow dryer. The bathroom was very small and would be difficult to maneuver, maybe even impossible if disabled. The bathroom door opens against the toilet and must be closed to sit or access the shower, and allows very little standing room when open. Doubt any wheelchair or walker could get by when closing the door. The carpet is old and recommend not walking on it barefoot - our feet were blackened by it - likely volcanic ash in the air that had settled and not been vacuumed up. The cleaning staff is not the best outside of making beds and changing towels, and the room was rather satisfactory but not impressive to hang-out in. A good place to sleep and launch out every morning though. Fair price that fluctuates up and down based on the popular demand for rooms in Waikiki generally instead of a set rate. Use a AAA card to get a discount deal. There is also an IHOP attached and between 6 - 8 am good seating and breakfast service before the 9 o'clock crowds arrive. On Thursdays between 9am - 5pm, a free caricature artist is on site and worth getting a picture done for a tip. Also, there are other nearby breakfast haunts on Ala Moana and Ena Road, as well as a few more bar style eateries nearby. A shrimp tent just went up at the Chinese restaurant next door before we left and it was better than anything else on the strip - well worth the try, and good value ($13 for 10 jumbo shrimp, garlic or sriracha spiced, rice, and a free bottle of water). There is an ABC on both corners and a Food Pantry just around the corner on Hobron Lane. For its location and practicality, I would use this hotel again.","Winnipeg, Canada",62,3.0

Check in was smooth, if less than friendly. The room was fairly large and clean. It was also quiet even though we were fairly close to the road - I'm not sure why so many people complain about the noise...The breakfast was about what you would expect for the price - edible, but not much more. The two miniscule areas for eating were extremely crowded, and the amount of warm food was inadequate for the number of people staying in the hotel. The service was poor / average - all three people I encountered at the front desk clearly care little about their job. The young woman was hands down the worst - her attitude bordered on rude. I doubt the management ever reads these reviews, but if they do, they need to do a much better job with training and supervising their front desk staff. Ultimately, it was a decent stay. Not bad, but not great.Oh, and two tips for people staying here: there are a few good, family-friendly restaurants across the street (be careful when crossing the street - the traffic is dangerous).

Then in took around 2 hours to actually get one in the room which made my exhausted 18 month old miss a nap. My second problem is they have recently added a $15.00 per night ""hospitality charge."" I did not know about this charge until I checked in (in their defense there was a foot note about the charge in my confirmation e-mail) and was really, really irritated by it. This $15.00 charge gets you the following things:DVDnow - which gives you the opportunity to rent DVD's from the lobby (isn't that what you want to do when you are in Waikiki?)A shuttle into Waikiki (which takes you to a lot of places you could easily walk to)A daily newspaperIn room coffeeIn room safeLocal and toll free calls!

Mom and I had reserved and accessible room and my uncle a regular room which was conveniently located next door.The rooms overlooked the mountains and were comfortable and quiet. We kept the door to the balcony open at night and slept just fine with the exception of one night when there were many emergency vehicles in the area.The accessible room had a bed and a pull-out sofa. I got the sofa (the things we do for our parents!) and it was more comfortable than most. When opened it did make the room tight and the closet door couldn't open fully. The bathroom had a roll-in shower and everything worked just fine.The AC unit was loud when operating but the outside temps were cool enough to leave the balcony door open at night with the sheers pulled closed. My uncle's room had an annoying noise from the unit when it was off. They weren't able to fix it promptly and offered to move him to another room which worked just fine.There are a few things that would enhance the accessible room however. Adding a few shelves on the bathroom wall above the lightswitch would add some much needed storage space for those not in a wheelchair. The rolling cart was a great addition but a bit more flat space would be great. There is a mini fridge and a microwave in the entryway and we made great use of the fridge. The microwave is located in an upper cabinet which is unaccessible to short people and anyone in a wheelchair. You might consider removing the upper cabinet and moving the microwave to the countertop. There was a light on one side of the bed but another on the other bedside table would be great as it is dark in the corner.We loved the location with its easy walk to the beach, restaurants and ABC Stores. Having the Hilton Hawaiian Village across the street provided some fun shopping and quick eats. We had a car while on vacation and with our GPS it was easy to get out and about from there. Yes, the parking garage takes a bit of getting used to and I wouldn't want to drive it in a large SUV/truck/van but the Altima we had was fine.

They were always very prompt to respond and very nice about it, but it was still hot in the room after they ""repaired"" the thermostat...

Exceptional location and value: just across the street from Hilton Hawaiian Village, which means a nice leisurely stroll to the beach through the Hilton grounds, but the room price is lower. Wailana Coffee House and IHOP are located in the same block. Do not think this hotel is far from the center of Waikiki: I walked from here to the other end of Waikiki (to Park Shore Hotel) in about 35 minutes, so you can imaging that to get to everything in between will take less time, especially if you use trolley (pink line).The rooms are quite large (especially if you get one with 2 beds). Our room was clean, comfy beds, nice sitting area, large balcony with a table and chairs, and microwave, fridge as well as free WiFi and local calls were all nice additions to my stay. No real complains about anything about our room other than a bit loud A/C unit, but I simply adjusted the temperature to a bit higher level (which I do not mind) so that A/C does not turn on often at night.I did not get to use their swimming pool or exercise room, so cannot comment on that. I got a package with a daily breakfast for 2 at IHOP, but I did not get the value I expected from those vouchers: very limited choice and you'll probably get tired of that in a matter of a few days (as I did). So I would not recommend that package. Also, we got a room with Diamond Head view. The downside of that was that that side of the hotels is facing Ala Moana Boulevard, which is a very busy street day and night, so unless you're on a hight floor, the street noise may be very bothersome. So, either request a room on a higher floor, or on the other side of the hotel, or simply keep your balcony closed for the night.The other thing was that we were 4 of us and initially we were given a room with 1 bed and 1 sofa bed. Well, you can probably imaging that it was not really what I expected, especially considering that all 4 of us are adults. Plus in that room, there were only two bath towels, so obviously during less busy period (and I stayed there for New Year) this type of room is designed for just two adults. So I went to front desk and asked if we could move to a room with 2 beds. I did not expect much since it was New Year time but a woman at the front desk said they'd have a room with 2 beds in a few days and that they could move us there at that time. That was very nice of them. I really appreciated it. The only inconvenience when we moved to the new room was that we had to ask for a 4th bath towel pretty much every day (yes, there were only 3 towels when we moved into the new room, although the room is designed for 4 people). I do not know, may be it's a way they conserve the use of towels... But other than that, the stay was excellent, staff very polite and accommodating and overall this hotel is of great value. I'd definitely stay there again if my travels bring me back to Honolulu.","Vancouver, Canada",4,5.0

There were too much furniture for the size of the room. The three chairs were made of some tatami-straw material, something very uncomfortable, specially for a hotel room where you want to relax.The good things are the 42"" TV, the free WiFi, the in-room coffee machine, the microwave, and the fridge (empty, but I could put my own drinks in it).

The positives were I was able to checkin on arrival at approx 11 am however I had to fight to get my room above the 8th floor as promised by my travel agent. I paid extra for a partial ocean view. On entering my room I have to say I was a little disappointed it was not quite as grand as the website photos indicated. I did not have a balcony. The bathroom was extremely small with the door only just clearing the toilet. Also the bath enamel was missing in several large chunks. I had paid $293 a night and was expecting something a bit more upmarket. The lift area is very tatty and resembles a 2 star hotel. I travel a lot for work in Australia and usually stay in 3-4 star hotels this was more like 2.5 star. On the good side the room was clean, the sheets were changed after 4 days not 3 as stated in the brochure. Air con was very noisy.Staff at the front desk were friendly and polite. I can't recommend the tour desk in the foyer as they charge well over the price for excursions to tourist sites like Pearl Harbour and do not pick you up at the Hotel but at a hotel further across the road this wasn't mentioned until after I had booked.I was on the 11th floor and it was extremely noisy although funnily enough I didn't mind this it adds to the excitement of Waikik. Wifi in the room was excellent and if being within a 15 minutes walk to the Ala Moana shopping Center is important then maybe you can overlook the other shortcomings. Personally I would expect more for my money and will do little more research next time I stay in Waikiki.","New York City, New York",17,3.0

The staff had told us to meet him at a certain spot, that we clearly did not know which area they were talking about. We were in an open parking lot next to Nordstrom which would have been very easy to locate us and pick us up.We knew what the shuttle looked like from the picture at the hotel.We waited about 20 minutes, we went to the second level of Ala Moana, thinking he might be waiting up on the second level. We decided to call the hotel again, and wanted to see what was going on.The staff had told us, that the driver was trying to look for us, but couldn't find us. Later he told us that the driver was driving a grey VIP transit van, which we were clearly were not informed about this. Next he told us that the driver would have to come back in 20 minutes, but we figured that it takes 20 minutes to walk to the hotel, so we decided to walk instead.We were extremely upset by this.I am aware that hotels do make mistakes, but it is important to display professionalism and organization in a business.

I will start off with the positives. The hotel's location is excellent and the beds were not bad. Moving on to the negative now. The first night there were banging / construction sounds until past 1:00 a.m. I was not able to get any rest until the noise stopped. The next day I requested to be changed into a room and they said that none would be ready until later in the day but to bring my luggage down and then when I returned from my tour they would give me the key to my new room. When I returned in the evening I request my key and my luggage but I was only given the key. The person at the front desk said he was too buy to give me my things and that he would take it up later on. When I got to the new room, my suitcase was actually there already which was nice but then I discovered that the new room had a sliding door that opened right to the pool and that door was not locked. This made me upset because anyone could have walked into my room from the pool and stolen my things. My first day at the hotel, the pool was open but then they closed it and never reopened it for the other two days that I was at the hotel. At check-out time I asked for a discount of the resort fee which is in addition to the hotel nightly rate. The woman at the front desk told me that the resort fee had nothing to do with the pool and that it was for the complimentary shuttle and ice water (not bottled) at the front desk. No one ever told them there was a complimentary shuttle nor did I ever see it. I am in a wheelchair and asked if the shuttle was accessible. She stated yes but since I never saw it , I cannot confirm this. Lastly, I made my reservation for hotel on the hotel's own website and paid for it with my credit card in full. When I checked in I was told that they were going to put a $100 hold on my other credit card to cover any possible charges (which is odd since they don't even have a restaurant or spa) I made to my room but when I checked my credit card they had actually put a much large hold on my credit. They put a hold for the cost of my entire stay. This made no since to me as I was under the impression that I had already paid for the room with another credit card on their own website. When I questioned the hotel they told me that on my original credit card they had actually only charged me for one night and I still owed the other nights. When I showed them my print out that appeared to show paid in full they pointed to very small print at the bottom that stated that they only actually charged me for one night at that point. This seems like a very inefficient and misleading way to do it. When you make your reservation it makes it seem like you have actually been charged the complete stay but you actually haven't and get charged the remainder at the hotel.","Houston, Texas",16,2.0

The room was clean and had a nice view. We checked out on Saturday to tour some of the other islandsWe returned the following Saturday for four more days and that is when thing went really down hill. We notice upon arrival in our room that things were a bit warm so we adjusted the thermostat to a cooler temperature and went on about our day. When we got back several hours later it was actually warmer than the first time we were in the room. On Sunday I reported to the front desk that it appeared as though the air conditioner was having a problem early the next morning. They sent maintenance who checked things told me the reset the thermostat and that it should take care of the problem. We went to bed and got up the next morning to find it even warmer than the night before.On Monday, I once again reported to the front desk that the air conditioner wasn't working. Again they sent someone to reset the thermostat. This time they told me they would also check on the chiller on the roof. Again when we got up the next morning it was warmer than when we went to bed the night before.On Tuesday I again informed the front desk around 7 am that there was still a problem. I was told that maintenance would look at it as soon as they got in and that the manager would give me a call. I returned to the room around 5 pm and it was still too warm. Around 5:30, 2 maintenance men finally showed up, checked where the thermostat was set and told me that I needed to expect the temperature to be around 75 degrees. And the manager never contacted me.On my way out for dinner I stopped at the desk again and was finally offered a different room. Since I was checking out the next morning I declined to move at 9 pm.Upon checkout I once again let the desk clerk know that I was unhappy with the handling of the problem. I was told that I could expect a phone call from the manager once I got home. Long story short is that I've now been home for 2 weeks and have not heard a word from the manager. I would never stay at the property again. They were good a lip service but didn't make a really attempt to rectify the situation.","Landisburg, Pennsylvania",5,1.0

I made it very clear in the booking that I wanted a twin room. When we got there we were instead given one of the smallest rooms they had overlooking a car park and construction site on the second floor, My ""bed"" was a fold out couch which is certainly not what I had paid for and made the space of the room for two grown people to be tiny. There was no room to swing anything and my idea of a holiday of a lifetime is not to sleep on a fold out couch for 8 nights. Of course I gave my daughter the bed. The state of the room was old and dated chipped and dirty and considering I had saved for years, and travelled a day to get there, I was incredibly disappointed. I paid $200 a night for an exceptually disappointing room.

We are a Kama'aina family and my husband had a Union conference on Monday 9/22/14 and we thought it would be fun to make a weekend out of it. The conference was held at The Ala Moana Hotel, however the room prices there were ridiculous and with a small child (he's 4) their pool is not suited for young children. After researching several properties in the close proximity of the Ala Moana area, I stumbled upon The Aqua Palms. I read the reviews (more positive than negative) and looked at the photos online and price compared to other properties and we decided to give them a try. The main thing that sold us were the pictures of the quaint, child friendly (not deep) pool which showed a CRYSTAL clear and BLUE water pool. We also pleased to see there were a lot of choices for dining within walking distance. Since my husband would be gone all Monday it was important for me to be able to take our son swimming in a pool and not having to walk to a beach. I reserved a City View room. We were all set. As I continued to read reviews up until the day before our arrival, I sent a message via Tripadvisor and requested if possible a room upgrade to the ""ocean view"" room facing the Hilton Hawaiian Village and above the 9th floor (as most reviews said you heard less street noise in rooms higher up) The General Manager graciously said she would put our request in and try to accommodate us. We were pleasantly surprised we got a free upgrade to a ""partial ocean view"" room on the 10th floor. The room was adequate & clean (carpets still damp from being shampooed) but the bathroom was a joke. The door grazes the toilet bowl and you cannot get in the tub without closing the door & awkwardly squeezing yourself between the toilet and sink. We walked out onto our balcony and looked down at the pool and was shocked to see the water murky, dark and GREEN. You could not even see the bottom of the pool and could see a ""film"" on top of the water. Since my son was all waiting all week to swim and because we are in the middle of a heat wave with hot, humid weather , we went down to investigate and to our shock the water looked even worse up close. There was NO MOVEMENT, water smelt stagnant and was definitely green. My son stepped in, my husband followed, I refused. After about 10 mins I told them to get out as it did not look sanitary. I spoke to another family who had been there 10 days already and they stated that the pool was not working the week prior to this but was told it was fixed however the last time they saw it ""CLEAR and BLUE"" was Friday, hello this was now SUNDAY!!! It was evident that the pump was not filtering the water. I went downstairs and spoke to the Bellman and also the Front Desk they both stated that the Maintenance Dept. would look into it. Maintenance radioed back (I could hear) and stated that everything was working but the pump needed time to ""do it's job"" . On Monday morning I got up went outside to see the pool water was not green, but it was not crystal clear either. It was still murky, looked a little better and I could see the bottom a little but it was still not was a normal working pool water should look like. I then called and left a message with the G.M. and she called back explaining that the pump was in fact working, that they closed the pool early on Sunday night (7:45 pm) so that they could retreat and flush the water. Why would they need to do that when the pool closed at 10:00 pm anyway, what would an extra 2 1/2 hours do if in fact pump was working properly. I told her what we witnessed the day prior and seeing it this morning and that there was not even a smell of chlorine while we were there yesterday. She assured me the pump was operational and the pool was safe to swim in. She also stated that ""sometimes on the weekend due to heavy use there is buildup"" Who is she kidding, uhhh we stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki and most recently at the Hilton Waikoloa both 5 star hotels, whose pools are used by 100's if not 1000's of people daily, even more on the weekends and never...never did their pool look like the Aqua Palms. I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and took my son downstairs to swim. The water looked and smelled better than the day before but it was still by far not what the pictures on this site and others portray. We were and are very disappointed. This hotel houses many military families pcs'g in and out, we spoke with several who shared lots of problems they were dealing with during their stay not to mention the pool. Overall the room was clean and adequate the staff was awesome. (excluding the Maintenance staff, we didn't see one our entire stay) For the price it was ok, would we stay here again??? Maybe!!!! They need to start being honest with guests about the problems they are having with equipment and renovations that cause all 3 elevators to be closed down one day (causing a young military family NOT MINE to hike up 12 flights with 2 small children and a stroller)...That is unacceptable!!! In the meantime spending about $20.00 -$30.00 more I could have stayed at a more reliable property with a little better amenities. Makes me irritated to think that the G.M. thought by upgrading our room that somehow made the pool situation ok. Well if the room we stayed in was an upgrade I hate to see what the ""regular"" rooms look like...","Kapolei, United States",5,3.0

Even though they allowed us to store our luggage, we arrived at 11am and had to kill 4 hours to be able to check in. There were quite a few patrons sitting around the small lobby waiting to be allowed to go to their room (It reminded me of a greyhound bus station). The construction people were laying a new tile floor and the small lobby became even smaller because of cones and yellow caution tape. The area where everyone was to check-in had been reduced to about 3-4 feet in width and while I was there even smaller as the guy laying the tiles was backing up into the waiting customers.","Sacramento, California",67,3.0

Everyone was friendly and helpful - a special shout-out to Mike the bell man for helping us with heavy items throughout our stay, always with a great smile and a little time to talk story. Also thanks to Venus and Gennifer at the front desk for excellent service. Cecilia, our housekeeper, cheerfully provided everything we needed, and Tino in maintenance quickly fixed our in-room safe when I couldn't get it to open. All of you are much appreciated. The building is older but reasonably well maintained. There was an odd smell in the lobby that I couldn't identify, although the lobby itself looked clean.Our room was clean but tiny, better suited for one person than two. The king bed was fairly comfortable except for the huge overstuffed pillows. There was a decent selection of TV channels, and WiFi worked well. Unfortunately our room overlooked a construction site, so we were awakened by crashing and banging at 7:30 each morning. The air conditioning system took a long time to cool down the room but maintained the temperature once it got there. The shower stall was sized appropriately for a 10-year-old child; an average sized adult will find it cramped.Since this was a working trip for us, we did not have time to visit the pool so I am unable to comment on that facility.If you plan to park a car at the Aqua Palms, I recommend a smaller vehicle. The parking levels have tight corners, and it takes a bit of maneuvering to get a large SUV into a stall.My biggest complaint with this hotel is that it was overpriced for the lack of space.

Nothing great. I would actually best describe it as ""no frills"" and almost ""bare minimum"". While the staff is very friendly and helpful, I won't return. The first room had a sliding door that wouldn't close properly, so it was very loud from the traffic from the back of the building. The front desk quickly gave me a new room. The new room was much better… sort of. It faced the front of the hotel, on Ala Moana. Very busy street equals very noisy.. even on the 9th floor. But it did have a partial ocean view between the Hawaiian Hilton Village and iIlikai across the street, and a view of Diamond Head in the distance…. quite nice to sit on the balcony and enjoy a glass of wine out there in the evening. The room (#906) was small and a weird layout…. walk down a small hall to the little kitchenette (nice to have the refrigerator and microwave) and a small dresser which blocked the way to the dining table next to the desk and then the bed. All cramped in there… but it was there. The shampoo/soaps were all nice… earth friendly and papaya smelling, but the bathroom itself was lacking. Small and outdated. The bed was ok. The pillows were so uncomfortable and hard that I didn't sleep all week. The room had no phone numbers for front desk or services, so when the toilet stopped up there's was no one to call. I had to go down to the front desk. Again, a friendly staff that took care of it.The location is good to get out of town. It's at the edge of where all the hotels are located…. so for transportation to North Shore or military bases, it's great. For walking, it's a schlep to downdown Waikiki. Starbucks is across the street at Hilton Hawaiian Village, as is the beach, and the path to go for a beach run. I saw fireworks from my room on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. I think they were set from the Hilton. That's where I'll stay next time.

The front of the hotel is not good if you arrive with a rent a car and want to check in.

Housekeeping came everyday and made the bed and gave new towels which was great. The only things that could have been better was that the water in the bathroom from the shower as well as the sink had TERRIBLE water pressure!

I only ever really use hotels as a place to sleep, so I can't speak by way of amenities, but it's definitely somewhere I would book into again.

The rooms were pale and a bit shabby, the internet service was non-existent, but it was affordable at that time and the location was good for me since I had lived around the corner in the Waipuna condo for 5 years in the late 1990's. Now, with the renovations and the upgrade in internet service, I think this hotel is hard to beat, especially if you don't want to be in the chaos of Waikiki. You have the best of all worlds - easy access by foot to Waikiki, affordable stay, very good internet, nice furnishings, a comfortable bed, and a most friendly and helpful staff. We were greeted daily by various staff. Also there is an International House of Pancakes next door and just a few steps away, one of my favorite restaurants in Hawaii, the Wailana Coffee House.

It is a few minutes walk to the bustling part of Waikiki- just down by the marina a bit. It was easy for us to walk to the beach, the farmer's market, shopping- but it might be a bit far for some. The pool needs some umbrellas so we could get some relief from the sun. Oh- we watched the King Kamehameha parade from the balcony- that was fun.

The great location is right across the street from the Hawaiian Hilton Village and just a couple of clocks to the beach. We were upgrade from a Diamond Head view to a Diamond Head and partial ocean view room. It really was a special view especially at night when one could see the lights of downtown Waikiki and the silhouette of Diamond Head It was just a 5 minute walk to Waikiki Beach and 10 minutes to downtown. Dukes on the beach was only 10 minutes away by foot and just around the corner was the Ala Moana shopping center where you could find a very nice grocery store to pick up those snacks or light meal items that we often seek out when on vacation.. My wife and I spent a couple of hours each evening sitting on the Lanai viewing the ocean, Diamond head and Waikiki Beach area and just people watching. We drink more then one glass of wine toasting the wonder of Hawaii and our good fortune for being there. On the downside, and for us it was not much of a downside, the rooms were quite dated and in need of new furniture and carpeting. They had done some work to the bathrooms and need to continue that effort throughout the room. However one must keep in mind that if they in fact put significant resources into updating this hotel you can bet the rates will jump considerably.

We chose Aqua Palms Waikiki for this past weekend based on previous reviews, and this hotel lived up to them.We reserved a room with a king size bed and pull out sofa bed for the kids. We were allowed to check in early, and our sofa bed was already made up and waiting for us which was lovely because I've been to and worked in plenty of hotels that will simply tell you ""The extra blanket is in the closet"" and leave you to make the bed yourself, so walking in and seeing it ready even with us being there a little early was fantastic!The staff were all super friendly and welcoming, no matter who we spoke to. They were quick to answer our every question, and quick to answer the phone if I called down to the front desk. They really understood that they work in the 'hospitality' business. The room and bathroom were clean, water pressure and temperature in the bathroom was good. Everything is within walking distance, once we arrived and parked our car we didn't get back in it until it was time to go home. I've stayed in some other nearby hotels, and so far this is my preferred hotel, the only thing I don't like is the balcony.

Breakfast was provided as well which was pretty good: we were given choices of oatmeal, French toast or pancakes with sausages at the IHOP restaurant every morning.

I'm not that particular as we don't stay in the room long anyway. The bed was a huge king size bed which was comfy and clean with a big LG tv on the wall facing the bed. The channels on the tv were pretty good as well. I watched quite a number of movies and South Park on it. There was a sofa next to the bed which was quite comfortable but it was slightly torn though. The bathroom was decent, it was not as big as I had hoped but it was good enough. Bath and face towels were provided as well as toiletries.

Aside from the 25 dollapur a day parking fee (which I was unaware) and the incredibly tight parking garage, the hotel itself was a positive experience. The folks at the Front Desk were friendly and we were checked in quickly. The hotel room was clean and the Maid Service was very good. I had a problem with operating the safe in our room and notified the Front Desk. A Maintenance man was there within five minutes and remedied the problem. The staff at this hotel takes a lot of pride in the work they do. I've worked in the public sector for several years and I notice all the small details that contribute to a good customer experience. These people have it figured out and it shows from the tidy rooms, the clean pool, and the spotless Front windows that are done every single day. Sure, there are better places to stay, but you won't find a better place to stay in Honolulu than the Aqua Palms in my opinion.

When we arrived the receptionist didn't seem to be aware of our request as first thing we were asked was if we wanted a room with two beds...( I must clarify we are a gay couple, and everywhere we go we get the same question, no matter what requests we make at booking time). We told him that we wanted one bed, on a night floor and with a balcony...we got one bed, on the 8th floor...but no balcony but as we were tired from a long flight from the UK we decided to stay in that room and ask for a balcony later. Later that day I asked if it was possible to have a room with a balcony for the rest of our stay, and we were told that it was ok, however we had to bacate our room by 12 as if it were a normal check out and go back at 3 to check in the new room...it was a bit of an inconvenience but it was worth it to have a balcony. We had vouchers for breakfast in the ihop, and everyday there was a big waiting list to get in for breakfast. Breakfast in the ihop was ok, just ok, edible.It is true that the hotel is a bit dated, but it's clean, good price and good location. You can hear some traffic noise at night but that comes with the location, it not the hotel's fault.On our last day we had and evening flight and a taxi arranged to pick us up at the hotel at 6:30pm. The day before we asked for a late check aou and we were told that we can stay till 1pm if there is availability, or we could pay 79 dollars and stay till 6pm but they told us to ask the day after. On the day we were leaving we asked for the late checkout, we were willing to pay the 79 dollars but the receptionist wasn't very friendly and said that the hotel was full ( vacancy light was on) and that we had to leave by 12, but when he realised we were asking for a paid late check out he changed his mind and he said that it was ok if we were paying...so, the hotel is full if you want to check out one hour late, but if you pay to check out 6 hours late is not full...we thought that we shouldn't pay for the late check out die to the lack of consistency from the hotel.But all in all, we still had a great stay, we know that you get what you pay for and you can't expect a five stars hotel at this price.

It's next to the loud, creaky elevators which run constantly. You'll be disturbed every time anyone else in the hotel flushes a toilet- it sounds like water is gushing into the room. And room 306 is directly above the pool. Terrible location. The room's tiny- which would be fine except that the furniture is arranged so you have to play a puzzle trying to get luggage past a chest of drawers blocking the entrance way. The drapes and sheers are filthy where many grubby hands have yanked them open- so visibly dirty that I really didn't want to touch them. Then there's the mystery grease stain on the lamp, and plug sockets that don't work...The Aqua Palms at Waikiki is recommended if you have a high floor ocean room, so be sure to make sure you don't get stuck with 306!Being next to the elevators and pool is bad luck - I guess someone will always get stuck with a bad location but the plumbing noises, lack of cleanliness and poor layout made our stay- the last few nights of a once in a lifetime vacation island hopping- less than ideal.

There were 9 of us in total with 3 rooms booked.The hotel is located in a convenient location within easy walking distance to the beaches, Duke Kahanamoku lagoon, Ala Moana Shopping Centre, and downtown Waikiki . We could actually see both the ocean and Diamond Head from our rooms. The rooms themselves were a little dated but clean. I'd recommend ear plugs as the air conditioner was a little on the noisy side, and the pull out beds were not the most comfortable. The swimming pool area was nicely maintained with plenty of lounge chairs and provided a place for our family to unwind in the evening (when not watching the sunset on Waikiki Beach).The bell service at the hotel was very friendly and attentive, and helped us with tips for when we were driving around the island, and with arranging our transportation to Pearl Harbor and the airport when we left for Kauai. The front desk service was also friendly and efficient. Don't forget to get your beach/pool towel cards when checking in.They give a 10% discount for breakfasts at the attached IHOP, but I'd recommend the Wailana Coffee House diner just down the street on the corner as a much better option with better prices. If you go there, ask for the macadamia nut pancakes. They're not actually listed on the menu but are available. The all-you-can eat pancakes with eggs and bacon was only $6.65 plus an extra $1.25 or so for the macadamia nuts. Delicious with the coconut syrup! On the Friday night that we were there, we walked to the lagoon and watched a great fireworks show that the Hilton Hawaiian Village displays each Friday at 7:45 pm. After that, we went back to our room. Al little while later, we heard a large bang and looked out the window. They were setting off a second round of fireworks. This time we watched from our balcony and could see most of the show fine from there since we were on the 9th floor. I'm not sure if they always do two shows or if this was an exception, but we really enjoyed it. The one negative with our stay here occurred on the last day. Our flight out of Honolulu was not until the evening, so we had our transportation arranged to pick us up at the hotel at 5:15 pm. We had asked about the possibility of having a late check out time (approx 4 - 5 pm) so we could keep our luggage readily available to us, have a last shower if we headed to the beach/pool, etc. When we were checking out in the morning, the vacancy sign was lit up, but we were told that none of our rooms would be available for a late check out. However, we could pay $79 to keep a room for the day, which my parents decided to do and we chipped in. My brother and his immediate family, and my immediate family then checked out of our respective rooms. We went out for breakfast and returned later and headed to the front desk to ask for from beach towels since my wife, son and I wanted to hit the beach one last time. The clerk's initial response was, ""You already checked out."" She had been present when we had earlier been arranging for my parents to keep their room for the day. So I reminded her that, yes, we checked out, but my parents had paid for a room for the remainder of the day, so she agreed to let us have some towels. Really, the hotel may have been well within their rights to no longer provide service to any of us other than my parents, but come on - you received 15 paid days from our family, and we just wanted to borrow some towels. I was kind of surprised by this since we were treated so well beforehand. Anyway, I considered making this a 3-star review, but I don't think that would be fair based on the rest of our experience. I only include it here for the benefit of hotel management to consider ensuring all staff are aware of the benefits of ""going the extra mile"".Mahalo","Charlottetown, Canada",20,4.0

Breakfast being included in the price is important to us also so to have this was fantastic! Getting to the beach is a short stroll across through the Hilton Hawaiian village and we found a great spot at the lagoon that has plenty of shade to shelter from the strong sun rays. We walked into Waikiki every night except for one night when we went to ala moana and we were not impressed, it's like being in an overpriced Florida mall and even though we found a great sushi restaurant, we walked back to the hotel through a road filled with sex shops/lap dancing clubs and were approached by a few homeless people. I wouldn't recommend walking up to ala moana sc unless you are on a shopping mission. The bars /restaurants down in Waikiki are fantastic! And some great happy hour deals on food and drink!! We loved the managers reception at your hotel, 'sway' was definitely up there with Mai tais as my favorite Hawaiian cocktail. We booked a partial ocean view room and we were on the 11th floor and it had a stunning view. Great view of diamond head also! The pool are was very clean and perfect for us also. The only thing which I would like to suggest is perhaps a parasol or two around the pool for us sun smart people! It was hard to find somewhere in the shade by the pool. The beach towels which you provide are a great asset also!

It looked like a dumping ground for furniture on its way out. It was possibly the spare room they allow their own staff to rest in. We requested a move at the desk while checking in so we luckily were moved the next day. It was a hassle checking out and back in, but I'm so happy the staff made it convenient.Pool was icky, but the deck looked to be a good place for lounging.Overall, we did overpay, but it was Valentines weekend and most places were sold out. A good spot when you're in a pinch. I'd stay again if family insisted on a budget hotel off the strip.","New York City, New York",84,3.0

I really hope to come back (and bring the rest of my family) so hope the proposed renovations do not mean a price hike! I loved all the thoughtful and practical amenities in the room. We stayed 10 nights in Feb in a twin bedded room on the 7th floor, with full lanai, the ""Diamond Head View"" which looks onto the Hilton Village across the road so you can see partial views of the ocean and Fri night fireworks, and Diamond Head. What we loved: Super location -The Bus stop right outside the front door so you can get to Pearl Harbor for $2.50, and the Tapa Towers Bus Depot (walk through path in gardens in Hilton complex)is just across the road for your pickup for Paradise Cove, Polynesian Cultural Centre and other day trips. Your airport shuttle will come right to this hotel and the lobby is one of its best features - friendly, tables, chairs & sofas, free apples, coffee and iced water and is the place for fun Manager's reception party every Thursday night - free cocktails and chips & dips and live band! More about location: right across the road for start of Waikiki beach. Easy walks to free Army museum; Ala Moana shops, lots of restaurants also the great Fabric Mart. The Palms has a fast easy checkout. The staff are super friendly and helpful and quick to respond if you need more coffee or clean towels. Everything was clean and nice, the sheets were beautifully crisp. More of what we loved: SUPER comfortable beds - must have invested in top quality mattresses. Also: full length mirror in main room (great for 3 gals in room); iron & ironing board;s proper coathangers; roomy bathroom with quite long vanity benchtop; microwave; filter coffee maker;( for breakfast in your room just buy some disposable plates etc). Table & chairs as well as desk; more chairs & table on lanai; beachtowels and beach chairs on loan for free, you get a special card for this; air conditioning works well. 3 elevators work well and fast. Used the pool a couple of times when we wanted a quick dip before going out. There is a BBQ too. From the pool you can see the fireworks - there were fireworks on Tues & Thurs as well - maybe another hotel in addition to the Hilton? Anyways be sure to get in quick by 7:00pm at the Hilton lagoon pool for the great show before the fireworks start at 7:45pm sharp Fridays. The beach gets packed! The rates at the Palms are reasonable because they do not have room service which I would never use anyway. Win! There are plenty of places to eat nearby and the ABC stores have great fresh sandwiches etc. if you want a quick snack to save time. The only issue I can think of was some inconsistent housekeeping - on our last night we came back to our room at 3:30pm and it hadn't been serviced yet which was disappointing as we wanted clean towels etc. before going out again. So we just organised clean towels and coffee refills. Another day we returned in the afternoon to find the bathroom light on, no bathmat and the pillows not yet arranged, and the sliding door to the lanai wide open as though the maid had been interrupted. I conclude that she had run out of bathmats and had gone to get some and forgot to come back to finish our room. No harm done, human error, we were 7 floors up thankfully. We just found the late cleaning of room inconvenient as we would often like to go out in the morning then come back to a cleaned room for a power nap before heading out again. Maybe the 12:00 checkout all makes the housekeeping timetable late all round. I'm just used to 10:00am checkout. We liked the cute palm them décor, I sincerely hope renovations do change anything too much. We're saving up to come back! Aussies this is a great value friendly hotel but bear in mind there are no more than 2 beds in each room. Mahalo, it was our first time to Hawaii and we had a wonderful time.","Sydney, Australia",44,5.0

The pool is small, but sufficient and clean. The parking garage is small so don't get a giant car, but it's easy enough to get the hang of after the first time. The road noise is annoying, but it's from about 7am to 7pm and I think if you had a road facing room at the Hilton across the street you would have the same problem for double the money.

Walking distance to Ala Moana Mall and beach is right down the street. There is an IHOP located next to the hotel and you get a discount if you show your hotel key card. They have all sorts of special rates and I found out that it was cheaper to book directly through the hotel by calling them than on discount travel websites. If you want to be close to the mall stay there. If you want to be close to central Waikiki stay at the Aqua Wave. Otherwise it's a $8 cab ride to get to a better beach where the surfing is and all the restaurants are. It's not too too far of a walk though if you don't mind walking with all of your stuff for staying on budget. This is a great hotel. By far the best staff for friendliness and helpfulness. I had a quick and painless checkout. There were no unexpected charges on my bill. Exactly what I was quoted. Free wifi in room which works great and the A/C worked great too. Housekeeping was there everyday to clean and restock shampoo etc. Elevators - there are three. You never have to wait long. Has a pool.

So they very kindly moved us to a front facing room (5th floor overlooking the front street). It was fine for me but as it was still too noisy for my light sleeping partner, we decided to move to a different hotel.

The other reviews are spot on with the description of the street noise. We had a Lanai with chairs and sat out there several times just taking in the beautiful view. The street noise was bothersome the first night, but a simple use of the room fan helped to block out the street noise on the second night. The hotel was reasonably priced hotel for the area and although I think that charging for parking is ridiculous, this is common with most of the hotels in the area. We arrived fairly late and the reception desk's suggestion of getting a quick bite to eat from the Wailana Coffee House at the end of the block was very helpful.

We had a room on the 9th floor and we still had to close the balcony door when watching TV.Check in was efficient, although the staff had only partial items of our package. This became a nuisance as I had to constantly follow up with the front desk staff to get the rest of the items from our package. There was never an apology offered, we checked in on a Monday and on Friday we finally got most of the items from the package.Room was clean and roomy, although the room started to show its age. The room has a private balcony with two chairs and a small table. We also had a sofa and a table with 2 chairs in the room. The bathroom was very small, only one person fits at the time. The shower head needed to be replaced as there was hardly any water coming out.There is a small kitchen cabinet with a microwave and a refrigerator there too.Housekeeping was good and efficient. The restocking of bathroom amenities was rather interesting as some days we got only shampoo, other days we got shampoo and conditioner and then on two occasions we got also bath gel. Every day we got a different brand, it looked like that they were trying to finish up old products.Room had free wi-fi, which was a big plus.We booked a room with partial ocean view and when you book a room of this category our higher you have breakfast included. The hotel itself does not have a restaurant, You are issued breakfast vouchers for the adjacent IHOP restaurant. There you have 3 options. Unfortunately the service at the restaurant was not that great. I assume that the service staff was not too worried since the gratuity was already covered by the voucher. They have a coffee machine in the lobby 24 hours a day and during the main day hours there is also free water. There is also a basket with apples at the front desk.Parking is, as noted by other reviewers, kind of difficult at first. We had to check in first to get our room key to open the gate to the garage, but after that it was pretty easy. I would not recommend to rent a large car as some of the spaces in the garage and the ramps with its curves are rather tight. Parking is $25 a day with in and out privileges.We would probably stay there again, because of its price-value. If the hotel was more expensive it would not be worth it. Also the staff needs to make sure that when guests are booking a package everything is ready at check in. The guests should not have to inquire for 4 days before the problem is being solved..","San Diego, California",32,3.0

The reviews were right on, in my opinion. The only BIG negative was I booked on the Aqua website and received a military/gvt rate as my husband in active duty military. They showed a rate of $140ish before taxes per night, we booked two nights, I paid for the 1st night upfront. Upon checkout, he tells me I owe $204, when I asked why the price difference he simply stated ""oh, your rate changed"". What could I do at this point, I'm not a cheap person so I wasn't about to argue, so I paid it. But, I've never had that happen at any hotel/motel I've stayed and wouldnt stay again simply for that reason. Positives: fantastic staff, clean hotel, great location.

Our party had two rooms on the 5th floor -- one with two queen beds and one with a king bed + sofa bed. Both rooms had microwaves and mini-fridges. Our rooms were at the back of the hotel facing a construction site. Construction began at 7am each weekday; we could hear the noise through our balcony door, but it was not terribly disruptive. As noted by other reviewers, the hotel's location makes it a great choice for anyone interested in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. We walked to the beach at Fort DeRussy Beach Park and went to the military museum there. We also took advantage of the dining options at the Hilton Hawaiian Village across the street. I was really impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff at the Aqua Palms. Everyone, from the housekeeping staff to the bell man to the front desk staff, greeted us daily and offered advice when asked. A front desk employee pointed us to the Shore Bird at one of the Outrigger properties for breakfast... It was perfect! A different front desk employee directed us to the beach at Fort DeRussy. The kindness and politeness of every employee we encountered made us feel welcome and comfortable during our stay. I agree with other reviewers that the parking lot is very tight and a little dangerous (parking was $25/night). However, there are so many buses and trolleys to take you to some of the main attractions that you may not need a car. I also agree with other reviewers that this is not really a boutique hotel. It is a middle-tier property with a great location. That said, we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay and would stay at the Aqua Palms again.","Chicago, Illinois",11,4.0

Problem arose when we were informed on our first stay that the hotel does not store bags for returning guests. We were advised to use their recommended third party service or store the bags at the airport. Various excuses were made why they couldn't store bags overnight and none being the same from those we inquired. So if either of the aforementioned bag storage options are not a problem or inconvenience, this hotel could be an option for your stay in Honolulu. Each time we were given high floor ""city view"" rooms which were clean and nicely appointed with a comfortable king bed, big screen TV, microwave, coffee maker and mini-frig. The problem here was that the hotel never mentioned the 2 buildings under construction directly behind the hotel. Anyone wanting to sleep past 7:00 AM will find it almost impossible with the noise of hammering and movement of construction equipment. While I fully understand that the Aqua Palms Hotel has no control over this construction, they are aware of it and in turn, could advise guests of this situation. As the ""Vacancy"" sign was up, guests could have been given another room location option(s) other than ""city view"", even without asking. As for the hotel's location, it's very good. The westbound downtown Honolulu bus stop was some 30 yards to the right from the front door and the eastbound returning stop was 3 minutes away across Ala Moana and down Kalia St. A tip: If you're traveling light (small carry-on suitcase/bag) take the #19 or #20 bus from the airport departure area ( 2nd floor) at the bus stop across the street from the building. The ride is $2.50/adult, $1.50/child and only $1.00 for seniors with a Medicare Card. After 50-60 minutes, get off at the Kalia St. stop by the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Another interesting thing happened that never occurred before at any of our other extensive hotel stays, either in the U.S. or overseas. In her Thursday night manager's reception, the hotel manager blatantly solicited favorable Trip Advisor reviews when addressing attendees in her welcome spiel. In summary, it was an OK stay at the Aqua Palms Waikiki but that's the best I would rate the stay. For those only staying in Honolulu and not using it as a home base to visit the other islands, you should find the hotel sufficient for your needs. Will we stay here again?

My only concern was for a tray in the room that was on the counter above the refrigerator. It was not clean and when I moved it several very small bugs came out from the wood that was around the tray. This was very unpleasant and I quickly placed the tray outside of my room with a note telling housekeeping to not put a tray back in my room. If these trays are in all of the rooms at the Aqua Palms Management should remove them because apparently they are a good hiding place for bugs. Also, it does appear that this hotel needs some newer furniture. A cabinet in the room looked like something that should be placed in the used furniture dump. This being said, the rest of the furniture in the room was adequate. The bed, bedding,towels were clean and well kept. Overall cleanliness in the room was good.

I called the front desk and they moved me across the hallway. normally, I wouldn't even make a fuss, but they put me in another room that was cleaned by the SAME housekeeper.

My new room (312) wasn't as worn looking as the other, but I don't care as long as it's clean and this one still had issues.

The patio doors to the balcony have no soundproofing qualities so can be quite noisy and the air con, although efficient had to be switched off at night as it was so loud. There is no restaurant or dining room, just the IHOP next door which we found to be expensive and the food was overly rich and sickly. There are better places to eat in Waikiki. Aqua Palms has no public areas at all apart from a lobby with a fairly small seating area. The staff on the front desk were always very helpful and twice printed maps for me. Clean beach towels are provided whenever you need them. There is a concierge desk where they will book tours for you. The ones we did were amazing.I had seen the hotel described as a boutique hotel and spa, which I don't think is an up to date description (I asked at the desk and they no longer have a spa). the swimming pool is on a roof terrace which is clean and well stocked with loungers and a few tables, however it is small (felt crowded on the afternoon there was six people there).

Slightly on the small side but really we didn't mind as we were only there to sleep and with comfortable beds, I really didn't care much. Places to eat - with the Hilton Village across the road you really don't have to stray too far to find somewhere to eat. We haven't had any meals as such yet, but will probably before we leave. Also easy access through to the beach by walking through the Hilton. If you need caffeine, there are several Starbucks located in there. Shopping - if you love shopping like we do, Ala Moana centre is a big big mall and is only 12 mins walk away from the hotel. There's Macy's in there, Nordstrom and so much more. Hilton Village also has lots of little stores in there to shop. Another shopping strip is Kalakaua Avenue. There's Sephora, Ralph Lauren, Victoria Secrets, Tiffany's and others.

This hotel is perhaps a 10 minute walk, at most, from the Waikiki Beach/shops, etc. A nice and safe walk on the streets, the beach would take a bit longer. It is directly across the street from the Hilton, and using that beach was easy and beautiful. We chose a higher floor, 8th, with partial ocean/Diamond Head view. Definitely go higher..there was some traffic noise, but nothing that interfered with sleeping. The view was nice, but worth the extra dollars, I am not certain. We saw the beach and Diamond head from a thousand other places and we we didn't spend enough time in the room to enjoy it! The parking garage is tiny. Even parking our compact car was challenging at times. $25 a night to park, which I guess is pretty much the going rate. Our rate included a select breakfast at the attached IHop, which was very good. The front desk, and all who worked there were very pleasant and helpful. Fresh ice water and fruit in the lobby, and a informal gathering Thursday night with apps and their yummy sway drink in the lobby. The room was beautiful, roomy, with a comfortable bed, nice hairdryer, refrigerator, ironing board. I couldn't have asked for more. We had been checking out hotels for months before we chose, and at that time we signed up for their email specials.

That said, I had a short solo stay in Waikiki and I grabbed a quick night (at a fairly good price) at the Aqua Palms Hotel (and Spa?) and I was really disappointed, even with little expectation going in.Frankly, the hotel is in dire need of a renovation as it appears they have used the ""lipstick"" maintenance method for many years beyond its usefulness. The facility and rooms are dirty, broken, worn, smelly, loud and in an overall state of distress. While I was staying alone for a business stop, I would have been truly disappointed if this stay was supposed to fulfill a ""vacation"" accommodation, despite the excellent location right off the beach.I would avoid the hotel until you can confirm a bonafide renovation.

This was despite me reiterating at check-in that we booked 2 queen beds, but they were apparently out of such rooms. The pull-out was really uncomfortable and whoever slept on it (we rotated) woke up with a headache the next morning.The PowerPoint in the bathroom (room 1204) didn't work and we had to plug the hair dryer in a PowerPoint in main room to use it. Also, the wifi didn't connect. They sent up the technician and he fixed it, but it only stayed fixed for 5 minutes or so. It seemed like it kept shorting out. I ended up unplugging the wifi connection in our room and then it worked perfectly (I assume I was using the wifi signal from the next room). I suspect there is a problem with the electrics in this room.However, the room itself was a good size, the view from the balcony was nice, we had a fridge, a microwave and a coffee maker plus some cutlery and crockery which was great. The tv was good with a decent number of cable channels. Housekeeping also did a great job.It is about a 10-15 min walk to the International Marketplace and a less than 10 min walk in the opposite direction to Ala Moana shopping centre. It is only a few minutes walk to the beach (in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village).There are numerous restaurants nearby and iHop is downstairs. I was not advised when we checked in that we were entitled to a free breakfast at iHop every morning, and I didn't find this out until our last night so we unfortunately bought breakfast elsewhere every morning (Snappers has a yummy $3.99 breakfast). The iHop breakfast wasn't on the website when I booked so maybe it was introduced after I booked (even though the room was the same price as what I paid) and perhaps I wasn't entitled to it which is why they didn't mention it? I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an economical alternative to the Hilton Hawaiian Village, as you are in a similar location, can use the lagoon but pay less than half what you'd pay at the Hilton.Parking is expensive, so on the days I booked a rental car to drive to the North Shore I picked the car up in the morning and returned it that night to avoid paying for parking.

Parking costs $25/night with a cramped garage - be careful on the turns.

We booked the Aqua Palms for July 20-22 before flying on to Maui,and I chose the hotel after previously staying at Aqua Ilikai Hotel, also in Honolulu, last September. I chose the Aqua Palm for the price and location, both of which were good for peak season in Honolulu (mid- to late-July). However, the air conditioning is terrible. Not just a little inadequate -- truly awful. The humidity level in our room was extraordinarily high, easily 70 percent. When I reported it to the front desk late the first night, the staff member gave me a fan to use until maintenance could fix the AC. Thank goodness for the fan or I don't think we could have slept at all.The next morning, I put in another request for maintenance to check the AC and to open the broken safe in our room. A maintenance staff member came to our room right away, but when I mentioned the AC, he sheepishly admitted that no one would be fixing it. I was left with the impression it was either too costly a fix or not a priority because it was a major system problem. The halls are cooler than the rooms, possibly because they have separate wall units. Too bad they can't add those in the rooms. We kept the fan and limped through our second night, but after we took showers and packed the next morning, we were so sweaty and hot that we couldn't get out of the Aqua Palms fast enough. I found the front desk staff to be kind and sympathetic about the lack of air conditioning. The front desk area was sweltering, too. As compensation for our discomfort, the $25/day self-parking fee was deducted from our bill. At $200/night, it probably wasn't really enough for how miserable we were, but I just wanted to leave. If you can handle no air conditioning, then this hotel is probably OK for you. It's not fancy, but it's passable. We liked the location, but if you're only in Honolulu for a few days, you can probably just stay further out from Waikiki and save money that way. If I had known about the AC problems before I booked, I would have gone elsewhere.One more thing: I'm not sure this hotel has an option for two double beds. We had two rooms for six people, and in both rooms, the second bed was a very uncomfortable sofa sleeper.","Kansas City, Missouri",2,2.0

We stayed at the Aqua Palms Waikiki. It was slightly under $300. nightly and $25. daily for parking. When we first arrived we paniced because there is ""a lot"" of traffic and congestion and their sign(like all others is tiny. We had to park in front of the lobby and partially on the sidewalk after having missed it 2 or three times even using a GPS. Once we checked in we had to drive a very, very high incline in order to get to the extremely tight parking garage. Parking in and out was very challenging. On one day of our 8 day stay they ran out of water for about 32 hours. We had returned tired and sweaty and could not clean ourselves. In the morning they still had not fixed the water. The rooms were okay and clean but quite older accomodations. We had a small partial view across the street of the ocean and our patio was tiny with one chair missing and fabric on remaining chair worn of sun rot. The staff was fairly friendly. One redeeming value was there were many places nearby to eat and tons and tons of ABC convenience stores. Their pool was pretty small and they have one small barbecue grill. Their exercise room was fair but no fans with one eliptical machine and one treadmil and very limited free weights. If it wasn't that it WAS Waikiki, I would say that it was well over priced but the Hilton across the street is substantially more.

Found the Aqua Palms through an internet search for a hotel. Since we have already taken numerous trips this year and more to come I was trying to go as inexpensive as possible. My husband is a bit of a hotel snob and wasn't happy we weren't staying at a resort. He was however happy when he saw the price and went along with my choice. I called the hotel a couple days before and was assisted in making transportation arrangements and planning our trip while we were there. All very easy. After a horrible trip over from Arizona we were so happy to walk into a large, comfortable room. Plenty of space for our 6 day stay. It's right across from a major resort that we were able to take advantage of as if we were staying there. The trolly stops right in front of the hotel for drop off and across the street for pick up. The hotel gave us a map and helped direct us on how to use the trolly which was simple actually. The room is very clean and we actually liked being able to walk out onto the balcony and see all the hustle and bustle. We still had a great view of the ocean and once we closed the door all noise was completely shut out. Every time I called the front desk they answered right away. They give free use of beach towels and chairs which the resort charges a fee for. May need updating in the future, but I think it is fine at this time. We used the laundry facilities while we were there and all was good. Did not use the pool, but noticed many young children there. Ours are older so we hit the beach instead. We were very happy with our stay and would recommend it to those not wanting to spend a lot and still get the use of a resort. The only reason I am not giving this hotel a 5 point rating is that their wifi is horrible. I was not able to use at all. I used my hot spot instead. If this isn't important to you then I would say it's a great place to stay. Aloha!","Mesa, Arizona",4,4.0

We got a great online deal for a Partial Ocean View Lanai room at Aqua Palms. It was the best rate that I found for hotels in Waikiki on the days that we were there! We had a view of Diamond Head and the ocean. Aqua Palms Waikiki is right across the street from the Hilton Village. We were only there for 3 days at 2 nights, but I loved the location. It was about a 7-10 minute walk to the beach and it's far away enough from the night-life/commotion of luxury row and the downtown area (we got great sleep at the Aqua Palms!).I was impressed with the service from the moment we arrived. Our flight got in from Japan around 0730 and we arrived to the hotel by 0845. Even though check-in isn't until 3pm, our room was ready and we were welcomed warmly. Because we were celebrating our anniversary, we were upgraded to a room on the penthouse floor. It was awesome getting to stay on the top floor! The view was great and the room was very quiet. The Partial Ocean View rooms are quite spacious. Upon entering, there was a little ""hallway"" with a closet; the bathroom had double sinks and a separate area for the toilet; then another door separated the actual bedroom (which included sleeping area, table with two chairs, small wet bar, and the lanai). The hotel provides towels and beach chairs for guests to use free of charge during their stay. They also provided great maps and recommendations for places to eat and places to visit. After our first day out, we were surprised to find an anniversary gift from hotel management -- chocolate covered macadamia nuts and a bottle of champagne! It was so thoughtful and a great touch. On Thursdays there is a manager's reception with live music, light snacks, and a signature cocktail. We really enjoyed this! It was also a nice, value-add that the hotel has. We didn't have any problem with the wifi connection -- which is always very important! It worked great!A short 5 minute walk gets you to Hale Koa (the military hotel). The Hale Koa was booked when we were in Waikiki, but it was nice being close to it in order to use the NEX and other military amenities. We went ""downtown"" for eating and shopping both nights that we were in Waikiki. The walk was approximately 30 minutes, but it was an easy/pleasant walk. We could have taken the bus, but the weather was really nice and the walk is actually enjoyable. If you don't want to make the walk, there are a lot of places to eat and things to do around the hotel.The reason that I gave a rating of ""average"" for cleanliness is because we noticed that the floor in our bedroom wasn't cleaned well. When we were making sure that we packed everything, my husband checked under the bed and there was an empty water bottle that wasn't ours. Also, I'm almost certain that there was a piece of cookie or some food on the floor near the table in our room, but I didn't want to touch it. I didn't complain about these small things because we didn't stay long and it wasn't enough to ruin our stay. Everything else in the room was very clean and up to par.","Naples, Italy",52,4.0

You do get wifi in your room, but if you need to update pictures and stuff, you need to go downstairs and use the wifi from the reception, which is a pain because you need to ask a code each time. The first day it did worked but not the second, the reception sent an IT guy in my room, and he confessed to me that there is only one modem for the whole building, explaining the slow internet. Parking; 20 dollars a day, no discount if you stay 2 weeks which is really disappointing.

We had originally booked a room at a very popular hotel across from Waikiki Beach, but we changed our minds after researching more about the Aqua Palms - and we are sure glad we did! It was so quiet yet we were close to everything. We could catch the bus or the trolley right out front, which was very convenient. We were able to walk to the beach, shopping centers, and restaurants. It was so nice to be close enough to the busier sections of the city and have the choice to return to peace and quiet. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. We checked in late in the evening and requested a King bed and private lanai, which the front desk staff member graciously granted. Each time we checked out and returned beach towels, we were greeted with a smile. The concierge booked a tour for us we decided to take on short notice. She was very helpful and provided a wealth of information. The Thursday evening manager's reception was delightful. Their signature cocktail was quite tasty. The live music and light refreshments were fun to return to after a day of touring the island. We appreciated the refreshing ice cold lemon water in the lobby that was always available. The front desk gladly made change for us whenever we asked. When it was time to check out, a staff member booked us a shuttle to the airport and stored our bags for the day until our shuttle picked us up later that evening. We had a room on the eighth floor with a partial ocean view and a view of Diamond Head. It was fantastic! The room size was ample - far from being cramped. Although the bathroom was on the small side, there were plenty of toiletries and towels. The water pressure was awesome and we always had hot water. The bed was super comfortable, along with the pillows. I especially loved that there were five pillows! The room had a fridge and microwave, which came in handy allowing restaurant leftovers to be turned into a late night snack. We did not experience any inconveniences with the elevators. We did not utilize the parking garage, the pool, or workout facilities, but the pool looked great - nice and clean with plenty of lounge chairs. I really cannot complain about this property.

We rented a midsize car (Chrysler 200) and parking structure was a bit of a problem if you couldn't find a parking at level 1 due to will not make it to level 2 due to very narrow lane when making the turn.","San Jose, California",1,4.0

The rooms are adequate but the big screen TVs have terrible reception and are snowy (so what's the point of having a big screen TV?).

Instead, the wifi is only available to guest in the lobby and ""complimentary"" means 10% off at the most expensive IHOP I have ever encountered. I understand the prices are increased because of tourism, however, the inclusion of breakfast was an important reason for choosing the Aqua Palms. Additionally, both of the rooms my friends and I were staying in (4 people per room) had one bed and one pull-out sofa. The pull-out sofa was incredibly uncomfortable and some of our party experienced back pain from their nights on the sofa mattresses. It is really unheard of for a hotel room meant to accommodate four people to not have two actual beds.That being said, the location is wonderful and the staff I interacted with were all incredibly friendly and helpful. During my stay, a water main broke on the street resulting in flooding, a broken elevator, and the lack of water for several hours. The staff handled the situation beautifully.

I booked the room several months early and got a very good rate for Waikiki. The thing about Oahu is that there are not many hotels that are outside of Waikiki except for very large expensive resorts. All I want in a hotel room is that it is clean, safe, relatively inexpensive, and easy to get into and out of. This hotel met all the criteria. Parking is $20 at the hotel and I never had trouble finding a space. The wired internet in the room was very fast and reliable. The room included good working A/C, a mini fridge, and a microwave. Overall, the hotel is getting a bit old but the management is responsive and responsible, and the rooms are well maintained and clean. The only complaint I had about my stay (and this is not the fault of the hotel) is that there was construction going on below my room, which was on the ""city side"" of the hotel rather than the side facing the ocean. A pile driver and construction noise started at 7AM every day and went on until 5PM. Luckily I am not sensitive to noise but this would have driven most people crazy. The other problem I encountered was that the hotel messed up my reservation and sent me several emails that my stay had been cancelled. I had to call the hotel about six times over six months to re-confirm and explain the situation (I had booked originally through booking.com but then cancelled that reservation and booked directly; somehow the hotel got confused). The hotel manager(s) took care of this problem but it did cause some worry. I was on the 11th floor, I was told that the larger rooms had a sofa (I asked for a larger room); there was a bit of wait for the elevators sometimes but not a big problem, and the room was fine.",California,23,4.0

The only negative I really experienced was the lack of wifi in rooms. However, there was a LAN line available for Internet if I had a laptop available. The reason I list this as a negative is that I clearly was not the only one with the problem, as the hotel lobby was constantly filled with guests using the Internet.

I highly recommend room 1109 because it has a wonderful view of neighboring buildings and way off in the background mountains with houses on them, all very picturesque. I felt appreciated by the staff when I checked in and glad that they followed up on my request for a high floor. The room was clean and the pillowtop bed extremely comfortable. My one tiny complaint is that I was rudely awakened at 1AM by a clock alarm, so it would have been great if when they readied the roomfor the new person they checked to make sure no alarm was set. I couldn't fall back to sleep forhours, but i got my bearings in the coming days. Shane on the tourism desk was really friendly and he booked my submarine trip which was an amazing experience. I found being on Oahu expensives some times and very reasonable other times. On my final day I spent a whopping$2.50 to go round trip to the North Shore (Turtle Bay Resort to be exact) on the city bus system which took over 2 hours each way. Another wonderful thing that happened at Aqua Palms was on Thursday they had live entertainment which consisted of a singer and a guitar player of Hawaiian music. I sort of at first wasn't sure about being in the center of all the action of Waikiki and thought maybe I should have gotten a hotel more off the beaten track, but it was exactly the right place for me, and very conveniently right around the block was a decent sized grocery store called Food Pantry. I ate the majority of my meals at the Wailana Coffee House which was no more than one half block from my hotel and the food was decent and just having some pineapple was a great welcome to the islands, Everyone in that coffee shop was friendly and it is a fact that the Hawaiian people are very warm and hospitable, and when you show the room key from the Aqua Palms they deduct 10% off what is already a reasonable bill. Another plus of the hotel was despite the numerous amount of guests the elevators were very prompt, and I recall there were at least 3 of them. I definitely will go back one day and stay at Aqua Palms, there were many things I did not get to do so it would be good to go back. One more tip don't spring for an expensive cab ride to the airport, right in front of the hotel on Ala Moana get the 19 or 20 bus to get to the airport in about an hour. ($2.50) just tuck your carry on under your seat and you will fit right in on the bus. Also if you go to Ala Moana Shopping Center and to their bus hub grab the 57 bus to go out to Kailua which is a suburb of Honolulu and a lovely trip over the green mountains. One of the worlds top 11 beaches is fairly close to the town center, it took my breath away. ($2.50 RT) I had a delicious meal out there and enjoyed every moment of avoiding Winter,Now i am back in NYC and it is snowing, oh well Spring must be right around the corner, I was first going to take the trolleys, but being an avid walker, I did a lot of that and really learned the city of Honolulu to some degree. I also highly recommend the Honolulu Museum of Art, it is housed in a beautiful building with gorgeous courtyards, and outdoor sculptures and Islamic and Indonesian Art plus a whole huge area of contemporary art, and also wonderful old Hawaiian paintings. I wanted to go to the home of Doris Duke who was one of their benefactors, which was only a short van ride away, and the museum had a great video on her estate, but they were sold out for that until after my trip. Maybe next time. One more thing on the hotel, unlike some places I did not hear a peep through the walls, it was very sound proof. There is also an excellent Thai restaurant right across the road from Wailana Coffee House. I'm so glad that I finally made it to Oahu. !!! MB Silver","Bronx, New York",23,5.0

Somehow it seems rather unfair to compare an apple to an orange, so note that I am rating this hotel in comparison to what I would expect from a 21/2-3 star hotel. That being said, there were definitely some issues that you will want to consider while you are looking for a place to stay. These are the cons:1) Firstly, my room had a ""city"" view and the street noise was rather loud. One morning there was some sort of race going down Ala Moana Blvd starting at 5 am so there was a lot of loud cheering. There seems to be no noise insulation at all. Luckily, I was already awake because I was still on California time. I am personally not sensitive to noise, but in reading many hotel reviews over the years I recognize that some people are very sensitive and will want to consider this. 2) Also, my room did not have a balcony, more of a 1 foot ledge. Although I noticed the room next door to me did. If this is important to you, make sure you book a room with this option. 3) The pool is small and shallow (3-4ft), so if you like a nice pool, you may want to look elsewhere. However, why would you want a nice pool when there are beautiful beaches all around you? 4) The hotel restaurant is an IHOP. I am not a huge fan of IHOP food, so this was a con for me, but do note the location is great and there are plenty of other places to eat. 5) Finally, the rooms are somewhat outdated, but not horribly so.Now to the pros… I will honestly say there were definitely more pros than cons.1) Price -Although this hotel may not be cheap compared to other locations in the US, for Waikiki it is very affordable. I was here for work and since I work for a non-profit the budget was tight. This was the only hotel within this price range in Waikiki that did not have horrible reviews with multiple complaints. 2) The staff was very kind and helpful and everyone always had a smile and was willing to help in any way they could.3) The rooms were clean and well kept.4) The hotel has beach towels and beach chairs for guest use.5) There is parking available (con is that parking cost $20/night).6) The location is terrific. You can walk to Ala Moana and to the main strip in Waikiki. The Beach is close by as well. The location for this price is an outstanding value.7) There was a refrigerator, microwave and safe in the room.8) There is an affordable restaurant on site (but as stated above it is IHOP).9) Rooms are good size.You can see, the pros outweigh the cons. Most of the cons were not even cons for me personally. For a 21/2-3 star hotel this is a good buy in my opinion. If I had reason to stay in Honolulu in the future, I would definitely stay here. This is my third visit to HI, but my first time staying in Honolulu because I was here for work (for vacation we've stayed in Lanikai). But if you are looking for a place to stay where you can be part of the action in the heart of Waikiki I would recommend this place.","San Diego, California",2,4.0

Our expectations were metThe hotel is a reasonable size facing onto the busy and noisy Ala Moana Boulevard and across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village.We had a Diamond Head View room on the front; it was noisy day and night with sirens and traffic in general even though we were on the 6 floor. We did ask to move to the back of the building but the rooms were smaller and the bathrooms tiny. We stuck with the original room 602 which was a decent size with a balcony. However the bathroom was small and the lighting was such that there were 2 over the sink and none over the shower so it seemed dark.The room had a coffee maker, microwave and fridge with an icemachine outside the door as well. There was free coffee in the lobby along with apples and lemon waterWifi was not expected in the room though they are hardwired and usable for free (most of us had tablets so not much help). The real pain with the wifi was that everytime you wanted to log in you had to get another code from reception, which sometimes meant a wait when you maybe only wanted to check your email or finalise a trip.The bed was comfortable and sheets/towels changed regularly. The toiletries were not too bad either if you came without.There is an IHOP attached to the hotel which was useful for an early substantial breakfast. We were 2 mins walk from a Hiking Cafe which did really excellent coffee, paninis and such stuff, so most days we went there.The main advantage of the hotel was the proximity to things, we had a bus stop outside the hotel which was useful for the bigger trips to Pearl Harbour and the like. We were 10 mins walk to Ala Moana shopping centre and close enough to walk along the beach or roads into WaikikiWe had a car for a week and parked at the Harbour beside the Hilton, during the week they have a 24 hour special for $12 and at other times there is either free parking or special offers worth considering. It was well lit and worth the 5 min walk not to have to pay for the higher charges in the hotel.We used the laundry facilities but beware the hotel sells powder etc for a reasonable $125 per pack but we found it in the ABC stores that you trip over on every street corner for less and you don't have to make change to buy that (although reception was more than happy to assist in supplying the change).On the whole for the price we paid my only gripe was the road noise that we could not do anything about, otherwise reasonable value for money if you are staying a while but if you want something for a short trip or something special look elsewhere","Calgary, Canada",35,3.0

Was a pain having to go to the lobby everytime we used the WiFi. Our room was described as Partial Oceanview. Could only see the ocean if we went out by the pool, and parted the palms on the palm tree. (Our room was located on the same floor as the pool.)

This was a let down. You can do great things with old buildings, but that's not the case here. This ""boutique"" hotel affixes a cheap once-flashy and unconvincing, tired veneer to a run down building that shows its age. The public spaces and rooms show too many halfway attempts at minimal, low-budget modernization. Today the wallpaper, carpet and draperies are well-worn, stained and depressing. Furnishings are utterly basic and show their age.The lobby level staff was average; upstairs we fared better some days then others with the thoroughness of the cleaning staff. You get what you pay for.Wireless exists only in the lobby, and the building restaurant is an IHOP. Those should be clarion clues to where this hotel rests in the hierarchy. We encountered a hooker in the hall on the first night, and a shady thuggish teenaged duo lurking around one of the parking levels on the second. Were I a parent, I wouldn't let my kids venture to the vending machine or pool unescorted.With high expectations and keen competition driving the market up and down Waikiki, Aqua Palms isn't a contender. Yes, you'll want to spend all the time you can outside your room and hotel when you're in Oahu, and many options are overpriced. But by defnition you've spent a lot of money to travel this far to enjoy all that Honolulu and the environs have to offer. You can surely find a better loding alternative in your budget that will bring a more positive experience.","Madison, Wisconsin",131,2.0

We were greeted with the aloha spirit even though it was close to 10pm when we were checking in. Our room was a standard room - we didn't need much space and the housekeeping staff was great! They even left a handwritten note one morning which I appreciated upon my return to my room. Previous reviews about the dated decor remain true however I was more concerned about cleanliness than whether we had state of the art technologies etc. The bathroom was clean and I was really happy to see the shower curtain wasn't dirty or moldy! What I was also thankful for was the gated parking structure - this enabled me to feel secure knowing that my car and belongings were safe (or safer than if we had parked in an open structure). I also enjoyed the proximity to everything - there was a block party on Kalakaua that we were able to walk to - very convenient. Also, I loved that it was so close to Wailana's! A couple downsides (that didn't hinder our stay but just for a head's up for future visitors) were the slight confusion regarding accessing the parking structure prior to check-in. Since it is gated, you need a hotel key to access the structure and there was only a small driveway in front of the hotel that you can park while you check-in. I imagine if you're checking in during the day, the traffic would be troublesome however, since we were checking in late, this wasn't a problem. Also, if a the view is a priority for you, be sure to double check with the front desk that your room has one. The rooms on either side of ours had full balconies with lounge chairs but ours had 2 very narrow (could only fit one person) balconies which was separated by a huge wall in the middle of the doors. Again, as this wasn't of importance to us, we weren't bothered by it. I do want to point out the excellent service of the management staff. A couple days after I arrived home, I received a survey requesting my feedback. I made a comment about the complimentary lotion provided by the hotel in the bathroom and how it was so fragrant and continued to remind me of Hawaii now that I was back home. I had hoped it was available for purchase so I put a call into the general manager, Patty Maher, to inquire if this was an option however Patty had read my feedback and offered to send me a couple at no cost - that it was her pleasure to do so! This kind of service is exactly what comes to mind when I think of ""Aloha Spirit"" and Patty went way above and beyond my expectations! I would definitely recommend the Palms for a future stay!!","Torrance, California",20,5.0

The staff at the Palms are a real plus as everyone I meet who worked here truly had the ""Aloha"" spirit and were extremely helpful. The staff gives them a genuine plus over other hotels. From the registration desk to the house keeping staff they are what makes this hotel a very good choice. I recommend what they call the partial ocean view rooms on the upper floors. Hve stayed on the 9th, 10th & 11th floors.The hotel is just across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village so it is a very easy walk to the beach. The Palms provides beach towels.

Only other gripe is that there is only wifi in the lobby - not the rooms.Having said that though, I cant recommend the staff enough. They were great. Always cheery and happy to help. The rooms (even though small - especially the bathroom) were exceptionally clean. The hotel was a 10 minute walk to the Ala Moana shopping centre and the end of Waikiki beach.

By far & away at the lower end of the Waikiki market the owners are cleverly investing in the things that matter such as top service, superb cleanliness, and most importantly - excellent beds! The decor in the rooms & particularly the corridors is very dated however at the low tariff being charged by Waikiki standards you would expect nothing else. The bathrooms have been more than adequately renovated at some stage, AIRCON is ducted & works well albeit quite noisily & by European standards the rooms are a good size. Other reviewers have more than covered the very convenient locational aspects & I would concur with others in that if traffic noise is an issue for you -ask for a room on the city side. The Hotel is located on the Western or city side of Ala Moana Blvd - so the East facing Diamond Head view rooms face the street. I had a room on the top floor city side for 5 nights & it couldn't have been quieter apart from the inevitable sirens & occasional garbage truck!

We had the partial ocean view room. I arrived to Aqua Palms with Friendly and helpful staff. My room was ready within minutes of my arrival. Prior to my stay I had asked the staff if they could possibly have champagne in my room for me and my significant other. When I arrived in my room I was so surprised to see a bottle of champagne two wine glasses, card and a box of chocolates. Although my GF probably almost freaked thinking I was going to propose or something :). Room was clean and our room was cleaned everyday right after we left for our outings. As stated in other reviews shower lighting is a bit dark, but I wasn't in Hawaii to spend my time in the shower. We were facing the street side it's busy and was a tad bit noisy but didn't bother us we slept with sliding glass door open ever night. Didn't bring our I pad so don't know about Internet. Pool was very clean and they had a BBQ grill at pool. That while looking out my balcony one day I saw the Aqua Palms staff light the grill up so the guest could Q up some steaks which you know us guys that like to Q that looked like a vacation it's self. The only thing that the Pool was missing was a Spa which would have been cool to relax in maybe a evening or two, and it wasn't fair looking across the way seeing guest at the Hilton village chill in the Hot tub lol. The gym was a bit small equipment could be updated but hey I'm a guy who like to lift weights so of course in going to complain about that. Great location you have tones of restaurants to choose from within walking distance. We didn't feel once we got there we didn't need to rent a car after all and right across the street you can rent cars, jeeps , scooters which is right next to KOBE steakhouse. You have I hop right next door to Hotel after that a Decent coffee and breakfast house around the corner from that a ABC store. On the other side of the hotel u have a chinese buffet and down the street from that u have some more restaurant. The trolley stops right in front of hotel the pink line you can ride for two bucks, which will take you to all the shopping u lady's can imagine. The beach is about a 7 to 10minute walk depending if u catch the crosswalk light at the right time. The city bus also stops at the hotel if you want to travel further or you can pretty much catch any Trolley in front of Hotel. Ok Hotel has no bells and whistles but a clean hotel is always good which the staff did meet. Would I stay here again certainly yes but if you have a High maintaince GF like myself probably not going to work out on our next visit.

Location - The Aqua Palms is conveniently located for my business trip. The IHOP is next door and was perfect for having breakfast in the morning. I tried the diner (forgot the name) right around the corner on the first night and didn’t find the food all that good so stuck with IHOP for the rest of my stay. The hotel is not a beach front property but is only a 5-minute walk at best. There are ABC stores (convenience store) on almost every block and there’s one right around the corner of the hotel. The popular outdoor shopping strip Ala Moana is nearby and is about 10 minutes walk. Hotel and Amenities - I found the hotel lobby to smell a bit funny, a bit musty which I found surprising as I didn’t think the weather in Hawaii was humid which could’ve contributed to the smell. Thank goodness the hotel room didn’t smell that way. Internet is free and wifi is only available in the lobby. In the room, you must use the ethernet cord which I found inconvenient as I didn’t travel with a laptop (brought my tablet instead). To use the wifi in the lobby, you must obtain a username and password from the receptionist. It would be in the best interest of the hotel to offer wifi in the rooms as more and more people are traveling with tablets nowadays. I checked out the fitness room and I could remember seeing a treadmill and another machine. The pool isn’t as nice as you see it on their website; it is much smaller than it appears to be.Room - I was given a room with a king bed. The room is a bit small, the king bed took up most of the room. The furniture is old. At first I thought that it was just the furniture style but my colleague who also stayed at the hotel told me that it is old and that the varnish had worn off. My room had a balcony but not one where you can step out into. I didn’t care for a balcony that I can step out into but was happy that I was able to open the sliding door to get fresh air in the room. There’s a mini fridge and microwave in the room which I didn’t use but I know would be nice and convenient for some guests looking to stay at the hotel. The bathroom is small and it could use more lighting. The bathtub is two-third the size of a traditional bathtub (I thought it was cute). The toiletries were nice and I ended up not using the ones I brought with me. They’re nicely scented; coconut lime, coconut some other, etc. Staff - I had minimal interaction with the staff during my week’s long stay. Of the interactions that I had, I found them to be nice and courteous. When I checked in, I was assigned a room on a lower floor. I asked for a higher floor and they accommodated. The housekeeper I ran into on morning was cheery and greeted me. The bellman offered help when I was leaving the hotel.Parking - I rented a car towards the end of my stay which I parked at the hotel garage for $20. The space is tight and you’d be fine with a sedan but a mini van or a SUV would be really tough.The popular hotel comparison websites rated Aqua Palms a 2-star hotel. I’d give this place 2.5 stars. Overall, I had a good stay. The hotel is a good alternative to the pricey major brands. The room was comfortable. This hotel is suitable for business travelers and couples but I can’t really say it would be for families though. I didn’t get a room with 2 beds so I don’t know how comfortable it’d be (I found my room to be small with a king bed so a room with 2 beds of a similar room size?).",Washington D.C.,25,3.0

As we were planning to move onto the other islands after the weekend we didn't need a resort type hotel for this visit. We booked a city view room (see photo for the view) from the UK via lastminute.com and the checkin went without problem. We were allocated room 1125, just below penthouse level. Initially we were a little disappointed with the room's basic look and feel but it was late at night and we weren't in the best frame of mind as the flight from mainland USA had been a bit rough. By the morning the room although a bit dated in terms of decor looked and felt a lot better and probably in keeping with the pricing and rating.The bathroom was pretty small with a reasonably powerful shower above the bath tub. Think the room had a small fridge (how soon you forget when in various hotels or is it age!), plus coffee maker (one sachet provided) but no kettle for tea etc. Decent sized and comfortable bed plus a small settee. Small balcony with chair. The only downside to the balconies is that one or two people had some sort of cooking facilities (eg similar to electric woks) on theirs and so the smells tended to waft into our room on occasions. Can't really blame the hotel for that though.Room cleaning was a bit haphazard. The first day was maybe partly our fault as we were in and out of the room on a few occasions and maybe missed our 'slot'. But on the second day we were out from 6.30am until 3.30pm and it hadn't been cleaned by then. Got a knock at the door just after that to clean the room but by then we'd just got in we're showering etc so it wasn't cleaned then, so in effect it wasn't cleaned / serviced at all during our stay.Free coffee was available from the reception area, just help yourself. Various other varieties were available at a small cost. The concierge (Shane I think) was very helpful and the tour we booked via him to Pearl Harbour was very good value.Five minute walk to Waikiki beach and generally the hotel was in a nice area with a diner iHop and other cafes / restaurants next to it.

When I stay in a Hawaii hotel, I don't care about the view (I view the ocean and mountains from my home), I care about the hotel's location, cleanliness, comfort, the ease of getting from my car to my room and the attitude of the staff. The Aqua Palms does well in almost all of these categories for me as a business traveler and as a comparative value, I would say that it is worth considering as a vacation hotel, too. Understand first that the location of the hotel on Ala Moana Blvd, is pretty good. The hotel is not in the heart of Waikiki but it is located two blocks from the union of the two primary roads in Waikiki. It is near restaurants, Ala Moana Shopping Center (once the largest outdoor mall in the US), and easily accessible to the beach (a brief look at pedestrian traffic outside the hotel shows locals carrying their surfboards to the beach ... its got to be nearby, right? And it is.) The hotel is clean. First tipoff about any good hotel: how clean is it? The Aqua is clean! My room was also comfortable, not large but big enough, with a usable and (again) very clean bathroom. The absence of a light in the dark shower was not to my liking but of little importance overall. The hotel's only negative is the parking. Parking a car larger than an economy car would be problematic for me and the hotel needs to figure out an alternative to making a guest return to the car after check-in so that the guest can put a parking pass on the dashboard. It was bad enough for me traveling alone ... I can't imagine what a father with two tired kids and an exhausted wife would feel like. And finally, if you want to know something about ALOHA, wait until you meet the housekeeping staff. They smile, they laugh, they truly seem to want you to be happy. Just thinking about the smile on the face of the woman that cleaned my room one day makes me laugh even now! The same is true for the front desk team and even the Expedia Activities concierge in the lobby! Oh! and some reviewers say they had to pay for the internet but I didn't. I don't know why but the in-room internet in my room was free. So despite the non-view, the absence of rolling surf outside my window, it all works. For business? Absolutely. For tourists? It's good value and well worth strong consideration.","Princeville, Hawaii",14,4.0

Waikiki is located in Honolulu mainly along Waikiki beach in a heavily populated area that saw a lot of construction in the 70s and therefore there are a plethora of hotels of this vintage. From the water looking at the city it seems it basically stretches from left (where the ala wai cannal) comes in to the right ( towards Diamondhead crater almost)So choosing a hotel is this: do you want or need to be close to anything in particular or simply can walk everywhere because you really can in Waikiki. The beaches are all in close distance regardless of where you stay so don't pay extra for a beachfront if you don't have to....though some are nice on the water too. One really good option is the Aqua Palms hotel and Spa. This is a regularly maintained hotel of boutique stature that was super convenient to use and cost effective. Close to their biggest mall with a short 15 minute walk ( no seriously it's a mall but a lovely one if you want anything at all ) otherwise go to their ABC stores which are pretty  famous there and have almost everything......they are on every block. No really....they are.Walking to the beaches is just a step across the street behind the Hilton which is a great spot to pick up any and all tour buses and city tours.Walking to high end shopping is just through a park and there you are.Pretty well located it is. Our room was nice and comfortable enough while not large by any standards our room with balcony facing Diamondhead was great. Some might find the street noise bothersome if the door to the balcony is open so in that case ask for a room facing the back......we did not mind that as it was quiet when the door was closed. Good to have a fridge and microwave in the room too as there WILL be times you want to just eat something at the room. Or put a bottle of something in there from the ABC stores where booze and food is relatively cheap...good tip.Our concierge which we nick named "" Connie Serge"" ...Janelle actually was an Expedia expert so she was super helpful in booking lots of things for us to do. In fact it was easy to blow another $1300 on activities as there are lots to do.Overall the hotel was great. The pool was being retiled when we were there but who cares when there are beaches. It is done now and looks pleasant.This is not a super fancy hotel but still very nice.The only downside was the ihop restaurant attached to it had abysmal service.

As the hotel was so cheap (approx. £60 per night) and was rated 3 star, I wasn't expecting anything special. On arrival, without our asking, we were upgraded to a Diamond Head view room at no additional cost. Room was spacious, well appointed, clean and a great little balcony with a view of the pool, diamond head and the sea. Room was still fairly quiet considering it was street facing. Great location, with Ala Moana shopping centre and Waikiki beach both within 10 minutes walking distance. Wifi in reception worked well, and staff were very helpful in arranging late checkout and airport transportation. Would definitley stay again.","Hawick, Scotland",3,5.0

I would recommend to anyone looking for a decent hotel at a reasonable price (I researched other places and this seems to best value for $).I'll start with the positivesGreat location - very close to Ala Moana mall (10 minute walk) and the main center of Waikiki (10 min walk). Also Hilton complex is just across the road (many places to eat and hang out, huge fireworks show over the beach on Fridays) which offers easy access to nice part of Waikiki beach (plus hotel offers beach towels and chairs). Rooms are spacious, clean and pretty much match what you see in the pictures. Bathroom was a bit 'cozy' as the door almost hits the toilet but we managed. Bed was very comfortable. AC worked just fine and TV offered wide selection of channels. microwave and small fridge made eating in easy as well. Lanai (patio) is small but i spent almost every morning out there with coffee and the paper.No wifi in the room but they do have a data cable (old school). i've heard they are looking at updating so Wifi will be available in the room. We connected using the cable and it was slow - you won't be able to stream video or Skype. So basic internet browsing is about it. My father had his iPad and used the WiFi in the lobby - always very slow as well.Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I won't get into all the examples but i'll say we never had a problem and in several instances they exceeded my expectations. The pool was being renovated while we were there but, hey, who goes to the pool when you have such a great beach across the road? Ok, I can see that some like to use the pool but it's good to see that the hotel is renovating stuff (they also were painting hallways) - they have to do this stuff sometime.other things of note - room key gets you 10% off at Macy's and IHOP. free newspaper. manager reception on thursday evenings with some food, drink, and music. great little Italian restaurant around corner on Ena Rd (Davino). Food pantry for groceries about 5 minute walk. No real huge negatives but you will need to be aware that any rooms that face the ocean also face the main road so are noisy. This is simply a function of the hotel being located on a main (busy) road and the amount of activity in the waikiki area (sirens fairly frequent and, i guess, trucks are allowed to use engine breaks in town...odd). This is probably one of the loudest locations I've ever stayed. Don't let this deter you, if you are a very light sleeper, bring ear plugs just in case. The hotel has done a decent job of insulating against the street noise. Or, ask for room at the back of the hotel, much quieter.","Nelson, New Zealand",70,4.0

The hotel is clean, comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Proximity to the beach is great considering it is not a beach front hotel. Took me 8 minutes from the time I got on the elevator in the hotel till I set my beach chair and towel (provided free from hotel) on the beach.........would have been a bit longer if the only traffic light wasn't green. This end of Waikiki Beach also seemed less busy as opposed to the other end with all the high end shopping, which I found more relaxing. Waikiki is a bit of a concrete jungle except for the beach, so it is what it is. It's very close to all kinds of places to eat and drink. From the crazy expensive to the cheap and cheerful, all within walking distance. The trolley stop is right out front of the hotel if you don't feel like walking at all though. If you want to surf the net in your room you'll need to bring a laptop or something that hard wires into the internet. WiFi is free but only available in the lobby. The pool was being renovated when we were there, but I didn't travel all the way to Hawaii to sit by a pool anyway. Saw them painting our hallway baseboards which to me didn't look like they needed it, so I think the overall hotel condition is good. Room to room noise is better than average for a hotel, but the street noise takes a night or two to get use to and the traffic is quietest between 11pm and 7am. I think a better seal on the balcony sliding door would help that just a touch too. They also have kitchenette suites which from a couple we met there said they were happy with as well. I would consider that option next time because I would have not problem staying at the Aqua Palms again.","Thunder Bay, Canada",9,4.0

I find myself in Hawaii every couple of years and usually my trips are planned in advance so that I am in a Hilton property where I have Diamond status. This trip came up at the last minute and there were no Hilton properties available at the Government rate which I qualify for. With all of that being said I was booked into the Aqua Palms which is not affiliated with any points system that I am a member of. None of this is the Aqua Palms fault. The staff was pleasant and professional. Check in and out was breeze. Parking was $20 per day and convenient; the spaces are tight so you are better off with a small car, but full size will fit.The room I was given (1010) was spacious and had a good view of the Hilton Hawaiian Village property and probably had one of the better ocean views available here, but its still a partial view. The furnishings had seen better days, but were not bad. The bed & pillows were very comfortable. The LCD TV was fine and the free internet access was adequate. The AC worked very well also which is important to me.The rate I was given was actually lower than the Gov't rate and reflects that this property is geared more for the discount Hawaii tourist. The location is very good for Trolley and bus service and it is s short walk or ride to the huge Ala Moana Shopping Mall. I am a spoiled business traveler, but after I got over the fact that I was not getting my usual perks I found that I really enjoyed being here. You get 10% discount at the iHop on the ground floor next to the lobby and a short 1 minute walk down to the corner will find you at the Wailana 24 Hour Coffee Shop and Lounge where you also receive a 10% discount on food with your room key.

The partial view was nice even though it had big buildings in the middle of the views!

I have stayed at this hotel twice, and the service is consistently impeccable. If you have just flown into Honolulu and need a hotel for any length of time, it is well worth your time to consider the Aqua Palms. It is very centrally located in Waikiki and is within a very short walk to the beach, search for the location on Google maps and you will be surprised and pleased to see how close to the beach it really is! We always arrive in Honolulu late at night, and reception at these hours is very important to us especially after a long flight. The staff manning the reception have always been very friendly no matter how late we arrive, and are always going out of their way to help us. If you need anything they will do their best to assist you with a smile. The rooms are all very clean, and have a great view, some face towards the mountains whilst others face the city, but Waikiki is very pretty so it doesn't really matter which one you chose, because you should be in Hawaii to have fun and be outdoors, and not for the view from your room! The beds are very comfortable, the bathrooms spotless and all with their own brand of toiletries that are very nice indeed. All the rooms have their own AC and decent TV if you find yourself tired out from a day at the beach. The laundry room access is great if you would prefer to save some money and do your own. Another point worth mentioning is that on the same floor as reception, there is an IHOP (International House of Pancakes), which opens at the crack of dawn and serves delicious food. The Ala Moana mall is within easy walking distance and is sure to delight anyone who is in the mood for some retail therapy. The hotel also provides free beach towels and chairs, so no need to bring those, bath towels too, which can save you space when packing your luggage. You get free Royal Kona Coffee in your room each day, to brew in a two person size coffee machine, which is a treat. I would highly recommend the Aqua Palms hotel, my only tip for anyone would be to book in advance. They epitomise the Aloha spirit!","London, United Kingdom",2,5.0

But the outstanding support in the lobby - they offer complimentary coffee and lemon water as well as apples, a cozy sitting group and tables large enough for a business meeting - was outstanding!

You could view the fireworks at the Hilton on Friday nights and walk to the mall. The location is excellent! The best thing was the Wailana Coffee House next to the hotel. Don't even think of going to IHOP! Wailana is open 24 hours! They have pancakes to die for, all you can eat with flavors like Macadamia Nut and Banana with coconut syrup. Yummy! I know it's weird to mention a restaurant in a hotel review but Hawaii is expensive so this $8 special is a good deal. They also have Karaoke :). I would definitely stay at the Aqua Palms again. The happy hour was okay (pineapple juice and nice music). The only downside about the hotel (why it gets 4*'s instead 5) is because they barely cleaned it during the seven days we stayed there. They change the sheets and towels and empty the trashcans but that's about it. On our last night, one of the rubber cleaning gloves was even left in the bathroom near my makeup. I pray it wasn't used to clean the toilet. Also, it's about $25 a day to park. But other than that, excellent stay.","Atlanta, Georgia",50,4.0

Generally they're all of a good standard and I now settle for hotels that are reasonably priced in a good location as some of the higher priced ones are still quiet tired inside. I'd stayed at the Aqua Wave a number of times and whilst the location is superb, the noise isn't and after signing up to the Aqua Hotels mailing list, took advantage of an offer from the Palms for a partial ocean view. The rooms are fine, cleaning spot on, lifts are fast and the noise is not a problem. I bought my Apple WiFi router to set up wireless in the room as it's still cable internet and the pool is fine to lay by for a few hours but it's not exactly a place of tranquility. It's a 5 minute walk to the beach via the Hawaiian Hilton and you can even pick up some Starbucks on the way there.Easy walking distance to the mall and it was nice to be able to grab a bite there if pressed for time.

The parking garage is very tight, be careful when going from floor to floor. We stayed on the 11th floor, the carpet was damp.

If you like the other aspects of this hotel mentioned in reviews then definitely request a room facing away from the road.

Patty, the friendly manager, is very approachable. Make sure to book a larger room with a couch. Yes, it can be noisy on the Ala Moana - Diamond Head side, so take ear plugs.

Coffee maker with free coffee, a microwave, and small frig. (with handy pitcher for ice water) are also part of the deal. Bring some snacks, paper plates & plastic utensils from the mainland if you want to save $. There is a small Food Pantry nearby, or a larger Foodland in the Ala Moana Shopping Mall, which is always jam packed with tourists. If you are renting a car, get the smallest one available.

We spent a very enjoyable 5 nights at the Aqua Palms in May 2012. Everything I had read on the Trip Advisor website regarding this property lived up to our expectations. The staff were welcoming and very friendly and helpful, as is everyone else in Honolulu. The rooms were comfortable and our room located on the 10th floor was very quiet. We had a Diamond Head room, with nice views of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach.The only negative was that this room did not have a lanai you could go outside and sit on, to watch the view. (The Aqua Plams website stated that the room did have a Lanai)I booked this room way in advance on the Aqua Palms website and got a good discount. Cost was about $115.00 per night. Breakfast was included with the Diamond Head Room, at the on site I Hop restaurant. The I hop was a bit disapointing in that the service was very slow and the meals not all that fantastic, although the pancakes with blueberry sauce was okay. I am surprised that the I Hop in general draws such negative comments, in that it is located in a prime position and the floor space is huge. I can imagine later on it turning into a Starbucks or MacdonaldsThe Aqua Palms has a fantastic location opposite the Hawaiilan Village Complex. You can walk through the beautiful grounds of this Hotel down to Waikiki beach. There is a nice Starbucks on the way with beautiful native gardens. There are numerous eating and shopping options close by. Check the Cheeseburger joint out where the waitpersons wear grass skirts and the Japanese sushi buffet at about $30 a head a few minutes walk away. Also there is a 24 hour restaurant/diner even closer which serves a wide variety of gigantic meals and has very friendly staff. Try the enormous ""special ice cream with banana fritters"", which is almost a meal in itself. There are numerous ABC stores in close proximity which are like Australian 7/11s but about 100 times better. You can buy decent Aloha shirts and T Shirts there without having to go to the more upmarket stores. For shopaholics you are in for a treat, the Ala Moana Shopping Centre is a short $2.50 bus ride away on ""The Bus"" (Stop right out side the Hawaiian village.) This is the best shopping centre/mall I have been in my life and the recently opened Westfield at Stratford in London near the Olympic Stadium pales in comparison. I couldn't keep my wife away from the place !! There are some great places for buying T Shirts with fantastic surfing logos - Hawaiian Island Creations located on the ground floor and Macy's have a huge selecton of Aloha Ware. There are numerous restaurants to get a reasonably priced meal.Another place not to miss is the beautiful Ala Moana Park a short walk right opposite the Shopping Centre. Take a walk around here next to the oceon and you will truly know that you are in the Paradise that Hawaii is. You can get incredible views of the aquamarine Pacific Ocean framed by the eve present surfers against Diamond Head in the distance. In fact I liked this area of Beach much better than the main Waikkiki strip which is narrow and congested.All in all we had a fantastic time in Hawaill and can't wait to get back, where we will have no hesitation in staying at the Aqua Palms again.","Sydney, Australia",14,5.0

The first time my mom and I stayed for one night before our cruise and two nights after. At that time they had complimentary Hawaiian sweet rolls and fruit for breakfast.This time my husband and I stayed for almost a week after our cruise. We booked a package through the website that included a rental car, parking, and free breakfast each day. It was a phenomenal deal!The location is terrific--it is directly across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. A five minute walk behind the Hilton and you are on the beach (all of the beach is public) or can go to the Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon. Fort DeRussy Park is a few minutes away by walking. We walked further, but easily, to Waikiki Beach and along the shops of Luxury Row. Ala Moana Blvd. is very busy, but it was not noisy on our balcony or inside our room. The crowds at Waikiki Beach are not for us, so we are glad that we were not right in the heart of Waikiki Beach. We had everything available to us from our location and it was much more peaceful.The pool is a little small and we only used it on our last day, but when you are in Hawaii just 5 minutes from beautiful beaches this was not an issue.We had a very late flight so we requested the possibility of having a late check-out. We had to come back to speak with the manager about this. When we did, the manager seemed to have been dealing with a demanding guest (it was New Year's weekend and the person wanted additional rooms for additional days, and was upset that the manager did not have any available). At first the manager seemed unsure if he could accommodate us. When my husband elaborated about our stay and how I was a return guest, the manager was more at ease that we were happy and satisfied guests. Although he could not let us stay as long as we had hoped, he did extend our time by a few hours for which we were grateful. Before booking this trip, I reviewed other hotels and well as this one since it had been 4 years since the last time I had stayed at Aqua Palms. There were mixed reviews about the hotel, but none that swayed me to go elsewhere. I don't know why people are so negative about the hotel--it is very nice and in a great location and well-maintained. Sure, it is not a ""luxury"" hotel, but the furnishings are tasteful, fresh, and clean. The Aqua Palms is very comfortable and way more than adequate for someplace to sleep and recharge for the next day. The value is excellent, and I guarantee that our vacation experience would not have been any better had we stayed across the street for twice as much money. I would return in a heartbeat to Aqua Palms.

We had an obstructed view of the ocean. On Thursday evening we attended the manager reception and enjoyed the entertainment. The location is perfect as others have noted. Just a short walk to many points of interest. Just one block away were three car rental offices. We rented from Enterprise and did the Island Circle tour which was very easy and educational. About 1/2 block was Wailana Coffee House where we enjoyed breakfast each morning. They give a discount when you show your Aqua Palms room key. Aqua Palms had a laundry facility for guests which was very useful after a week at a convention, The washers and dryers were $1.25 each (quarters only). The laundry was located on P3 (Parking Garage level 3). Wish they had a chair to sit in while doing laundry. We were on the 6th floor overlooking Ala Moana Blvd and did not notice the traffic noise mentioned in other reviews.We visited Pearl Harbor Saturday before embarking on the cruise. The Aqua Palms allowed us to extend check-out to 1:00. This was very helpful. We used VIP Transportation round-trip from the hotel to Pearl Harbor $9 per person. Taxi from Aqua Palms to the Pier was $13.60 plus tip. My wife and I would stay here again if we visit Honolulu again.

The next room was not a king bed, supposed to be a queen bed but felt like a double, wife had to sleep on the sofa bed. The floors in the first two rooms are sloped from the patio door towards the hallway door. Always felt off balance and the couch was on such a slope that it was not comfortable sitting on it. Third room we tried was quiet being on the 11th floor. What you get with this property is an older hotel that is well kept and friendly staff.

We never really felt comfortable leaving our room and always used the safe. We noticed however that the safe was only attached to the nightstand that could be carried out by one person anyway.

While the rooms have not been upgraded (except for the new, flat, wall-mounted TV), the rooms are clean and comfortable. We originally booked a room with a king-size bed and Diamond Head view; however, upon reaching our 5th floor room, we soon discovered that we would not be able to sleep during our 5-night stay. The Diamond Head view rooms are on the front of the hotel, and road noise is very loud. Additionally, nighttime road work was being done on Ala Moana Boulevard. We made a quick call to the front desk asking for a higher room or a room on the back, and we were quickly brought a key to another 5th floor room on the back side of the hotel with a city view. I didn't consider the fact that we were trading for a cheaper room, so I never asked for any partial refund or financial consideration -- wish I had at least asked for free breakfast which did not come with our original booking. We were just glad to get a room that would allow us five quiet nights of sleep, and the room had a decent view. The room change also resulted in a smaller bed (queen-size). We were very happy with the balcony that we enjoyed every evening. The front desk staff was always friendly and accommodating. They answered all of our questions, even making sure that we would find the local Walmart. The helpful man at the valet parking desk made sure to let me know where we could park if the hotel area of the garage was full when we returned from the Polynesian Cultural Center. By the way, driving and parking in the garage is as tight as other reviewers have stated -- just be careful. We had hoped to use the PC in the lobby, but the machine can only be used with a credit card, and the price quoted for each quarter hour was more than we wanted to pay. The refrigerator and microwave in the room were handy since it allowed us to enjoy coffee and light breakfast on the balcony before heading out each day and a snack after returning each evening. This was a help for reserving our eating budget for a good meal out during the day. The location of Aqua Palms was perfect for our needs. It is good for using the bus service. One day, we rode to Pearl Harbor to spend the morning at the USS Arizona Memorial and then worked our way back to the hotel. Another day, we took a bus to the Bishop Museum. The location of the hotel is also good for walking to Waikiki Beach where we enjoyed evening strolls on the beach. We were very satisfied with our stay at Aqua Palms. It provided clean, comfortable lodging convenient to the attractions of our choice without spending dollars for oceanfront views.

Consequently, we are always looking for a budget-friendly hotel that provides us with a good experience and allows us to enjoy the island. That's what we've found at the Aqua Palms, which is why this was our second stay at this hotel in two years.While I don't know how we managed this, we were upgraded to a 12th floor two-room suite on our recent trip and loved every minute of it. Our suite came with a kitchen, full-size refrigerator, and a huge lanai that I loved to sit on to watch the sun rise and Waikiki come to life. The room was quite clean and very comfortable and made this a place that I wanted to relax in almost as much as I wanted to head to the beach.That said, most travellers are not going to be upgraded to a suite. So, how's the rest of the hotel? While much smaller than our two-room suite, our room two years ago was also comfortable and provided us with a great base to explore Oahu. When we decided to head back to the islands, we knew based on that experience that the Aqua Palms was where we needed to stay on Oahu. The common areas of the hotel, while not overwhelmingly spacious, are acceptable and the staff is quite gracious. I love that they provide towels for the beach and they also have a nice, but busy, laundry facility in the parking ramp. Part of what attracts us to this hotel is it's location. You're across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village and Fort DeRussy, which means that you have great views of most of the Waikiki skyline and Diamond Head. On each of our visits, we've booked a Partial Ocean-View room to take advantage of this view. In addition, this means that you're about a 10 minute walk through or around the Hilton complex to the beach and can get out of Waikiki - and head to Ala Moana, for example - in a very short time. If you're looking for a comfortable, affordable hotel in a great Waikiki location, then look no farther than the Aqua Palms. It provides enough bells-and-whistles to help make the vacation memorable, but without breaking the bank. We've enjoyed it both times we've visited Oahu and plan on staying there again when we return to the islands.","Saint Louis, Missouri",16,4.0

However, I suspect most parking garages in Waikiki are like this. The other item is that if you are arriving in a rental; there's not really a good place to park in front of the hotel to check in. You will need to pull into the hotel garage and dial the front desk so they can 'buzz' you in to park. Otherwise; this is a clean, comfortable hotel with a very friendly and helpful staff. I will say that the hotel is a little older and it might show here and there, but should not take away from an enjoyable stay. It is about a ten minute walk to Waikiki Beach and just a five minute drive to Ala Moana mall. I stayed in a room with a partial ocean view and it was well worth the (reasonable) cost. I had views of the mountains, Diamond Head and the ocean from my balcony, but I would suggest you try to get a room above the 9th floor. Traffic is a bit noisy on the street. Okay; its very noisy, but if you shut the balcony door its not distracting. I happen to like traffic noise, but I think you'll find your room to be quiet and safe at night. The staff makes every effort to ensure you are comfortable and provides everything you might need. I was treated like a special guest and felt very welcome. I would difinitely recommend this hotel to friends and family.",St Louis,10,4.0

At check in Larry was able to give us a king bedroom on a high floor, but we didn't get a balcony though. Our room ended up facing a hotel next door and its parking lot. We didn't spend much time in the room so it worked out just fine. Aqua Palms also has a laundry area and a pool. I think they also had beach towels but we didn't use that service. The staff was nice and accomodating (we had to call a houseman four times as we couldn't figure out how to set up a safe code).

It is really on the edge of Waikiki, which, depending upon your preferences, should be a prime consideration in choosing the hotel. You are removed from the Waikiki madness and much of the noise, but your dining options are limited unless you want to walk in to Waikiki or Ala Moana. There is no room service, but there is a coffee house on the block that is open late (Wailana Coffee House), and of couse, the ubiquitous ABC stores for essentials. An Outback and Red Lobster are also very close, and the hotel as an IHOP connected to its lobby. The last three being chain restaurants, I would encourage visitors to explore a little further. There are much more unique and interesting dining options in Waikiki.As you are on the edge of Waikiki, Ala Moana shopping center and park are also within walking distance.The hotel has a very small pool. But heck, the beach is why you came, right?I found all the staff to be helpful and friendly. The complimentary coffee in the lobby is good, and the rooms have a nice sized fridge, micro and coffee maker. Rooms are clean and attractive. My room did have a few teeny-tiny ants roaming around. I am born and raised in Hawaii and insects are a fact of life in a tropical paradise. These tiny ones are especially hard to eradicate.

Ice machine broke 3 times fixed each time within 20 minutes. Rooms are small but have fridge and microwave so you can save some money doing own food. Paid for downtown view but had semi ocean views anyway. Desk staff very helpful. Gave free beach towels. There is a tour operator place in lobby, but you can get much better discounts if you shop around for local type groups. Main thing I regret spending too much money on tours by not checking local websites. Go to Wednesday night guest reception they have a killer special drink.","Vancouver, Washington",2,4.0

This is our last night here and I wanted to be sure to share our delight while everything was fresh in my mind. We stayed here a week and the staff is so much of what makes a great hotel one you delight in telling all your friends about. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.The location is perfect, right across from the prestigious Hawiian Hilton Village, this is definitely some of the prettiest beach front in Waikiki. The fireworks off their beach on Friday nights was fantastic- just a few minutes to walk over, this time of year they were Friday at 7:45 but the front desk can let you know if the time is still the same. We walked down to the International Marketplace (just about the center of Waikiki shopping) in 20 - 30 min depending on the whims of the signal lights. There is a car rental place only about a block and a half away with 4 different companies- right on Ala Moana. The IHOP next door is wonderful and we had elected the partial ocean/diamond head view with breakfast- what a great deal. There is a Food Pantry on the block behind the hotel (on Hobron) if you need more than what all the ABC stores (seemingly every block) carry. We saw one group of 10 cooking on the grill down by the pool and having a great time. Loved the apples in the lobby- and the frig in the room- nice big size, not those mini's that you can hardly squeeze anything in. Two other perks that have disappeared from most hotels or never existed that I must mention- this hotel still has ice machines- PLUS, unheard of- a night light in the bathrooms so you don't have to leave the light on with the accompanying fan noise- wish all hotels would include a night light- it's actually the back end of the hairdryer so it doesn't even tie up a plug outlet :0) The free internet in the room is great, I had brought a cord but they have a land line ready for you- maybe not quite as quick as wifi but really fast enough and they included it. There is wifi in the lobby but I never needed to drag my laptop down there. We enjoyed the balcony and could not have been more pleased that so many had shared previously about this hotel- definitely one of my favorite hotels and my first choice for our next trip here.",San Diego,108,5.0

It was great! The location is right outside of Waikiki so you avoid that traffic. Ala Moana Shopping Center is a 10 minute walk and Waikiki Beach is about a 20 minute walk. I stayed on the 9th floor (room 922). There is street noise you will hear with the balcony doors open like tour buses, trolleys, etc. but I heard little street noise with the sliding glass doors closed. There was one night road crews were doing work with heavy machinery right outside the hotel and once I closed the balcony doors it virtually drowned out all of that noise. I was able to watch TV comfortably that night. The room had a king size bed, pull out couch, desk, table and 3 chairs. There is also a small table and 2 chairs on the balcony. There is a 42 inch TV on the wall. Also has fridge, microwace, and a small safe in the room, which I found very convenient. The staff was super nice! My rental car broke down 4 hours after I got it and I walked to the Aqua Palms to ask if I could check in early to deal with it. Check-in is at 3pm; I got there around noon. They said YES! and it only took about 7 minutes to get me checked in and in my room. The room was very clean and had a better view than I thought. The bathroom is small but adequate. Shower pressure was good. Every time I passed an employee in the halls or in the elevator they always smiled and said hello. Some people have complained about the elevators being slow; I never waited more than 90 seconds going up or down.If I had to pick anything bad -the parking garage is a little small and getting up that entrance ramp with wet tires can be a liitle scary. I would suggest renting a smaller car if you are going to use the parking garage. But that $20/day parking fee is a great deal compared to parking anywhere else around Waikiki. Overall a great deal and I am definitely staying at the Aqua Palms for my next trip to Honolulu!","Las Vegas, Nevada",8,5.0

My husband was unsure, because of the star rating, and he had read some negative reviews but he admitted he was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed our stay. It was clean, bright, close to everything we wanted, and we loved eating at Wailana's for breakfast. The staff were all very helpful and friendly, we really appreciated them. The bed was comfortable as well, and the TV in a good spot for watching from bed. We were a little disappointed in the size of our lanai (standing room only) - we thought we were getting a balcony that we could actually go out on. However, that was our misunderstanding. Really, we didn't spend that much time in the hotel anyways, since we were always out and about doing stuff! The bathroom is a bit small, can only fit one person at a time, even just to use the mirror. The ocean view was small and in between buildings, but I still really loved being able to see the water. The elevators are a little slow, but really, if you're on vacation - who cares? We moved to a different hotel for business purposes after a week at Aqua palms - and even though it had a higher star rating - we preferred Aqua palms and wanted to go back there! It is not a 5 star resort, but for a great price and great location - we loved it.","Niagara Falls, Canada",3,5.0

I live in Michigan, she lives in Utah. Our adventure this time was to meet up in Las Vegas and then fly to Honolulu for a 7 day island cruise. We stayed at the Aqua Wave (Palms sister hotel) the 2 days before our cruise departed. We boarded the ship on Saturday and was only on there for about an hour before my friend got terribly sick and had to be ambulanced to the hospital..in other words, our cruise was over before it even started. I slept in my friend's hospital room for 2 nights before I was able to secure a hotel room for myself until she was released from the hospital. I called Aqua Palms and was able to secure a room for 5 nights. Being this was an unexpected expense I asked if I could get special rates as I had not planned on another hotel expense and funds were low. The Palms worked with me on pricing, and gave me vouchers for meals at the Ihop restaurant which was ajacent to the hotel. The only room they had open at the time only had 1 bed and a sofa bed but they worked with me on getting a room with 2 beds for when my friend was released from the hospital(Wednesday). They moved our luggage from one room to another without hesitation. I was very impressed with the hotel and the staff, they were so friendly and helpful. I felt all alone in Hawaii as I was on my own in a strange place and they made me feel welcome. They printed out directions to the bus stop (to get back and forth to the hospital), gave me directions to other places as well and even printed out our air boarding passes without charge when we were ready to depart Hawaii.The Palms was a lifesaver for me as I had no place to go, I was all alone for a few days. The Desk staff went beyond the call of duty to make me feel comfortable and safe. The room was nice and was cleaned daily.

We had decided to splurge on a nice bed and hot shower before we had to get on a plane for a day, and settled on Aqua Palms as a good value and close enough to the airport. We though it was particularly worth the extra splurge because we didn't see a charge for parking anywhere on the website (almost every other hotel in Waikiki does). Apparently there is a $20 per day charge to park in their garage, which I urge the management to put on the website asap, because that probably would have affected our booking decision. As it was, when we checked in and found out about the parking charge, the guy at the front desk was awesome and comp'ed the parking for us because of the confusion. Given how exhausted we were after our trip, this was a much appreciated gesture.The room had a really comfortable bed and amazing hot shower with good water pressure. This place seemed a little better suited for longer stays since there was plenty of space and storage in our room for a multiple week stay, and I'd definitely recommend it for that type of trip. Overall the room was updated, spacious and comfortable, the price reasonable, and the service fantastic. They even let us park there after check out so we could walk around a bit before taking the car to the airport for our later flight, and were great to deal with on the phone when we wanted to change our reservation to a better deal we saw on their site.","San Jose, California",4,4.0

In the lobby you can get free regular coffee and free apples. Also you can request beach towels for no charge.The cons - the room was small and showed wear. Nothing like the picture on the web. I have a picture of a spot of mold growing on the wallpaper below my headboard. The bathtub was really gross having been re-enameled but with most of the enamel peeling off. Even after bleaching out before every use I felt bad giving my toddler a bath in it. The balcony was extremely dangerous for my 2 year old - her head and entire body fit easily through the bars. I don't know what the code is for this (maybe it's standard?) but I would not let her outside at all which further cut down on our very tight living space. The in room coffee pot is ok, it's small and enough for maybe two cups of coffee. The pool was also small but adequate but because of a building across the street it loses sun for appx. 2-3 hours a day (about 1:30-3:30pm). The free wifi internet only works in the lobby.

If you care about being treated like a five star guest this is the place for you. Maholo to Patty and her staff for making our trip such a pleasant one. On our last day of holidays we met an elderly gentleman who told us about a place at the Ala Moana Shopping Centre called Shirokiya (it's beside Macy's and within walking distance of the hotel). It is two stories of a variety of fresh Japenese foods that are very inexpensive and a nice change to what is available at the local ABC stores. Also we were prepared to rent a car for at least a portion of our trip. It turns out that their transit system is very efficient. You can literally go anywhere you want to on the island for $2.50 (exact change required). The concierge can help you with the schedule. The Expedia representatives are very helpful as well. Of course they would like to sell you their tours and if you want a hassle free way to go that may be desirable. We found it wasn't any big deal to take the bus. We went to the North Shore, The Polynesian Cultural Centre, Pearl Harbor, Chinatown, The Bishop Museum to name just a few (all accessed by bus). We only travelled during the day so never felt vulnerable. There were some pretty interesting locals on the buses, friendly and willing to give advice about places they would recommend to visit.","Saskatoon, Saskatchewan",35,5.0

Pay the excess luggage fee and bring your own travel crib. However, the room was so small a crib would not have fit. From the website I thought we would have a large room with a couch - that was not the case. Be sure to ask up front what you're getting. I never saw any bugs.

Overall we enjoyed the hotel but a few things were disappointing. The Good:Hotel is in a great location, within 10 mins walk of the Ala Moana shopping centre, the main strip and Waikiki beach. Trolley(bus) stops are just outside the hotel too. Receptionists were fairly friendly, but generally very busy. The room on the 11th floor was clean, with a small kitchen area with microwave & fridge. Car parking was decent at $20 a day as we had a hire car. The average:The pool & gym are tiny, but we didn't go there to have a work out or swim in a pool! Bathroom whilst modern was tiny, and it was difficult to walk in and close the door behind you! It is impossible to have 2 people standing in there at the same time. The views of the ocean were narrow as it is a couple of blocks back from the beach. No tea bags, sugar or milk in the room either.The bad:1. Our room on the 11th floor would stink of cigarette smoke at around 9pm onwards on our last 2 nights. When we complained to the hotel they said it was a vents issue from the private apartment above us and there was nothing they could do. They didn't even offer for us to move rooms! my wife got quite sick when we left hawaii and I'm sure the smoke contributed. 2. The noise! the street outside is very busy with street traffic (Cars and people) and we could hear it from the highest floor at night. For light sleepers this would lead to a very poor night's sleep3. The lifts. They are old and extremely slow. Be prepared to wait for up to 4 mins for a lift during the mornings and afternoon peak times.Overall we would go back as the price was very reasonable, but I would have to ask for a room NOT on the 11th floor and away from the street side.",Sydney,9,3.0

Secondly, the ""partial ocean view"" rooms are on an incredibly busy street. The noise dampening in the room is terrible. Without the ear plugs there would be no way to sleep. In talking to other guests, many of them booked the same rooms we did then moved to the other side of the building to non view rooms after the first sleepless night. We got the ear plugs and stayed. Another issues is the lanai. Some rooms have them, some don't. Make sure you know what you are getting if that is important.Bed is comfy, the rooms have a refrig and microwave, the bathrooms are small but updated. The location is two blocks to a very good beach. The pool doesn't look like much though.For full disclosure here, we got a hell of a deal through a wholesaler and did this all on the spur of the moment. We were going to go up to the North Shore for some peace and quiet but changed our minds, this is actually pretty much fun. An urban beach experience. We've never done it before but may again.

He is in the Navy and transferred to Pearl Harbor and the Palm had a great rate for military travel at about $100 per night with free parking and breakfast. Lodging in Hawaii, particularly in January and February, is VERY expensive (motel style rooms can go for more than $150/night) and parking in the Honolulu and Waikiki areas is very pricey as well so skip the rental car if you can.When planning the relocation, we were not aware that January and February are the busiest time of the year here and the base lodge was completely booked for the entire month as were most of the other places we called. We were very surprised to find rooms available when we called the Aqua reservation line and shocked when we heard the deals they had for military travel! Our relocation was quite a process as we arrived in Oahu to spend a long weekend, then flew over to Molokai to get married and spend a short honeymoon, and then returned to Oahu so my husband could check in and we could begin house hunting. The Aqua rep was incredibly helpful with travel suggestions and lodging options for the entire process and was also quite knowledgeable about temporary lodging allowances offered by the military. I was disappointed on arrival however as the front desk staff, while pleasant, were not nearly as friendly or knowledgeable as the rep I had spoken to on the phone. They required a copy of my reservation confirmation as proof that the parking and breakfast was included in the room price. We stayed in a Diamond Head view room on the 10th floor. The room was clean and nicely decorated. The closet and lanai areas were rather small but the room was otherwise pretty spacious. However, the Diamond View rooms do overlook the city so they are noisier than the rooms on the other side of the hotel. They were doing road work for our first night there and I was concerned it would keep me up all night but being on the 10th floor coupled with the hum of the air conditioning drowned them out well enough. If staying in these rooms I would definitely suggest requesting the highest floor available. Aside from the noise, the only negative of note was the internet service. In our travel experience- it seems common in Hawaii that internet is available for free in most rooms; however, it is not wireless and is so slow it took me back to the days of dial up. Wireless internet was available in the lobby. This may not be a big issue if you're on vacation but when juggling a hundred moving pieces in the process of relocating it was quite frustrating.The hotel is in a very nice area, across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village which offers plenty of shopping and restaurants, and only a few blocks from the beach. There are plenty of dining options a short walk in either direction but I would strongly suggest skipping the 2 most convenience- the IHOP connected to the hotel and the coffee shop on the corner which also offers a discount to hotel guests. The food at the coffee shop was horrible! We were served half frozen burgers and fries. The IHOP was VERY expensive-- even by Hawaii standards- omelets were $15- and if not for the free breakfast provided by the hotel we would have skipped it all together. Definitely try the Greek restaurant across the street as the food was great, the service friendly and the prices reasonable. Overall we enjoyed our stay here- especially for the price! However, if we hadn't the benefit of the military rate I do wonder if I couldn't have found someplace better for $200/night.","Mililani, Hawaii",53,4.0

We chose to stay here because of the price and the ratings. The rates were around $40 a night for a 5 night stay and the reviews were good! This hotel is located on a very big street. The road noise is loud and there isn't really a lot to eat or do directly near the hotel. You have to walk about 10-15 minutes to downtown or if you go the other way you should drive/take a cab to get to the mall and the city open beach.When you come to Hawaii you expect a beach. If you don't pay for a place that has a beach, you expect a pool. I don't know what this hotel/motel was thinking when they made their pool. It's located on the outside of one of the mid level floors, so that means the pool is covered in the shade by the surrounding buildings. The jacuzzi is exposed and dirty. The pool was dirty and extremely small. It was so disgusting that we didn't even want to risk swimming in it.The hotel is located across the street from the Hilton (I think that's what it was), so you can walk over there and try to use their facilities, eat at their restaurants and use their beachfront. It's only a 5 minute walk across the street.Our room was located facing the back, so I would recommend this. It had a balcony and was a decent size. The road noise was pretty non existent and if you stay on a higher floor, you can leave the sliding door open so that the cool breeze is flowing through your room. The rooms were clean and minimally decorated. Everything you needed except food is provided.There are free red apples at the front desk reception, but unless you have no shame, you can only take 1 each.Overall the place is no 5 star hotel, but for the price to value ratio, you are a getting a pretty good deal!","Taguig City, Philippines",264,3.0

We also had a brand new bar fridge and Sharp microwave oven and huge LCD tv. The only minus was that we wereright next to the ice machine on the floor but we got used to the noise.The staff are fabulous and friendly and they even provide beach towels, a free drink and apples. All the tour and activity places knew the hotel so that was convenient for us to get picked up to go jet ski and kayak etc. There were also free local Telephone calls and free internet - you will find it useful.A bonus was how close we were to good, cheap and large portion food (rather than paying tourist prices in the centre of Waikiki) - highly recommend wailana coffee lounge just under the hotel. Also we were across from todai sushi buffet, which looked busy but we never tried it. Also- we were able to walk to (rather than bus it to) AlaMoana shopping complex which is awesome for all your shopping needs and Macy's sales. Walmart and ward shopping is also nearby.All in all, very happy with aqua palms and would happily recommend it to anyone.",,14,5.0

Fridge, microwave, coffeemaker, iron/ironing board, and hair dryer were included in the room. Gym is small. Parking available - $20 per night.Front desk staff are friendly, courteous and helpful. Off the lobby is a tour desk.Directly across the hotel is Hilton Hawaiian Village which you can cut thru to get to the beach. You can easily take TheBus to Diamond Head ($1 entrance); to Hanauma Bay ($1 parking, $7.50 entrance, $12 for snorkel & fins, ~$7 for lifevest, food/drink allowed - no food/drink booths at the beach, tram down to (75-cents) and up from ($1) beach available; to Pearl Harbor (bag storage $3 - no bags of any size allowed past the entrance, entrance Free, gift/souvenir shop prices reasonable unlike some others that are tourist traps.Honolulu has a very efficient and tourist-friendly public bus system. You can practically go anywhere on TheBus, even all the way to the North Shore. TheBus fare is $2.50 for adults, $1.25 for children - exact money required. $1 bill and coins accepted. The driver informed us that the transfer ticket can be used to go any direction on any bus, even the same bus number that you had received the transfer ticket from. Take note of the time expiration.For airport transportation we used TheCab - it cost us $30 to HNL. Luggage is not allowed in TheBus so if you have a bag that you can put on your lap, then this is an option from and to the airport.The Waikiki Trolley stop is right outside the hotel. TheBus stop is a few feet away; on a return by bus you get off infront of the Ilikai Hotel.Coming out of the hotel to your left is the IHOP; a few doors away at the corner is the Wailana restaurant which has a wide array of menu choices and less pricey but delicious fare; an ABC Store is around the corner; across the street are Thai, Japanese, and Indian restaurants.If you don't mind walking, the Beach Walk, the Royal Hawaiian Center malls, and the International Market Place can be walked.Another ABC Store is diagonally across the hotel near the Ilikai Hotel. Several restaurants on that side of Ala Moana Blvd.From the hotel walking to the right there is a chinese restaurant (not recommended); a McDonald's is at the corner; Enterprise, Alamo and National car rental are in the same bldg (we prefer Enterprise because renting with them goes smoothly and they have a friendly staff); restaurants in same bldg.

It's right in Waikiki, although not on the beach. The Waikiki Hilton is right across the street. We booked ""Diamond Head View"" 6th floor with a balcony and we had a partial view of the ocean. Really pretty at night to see all the lights. Since you're on the main street it can be a little noisy from the traffic. The room was a good size, nicely decorated, queen size bed, sofa, desk and a table with chairs. Amenities include flat screen TV, fridge, MW, safe, coffeemaker, hairdryer, phone, alarm clock, good thick towels and nice toiletries. Internet is a hard wired connection - not wi-fi. With the ""Diamond Head View"" you can get a free breakfast at the IHOP which is just off the lobby. You get a voucher with 3 choices or $5 off any other choices. The desk clerk says it's valid for the whole day, not just breakfast time. We didn't use it as we wanted to get to Pearl Harbor early to get tickets for the Arizona memorial. The area seems safe to walk around. There's a Subway and McDonald's just a few blocks up the street in a kind of mini-mall. Just turn right when you walk out the front door of the hotel.When you first arrive at the hotel, you can drive up on the sidewalk in front of the IHOP to park and run in to register. The covered parking garage is next to the front door, up a steep ramp- you'll need your room key to open the gate. Parking is a bit tight, but not too bad. Be sure to place your parking pass on the dashboard.All in all, a very nice choice. Good room, clean, great price, and very helpful staff. We'd stay here again.","Glenelg, Maryland",198,5.0

Grabbed a cab from the airport because I had a late flight and didn't want to deal with shuttles. Fare was $28.70 plus tip. Check in was smooth and pleasant and although I booked a city view room I got a Diamond Head view. My room, I think, is slightly larger than the rest, at the end, has a nice size lanai, and also has a view of the ocean (partial). A previous reviewer posted about the small lanai and I see what they mean. The room next to me does have a tiny, maybe 6 ft by 10 inches, lanai; kind of odd compared to the size of mine. Staff has been great. Bathroom is small, particularly the shower/tub area, which is also not lit. The counter is a very nice size, however. Here's the bottom line: I did this trip on a budget and this hotel was very, very reasonable. Across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village (a hotel I have stayed at and liked a lot but someone else paid the bill) which is fun to browse around and has a great beach. I love this end of Waikiki and it's an easy walk to the ""heart"" of Waikiki. The rate I paid is less than half of the HHV, got the same location, a clean roomy room with a microwave, fridge, free coffee and newspaper. So the money I saved allowed me to do a lot of Christmas shopping! If you want luxury, you have lots of choices. If you want functional, clean, great location, and a bargain so that you can spend what you saved by staying here at the plethora of shopping opportunities there is in this area, stay at the Aqua Palms.","Midland, Michigan",17,5.0

The front desk staff was very diligent in calling us on our mobile once our room was ready• Housekeeping was excellent. Great attention to detail• request for a quiet, higher room was attended to.

Room carpet really needed a change• noticeably absent since our last visit was cutlery and bathrobes in room• our Aqua’s 10th Birthday Special rate was not factored into our final bill.

The hotel is located across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village which has an expanse of a beach front. The beach front is open to the public which I went walking or jogging every day. The hotel is not your average 5 star hotel but it is decent. It is clean, they clean your room and change the bedding every day and the front desk is very helpful. There is a happy hour manager's special every Thursday with live band and drinks and finger food which I thought was very nice. There is also an event desk person that helps you book trips and educates you on things you can do. Also if you rent a car be aware that parking is going to be about $20 or more on average in that area.In all we enjoyed our stay in Hawaii. Honestly no matter where you stay, you'll enjoy the place.

It is located next to the Hilton Hawaiian Village resort, and the entire beach is open to the public, which is also true for the shopping areas between the hotel buildings at the Hilton, so the walk to the beach from the hotel is pleasant with many small touristy shops (jewelry, clothing, etc.), bars and restaurants in a pedestrian only environment. There are two ABC convenience stores within a few hundred meters (this seems to be true for most locations in Hawaii though!). The immediate area around the hotel has a good selection of restaurants, but countless restaurants are within 10-20min walking distance in the area further east of the hotel. Right outside the hotel, the bus to the airport stops. The only disadvantage to the location is the relatively high traffic on Ala Moana blvd. right outside the property, and this does generate noticeable noise in the rooms facing Diamond head, even at night. It is best to leave the lanai door closed, and one might as well ignore the lanai, as it is not pleasant to sit on it with all the traffic noise. The view of Diamond Head from the hotel is nice though (through the glass door!). The first night we stayed in one of the rooms facing the other way (the cheapest rooms). One would think it would be more quiet, but that was not the case as we were on the top floor (room 1105) which is very close to (and above) the roof of the neighboring building which generates a lot of noise from the HVAC systems on the roof, making it almost impossible to sleep as the lanai doors let in most of the noise. We were happy to be upgraded to a Diamond Head view room on the second day (using a coupon), because the traffic noise was not as aggravating and the room was also significantly larger.Everything was perfectly clean, well maintained, and the beds were comfortable and the staff kind and helpful. The rooms have a refrigerator with plenty of room to hold drinks and stuff for breakfast (if you're rolling you own breakfast like we did).

Loved the hotel - location couldn't be better being right opposite the Hilton Hawaiian Village with its beautiful gardens, shops and bars and direct walkway to one of the best beaches in Waikiki. A ten minute walk in one direction takes you to the enormous Ala Moana shopping centre and there are numerous shops and eating places all around the hotel. The famous trolley buses stop right outside and the tour buses pick up right across the road at the Hilton. The hotel was perfect for us. We booked a Diamond Head View room which had been recommended in other reviews and were very happy with it. We were on the 6th floor which gave us direct views over the iconic Hilton Hawaiian Village dancer statues and water - lovely at night with its flaming torches - and all the lights of Waikiki. Also we watched the weekly fireworks on the beach from our balcony. We also overlooked Fort DeRussy Park with spectacular Diamond Head in the background. Would definitely recommend paying a little extra for one of these rooms. Our room was a good size with small sofa, table and chairs and huge plasma TV on the wall. Bed was very comfortable, great mattress and pillows. Room was kept very clean and was serviced daily by the most charming and happy housekeeping staff - in fact all the hotel staff were great, very friendly, helpful and always smiling! Our breakfasts at the adjoining Ihop restaurant were included and we ate most evenings at the Wailana Restaurant on the corner of our block - huge meals and great value, with discount for Aqua Palms guests. We didn't have a car so can't comment on parking but found we didn't need one as the transport system is so good - trolleys are plentiful and The Bus is one of the best ways to travel around, very cheap with visitor passes available. My husband used the swimming pool which is pretty small, only negative being no shade around it so for us that meant no lazing around the pool reading as it was just too hot!

Given the right package options, I would definately stay here again. It's best feature is it's location on Ala Moana Blvd, across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. This the west end of Waikiki, considered by some to be the beginning of the strip. Ala Moana Blvd merges into Kalakaua Ave just down the block. For those of you familiar with Waikiki, the quickest access to the beach is through the lobby of the Hilton. The beach in front of the Hilton offers is one of the widest spots of Waikiki beach (remember, the beaches in Hawaii are open to everyone). There is a city bus (The Bus) stop near the entrance of the hotel and a Waikiki Trolley bus stop just out the door. Ala Moana Shopping Center (largest mall in the state) is an easy 10 minute walk. The only downside of the location is the occasional street noise that can be heard from the room (trucks, sirens, depends on the time of day, day of the week - weekends, more sirens).Check in was quick and easy; staff friendly, efficient and knowlegable. The lobby area is compact. Free wifi in the lobby. There are a couple of pay per use internet terminals as well. There is an IHOP adjacent to the lobby.The hotel offers several floors of parking. The parking structure is between the first floor (lobby) and first floor of hotel rooms. Tight turns in the parking garage make it better suited for smaller cars, but mid-sized and larger cars do fit. Although parking is shared with the IHOP, it is gated and somewhat secure. I got free parking as an option. This was one of the main reasons I picked this hotel. The normal parking fee was $20/day.My room was on the 11th floor (out of 12). Good view of the beach, Diamond Head and the surrounding towering hotels. Rooms were very basic but well equiped, mini fridge, coffee maker, microwave, iron & ironing board, hairdryer, flat screen TV w/cable, and free internet (wired only in the room, wireless in the lobby). My room had a single queen sized bed, very comfortable, which left room for a sleeper couch. The closet was small. The bathroom was very small, but clean and amply stocked with towels, soaps, shampoos, etc. Overall the room was clean and well maintained, nicely decorated.I did take advantage of the fitness center, also quite small. It contained an assortment of dumbells, a bow machine, two treadmills and an eliptical machine. There was a small TV, a water cooler and a bathroom.","Seattle, Washington",9,4.0

We wanted a good deal, best view we could get for a good deal, biggest lanai and had to be as close to Ala Moana Beach Park as possible. Wow, did we pick right! That lanai was huge for Waikiki and we enjoyed it bright and early every morning with our gorgeous view of the water, complimentary coffee and the sunrise. Yes, the HHV was right in the middle of our view but that was fine because we paid $120 a night! We even got a surprise fireworks show on a Saturday night compliments of the HHV! Could not see Friday's fireworks but we saw most of Saturday's show and sent the video to our kids at home. Totally unexpected and so cool!We love Ala Moana Beach Park and it was a short walk or an even shorter bus ride. Bus stop right in front of the hotel and we enjoyed the four day bus pass we bought at ABC store across the street for $25 each. That was our other major value for our money! We more than tripled our money back on that deal and having stops so close to our hotel was convenient. Plus Ala Moana Center is super close and the bus transfer station is located in the parking garage of the mall. Vacations for us mean no stress and that means forget about driving in that crazy traffic! Spoiled ourselves and took a taxi to and from the airport, which we recommend!This is not a resort hotel but it was clean, great fridge and microwave and the bed and pillows were wonderful! Our maid was fantastic and had the room cleaned by the time we returned from the beach at noon every day to get ready for our next adventure. (remember to tip your maid and she will make sure you get extra coffee! Thank you Loreta!) So now the possible cons.....yes, the first two nights were noisy because the recent construction left steel plates that were & noisy every time a car ran over them. That problem was fixed by our third night and it's all good. I read all the reviews neurotically and still begged for the ocean view with a lanai cause noise doesn't bother us. We sleep fine when it is time to sleep. Hanging out on a beach all day and traipsing all over Oahu while eating yummy food can wear a person out! And yes, it sucks to have to share the three elevators with the staff..... But we felt it sucks worse for them than for us. They were trying to get their work done and why did the hotel not have service elevators for them to use? The elevators can be slow and it was annoying but we just remembered to jus' relax and don't worry about it. I inquired about the late check- out I read was available for a price on the reviews. When I called to ask about it before our trip, I was told to ask at check-in if it was available. I did but the clerk told me she would not know if I could have that service until the morning of our check- out. That was annoying. So instead of sweating it, I just booked another night and avoided being tossed from our room at noon even though our plane left for Anchorage at nine that night. Read on this site that another gal did that and it made sense! I know they would have stored the bags but that last day of going to the beach and fully enjoying our time on Oahu right up to the last minute was worth every dime. The showers we took after the beach would have been missed! I did not want to wait until the last day to get a better deal. I just wish I had not been told I could find out when checking in.... small annoyance.Yes, the room could be considered small if more than two people are using it. We only sat on the couch and that was comfy. Preferred to sit on the lanai enjoying the awesome view when in the room, night or day. The bathroom is not big but it was clean, great toiletries and strong shower with plenty of hot water! Remember, this is not the HHV across the street so do not expect huge rooms. Be happy with saving all that money, (book ahead and save more!), because now you have more cash to eat better, go on tours if that's your thing and do some world class shopping!We would stay here again easily! Oahu is too fast paced for us so we will be in Maui for our 30th anniversary this next April. But if we ever need more action again, we will book Aqua Palms and Spa! Deb Mc.P.S. Wailana's Diner is the best! We ate there six times in a week and never remembered to ask for the discount! Still a fantastic deal! Loved their food, atmosphere and great service! Their prices are such a good deal.....why go to the IHOP (no offense) when you can absorb that local ambience in a truly authentically Hawaiian restaurant!",Alaska,21,4.0

Hotel lobby and staff welcoming. The desk staff was very helpful with any questions or concerns I had. Enjoyed the anytime fresh cup of coffee and ice cold lemon water located in the lobby. Very convient to have IHOP located right next door/connected to hotel. Plus you get a discount being a hotel occupant. Elevator wait time wasn't that bad, but time of year didn't seem extremely busy either. Housekeeping did a wonderful job daily cleaning our room/bathroom, refreshing the towels and sheets as needed. (We stayed a week.) Beds very comfortable, rooms clean, and TV large flat screen. Nice to have mini frig and microwave in room although not used much. Rooms adequate size, but would have liked larger. Furniture seemed to just fit with 2 queen beds. Not much extra moving around room.Walk to beach wasn't bad, walked 2-3 blocks for closest access by the Hilton. (It's nice to have 2 complimentary large beach towels to use for the beach.) The Hilton across the street has some awesome photo opportunities for your family with all the beautiful foilage and landscaping. You have to walk pretty much anywhere you go unless you pay to use the trolley/the bus or pay $20/day parking in a very cramped parking garage.We did not use the pool one time. It looked clean and was pretty much deserted everytime I looked out the window at it. But is very small if you're looking to spend much time in the pool. Fitness room was small also, but sufficient if you want to get a little workout. Most people seem to just go outside for a walk or jogging. I noticed lots of people jog in Honolulu/Waikiki.Location is close walking distance to beach, park, shopping, fine restaurants, car rentals, etc.","Columbia, Tennessee",15,4.0

The location is very good - right across from Waikiki, decent grocery store right behind the hotel, 10 minute walk to Ala Moana Center (and Ala Moana beach, of course). Rooms are pretty ordinary, but clean and well equipped. The furniture tends to be a bit worn. This last time I was on a higher floor and had a balcony looking towards the canal/pali. More expensive rooms might come with a glimpse of ocean, but are also on the noisier side of the building. The pool is actually pretty nice - it's on perhaps the 4th floor of the building, and is a pleasant place to keep an eye on the sunset. Staff are all helpful and friendly.

I believe that it would be near impossible to find a better bargain. The hotel lobby is rather small and the hotel room was somewhat (but not overly) dated. The good points far ounumber the few provisos. The staff are consistenly cheerful and helpful. The maid service is impeccable. The rooms are furnished with a large flat screen TV, Microwave, refrigerator and small coffee pot w/ fixings, comfortable bed and usual furniture. The location is close to Hilton Hawiian Village, DeRussy Park, a neighborhoold restaurant as well as an IHOP next door. Busses stop close by and some shuttles stop right outside the entrance: it's easy transport to Ala Moana Mall, Army Museum (free), beach parks, hotels and the International Marketplace. There is an ABC market around the corner so a person can buy almost any common product and store them in the room or refrigerator. All in all, the Palms is a bargain unless you desire a high-end environment. Personally, I would rather save a few dollars for more fun things.","Payson, Az.",56,4.0

On previous occasions, we've stayed in the heart of Waikiki - on this trip, we appreciated the more residential feel and quieter sidewalks of this part of Waikiki (central Waikiki is an approximate 10 minute walk away). The hotel was clean, the beds comfortable, the staff were courteous (Francis and Lester were fantastic). There were many perks that we appreciated - free IHOP breakfast with the Diamond and higher rooms, manager's reception, free coffee, lemon ice water and fruit in the lobby. It's a five minute walk to what we belive to be one of the best beach areas in Waikiki - accessibility to the Kahanamoku lagoon is fantastic for families. There is a Food Pantry within a couple of blocks that is great to pick up some supplies for a light lunch or snacks. Many good restraunts in close proximity (favourites were the Wailana and the Fat Greek).Although there was roadwork underway during the night, it was not a problem for us. We also feel the noise transfer between rooms was less of an issue at this hotel than in many more expensive hotels we've stayed in.

Since this was my first time in Honolulu, I didn't know the area or where to stay, so I checked TripAdvisor and found the Aqua Plams, which was a wonderful find. Entering the lobby of the hotel was welcoming and almost magical. The lobby was clean, well appointed, with nice, comfortable furniture, tropical decor, a large glass water dispenser filled with ice, water, and slices of lemon, and the staff were all wearing nice Aloha shirts and beaded leis. I was greeted with very friendly courtesy and check-in was a breeze. There is a tour desk and concierge in the lobby, as well as couple of computers for internet access, which you pay for with a credit or debit card. Not cheap, but handy. The one problem I encountered was using the elevators. There are three elevators off the lobby and all of the guests use them, so sometimes it takes a while to get up. I usually just walked down the stairs instead of waiting for an elevator. The room itself was great, with clean, modern furnishings, nice and new linens and bedding, a king size bed, and a private lanai overlooking Ala Moana Blvd. The traffic and street noise was a bit much but the Aqua is across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village and every night around 6:00 p.m. or so a worker in a traditional costume runs out and lights all the torches. Very scenic. The Hilton also has a fireworks show every Friday night and you can either get an obstructed view from your Aqua lanai or just walk across the street and join the crowd at the beach. The Aqua also is located close enough to easily walk to Ala Moana Center, where there are dozens of restaurants, shops, department stores, even a post office and, my favorite, a Foodland store. If you like poke (think flavored and spiced sashimi), then Foodland has a great selection and good deals, including a poke bowl, fish and rice for only $6.00. The Aqua is also next door to an IHOP and a few steps away from a 24 hour coffee house restaurant that has a wide and varied menu (but bring a sweater because it's kept at freezing in there) that also includes local favorites like loco moco and fried saimin. I loved my stay at the Aqua but did find it a bit of a walk from most of the action in Waikiki. Best to get a bus pass and ride the air conditioned buses up and down the strip and wherever else you want to go on Oahu. One tip: the US Army museum is just a 15 minute walk east from the hotel and it's very interesting. The museum is housed in a former artillery battery at Ft. DeRussey. I stayed there in June 2010 (can't select this date on the website).","San Jose, California",53,5.0

It is in a good central position, near Waikiki but not too far from the cruise ship terminal or the airport.Our room was on the 9th floor - a Diamond Head View room. We did have a good view from our balcony but Diamond Head is quite a long way from there so it was a distant view. However, the overall view from the 9th floor was very nice, and particularly lovely at night with all the lights! It is not a quiet street, even on the 9th floor. My husband slept well and wasn't disturbed by traffic noise etc. however I wore ear plugs! The room was fairly spacious and clean with the usual signs of wear that you might expect from a busy hotel that is a few years old. However, we thought the room was quite good and excellent value for the price. If you want to stay at a palatial hotel in Waikiki then you will certainly pay for it! Yes, the lifts are slow but you just need to be a bit patient! You're on holiday! One thing that is not really a gripe but a bit strange was the fact that on three occasions when I went to shower, there was no hot water. I was told they were working on the hot water service the first time I enquired about it and I actually didn't mention it again until we checked out - the staff seemed surprised it had happened a few times? Having said that, my husband who showered at a different time to me each day had no hot water issues? I guess I was just unlucky as it seemed to be an intermittent problem? The staff were all very friendly and helpful both at reception and the tour desk. We organised a few tours and nothing was too much trouble. Our hire car, booked through the hotel, was only a short walk away at Enterprise and we were very happy with them also. We actually only hired the car for a day to drive around the island and I would recommend this as it is quite different when you get away from Honolulu. The north shore beaches are wonderful and we stopped on the way at the shrimp truck for a delicious lunch - I think it was called Giovanni's? We found we could walk to a number of restaurants near the hotel and to the big mall nearby which we only visited once. Shopping centres aren't big on our priority list when we go on holidays - we can shop at home! Mind you, a lot of tourists we spoke to seemed to enjoy regular visits there. We weren't really keen on some of the food we'd eaten at the cafes for breakfast so ended up preferring to go to the local convenience store where we could buy nice fresh fruit, juice and yoghurt.

We had requested a room with two queen beds, but were told when we checked in that they only had a room with one queen bed and a queen size sofa bed available. When we checked the next day for a different room, they told us that they would let us know if another room became available, although from the whispering among the staff, we inferred that they weren't going to move us to a different room even if one became available. We paid $20 per night for parking, but our room key seldom worked to open the parking gate and the parking was limited and cramped (although from what I've seen, that is normal for Waikiki area).

I booked for a Diamond head view and requested for a 2 beds but got a queen bed with a sleeping sofa when I checked in.

If you stay in this area you really don't need a rental car unless you plan to circle the island. Walking distance to Waikiki strip if you like shopping and partying at night.

We found the staff were more than helpful to the point that when they found out we were getting married while there they offered us one of the penthouse rooms for our pictures before we left to get married. They have a very large car park so if you hire a car while there no problems with parking, they have a gym (we didnt use it) they also have a spa which we didnt get chance to use either. The maid service is second to none and nothing is too much trouble for them either, they also have a self service laundry which of course if your going on somewhere else after here is very useful, as my husband to be thought the very day we were getting married it kept him happy while he waited for me to get ready!!!

The views of the ocean are minimal, even in the ocean view rooms, but the other amenities provided by the hotel and its location make this a great deal. Aqua Palms is right across the street from Hilton Hawaiian Village, which invites the public to use its property. We walked to the beach through the Village and it took about 5 minutes (and that is with a 6 year old). We also did a lot of shopping and ate at the Village. Our room, itself, was comfortable. We had a king bed with a sleep sofa. The carpets were filthy and need shampooing, but the rest of the room was clean. The dresser and armoir were very old and worn, but still functional. My parents were in a room with a king bed only, and it was small--about 1 1/2 feet around each side of the bed and they couldn't sit at the table because there wasn't room to pull out chairs. I would suggest anyone making reservations request a room to accommodate three people since the price is the same. That way, you can be sure to get a larger room. The beachtowels the hotel provides were convenient, too. The parking garage was tiny. If you are renting a car, skip the SUV! We actually saw an extended cab truck get stuck because a car was parked illegallly (parking spaces were in high demand that week) and the truck did not have enough room to make the corner. The pool was tiny, but clean. My son enjoyed it. They refilled it while we were there. Not sure why. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We used the concierge service to book a tour and got a great discount. The construction is still going on at night. Most nights, they quite around midnight, but one night they went all night long. My family slept through it but I didn't. It was much quieter on the backside/city view of the hotel. All in all, this is one of the best values you'll find in Waikiki.

The hotel provides beach mats and beach towels at the lobby desk. They also have red delicious apples & newspapers for free. The rooms are very clean. Some are larger than others. Great staff with true aloha spirit. They have a party once a week in the lobby with delicious pineapple cocktails and entertainment. The beds are excellent and it's pretty quiet. I didn't use the pool - it's tiny. Why swim in the pool when you have the wonderful warm ocean waters minutes away?Parking garage is tight - rent a compact car!

Upon arrival in beautiful Honolulu we proceeded downtown to our hotel the Aqua Palms & Spa. After an initial misstep where the airport shuttle dropped us off at a different Aqua Resorts property we proceeded to check into the right hotel and after a long morning of travel and a three hour time change, we were immediately impressed not only with the helpful staff but with the location of the hotel. Although to us it was late in the afternoon, the three hour time change had us at our hotel prior to the scheduled check-in time. Since our room was not yet available, the hotel took care of our baggage which allowed us to take in the shops and scenic locales adjacent to the hotel. Waikiki Beach was very easy walk from the hotel and there were numerous buses and trolleys which stopped in front of the hotel on a constant basis. When we finally made it to our room, I was impressed not only with the size and comfort of the room but with the amazing view of Diamondhead as well as a partial view of the beach. The room had a high-def flatscreen which has several channels to choose from as well as foldout couch, desk, complimentary high-speed Internet, microwave, mini fridge & safe. The shower was very relaxing and complimentary spa products were made available which is a plus (especially after subjecting your skin and hair several days of sun and salt water). The hotel also offers a full spa service and in-room massages are available as well. The hotel has a pool located on a deck on one of the lower floors which gives guests and enjoyable and relaxing private oasis in the heart of the city’s perfect after a long day. On Wednesdays there’s a Manager’s Reception and the concierge desk in the lobby will happily arrange island excursions for their guests. If you happen to be in Waikiki on a Friday night, make sure to catch the fireworks a Waikiki beach. Check-out was very smooth and we were able to call ahead and have a taxi waiting for us to take us to the pier for our cruise. Upon completion of our cruise we returned to the Aqua Palms & Spa and once again were given storage for bags when we arrived early in the morning. Venturing out in a new direction we found that an extremely impressive and upscale mall is only a 10 minute walk away. The Ala Moana Shopping Center not only offers plenty of shopping options but several dining options as well. The area around the Aqua Palms & Spa is rife with restaurants, convenience stores, and other shopping options and the helpful hotel staff were more than happy to point out and provide directions to area restaurants whenever we asked. Following a week in a cruise ship cabin it was extremely enjoyable to take in the extremely comfortable AquaBLISS pillowtop bed that the hotel offers as well as enjoy being able to have plenty of space in which to work. Rooms starting at just $90 a night are an exceptional value especially when one considers the location of the hotel. The comfortable and clean hotel and friendly staff truly makes the Aqua Palms & Spa an incredible value and an enjoyable stay for those looking to visit Waikiki on a budget.","Phoenix, Arizona",84,4.0

We are Navy and were permanently moved to Pearl Harbor. We had to choose a hotel to stay in while the military found us a home. We had stayed in the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the military only Hale Koa hotel previously... both were too expensive/all booked.Room:We stayed in room 712. We were upgraded because we were military... the room looked exactly like the room we had orignally booked, but we found out later some of the rooms don't have a balcony and ours did. The room was very tidy and neat. Very large TV with decent channels. We used the internet a lot in the room. It's free, but very slow. The room had a mini fridge, coffee maker and microwave that were both very useful. There was also a vending machine on the floor.Staff:The staff was friendly. No complaints.iHOP:The entrance to iHOP is right off the lobby. Because we were traveling on military TLA orders, we got free breakfast for 2 every morning. We didn't take advantage of it until the last 3 days. They printed us out 6 vouchers. They give you 3 options... they 2X2X2 is the best deal... 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and your choice of either 2 pieces of bacon, or 2 sausage. If you are not military, but a guest of the hotel, you get 10 or 15% off... can't remember which.Location:The location of the hotel was pretty good. Mapquest made it seem closer to the beach then it was. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty close, but it's on a one way street so you have to walk the opposite direction to the intersection to cross... and walk through the hilton property to get to the beach. Seemed like a long way to walk when you're soaking wet from the ocean.Parking:The hotel has a parking garage right above the lobby. Again, because we were military, we got free parking... I'm not sure what it costs to park daily. I *think* it was about $18. We forgot to put our pass back on our dash once and had a note waiting for us. We thought it was a ticket but it was bascially a ""warning"" saying they had taken down the description of our vehicle, and if it happends again it could be towed, etc.Although we were happy with the hotel, next time I'd pay a little more money and stay in a hotel on the beach.If you're military, I HIGHLY reccommend the Hale Koa.FYI... our TLA allowance was about $221 per night for my husband, one dependent and one child under 12. Although the hotel was only about $150 a night at their TLA rate... we wern't told in advance what our rate was so we played it safe with the price. Darn!","Lacey, Washington",6,3.0

on at my sweetie's employment, we weren't sure could take time off until two days before we actually did take time off. happily, i was able to make reservations for a three night stay at the aqua palms. i was familiar with the brand because when my mother visited a couple of years ago, she stayed at the aqua aloha surf & spa. we checked out her room there and felt it was a solid value. the palms & spa similarly satisfied our needs: clean, comfy place to return after playing tourist in waikiki for $100 or less a night (we're saving our money for a longer vacation on the mainland in the next few months).first of all, aqua always has a great kamaaina rate. interestingly, they were also running a ""birth certificate"" discount that was an even better value. we were able to get a city view room for less than $90/night (fri-mon). secondly, the staff are always cheerful & in my experience, very willing to work with you. initially, we were given a room on the 2nd floor which i was unhappy with only because people at the pool could see directly into our room. i called to request another room because of the privacy issue and within 15 minutes, we were given one on a higher floor. divinia (i think that's how her name was spelled) was very pleasant over the phone.a nice touch we experienced while in the first room: one of the staff (bellman? i didn't get his name) came by with a personalized note from the hotel manager along with a six pack of chocolate covered macadamia nuts. my sweetie and i are honolulu residents, so we're not impressed by chocolate mac nuts only because we can get them anytime, but definitely we appreciated the personalized note and the fact that the nuts were not just left on the bed or in the room but that someone came up to bring them to us. it's a very warm welcome that you don't get at the larger hotels. also in the room are cards that tell you who your room attendant is, etc.another thing you don't always get at the larger hotels: a microwave. yet the aqua palms and spa has both a good-sized fridge with freezer compartment and a micro. a friend of ours stayed at one of the chic and very expensive suites on the 30-somethingth floor at the hawaii prince hotel during the 4th of july and that suite did not have a micro.by the way, the room we stayed in (1119) looks exactly like the example does on the website. the palms & spa touts its beds as being ""aquabliss"" and they were very comfortable--more so than our own bed at home (am now in the market for a new bed, actually). it doesn't have much of a view--you can barely see the top of diamond head from the balcony over and between other hotels--but we didn't care much about that (remember, we're from honolulu). i can see how a tourist might be disappointed with the view or lack thereof. also, unlike others, we had no problems with street noise even on the one night city crews were working on ala moana blvd right by the hotel front. the A/C was a little rumbly but nothing bothersome. the A/C temperature was easy to adjust (it's on the wall by the bed) and we liked that it would turn off automatically when you opened the balcony door.i should say that the bathroom is tight. the only way two people can be in there at one time is if one is sitting on the toilet or in the bathtub and the other is standing at the faucet. also, other posts saying that the only way you can get into bathroom is to open the door fully and the only way you can get into the tub is to close the door fully are true. we found lighting in the bathroom to be good. for some reason, the shower head has colored lights. it would alternate between green, red and blue. it didn't provide extra illumination, in our view, but it was both perplexing (because we were trying to figure out if it was tied to something like water temperature but it didn't seem to be) and entertaining.to address hotel location: i specifically picked this hotel because i didn't want to be in the middle of the bustle that is waikiki. i wanted us to do a fair bit of walking on our staycation. we found that it took us no more than 15 minutes to walk from the palms & spa to the royal hawaiian hotel & shopping center if we went on kalia rd past the hilton and ft. derussy park and cut through the trump tower's loading area/valet parking on saratoga to get to beachwalk and cut through the embassy suites hotel (where yardhouse is) to get to lewers ave. i think the palms location is great if don't mind a bit of walking to get to central waikiki (which, most locals would say, is located at the royal hawaiian, i think).oh--something most first time visitors to hawaii don't know--locals don't really go to waikiki beach for the most part. we go to ala moana beach and magic island. if you find waikiki beach too touristy and smelly of coconut oil, the palms & spa is within easy walking distance to ala moana beach and waikiki beach. it's great for swimming with kids, is nowhere near as crowded as waikiki beach and you won't have to deal with people hawking surfing lessons etc. ala moana shopping center is also easy to reach from the palms & spa and it's the largest mall in the state with a great food court.regarding the parking: yes, the ramps are a tight curve and a bit of a squeeze if you drive something longer/bigger like an lexus LS460Lor a Titan (though we did see a Titan parked in there). $20 a night is the usual for waikiki hotels (remember, we're on an island and land resources quite finite; property values are accordingly very high). we never had trouble getting a space if we left the hotel. you will gasp at the steep incline at the entrance and if you drive a stick shift, hopefully you are fairly experienced or have some sort of ""hill assist"" function. otherwise, it's no big deal; just drive cautiously. oh--i wouldn't recommend forgetting to place the parking placard the hotel gives you onto your dash when you park because i got three tickets in the last 24 hours of our stay. the lady who checked us out at front desk laughed when i sheepishly handed her the tickets and placard, all the while apologizing. i didn't have to pay extra and i was very glad not to have been towed (though the instructions clearly say i could have been).we forgot to look at the fitness center but i peeked at the pool. it is small and goes only to four or five feet deep. as others have pointed out, this might be a disappointment but all beaches in hawaii are public beaches by law so feel free to head over to waikiki beach or the beach fronting the hilton (technically part of waikiki beach, i think) or, as i said earlier, go to magic island/ala moana beach park.we didn't eat at the IHOP on site. while we did go to wailana (which i've gone to countless times since i was a kid, so yeah--wailana's a 24 hour retroish coffee shop that locals go to), i forgot to show my room key for the discount. didn't matter--we enjoyed our patty melt & reuben with fries just the same (the shakes are good, too). iron chef morimoto's restaurant is across the way in the edition hotel, as are chart house (great happy hour menu at sunset and late night w/local music), harbor pub pizza (pizza & beer & i heard a good breakfast) and red lobster. you can have japanese buffet at hawaii prince's hakone restaurant and fairly serene breakfast buffet with a view of the harbor a prince court (also at hawaii prince hotel). also very near are buffalo wild wings (great for wings, beer & sports TV), the irish rose saloon (yelp it) and an abc store (waikiki's answer to 7-11) that is stocked with more stuff than you'd expect like a variety of fresh fruit and other grocery staples (peanut butter, jellies, bread, cereals, etc). i guess that's because the population on this end of waikiki is less transient with people living on boats in the harbor and a number of condos in the area.from the aqua palms, we hoofed it to enjoy places like the edge of waikiki (beachfront bar at the sheraton waikiki), duke's barefoot bar (beachfront bar at outrigger waikiki), iyasume (behind the hyatt on koa avenue in a little alleyway; best musubis: spam/shiso, spicy chicken, salmon/mentaiko and good chicken karaage); ramen nakamura (best japanese style ramen in waikiki; kamaaina discounts w/Hawaii ID); tonkatsu ginza bairin (best authentically japanese pork katsu on island, including one made w/kurobota pork; panko breading is texturally like snow--crisp but gives way beautifully; nobu (OMG...pastry chef rachel murai's desserts are ethereal!); morimoto's (great to-be-seen celeb restaurant); lewers lounge (swanky bar in swanky halekulani hotel; great place to begin a romantic night of cocktails, jazz chocolate fondue).we were surprised on the afternoon of our third day to come back to a note from the housekeeper thanking us for the tips we'd been leaving her on the bed. we appreciated this acknowledgement. housekeeping was great--they refilled our toiletries a little quicker than needed and the room was always spotless after they did their thing. they were always cheerful when we'd pass them in the halls or ride with them in the elevator.free internet service was also handy. we noticed the speed bogged down a bit during evenings when people were likely in their rooms, catching up on email and looking up places to go to. otherwise, it was reasonably fast. the large LCD tv was enjoyable and you get the full (but non-premium) cable TV that hawaii residents get if they don't choose the DVR option. in other words, you can watch broadcast TV and the major non-premium cable channels such as TBS, USA, OWN, Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, FoodTV, CSPAN, CNN, etc.overall, we'd stay again if we had the same needs (someplace to clean and comfy to crash after hanging out all over waikiki; quick/responsive/aloha-spirited service). i think if you're a tourist the aqua palms & spa is a great choice if you're big on sightseeing, don't plan on staying in your hotel room except to rest & recoup after tiring yourself out and would prefer to spend money on doing things outside of the hotel like enjoy pricier restaurants, do some shopping, and go on tours or do adventurist stuff like go parasailing or charter a fishing boat. as others said, it's an older hotel that's been refreshed and therefore by no means swanky or luxurious. but it is more than satisfactory for the price and in our experience, can exceed, in some ways, what you'd get at the pricier, big name resorts.","honolulu, hi",4,4.0

The front desk person was really helpful in getting us checked in quickly so that my husband could go put our daughter into bed as she was sleeping when we arrived. My only complaint would be at the end of our week long stay, the housekeeper didn't empty out our coffee pot our second to last day. Aside from that, housekeeping was on top of it. This hotel is nothing lavish but very cute and economical. It's centrally located to Waikiki beach and Ala Moana shopping center. My husband and I would recommend it if you're traveling on a budget.

Look them up and make your reservation online.The room: King bed with sofa pull out bed,coffeemaker with Hawaiian coffee provided, frig, microwave, in room data cable on desk (worked well),LG flat screen TV. The room is a very good size. Daily maid service with linens changed every 4th day unless you request otherwise.The complimentary safe is bolted to the bottom of the night stand in a very difficult spot to get to.There was no floor lamp to read by and the lamps on the night stand do not move and are at the wrong height to read in bed.Bath amenities: bath gel,body lotion,shampoo,conditioner infused with Noni papaya & pineapple extracts.

The room was quite small for 3 people and the bathroom would need a bit of a revamp and again it was really really small; however the beds & pillows were quite confortable...not sure if it was because I was on holiday in one of the most beautiful parts of the world but slept like a baby. I did read other reviews saying that the bed was too small, so might be very personal, but I am quite tall and my boyfriend is quite stocky and we were didnt find the beds small at all. The actual bath is a bit small and dated but the toilet and sink were new and personally I thought those were the most important thing. The location is pretty good I think, you are far enough from the noise but close enough to the Ala Moana shopping centre and the beach. We did walk a lot but I if you enjoy walks and exploring places outside the Waikiki area as well , the location is for you. The drinks in the lobby, apples, beach towels and free paper were a really good addition; It would have been awesome to have water in th lobby at night when coming back from our walks.

I will summarize some points that many reviewers have mentioned and what I found during my stay. -The front desk and all staff are friendly, helpful, and efficient -Free wifi in the lobby, free plug in internet in the room-I found the location to be good. It’s about a 10 min walk to Ala Moana Shopping Centre and a 10 min walk through the Hilton Village to the beach. It’s a 5 minute walk across the street to Starbucks (again in the Hilton Village). To reach the action in Waikiki it’s about a brisk 15 minute walk. Be prepared to walk lots.-Parking is $20 per night-There are laundry services -Yes the pool is very small and in my opinion not worth spending time at. -There are ABC stores, IHOP, and a very popular 24 hour café steps outside the front doors. -The rooms are quiet, small, and clean but have been worn down over the years. Again, they are functional. Unfortunately the bed was small, and the AC loud, but ok once you got used to it. There is a safe in the room. -At my request we stayed on the opposite side to Ala Moana given that there was a lot of loud construction and traffic noise. -For a fee ($60) you can request a late check-out of 6:00 PM. -The water, coffee, and fruit in the lobby is a nice touch when you’re returning from a hot day of adventures. Overall this hotel is good and I would stay here again. I would recommend it to people who don’t spend a lot of time in their room and just need a place to sleep after lots of exploring.

I have traveled to Honolulu on business and occasionally for pleasure over the past 12 years or so. Overall, staying at the hotel was a positive experience and I would recommend it for anyone who is value minded and does not expect a big swanky hotel such as Hilton Hawaiian Village. I came on business, but the hotel was filled with lots of vacationers who seemed to have enjoy the place.The hotel is located right on Ala Moana Blvd., across the street from Hilton Hawaiian Village at the west end of Waikiki. Overall, it is a good location and within an easy walk to several good restaurants. It has a very unassuming and understated front entrance. I found the front desk to be extremely friendly and helpful. Initially I signed up for a partial ocean view. After I checked into the room, I realized that the roadwork in front of the hotel had created a noise problem because there was a long line of large metal plates placed into the street where extensive underground cabling is taking place. When cars run over these plates, they can cause a big racket. I requested a move to the city view, or back side of the hotel where this noise problem didn't exist. The front desk could not have been friendlier and immediately moved me.The room was very comfortable, and included a flat panel TV, couch, free plug-in internet, decent carpet, good bed and nice bathroom. Some of the furniture/closet were bit shabby, but overall, everything was clean and fine. There is no restaurant in the hotel, so breakfast can be had at the IHOP next door, or preferably, at the world famous Wailana Coffee House where I have eaten a bazillion times and always go back for more. It is open 24 hours and gets all the jet lagged tourists from hither and yon. It is a great value and beats the overpriced buffets served in many of the hotels.The parking garage gets good marks. It is the typical ""tight"" garage of Honolulu, but the self-park feature is nice and it is pretty easy to get in and out quickly. At $20.00 per day, it is cheaper than other hotel garages where one also needs to tip the car hop. I didn't use the pool or many of the other little features of the hotel, but other guests that did seemed pretty happy. Overall, this hotel is a good choice for the value minded person who does not need luxury, a patio opening right out onto the beach, or the feel of a big hotel.","Beaverton, Oregon",100,4.0

We booked a double queen room which came with a fridge, microwave, large flat screen TV, and a lanai overlooking Ala Moana Blvd. and the Hilton Hawaiian Village Hotel. There was ongoing road construction right below our window, but with the air conditioner on, we hardly noticed the noise. If you plan to stay there any time soon, request a mauka (mountain) facing room, which should be quieter. The construction may well be finished by the time you get there, so ask the front desk about it when you book your room. The only other minor irritant was our phone message light wouldn't turn off. Overall, we were very pleased with the hotel. Our room was large, clean, and comfortable. There were three or four dresser drawers, an armoire, and you could also store clothes on the shelving under the night stand. For breakfast, skip the mediocre IHOP and walk to the Wailea Coffee Shop on the corner. Yummy banana pancakes and portuguese sausage. For lunch/dinner, the ginormous food court at Ala Moana Shopping Center can't be beat. No matter what you're hungry for: Hawaiian, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, hamburgers, pizzas, fried chicken, you name it, it's there. If you want to sample scrumptious Japanese bento meals, go to the second floor of Shirokiya's department store (next to Macy's) for an amazing array of prepared Japanese foods. In terms of parking, if you are military (or retired military) and want to skip the $20 per night Aqua Palms parking fee, do what we do and park at the Hale Koa parking garage just a block away. It's only $8 a night, but you must go to the office and show your military ID to qualify for the deal. We get the multi-day pass which enables you to come and go using a prepaid parking card. Why is it, if we're military, don't we just stay at the Hale Koa, you may be asking. Well, you can't always get a reservation there because it's so popular, the rooms are smaller more expensive than the Aqua Palms, and it's only a five minute walk from the Aqua Palms so we can still use the Hale Koa facilities, snack bar, pool, and base exchange store. If you bring a laptop/iPad, you can't access wifi in your room, but the Aqua Palms front desk staff will assign you a password and you can get free wifi if you sit in the lobby. Additional perks: we enjoyed the free apples at the front desk, and the manager's special on Wednesdays (free chair massage, free tropical drink, live music). I think the Aqua Palms offers a lot of value for the price - a clean, well appointed room with a friendly and patient front desk staff, and it's located conveniently between Ala Moana Shopping Center and Waikiki. We'll be back!","Atlanta, Georgia",3,4.0

The bed was comfortable. Good to have a fridge and microwave. We like to just pick up drinks and snacks at the ABC store. IHOP breakfast was good. I used the exercise room (which has just a treadmill, elip and weights) and the pool every day and found the areas clean and usable. We didn't have a car so I can't rate the parking. Bus stops are convenient and walking distance to lots of shopping and restaurants. We really appreciated the dedicated smoking area near the garage.

We could have stayed at other hotels, but we couldn't resist the value that this hotel offered. The price was awesome for the property. From the pictures the hotel looked so nicely renovated and the truth was not far from it. We were very satisfied. It's true that this hotel was no resort. But since we got plenty of sand and beach in the Big Island, it was not important. We wanted to explore the 'townie' side of Hawaii. It was no luxury but perfect for our needs. The room was nicely done in cheery colors. It was a refreshing welcome from the typically cheesy Hawaiian theme, but still enough to convey the island feel. Our room was large with a space for sitting area. We booked a room with a view of the Diamond Head and partial ocean, and that was what we got. The two large sliding doors let in a lot of light and an awesome view. There was a microwave and a mini fridge, which was helpful. And a free in-room coffee + machine. One complaint about the room, when the glass doors were closed, there were intermittent rattlings coming from that direction. The rattle noise was so strange that I was kept awake on the first nights. Finally I got used to them. There were plenty of restaurants around the hotel, as well as a few ABC stores. There was an IHOP downstairs, but there was also a local breakfast/diner place around the corner. Location was great for walking. We walked to Ala Moana Center where we had our cheap Japanese curries and other local goodies (shortbread cookies). Wal-Mart was also nearby there. We also walked to and from Waikiki many times. Very enjoyable strolls with plenty to see. Catching a bus was very convenient. We took the bus to Pearl Harbor and to Diamond Head. We also rented a car one day to go to Hanauma Bay and to explore the other parts the island. The rental car place was also not a far walk. Hilton Hawaiian Village was just across the street. There was always cold water at the lobby. We especially appreciated the fresh apples at the front desk that we got to enjoy everyday. There was also an activity desk at the lobby for easy booking. The staff at the front desk were also very helpful in giving us from restaurant recommendations to bus information. We definitely had a great time staying here.","Simi Valley, CA",54,5.0

Initially on check-in, I wasn't given the 2 beds requested, but a bed + sofa bed. Then there was a problem with the lock. We were moved to a different room but temporarily and had to move to a different room again during the trip. The rooms are very worn and tired as well as the washrooms. It's older and the furniture looks like it's out of the '80s.The bonus is the convenient location - it is very near to the quieter side (marina side) of Waikiki beach by the Hilton Lagoon. There's multiple ABC stores and restaurants nearby. It's also walkable to Ala Moana mall and the Walmart. The hotel lobby has refreshing complimentary iced cucumber water and complimentary wireless. The Expedia travel desk in the lobby was also convenient. I got a fantastic recommendation for Ahi Tuna Poke near Diamond Head. I extended my booking for 1 more day after booking it initially over the phone for the redeye flight back to the US Mainland. I received the amendment over email. My checkout date was never confirmed with me at check-in. At check-out, they tried to tack on an extra day's charge for me not checking out on time from my room. Only because I had a printout of my reservation which showed the full number of days was it alright. This was the only hiccup of the entire trip but it ended the experience on a bad note.

(i think the front desk has disposable utensils)the towel service at the front desk worked fine - you trade in a card for towels & then switch out the dirty towels at the end of the day. there is a basket right next to the front desk where you place the soiled ones. the pool is very small and on the second floor. do not plan on spending a lot of time there!again, the hotel is average but the positives are that it was clean, well lit, easy parking (but additional $20/day), coin operated laundry facilities on-site, and it offers a great view of diamond head with a very nice little balcony. be warned: it is VERY loud facing diamond head because you are directly above ala moana boulevard which sees a lot of traffic during the nighttime. you need to decide if the view outweighs the noise!",United States,137,3.0

My suggestion is to not pay extra for the Diamond Head view, even though it is breathtaking. The daytime street noise and the night street repair noise is much louder on the ""view"" side of the hotel, plus your second bed is a hide-a bed couch.

I was wishy washy until 1 month before my vacation I called and spoke to service manager Keola. He was super nice (as I was pestering him with so many questions) and I booked Aqua Palms as soon as I hung up. I read other reviews that the service here is great...and I was not disappointed. Not a single mean spirit and they had fresh apples at reception everyday. The ROOM: I was worried that the rooms would look different than the pictures. But they are exactly like the pictures and the pictures others on Tripadvisor have taken. Keola said that most rooms had a sofa and only those with two kings, did not. The room is huge, has a big tv, microwave and fridge. Now if you want a balcony it would be best to call in and request one because the room next to me had a 1 foot balcony and i had two chairs and a table. The bed felt like there was plastic underneath the sheets. and the construction on Ala MOana was very loud, and when it's not being worked on, cars drive over the metal hole covers. But the AC which is loud covers that up. There toiletries were good too. There was only one light in the bathroom and it's location made for a very dark shower. Other than that it was an awesome room. There was one wall that had a cute detail: it had a sand texture. Loved it! The sofa was super comfy although I did not pull it out and test the bed. It was nice to have all that space because we were there was a week and it felt like home. There was lots of room to make a mess.  I always had left overs from dinner so I microwaved it and had it for breakfast. I also bought a jug of guava juice which i poured for myself every morning. and got a new glass everyday. The maids were super nice. When my bf didnt let her in to clean, she asked me if i wanted clean towels and a bunch of other things I didnt think of such as taking out the garbage, replacing toiletries, new glasses etc. which she did without disrupting the sleeping boy. The walls are pretty thick because I never heard my neighbors and once I walked out of my room and they were in front of theirs talking, and I didnt hear it from inside. I did have a ice machine in front of my rooom which was nice and it was not loud. Although my friend on the 9th floor below me couldn't find one, until she came up for a visit. I had a partial view of Diamond Head and the beach. The LOBBY: It's pretty easy to get a cab from the front, and if you're doing those hop on and off trolley tours, the stop is right in front of the hotel. Also cool is that the Hilo Hattie free trolley to go to there store and buy stuff also had the same stop. Why is this cool you ask? because if you need to get to the mall ($6-7 cab ride) you jump on the Hilo trolley and it wakes you there for free and back. Just go buy something cheap from their store at the mall. Everytime I walked into the lobby it had this musty smell like mildew, but that was only place it smelled. The other floors did not have that.FREE INTERNET: is awesome but was connected. And it sometimes was slow. TV: had soooo many channels and was huge. My friend stayed at the AQUA wave and they got the old school tv that was 18"" and had the giant back. Ours was a LG flat screen and I think it was 32"". BEACH TOWEL: were provided.Other things nearby: ABC store, the Hawaiian souvenir shop next door was the cheapest prices I found, the surf shop next to it had cheaper surfing lessons than those at the beach, the divebar called the HIDEAWAY was walking distance and opened late and was dirt cheap, which is also near FONG YUEN which had $10.99 lobster until 3 am. If you're renting a car, ALAMO and NATIONAL are close, and there is a local rental place for bikes, moped, jeeps etc across the street, but they do not have cheap economy cars like ALAMO. Most tours I went on had a pick up across the street at Hilton's bus loading dock, which is a 5 minute walk. And the regular buses were next to that (which I took to Diamond Head.)I'm so glad I didn't waste my money paying more fora Hilton room when I got an excellent room at AQUA Palms.","Bangkok, Thailand",181,5.0

We did not expect that it would be so nice. The hotel staff were always kind and helpful and the room was clean and the king bed was incredibly comfortable. It is a great central location and most tours/adventures leave from right across the road at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Everything is within walking distance and the parks and beach were visible from our lanai. We went down and met the staff for the Manager's reception and I must recommend you try ""The Sway"" drinks they serve on Wednesday evenings. Another plus with this hotel is the optional late checkout. Since our flight did not leave until 10 pm we wanted to book our room later. The front desk scheduled a late check out for 6 pm for $70 moreso we could relax.The downside is that the pool is really small and the overnight construction right outside is loud. Luckily I brought earplugs and the Wailana Coffee House on the corner serves delicious mai tais for only $3.75 so we were able to suffer through the noise.","Victoria, Canada",1,4.0

The rooms are showing some age, but were clean. Room amenities include wall mounted TV, microwave, refrigerator and coffee pot/mugs. There's a small patio with table and chairs - nice for enjoying the afternoon breeze. The rooms are a little cramped, but we rearranged things to our liking and it was fine (we travel with large bags). The room is on a main street near a major intersection, so there is some noise. Right now there is also road construction at nights and the fireworks from the Hilton Hawaiian Village across the street is quite loud on weekends. Still, with the patio closed and the shades drawn it wasn't too bad. If you're a light sleeper though, you'll want to request a quiet room away from the street. Beds were comfortable with lots of pillows of varying thicknesses. The parking is in the same building up a STEEP ramp - someone with a manual transmission kept stalling the engine trying to get up the ramp. Its tricky to get into the parking entrance and large cars definitely will have trouble making the turns up to each level. The trolleys and buses stop right in front of the hotel, so you may want to skip the car. The staff are always friendly and helpful, whether its setting up a tour or recommending a restaurant. The lobby has computers and internet access (for a fee), coffee machine for lattes/capuccino/etc (for a fee) and a tour desk to help find activities. There's an IHOP (International House of Pancakes) across the lobby, but its pricey (Chicken Caesar Salad for $17) and the service wasn't that great (good pancakes though). There's a Starbucks across the street at the Hilton. The location is right on the edge of waikiki, so you avoid a lot of the one-way street issues and its close to the Ala Moana shopping center and the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I would definitely stay here again because of the great staff and the convenient location.","Sacramento, CA",53,4.0

You can park a rental car in the hotel parking lot for $20 (at the time of stay) if you so wish. I wasn't so bothered by the pool or the other amenities. It's a three star hotel so you have to keep in mind that it's not going to be boutique or luxury standard.

We were in Hawaii for a wedding at the Hilton Hawaiian Village hotel and were looking for a budget friendly alternative to that property. This hotel is directly across the street from the Hilton and about a 10 minutes walk to the beach. This part of Waikiki beach is quiet as compared to downtown, so no worries about find a spot!The service at the Aqua Palms was outstanding. I have done a fair amount of travel both for business and pleasure and would say the staff are the friendliest out there! You can tell management empowers their employees and that customer service is the number one priority.Things we loved:-Free coffee, tea and ice water in lobby 24/7-Quiet property - found the Hilton across the street to be quite busy and noisy-Comfortable room with free internet, fridge and microwave-Comfortable beds with 4 pillows per bed-We had a balcony in our room and found the lounge furniture very comfortable-The Waikiki trolley stopped directly in front of the hotel which was super convenient to go anywhere-This property is close to the airport as compared to other properties further toward diamond head. We were the first to be dropped off on the airport shuttle and last to be picked up. Would pick this end of town any day instead of the hustle and bustle closer to diamond head.-the entire property is non smoking!-10% discount offered at the IHOP and Waimea Coffee house. The coffee house has a fabulous salad bar and is extremely reasonably priced for Waikiki.Helpful hints/things to know:-this property doesn't seem to have a lot of rooms with two beds. If this is required, please ensure you call the hotel and reconfirm. We were given a room with King bed the first night but were then prompt moved the following day.-the pool area, although was fine for us was a little small. If you have kids who need room to splash, this is not the hotel for you!- I would recommend upgrading to the diamond head view room. It worked out for us to be an extra $10 per night but included breakfast for 2. It also guarantees you are on the higher floors 6-12th floor and the view is outstanding. You see both diamond head and the ocean!- not all rooms have balconies so make sure this is requested as well-if you are looking for a ""resort"" property, this is not it. Please don't compare this property to the all inclusive you have stayed at. The Hilton is more of a resort property, but they charge for all extras like internet, room service etc.Overall we were extremely happy with our stay at the Aqua Palms and would recommend it for anyone looking for a budget friendly property.","Halifax, NS",11,5.0

The hotel is incredibly average in all areas. The bottom line is that it is clean and decently sized. The location would normally be a good thing as it is within walking distance to the eastern edge of Waikiki Beach. However, due to the road construction directly in front of the hotel, Ala Moana Blvd is terribly congested after hours and on the weekends. Road construction aside I was also surprised by how loud the road noise is – even though we were on the 7th floor. We had a view of Diamond Head Crater, whereas the other side of the hotel (presumably quieter) faces downtown Honolulu. The view was beautiful.I stayed at the Aqua Palms for 7 nights with my family of four (two boys, 8 and 11). We had a queen sized bed and the boys slept on a pull-out couch. My boys are pretty low maintenance, so they did fine on the pull out, but it didn’t look comfortable! The room is a good size for 4 - not that we were in the room that much anyway. There is a serious lack of drawer space, so you will be living out of your suitcase if you have more than 2 people in the room. There is a big armoire, but who brings clothes that need hanging to Hawaii (shorts and Ts!)?!?!? The bathroom was clean; the tub, toilet and sink/vanity were packed in a relatively small space, but it was manageable.It’s about a 15 minute walk to Fort DeRussy beach. You have to cross Ala Moana Blvd which can take 5 minutes in itself if you catch the lights at the wrong time. But it is close and walkable. The hotel provides beach towels (nicely sized and plush), which is an excellent convenience. You can get fresh towels whenever you want. There is a bus stop close by as well as a trolley stop. There are a few places to eat nearby as well. It’s a little more than a mile to walk to the Royal Hawaiian/International Marketplace and along the main drag where there are tons of shops and restaurants. The pool is small and not heated – normally not an issue when it’s beautiful, but we were there in April when it was mostly cloudy and the pool was cold! There is no hot tub. The fitness room was decent with 2 treadmills – possibly an elliptical and/or bike (don’t remember, but really why wouldn’t be running/walking outside along the beach!). There were dumbbells and a Bowflex type machine.There is an IHOP attached to the hotel, but it’s expensive (for pancakes and eggs). You’re better going to the coffee shop next door or the ABC stores (they are everywhere and you can anything). There is a fridge and microwave in the room too.In summary, it’s an average hotel. It’s a good deal for the money. You’ll pay 3 times as much to stay at the Hilton across the street. If you are looking for a place to rest and clean up, the Aqua Palms is perfect. If you want a “resort” experience, this is not it.",New York,118,3.0

We had a great experience and the hotel was definitely worth the cost.A few negatives: Elevators a extremely slow (not a big deal), Pool is a little on the small side (who cares when you have beautiful beaches within walking distance), and parking is super pricey.Positives:The rooms come with a mini fridge and a microwave, which was super convenient. Also, they come with a high speed internet jack which was very convenient for researching local restaurants and stuff to do.Hotel staff are extremely friendly and this definitely made a huge difference. They were always willing to answer any question we had, and this was helpful since it was our first time in Hawaii.The room was very clean. I had no issues with bugs or mold which I was partially expecting given the climate. Also, housekeeping was great. They were SO friendly and entirely willing to work around your schedule to get your room cleaned. The location is great. A short walk to the beach, many surrounding restaurants, and Ala Moana center. Also, a bus stop right outside. Free apples and lemon water in the lobby was a nice touch as well. Very welcoming. Overall, this a great hotel and I would definitely consider staying again.","Worcester, Massachusetts",1,4.0

They were always helpful with our touristy questions. Location is good, we were able to walk all over waikiki area including the ala moana shopping center, bus stops are all over and go everywhere. Although there are much nicer beaches, you can walk to the beach via the Hilton across the street in about 5 minutes. I was pleased that they had some coin laundry machines on the p3 level, and the mini fridge is very handy. Although the place is a bit outdated it was very clean and the bed was big and comfortable. All in all I think it was a great choice for a great price.Bad stuff: as of 3/23/11 there is alot of road construction going on right in front of the hotel on Ala Moana blvd, and it's being done in the middle of the night, literally, so it's REALLY loud. Even with the patio doors shut and earplugs in it was still loud, we were ok with it, but if you have a problem with noise you might want to ask for a room on the other side of the building.The pool is small, but honestly why go to the pool when there are so many amazing beaches nearby. A hot tub would've been really nice though. Also FYI they might recommend the IHop next door, but we got terrible service there and it was just as expensive as the breakfasty places down the street or over at the Hilton, so I don't recommend it.","Letterkenny, Ireland",9,4.0

My husband found Aqua Palms online and booked me a room for 2 nights. When I arrived, I was tired and stressed out from the horrible traffic and not knowing where I was going. The parking garage is right under the hotel, very convenient (with a bit of a steep hill to get in, but plenty of parking). I was greeted at the front desk by a very polite staff member who quickly checked me in and gave me my room keys. I had room 1102 on the 11th floor, my husband wanted me to have a nice view since I would be there alone, it did not disappoint! The room was really big (it was a king bed with a sleeper sofa). Plenty of room even if I had brought my husband and two sons with me! The view was amazing, the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. I was able to walk down to the ABC store, a 2 minute walk away to get a few snacks for the night and settled in.The next morning, I was greeted by a BEAUTIFUL view of Diamond Head. This was my first trip to Hawai'i so to me, it's all breathtaking. I could see the beach from my room, it was about a 10 minute walk (once I figured out where I was going). It was just lovely sitting out on my lanai having breakfast each morning. The only thing that was bad about it was someone was smoking on their lanai and it was coming up to my room, I had been told it was a non-smoking hotel, so I had to go inside and shut the door :(There is a decent sized fridge in the room (with a tiny freezer) that easily held a two liter bottle of coke, several bottles of water, some cans of coke and a few cold snacks. There was a microwave too and the ABC store just down the street (and across the street, they are everywhere) had plenty of microwaveable meals for sale, fresh fruits and veggies, etc. The prices were what you would expect for a convenience store in a tourist area.The hotel lobby is small but very clean and quiet, very polite and helpful staff members. The room was big, clean, bright and cheery. I travel a lot and this was one of the best places I've stayed for the price. The hotel rooms I've gotten in NYC (also a big city) were 1/2 the size and not as nice! I was actually amazed at how clean and mold/mildew/bug free this room was considering how humid and tropical the location. When we stay in SC hotels, even the newer ones have a gross smell of mold and usually mildew in the bathroom with tons of critters, I saw none of this here.I could see the pool directly below my 11th floor balcony, but did not use it as I could see there were people smoking. It was small but looked clean and had a lovely view of the Honolulu.Everything I wanted was in walking distance and I truly enjoyed the walk. There were tons of fast food places within a block for a quick meal, and just a 5 minute walk from the hotel, there is a WONDERFUL italian restaurant on Ena Rd. called Due Divino. They had eat it and take out, some of the best pizza I've ever had. Lots of gift shops near by and within walking distance to all of the expensive shops on Kalakaua Avenue. It was a quick drive to the Honolulu Zoo which had plenty of parking and easy access to Waikiki beach with great snorkeling.I also noticed a special $79 for a massage in the hotel spa and booked one right before check out. It was heavenly - certainly helped with the long flight home.When it was time to check out, they were quick, efficient, friendly and the H1 highway exit was right down the street, it was a quick 15 or less minute drive to the airport (at 7pm, before that WATCH OUT, traffic is AWFUL on Oahu during rush hour).The only negatives:I never had my room cleaned the entire time I was there, I don't know why that was (no-one ever came to make the bed, change the towels, etc) , that was a little odd since everything else was so clean and I saw the cleaner several times on my floor doing other rooms. This was the only disappointing thing because coming back to a clean room after swimming, sightseeing, etc. is one of the highlights of staying in a hotel for me!Also, there was a burn in the carpet smack in the middle of the room, it was about the size of a tea cup. Finally, on Tuesday evening (March 8th) I called down to the front desk to see if there was a way I could print my boarding passes for my flight the next day. A man answered the phone and he was very rude, very curt and basically yelled ""You must pay for it! It is not free!"" All I wanted to know was if there was a printer down there! A bit later I went down to the lobby and a lovely woman named Venus said she would be happy to print them for me, looked them up on her computer and printed them within 2 minutes, no charge and asked if I needed anything else :)We are planning a FAMILY trip back to Hawai'i next spring and we will definitely be considering staying at Aqua Palms if we can get the price and room we need, it is a great hotel!","Worthington, Ohio",60,5.0

As it was after midnight, and we were exhausted, that was all we could do. When we went to our original room, neither of our keys was working. My friend then went downstairs to get they keys changed, and while I was waiting, a hotel employee came upstairs to tell us a room with two beds had been located. I was a little annoyed that just a few minutes before there was nothing available. We went back down and got keys for our new room. This was basically the only negative experience we had. With the negative conversation, the person at the front desk forgot to tell us that hotel guests get 20% off at the ihop with a room key.Our view was the back if the hotel, but that wasn't a problem since we planned to be out most of the time-and with a flight AND eleven nights in a hotel for $700, I was not expecting the best view in the hotel.The microwave and fridge in the room was great, and it allowed us to have some snacks or breakfast in our room. With the ABC store right around the corner and another across the street, our fridge was always stocked.The location of the hotel is great. You can to Ala Moana and to the busier areas of Waikiki, but you are not in the middle of the noise. I loved the fact that I could sleep at night.There is a trolley stop right outside the hotel, and one for the other direction right across the street outside the Hilton.While the pool is small, it does get some great sunshine. I wish I reminded those smoking out there of the no smoking rule, it did get annoying.The gym is small, but it is adequate. There is a water cooler there, and sometimes we would fill our water bottles there on the way out.We booked an excursion from the expedia desk downstaira, but when I asked about a trolley to the zoo, I was told it would be about $30. When I pulled out the trolley map to clarify, and said that I thought it would be just $2, the person confirmed that was correct. That made me feel that the desk was just there to sell excursions, rather than act as a concierge (which is probably true, but I never noticed anyone at the guest services desk).We were there for 2 of the Wednesday manager's receptions, and those were fun. Be sure to sign up for the complimentary messages early-they get booked up.There is a cheap breakfast available on weekdays at a pub down the street, and to the right of the hotel....I forget the name of the place, but I believe it is right downstairs of the Buffalo Hot Wings.I know my review is all over the map, but I wanted to be sure I captured every detail.There is free wifi in the lobby, which is very convenient.I would totally stay at the Aqua Palms hotel for the location, and the value.",BC - Canada,11,4.0

He didn't complain though. I wanted to ask for a board to place beneath the mattress. ~The housekeepers are lovely though the policy is to change the sheets every 4th night - unless asked for a fresh bottom one, then they kindly oblige.~3rd night in I saw a small roach, a few tiny ants, and a tiny silverfish. The next day pest control visited. I understood that, being in a city in the tropics, buggy things happen, and they were addressed immediately. However my main gripe was ~~the sudden LOSS OF HOT WATER and the way it was handled at first. In a hotel, hot water should NEVER be a concern. ~~~~When I complained a second time about the hot water, we were upgraded to the 8th floor the next day. This room was much more comfortable, with better mattress, nicer microwave, and a better view. The view wasn't a concern for me, I was there to spend time with my partner. But the increased quality felt more appropriate for what I paid. The workout room was small and bare basics, the pool was small but adequate.- mold on wall in 2nd floor bathroom, was addressed immediately when I brought attention to that issue-low water pressure in the upgraded room, but adequate.- tubs and bathroom floor need refinishing. The finish on both are notably chipped. The chipped finish of the floor flakes off on bare feet, so put a bathmat down before walking on it~~~HUGE thumbs down for all the smokers at the pool, when I specified that I wanted to stay at a 100% smokeFREE hotel.As former smokers, we did not enjoy inhaling that scungy smell when swimming. ~~~- Parking was ridiculously expensive at $20/ day, and the garage was a little sketchy, but ok. I kind of expected that in a big city.POSITIVES:~Be sure to ask for a higher floor for better quality amenities.~Be sure to inform the front desk about the smokers at the pool. I didn't and it compromised my ability to enjoy swimming there. This is advertised as a SMOKEFREE hotel. Also, employees shouldn't be smoking next to the front door. Employees should check the pool area frequently to be sure people aren't smoking. ~The mattress in the upgraded room was very comfortable.~The housekeepers are wonderful, smiley, lovely people who seem happy to address requests for extra linens and will work around your schedule for cleaning. Truly high quality ( housekeeping) staff that I would expect in a 4 or 5 star hotel.~Free apples and iced lemon water in the lobby was a nice touch~ Great location for walking to Ala Moana Shopping, beach, and touristy stuff. easy to get out and drive to the ""real"" parts of the island~ Front desk staff, once they figured out how to address our concerns, were great. Divina in particular was lovely, professional and extremely helpful.~ Places to eat and get snacks are just a few steps away. It's a great location out of the deep touristy parts of waikiki. ~Massage and skincare available in the spa~ Lobby kept spotless and clean public restroomsI might recommend this hotel to others. I would stay again but not below the 8th floor.Despite all these issues, this was the best vacation I ever had, and the minor setbacks were very minor compared to the amazing time I had with my partner in Hawaii.","Portsmouth, New Hampshire",39,3.0

It was not the most quiet room, but overall we slept allright - just being woken up intermittently. Also, the breakfast was not very good. You basically get a coupon for a choice of 2 eggs or 1 oatmeal. It was pretty bad and not worth upgrading the room for it. Next time we know! :-)2nd Stay (post cruise): Booked and pre-paid a City View room. Check in was again fast and painless. Received a nice room on the 9th floor. Much, much smaller than the Deluxe Rooms, but clean and overall all right. We actually loved it much better than our first room, because - guess what? - it is so quiet!!! All you see out your window is a giant parking lot and a dead-end street. It was much more peaceful.The staff was very friendly, the parking on site (covered and secure) was nice - though $20 a night is a bit much, but typical for Hawaii. We felt safe and could easily walk to restaurants, the beach, etc.We paid less than $75.00 a night for our rooms and compared to some other places in Waikiki - that was a bargain. We would stay there again.","Simi Valley, California",34,4.0

The entryway was large but good for storing luggage.In the lobby of the aforementioned hotel was an IHop, travel services, and a helpful front. I didn't ask for much, but when I asked for a taxi at a certain time, they made sure it was there at that minute. The pool was on the roof but I didn't use it, and the street side of the hotel gave partial views of Diamond Head, the mountains, and the ocean (if you were high enough). It was on Ala Moana Boulevard right across from the Hilton complex, so there was a lot of pedestrian and car traffic out front which might be noisy if you have a street-side room. A 7-11 was 3 blocks away and several other restaurants in the immediate vincinity. The ice machine on the 3rd floor was missing (the spot where it was was still there) and I had to use the one I found by the coin laundry on the top parking level.For $74 per night it was a bargain, and since I didn't really care about the pool, I didn't check out any beach towels that were offered.",Chicago,116,4.0

Within a 5 minute walk from the main beach. The front staff are very cordial. Almost always a quick check-in with our keys ready to go. The hotel is clean, but aged. With narrow, dark hallways. The elevators are fairly quick, except during ""rush hours"". The exercise room is very small with only a couple pieces of older equipment. On my last stay, the elliptical was making a clanking noise. They do provide a rack of barbells, which I particularly like. The small, exercise room faces out over the pool area. The pool is very small, but clean. The sun is blocked by higher buildings a good part of the day. Also, the pool patio area is too small in size and not enough seating. My last time here, I went out around 1pm and the only place to sit was in the pool. They do provide a bar-b-que grill to cook meals, but you have to wait for a mx person to come and fire it up for you.The rooms are clean, but VERY SMALL. The bathrooms are EVEN SMALLER. The showers do not have lighting, so most showers are taken with very little light. You have to move the door in order to move around in the bathroom. They provide portable closets, but they are sometimes not secured to the wall and can fall forward presenting a possible hazard.The beds are very comfortable and clean. Sheets are changed every day by very friendly staff. They do provide a package of coffee with an in room coffee maker. Also, your room comes with a nice microwave and small refrigerator. The ethernet internet connection is always fast and available. Wifi runs in the lobby. The patio off the room is very small and rarely used. The patio doors have a switch on them that when opened (a magnetic connection), turns off the air conditioning. The a/c is pretty noisy, which I found hard to hear the TV when it was running on high. Since the rooms are so small, it takes no time to cool the area.Another big negative is the lack of a BUSINESS CENTER. They do have a desk in the front lobby where you are charged to access a computer. A dedicated room with a room key access is badly needed here.A VERY BIG PLUS are the plasma TV sets. They offer free Cable with all the great channels. Also, they are HDMI compatible, so you can connect any HDMI unit so you can run your laptop, gaming or movie device over the plasma TV.On both occasions in which I had a mx issue (coffee maker broken, bathroom door locked), the staff was at my door within 5 minutes to fix the problem.The desk are low budget type with very sharp edges. If using a laptop with a mouse, when resting your arm it will become irritated by the sharp glass edge.One of the biggest and most concerning issues I had with this hotel was that some rooms are sloping. I wasn't sure until I took a water bottle, placed it on the floor by the patio, and watched as it rolled from the patio door in to the middle of the room. Also, sitting at my desk, my pen would roll along the desk. Very disconcerting. I have stayed at this hotel several times and have only received a ""slanting"" room twice.Fire escapes are well marked and clean.There is an IHOP located within the same building.Laundry machines with dryers (coin operated) are located on the 2nd floor open air parking garage.If you are looking for a basic hotel with a great location, I would recommend the Aqua Palms & Spa.","Jefferson City, Missouri",36,3.0

Lovely lobby, smaller hotel, and easy check in. Room was very clean, furntiture a little dated, but clean, great bed, and a balcony with a view of Waikiki and Diamond Head. Ver pleased.

All very safe walking at night. Hotel was very helpful with all our questions, always had coffee and fresh lemon water in the lobby and we were so comfortable there.

My only complaint was that we booked our room over 6 months in advance and had requested a room with two beds rather than the king and sleeper sofa (which their site states is an option), but we ended up with a king/sleeper room just the same.

This place was worthy of receiving my money.I found the Aqua Palms online and like all online hotel photos, was skeptical about the price. Having a friend in the Waikiki area helped as he did a pre-inspection before I booked. His only negative comment was ""it's small.""First the positives; The room and hotel was clean. I'm a freak about clean, and this hotel was acceptable. Sheets, towels, carpet, walls, windows, tile and appliances were all clean. I even checked under the bed. The air conditioner worked well, had correct temp displayed. It shuts off when the balcony door is opened (as it is a waste to stay on, makes sense).Coffee maker, fridge (a tad larger than the normaly small one), microwave, hair dryer, iron and board......all worked well.Bed. I was prepared to bite the bullet on this one due to the booking price. However, the bed was most comfortable and my roomate had the same compliments for his bed.Service was friendly and helpful. If you know anything about Hawaii, you've heard the expression, ""Hawaiian Time"", which means ""you get it when you get it"", but really is an excuse for lazy service. I was expecting this attitude when I arrived, but to my surprise it was non-existent at this hotel. When asked for directions, they went out of their way to write them out. When asked for a taxi, they booked it and made an effort to calculate the estimated cost. They even had a ""meet and greet"" with music, snacks and their own free (alcoholic) drink called ""The Sway"". The day of my departure, I left a bluetooth device behind that they found and offered to ship.Location is at the edge of the Waikiki strip, across the street from the Hilton. There are a few familiar places to eat within walking distance including Buffalo Wild Wings, Outback and Red Lobster. Do not go to the IHOP as service is non-existant (Hawaiian Time at its worst). I always say eat where the locals eat, and the locals seemed to hang out at the corner Wailana Coffee House. An old, worn out Denny's style diner with good service, good food and reasonable prices. 10% off with room key.Now the negatives;Small room. I knew this booking, so no surprise here. More than 2 or 3 people in the room and you'll feel cramped.Small parking places. Parking is $20 a day (believe it or not, that's the norm in the area). Don't try parking anything larger than a Corolla here. My friend owns a Nissan Titan and we all literally climbed out one door more than one time.Small pool and workout room. Again, this was known prior to the trip, so no shocker.Slow elevators. Or at leat they seemed slow after a night of drinking.I hope this helps. If ever in the same travel situation, I will boook the Aqua Palms again. I'd rather pay half price for a hotel and spend my money on outside events. If you plan on spending your entire day in a room, or want movie like views of the ocean, you should be looking elsewhere anyway.","Riverside, California, USA",3,4.0

We called the hotel and they told us it would not be a problem and would have our room ready for us upon our arrival. When we arrived the front desk staff was very warm and welcoming. We had booked our room on a third party website and the only option was a room with a king size bed. When the staff realized we only had the king, they immediately offered to put us into a room with 2 double beds, which was greatly appreciated. The evening they were sold out of the double rooms so they advised us to have our bags packed and they would have everything moved for us the next day while we were out, and they did. The staff is always pleasant and very helpful.The room was perfect. Where most people stay for an extended time period, this hotel is great. The rooms come with a microwave and fridge, which comes in handy. The beds are really comfortable and they have balconys attached with nice views. I found the rooms to be very clean, and the washrooms are an average size.The hotel was in the perfect location. I read reviews with people complaining of the noise levels because the hotel is located on Ala Moana Blvd.. I dont know what was wrong with those people, we were not distrubed once. The hotel is approx. a ten minute walk from central Waikiki, just far enough away your not continuously swamped by the tourists, but close enough to get there in minutes. Another great part of staying at this hotel is, its about a 10 minute walk from the Ala Moana Mall, which is huge and has everything you can imagine. Its a quick walk to Waikiki Beach if you want more of a busy beach, but another great thing is, its about 5 minutes from Ala Moana Beach which has less people and just as beautiful. We prefered going there. The hotel is attached to an Ihop which is convinent for a quick affordable breakfast right before you head out for the day.The one negative I had with this hotel was my experience at the spa. We had booked two massages and requested males. When we got there, there was one man and one women. I ended up with the women and it was by far the worst massage I have ever recieved in my life. She didn't massage for the full 50Min booked and did most of the massage over top of the blanket. There was no flow to it and 99.9% of the massage was spent with her elbow plowing into me, and being scraped by her nails. After the massage I immediately went down and spoke to the Guest Service Manager, and he was great. I was compensated for the massage and he assured we would be taken care of the remainder of the trip, which was really appreciated.

They ended up giving the crib for free, but having to argue about it after arriving on our vacation was not good. The day staff seemed better.The rooms are not as nice as what is shown on the Aqua Palms website.

The hotel is outdated (both interior and exterior), the so called pool is a joke (and super small), the decor is cheesy Hawaiian/Red Roof type, but the room was clean and functional.

Nice LCD TV mounted on Wall. General layout is quite comfortable. One thing we noticed was the sound proofing of the walls didn't seem to be effective, as the next door guests talking on balcony was quite loud, and when they dragged chair to sit/stand up, the sound seemed quite loud. Although that might be because of the glass wall to the balcony.The hotel is located across Ala Moana Blvd from Hilton Village, on the west end of Waikiki, walking time from hotel to international market space takes about 12-15 minutes. Although there is an IHOP next to the lobby and a few restaurant nearby, also convenience stores.

The room was also awkwardly furnished--no night stands by the bed which meant the lamps were across the room. ??? The tub was clogged, bathroom left less than clean, safe didn't lock, furniture was heavily scratched, and there were (dirt?) spots on the walls. It was not good. I travel quite frequently and this was one of the shabbiest rooms I have stayed in. I will say, however, that maintenance and housekeeping promptly came up to fix the safe, as well as deodorize the room so I give them kudos for that.

The location of the hotel is literally across from Hilton Hawaiian Village - tourist central for those who have never been to Honolulu. It is true that it's very convenient and centrally-located, but if you are looking for a quiet base to return to, you may be disappointed. Also, given the proximity to the beach, you could in theory walk from the hotel to Waikiki beach, although I never did (since I rented a car). Having visited Waikiki beach, I would definitely avoid that area like the plague unless you love super-touristy areas with boisterous tourists and crazy traffic.The room is nice - large LCD TV on the wall and a nice couch. However, given the amount of traffic and ocean waves bouncing off the different tall buildings nearby, it does not make for a quiet environment to sleep in (especially when your body is at least 3+ hours AHEAD of local time!). If you rented a car, you will definitely appreciate the gated card-in parking privilege, amid the fact that it's $20 a night. (Wired) Internet in the room is free in the room, which is almost as essential as the toilet these days. For some reason, there is a very very strong smell in the reception area that even though it doesn't make me feel nauseated, it doesn't encourage me to hang around that area for an extra second. The pool - I wouldn't recommend going by the picture on their site. It's Hawaii, and swimming in a pool is the last thing that you'd want to do. Net net, I would recommend staying here if you like being close to everything.

Apparently I haven’t request the one with balcony, so please bear in mind, to email them in advance.

Hotel have a really good car parking, all you have to do is go to reception and tell them you have car, they will code your room key and you will use it and enter key to car parking. Really positive side was that there is IHOP adjacent to reception, so you can straightaway grab nice breakfast.

And it was so close to Ala Moana Shopping centre!!! I think it was the best shopping centre I saw in my life, there wasn’t a brand we couldn’t find there. The only downfall was the noise, I’m not light sleeper but lads on their Harleys absolutely love the street, cause they can listen to their exhausts and engines. Noise was really loud!!!

I was going to stay at the Courtyard Waikiki for $125 a night until I decided to see if there was a cheaper hotel that wasn't a flop house. I saw Aqua's reviews on Tripadvisor and obtained a $80 AAA rate so staying here for 4 nites was $200 cheaper than the Courtyard. Very happy I did so as you receive maximum value for the price.I did not experience any of the negatives reported: no bugs, no cleanliness issues, no long elevator waits. Also, the parking garage is not as small and dangerous as some say. It is a typical garage for this size hotel and roomier than the much more expensive Marriott Waikiki.The positives: clean room, decent decor, clean carpet, very comfortable and clean bed, large flat screen TV and quiet due to concrete walls separating my room. Never heard the people next door for 4 nites. Free wired internet service was fine.If I looked for negatives, the area by the toilet and shower is very dark as the only light is over the sink. Also , there is a single sink and the shower curtain bar was old and discolored. Are these reasons to pay $50-$100 a nite more elsewhere? No way. Stay here and save your money.","Northbrook, Illinois",95,4.0

The hotel is located in a fairly busy part of the city, but we couldn't hear anything from the street level at all with the windows closed. The walls had excellent sound insulation; other than the sound of adjacent doors closing, there was nothing else to disturb our sleep. The linens were clean, the furniture was like new, and the toiletries provided were good. The wired high-speed Internet was easy to set up, and the in-room safe with digital keypad was big enough to easily fit a 14"" laptop. One issue we had was with a leaky shower curtain; no matter what we did, we couldn't completely cover up one corner of the shower, so we constantly had a wet bathroom floor. Beach towels were available on request at the front desk.The location is convenient, as many restaurants and shops were within ten-minutes' walk. The IHOP right next to the hotel made it easy to grab a quick breakfast. The Hilton on the other side of the street had a Hertz service desk with cars available in the hotel parkade. A short walk through the Hilton brought us to a nice beach.At about $65 a night, this hotel was a great deal.

The tripadvisor reviews were generally positive and at $100 a day (once you add parking fees) it seemed reasonable.First: It is in a very noisy (traffic, stereos, sirens, etc) and congested part of town but not on the beach. It is within easy walking distance of decent restaurants, shopping, and even a grocery/liquor store.I got an 11th floor room (top floor) and it must have been the same room as another reviewer as it had an external glass door that had a one inch gap that let in wind and lots of street noise. There would be no way to sleep with that noise. I called down about it and they said they would send maintenance. After an hour, nothing. I went to the front desk and asked if they had a room with a working door. They said they were completely booked even though the neon sign out front said vacancy. They said I could check out the next day at 11 and check back in at 3 to get a room with a working door. That would interfere with my plans so I said no and resigned myself to a couple of days without sleep.After going to eat and returning the maintenance person had come by and fixed the door. Yeah! It's still very noisy, but tolerable.The next problem. They have 3 elevators. There seems to be a problem with them being very slow. It ranges from a 5 minute wait and irritation to a queue of 30-40 people spilling into the lobby waiting for an elevator and a 30 minute wait. You can try to use the stairs, but there are 4 levels of garage so floor 11 means 15 stories of stairs. This was a problem after one particularly long wait the key card failed to work. Back down and then another wait to get an elevator.The rooms are very small, about half of what you would see at a Best Western or Holiday Inn. They are well equipped, with ethernet internet, AC, microwave, and small refrigerator. They are not modern or luxurious, but they are moderately comfortable. As described above, they are on the noisy side due to the location and age of the building.I have mixed feelings about this place. There are many flaws, but in my case it worked out in a minimal way for not too high of price. Given enough time they eventually made things as right as possible given the older infrastructure they have to work with.I would recommend this for someone on a budget and without high expectations.","Olalla, Washington",76,3.0

I read a review of the Aqua Palms which mentioned that it was across the street from the Hilton and you can purchase day use passes for the pool. So I decided to stay at the Aqua Palms and save the money for activities while on the island. I am so happy that we stayed there! The Aqua Palms hotel was a perfect fit for our family vacation. The room was clean and nicely decorated. We had a queen size bed, a desk w/ a chair, a small table w/ 2 chairs, microwave, compact fridge, coffee maker w/ free coffee daily, a closet, a 3-drawer dresser, and a pull out couch in the room. With all of that in the room, we were still able to store 2 large suitcases, 2 carry-on suitcases, a laptop, and our snorkel gear. With the couch pulled out, it was a bit crowded, but we just opened it at night and closed it during the day. Our son slept on the pull out, so I can not speak to how comfortable it was. Our bed was comfortable, though. The bathroom was a bit on the small side but was modern and clean. The lanai was nice too, although the view was of the surrounding buildings/hotels. The room had free internet hookup (no wifi), which was nice since we brought our laptop. Overall, the room was comfortable and met our needs for the week that we were there.The hotel is located across the street from the Hilton at the Ala Moana end of Waikiki. It is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel to the beach at the Hilton, which is mostly walking through the vast property of the Hilton. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to Lewers St. and the International Marketplace in Waikiki. The location was good for us because we didn't have to drive through Waikiki to get to and from the other parts of the island. We didn't use the spa facilities, so I can not speak to those. We did go to the pool while we waited to check into our room; it was tiny but there were plenty of lounge chairs. The hotel also provided beach towels to use during our stay, which we traded in for clean ones every day. Overall, I think the hotel was a great value for our family vacation.

The location was great for him - just about an easy 10-15 minute walk. It is located on the outskirts of Waikiki, so it's a decent hike to the heart of the area, but nice beaches are all along the way. Fort Derussy beach became my favorite. It is just on the other side of the Hilton mega-complex (about a 10 minute walk). There were plenty of great food options around the hotel (and a nearby grocery store) so there was no need to make the haul into central Waikiki for that reason. Neither of us are shoppers, but the location would be really appealing to those who plan to spend time shopping - the huge shopping mall is just a short walk over the canal (also about 10-15 minutes.)The front desk staff was very nice and helpful, though on a couple instances when we found that one person was doing everything, so we had to wait for her to become available while a man was paid to stand in the lobby and direct people coming in. That was a little frustrating from time to time. Also, we were disappointed by the partial ocean view room. A marina could be viewed if you leaned over the balcony and looked between a sliver in two buildings. (See picture.) The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the flat screen tv impressive. The decor was a little worn and scratched up from luggage, presumably. Housecleaning was superb. They came everyday and somehow made the rooms spotless - every spec of beach sand gone! The free internet has be be accessed through an Ethernet cable. Since I use a netbook, I had to access wi-fi in the lobby which was also a bit of a pain.I was a little sad to see that the 'rooftop' pool was on the 2nd floor and quite small, not really for swimming. The fitness center was also tiny (just a couple of machines,) smelled awful, and had poor air circulation.","Albuquerque, New Mexico",127,4.0

I read the reviews from trip advisor before I booked this trip and was pleased with this hotel. The rooms are clean, equipped with a small refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker (mr. coffee style) It had free internet (hardwired, not wireless in the rooms) and coffee service in the lobby 24hrs a day. The beds were comfortable, and each room has a good airconditioner system. It had a small lanai that looked out to Ala Moana Ave and the Hilton Hawaiian Village. There was a pool, a little small in size located on the 2nd floor, but it was clean and had a nice patio area with lounge chairs, also a spa located adjacent to it. The work out gym was also located adjacent to the pool. The hotel grounds are kept clean, and it has a parking garage that is monitored by video cameras. There is a free shuttle service that stops right out in front of the hotel and will take you down to the main part of Waikiki, ie , international market place and trendy shop area, waikiki beach. There is an excellant coffee shop diner located below the hotel called the Wailana Coffee House. We ate breakfast and dinner here and were satisfied with the serving portions and selection of food offered. If you show your room key, they will give you a 10% discount. There is also an IHOP located next door to the hotel, but I personally did not eat there since it did not have good tripadvisor reviews.The hotel was so kind in keeping our luggage until 7pm as we had a late flight out (9pm) and the airport will only allow you to check your bags 3 hrs in advance.The only thing I didnt like with this hotel is its cramped parking garage. It takes a good driver to position your car into the small spot without hitting one of the cement posts or another vehicle next to it. Also, the charge of 20. a day to park the car is a little steep in my opinion, but the convenience was worth it. There is no street parking around so keep that in mind when renting the car.

This was NOT it!!!! I thought I had made a good choice - but this room is right above the Children's pool - we woke up to kids screaming at 8am almost every day. I know this is beyond control of the unit's owner - but....wow. Once we got there and heard the noise I felt like I should have just stayed at another hotel closer to the beach - don't know how much louder it could have been there than where we were.Also - getting to the Aqua Palms is very difficult - you have to actually park in the parking garage to check in - which is very confusing if you've never been there. Especially because there's a gate that you need a key for - you need to call the lobby or follow the directions for Ihop (yes, Ihop also parks in this garage) I read other reviews that said Eugenia's had it's own parking space but I had to pay $20 a day for parking. The front desk does not know ANYTHING about your unit so be prepared with info before you get there.The unit feels kind of old and smelled musty when we got in (probably because the A/C had been off).It's a little bit of a walk to get to the main stuff on Waikiki but isn't too far if you want to hit water (just walk around the Hilton).

We felt the hotel room was clean and adequate. We were able to control the temperature of the room quite easily, and the bathroom was again adequate. The location is very close to the Hilton and within a 5-10 minute walk to Waikiki Beach. We didn't use any room service while we were there, but did go to the swimming pool once -- which was pretty small, but well kept. We did take advantage of the couple's massage, which was quite nice. The concierge service was nice and helpful. We did enjoy the free (ethernet cable) internet in our room, something we came to appreciate when we stayed at another hotel that was $13 per day. We liked having the ability to map out and research stuff on the internet on a day-to-day basis. Like I'm sure many hotels around Waikiki, the $20 per day for parking was an unwelcome surprise, but I would guess this is a pretty uniform rate. If you're planning not to travel around the rest of Oahu, pretty much everything in Waikiki is within a healthy walking distance -- even the Ala Moana Mall. So you may not even need to rent a car -- we did end up driving a little bit, but in hindsight, could have gotten by without a car (we're in our 30s and can walk pretty healthy distances into Waikiki). I would say the biggest criticism I have with Aqua Palms is the elevators. There are 3 elevators competing for 10 floors of rooms, and we (and other guests) were often waiting a LONG time for elevators. They might have had some trouble with one of them while we were there. In summary, I think we got good value for our purchase. If you're looking to be blown away by the rooms, facilities and services, you'll need to pay more elsewhere, but if you want a solid, affordable and reliable place to put your stuff while you go explore Oahu, I think Aqua Palms is a good choice.","Salt Lake City, Utah",9,4.0

Getting to the Aqua Palms was easy from the airport via shuttle. We were tired even tho it was only 6:30 HST. Upon arriving at the AP&S we were checked in in a fairly efficient manner. However, when we got to our room it was hardly the size of a broom closet. We had 2 large suitcases and 2 carry-ons. They wouldn't fit in the room. There was also not a safe in the room as had been advertised. While my husband went down to the desk to inquire about this, I retrieved our reservation confirmation. We had reserved a room with 2 queen beds or a king and a sofa bed. We were given a room with a double bed, barely fitting into the room and no sofa. Upon speaking with the desk clerk, we were informed that there were none of those rooms available. We were told that one might become available the next day. However, since we were only staying 2 nights (before leaving on a cruise), this was unacceptable to have to move rooms. I became fairly adamant about the reservation and magically the room we reserved was found. It was a really spacious room with a king bed and sofa, desk, wall-mounted flat screen tv, high speed internet, and safe. The bathroom was adequate, There was a microwave and minifridge also in the room. The room was dated and could have used some renovation. It was relatively clean, just some dust around the baseboard edges and a couple of carpet stains. The air conditioning was overworked in that it kept cycling on after only a couple of seconds off. Not sure what was happening there.We didn't use the pool, but it looked nice. Amused that the coffee in the lobby was machine generated and not free. There was lemon ice water that was free, however. The hotel has an IHOP adjacent to it for breakfast as well as a large coffee shop not quite a block away. Located across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village, it was convenient to get transportation for tours.Overall, the hotel is a good value. The price was right and location convenient.

I sell mattresses for a living, so I always notice the bed quality immediately when we travel. After all, you want to be able to SLEEP well when you're on vacation! I have to say that they outfit their rooms with excellent quality beds! Comfort is relative (we were VERY comfortable), but the quality of the mattress cannot be debated. Of course we didn't stay very long, so we didn't check out all the amenities, but the location was great... a block off of Waikiki Beach, plenty of nearby dining & shopping, etc. The IHOP downstairs is grossly overpriced, so we recommend a small restaurant around the corner on Ena Rd. called ""Due Divino"".

A friend of ours was getting married in HI. To be fair, the pros are: 1. Location - very convenient. if you take the shuttle from airport, you will get here must faster than other hotels, which is awesome if you fly in from the east coast, it's also walking distance from the mega mall Ala Moana Shopping center which has a Walmart right next to Nordstrom; 2. parking - cheaper than most Waikiki hotels. But you have to ask for the special for $10 when making reservation; 3. super friendly & knowledgeable staff - I found the male staff are more helpful than the female ones... the girl with glasses & dark hair was quite snappy. 4. The free high speed internet is fast & awesome. 5. The pillow top bed is surprisingly comfortable. It reminds me the Westin Heavenly bed, OK, maybe that's too far a stretch, at least Sheraton beds. BUT, here comes the killer: 1. Cockroaches!!! In your face!!! I know they have IHOP right downstairs, & having lived in NYC, I'm pretty used to seeing these little suckers in any condo or coops, cause whenever you have restaurants downstairs, you will have cockroaches running up the pipes. But for a hotel - any hotel has restaurants, I've never seen these in a Westin or Sheraton or a Hilton or Marriott?!! Anyway, that was a big disappointment; 2. the SMELL!! URGH!!! Every time we came back to the room, it was like walking into a garbage dump. We had to blast the A/C to get the smell out. URGH!!! 3. The room condition - don't get fooled by the website picture. It's called Photoshop. Big time. Mega amplifying the brightness. Most room decor is the cheesy blue aqua palm tree looking style. The furniture are all very old & worn out looking. I know cause I went to quite a few rooms. The closet hangers are covered with rust & dust. I had to put tissue over them to hang my dresses... Just not very clean feeling. The carpet feels grimy & dirty. They still use glasses - Do not use those cause Dateline had a report showing how maids in Sheraton cleaning them using household chemicals, or worse yet, spit... cause they were too lazy to send them to dishwasher... 4. Noise level - if you get any even # rooms, they are so called ""ocean facing rooms"" which means you are ""boulevard facing"" too, so be prepared for early morning buses noises. It didn't bother us too much cause we were jet lagged the entire stay & ran out early in the morning for sunrises... 5. FIRE alarm - in the middle of the night... it was a false alarm but Waikiki FD must be the slowest FD in the nation cause it took them FIFTEEN minutes to get to the scene after all of us exited the building. I know Hawaiians are very relaxed in general, perhaps a little bit too relaxed? Had it been a real fire, people would've been roasted already... Anyway, the bottom line is you get what you pay for. For the price, had it been no cockroaches nor stench, I would've been OK with it. If you can tolerate those, you can't beat the Aqua Palm's price in Waikiki.","New York City, New York",32,2.0

I got a great deal on Hotwire. I had never heard of the Aqua chain before. But because there is such a great deal for lodging in Honolulu near Waikiki the large mainline chains (Starwood, IC, Hilton and Marriott) not only do not have the capacity to meet the demand, but smaller chains such as Aqua take together have more capacity in Waikiki. So get used to the fact you may have to book something other than your favorite chain when you reach the island.That said, my fears about going to an “unknown” –at least unknown to me- chain were quickly allayed. Reception at the front desk was exceptional. Anais did a great job making me feel welcomed.It’s almost possible to miss the entrance to the hotel. There’s no grand marquee – just the address on the front of the building. And like many of the tall structures in Honolulu, the first few floors of the hotel’s building are dedicated to parking. So it’s easy to get confused if you are expecting a “normal” mainland façade.OK. On to the rooms. Small by mainland standards, but probably acceptable to the majority of the visitors to Hawai’i from Asia, and Asian tourists equal if not exceed the number of visitors to Hawai’i from the mainland. Besides, if you’re coming to Hawai’i to stay in your room, you may have the wrong destination.The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and comfortable. There is a pool located just above the parking level along with a guest reception room and exercise room. I highly recommend the view from the pool! And incredible view of some Waikiki beach and some of the other major properties in the Waikiki beach area. The view from the pool was much better than the view from my room which faced the hills of Oahu.Parking was reasonable. You have to get used to the initial steep climb to get to the parking level, and yes, the lanes and parking spaces are tight. But my advice is to dump the car at the hotel and then walk where you want go. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is literally across the street with direct access to Waikiki beach. Certainly the affordability of the Aqua through Hotwire merited the one block walk to the beach versus the potential cost of a market rate stay at the Hawaiian Village.In summary, rooms are small but very comfortable and clean. Think small like Europe but clean like Hong Kong and Tokyo. Park the car and walk. Everything is close. If you’re mainland chains are booked and/or too expensive and you affordably end up with the Aqua Palms through Hotwire have no fear. The stay will be great if not only for the killer view from the pool!","Washington, DC",73,4.0

I was PLEASANTLY surprised. My room was CLEAN, quiet, and well-equipped. There was a hair dryer and iron; both worked great. Coffee maker, which I didn't use. Small fridge, which worked fine. I had no problem at all with the room's internet connection (not wifi, but a cable connector that worked perfectly). The TV was huge with lots of choices. I had a partial city view on a low floor, which was fine for the one night I was there.I thought the hotel should have had more front staff working the lobby, but each of the staff members I came in contact with was nothing short of professional, helpful, and super friendly.The room was quiet; I didn't hear anyone in other rooms in or in the halls.I did not experience the slow elevators that other people did.I found the hotel convenient. Not far from Waikiki, Diamond Head, or getting onto major highways or other roads to attractions. Traffic is pretty much always a hassle in Honolulu, but being in the middle of the action was helpful to me.PARKING: Yes, it's expensive. For me, though, it was worth it so I didn't have to drive around for 30 minutes trying to find somewhere to park. Heads-up: Parking in Honolulu, especially in the Waikiki/Ala Moana area, is just always going to be difficult. The parking garage is just behind the hotel and attached through the elevators. I found that convenient and safe, which I liked.HASSLES: Parking the car while checking in. You have to pull up ON the curb in front of the hotel while checking in. Everyone was doing this, but it does create a traffic jam at times. Just relax and go with it. FINDING THE HOTEL: If you're coming from the airport, you'll most likely arrive on Nimitz/Ala Moana from the south, which makes seeing the hotel nearly impossible (there's a high planter divider between the two lanes of the road).

But at rack rate, I'd have expected more than the Aqua Palms gave. Got a smallish 4th floor room overlooking the parking lot, which was being repaved (so until 5 p.m., there was lots of noise & a faint smell of hot tar). I'm accustomed to dated furniture in mid-price Hawaiian hotels, but the bureau/dresser was truly a tag sale reject. Can't quarrel with the hotel for assigning least favorable rooms to the lowest-paying customers, though. (But again, if we'd paid their advertised rate and received this, I'd have complained.)  The Aqua Palms met our goal perfectly:.We were just looking for somewhere pleasant and affordable for a night's sleep between the long trip from the East Coast and an inter-island flight the next day. (The motels near HNL itself get bad reviews).  My opinion on Hawaii: The mood is laid-back, and you'll usually be disappointed if you demand polished brash and Ritz-Carlton efficiency. It's a tropical climate, so there may be a few flying bugs, etc. Carpeting, upholstery and bedspreads are often designed for endurance; humidity and beach sand can take a toll. Furniture is costly to ship in, so a lot of places keep things a few years longer than you'd expect on the mainland. The Aqua Palms fits that pattern: It's got a slightly weather-beaten feel.  But most of the Hawaii that visitors see is also bright, festive and clean, and the Aqua Palms is all of those. Yoy could have a very happy vacation here. I could see spending several days; if I did, it would be at off-season when the rack rates are quite affordable. In that case, I'd book directly through Aqua ... and expect a better room in return. I give it high marks for an immaculate lobby and generally fun, cheerful atmosphere. The pool is small but pleasant, and surrounded by a little sun deck with a decent view of the Hilton. Gym equipment is a bit dated, as is the elevator. Location: Great if you're using an airport shuttle (you'll probably be the first off on outbound shuttles, and the last aboard on trips to the airport. This is way better than what happens on the Diamond Head end of Waikiki, where Marriott and Hyatt guests may be the last ones dropped off on trips returning from the airport ... they'll also have to be the first aboard for the long shuttle trips that pick up at other hotels on the way back to the airport). Not great if you want to be central to Waikiki: It's a hefty walk away, or else a bus ride. Isolated but unpleasant: During our stay, a little girl vomited on the sundeck. Her mother threw a towel over it. The next day, someone - presumably maintenance or housekeeping - had removed the towel, but left the mess beneath. Definitely an isolated incident, and nothing else gave the sense that the hotel has anything less than high standards for sanitation.

Our stay was from Oct.17-25, 2009. This was a great value for the dollar. The rooms were small but we weren't there very often. King-size bed, bigger refrigerator than we expected, microwave, iron and board, hair drier, coffee maker and quiet rooms facing away from Ala Moana Blvd. We were told by people staying across the street at the plush Hilton Hawaiian Village that they did not have all those items. A/C and Internet worked great - I didn't try the wi-fi since an Ethernet cable was available. I saw a lot of people using wi-fi in the lobby, though. Plenty of hot water, although one day it seemed to run out, but was fine a few minutes later. NO PROBLEMS WITH THE ELEVATORS. Big flat-screen wall-mounted TV – nice. Gym was small - one universal, two treadmills and an elliptical, but it got the job done. Very small pool, but it was never crowded and the water was nice - spent most of the water time at the beaches anyway - walk through Hilton HV across the street to get there. You can check out beach towels at the front desk for the day – cool. Minor items – some of the electrical outlets are loose enough to pull away from the wall when removing your plug. They also aren’t too good with replenishing your coffee packets – just leave a note or call the desk and they’ll bring more. The Wailana Coffee House will save you a fortune at breakfast - the $5.75 all-you-can-eat pancakes is the best deal going - two eggs, two strips of bacon and three nice pancakes - more if you want them when finished with the first batch. Coconut syrup was great. It’s right next to the IHOP downstairs at about 60% of the price, and the food and service was better. Great spot if you're watching your budget. Many ABC stores (souvenirs, snacks, drinks) - seems like they are on every other block – they have 1.5 liter bottled water for 99 cents. If you can get out to the flea market at Aloha Stadium (Sat., Sun, and Wed until 3pm) you will save BIG money on souvenir aloha shirts, towels, t-shirts, costume jewelry etc. I saw a specific Hawaiian shirt for $10.00 that was going for $14.99 and up in town. There is a Wal-Mart, but you’ll have a good 20 minute walk to get there – it’s on Keeamoku St. The front desk can help with directions. If you want beach chairs and umbrellas, it’s cheaper to buy them and leave them behind than to rent at the exorbitant fees being charged. $50 will get you two decent chairs and a not-so-great umbrella, but again, gets the job done. Best tip I have - parking is expensive, but...if you have a rental car, come out of the hotel and go right on Ala Moana Blvd. Make a left at the Red Lobster (Hobron Ave.) and drive straight back about 2 blocks. There is a marina there - just follow the road around a couple more blocks to 25 CENT PER HOUR PARKING - NO KIDDING. There's a maximum of 24 hours at a time. Find a spot, note the spot number, go up to the machine, enter the information and put your money in. Put the printed ticket on your dash. You can't touch that deal in the Waikiki area. You can go into the heart of Waikiki for $2.00 by catching the Pink Trolley around the corner on Kalia St. at the HHV. Best price I could find on a rental car was about 47 bucks for economy size at Alamo – reserve and pay in advance online to get that price. If you make changes within 24 hours you’ll be charged a fee though. We booked this room last March at around $90-100 per day. You just can’t get all these features anywhere else in Waikiki for this kind of money. Seriously, yes, you get what you pay for, but if you want to go to Hawaii and you're on a tight budget, this is the place where you need to be. If I return to the Waikiki area, I would definitely go back to Aqua Palms – it has to be the best-kept secret on Oahu.",,6,4.0

I was in Honolulu for a conference, and this was one of the cheaper hotels near the convention center - about a 7 min walk (same distance to beach). I didn't find the location to be that great but not terrible either.The main problem though was the uneven service of the staff. Upon checking in, they did not have the room we requested (this happened to a number of people in our group). Instead of a 2 double beds we were given a king with a couch. If they ran out of those rooms when we made the reservation, they never should have taken our booking, Since I complained, I got free breakfast coupons. However, a coworker (a small Asian woman) did not get the same respect, and when she asked for coupons they lied to her and said they don't have those anymore.Later in the week, the hot water stopped working in the hotel. I recognize this happens, but there was no apology, simply a shrug of the shoulders. When one of us called down to ask about it, they just hung up the phone on us. I asked for a discount on the room - which has not yet been resolved.Other notes, the pool and the gym are tiny. There is an IHOP that it is affiliated with for breakfast. The bed and couch were very comfortable (bed was lumpy - couch was sloped). The view is nice if you have a higher level diamond head room. Overall, i guess you get what you pay for.

This hotel isn't on the beach, but it overlooked a great park and Diamond Head in the distance. Even if you stay at a beachfront hotel, unless you pay a whole lot, you might have a view right into another hotel or alley. The staff was great and we loved everything about this hotel. It's just across the street from the beachfront and is on a street with many shops and restaurants and transportation. I would highly advise NOT to use the auto rental company across the street though. We used them and they were sneaky and lied about a lot of things and our car was terrible and broke down on us twice. DO NOT go there.Anyway, we loved our stay at this hotel.

If you are not looking for a hotel in the middle of Waikiki, but close to it, you should surely think about this one. It's just a 10 minute walk from Waikiki and a two minute walk away from the beach (and Hilton Lagoon). The staff were very friendly and helpfull. After we mentioned that we were on our honeymoon, we got a free room upgrade (upgraded from city view, to ocean/diamond head view), a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine. The only other time we needed the front desk, was when we needed a taxi back to the airport and they called one for us. The rooms were big enough for the two of us and it was nice to have a big flatscreen tv hanging on the wall. The view from the room, towards Waikiki/Diamondhead, was great. The only downside of the room was that it was at the Ala Moana blvd. side of the hotel, so it was a bit noisy with all the traffic in front of the hotel. With the doors of the balcony closed we didn't find it that disturbing though. Breakfast is at the IHOP next door...free continental breakfast, or a $5 discount for each person when having breakfast a-la-carte at the IHOP.

I am going to try to be objective as much as possible despite our experience, but it'll be hard.When we made the reservation for one night ($130) SIX MONTHS prior, we let them know this was our honeymoon. Then I made the spa reservation online, as they suggested to their sister hotel very near by. I was already informed that we would be taking a cab (5 min ride) for the spa, perfectly fine. We confirmed all this a week prior to our arrival.We checked in, mid day, and checked into our room without any problems. The room is your typical boutique hotel room, small but with character with a great view within downtown. 30 mins later we came down, spoke with the front desk and made an appointment for our cab 30 mins prior to our spa appointment the next day. I also requested for our spa appointment to be changed to an hour earlier, which then (let's call her Lisa) Lisa confirmed my appointment, then called the sister hotel to confirm infront of me, and gave me a confirmation # and info. When we came back after dinner, we noticed our luggages in the lobby. Then we were stopped by Lisa (its a tiny hotel) and told they gave us a wrong room by mistake and they had to switch our room and already gave our old room to someone else (which is why our luggages were moved, without our consent, when I had things OPEN in the room). At this point, we were calm but still upset. 1) Why would ANYONE touch anyone's luggages without their permission? 2) Despite their reason for the need to fill it with another guest, why couldn't they wait for us? 3) WHY DID YOU TOUCH OUR BELONGINGS AND PUT THEM IN THE TINY LOBBY WHERE ANYONE CAN SEESo after them apologizing, whatever, we just said its fine, we don't want to make a big deal out of this. So we went to our new room. It was substantially smaller, not that we really cared about the room because it was small to begin with. We just felt like we got kicked out and were being shuffled around.We got over it, the next day we went out to the front desk for our cab for our spa. 1) The cab isn't there 2) Someone else other than Lisa tells us there's no appt for us 3) We're stranded, againThey finally get ahold of Lisa, Lisa tells the hotel yes, we have a cab appt, yes, we have a spa appt at the new time and she did confirm it. The front desk calls the spa, is told NO, the appt is still at the old time (which we will miss because we're there for only one day and have plans, which is why I requested the change in the first place as soon as we checked in)In the end, we're told sorry, but no, they don't have the appt and there's nothing they can do. So after spending nearly an hour for the confusion to be understood, we just leave and do other things. What a waste of time.When we get back the manager heard about the 2 incidents and apologizes to us. We tell him its fine, but its disappointing because its our honeymoon and we're only here for one night. He tells us he'll give us credit for the night which he explains will show up within 30 days on our credit card statement.We forget about it when we come back and my husband emails him after about a month (he gave us his info, for the credit) to follow up on the comp, no answer, we're ignored, yet again.I'm wouldn't even give 2 stars if it wasn't for the location and it being a cute boutique hotel.Complete waste of our time. No one took responsibility over anything, and no one acted out of professionalism and hospitality.

The worst thing, to me, was the lack of a hospitality room or even a shower for guests who have checked out. In a beach town where people have long flights home, that is absolutely inexcusable. Who wants to get on a five, eight or 10-hour flight without showering after a day at the beach? And who wants to sit next to that person on the plane?Frankly, I would choose the Wyland over this one.","Chicago, Illinois",44,3.0

I booked on March 3 at aquaresorts.com for our July 15-22, 2009 hotel stay. I confirmed my booking before we left, and everything was fine. When we got to the hotel, however, we were told that the hotel had overbooked, and even though they had four months to contact us, we never received a phone call or e-mail. We were told that they moved us to a much better location right on Waikiki Beach, and the Park Shore hotel. The only consolation was the paid cab right to the new hotel. When we got to Park Shore, it was obviously not the same quality hotel. And when I talked to the front desk, they kept saying that the location was much better. I tried to explain that I booked for the continental breakfast, the flat screen tv, the in-room massage and the star rating, none of which Park Shore offered. If I had booked Park Shore in March, I only would have paid $84 a night, and when I told the front desk this, they said we had to pay the full $94 that we had agreed to for the Palms and Spa. I called other hotels that we had looked at, and of course the last minute rate was double what it would have been in March. So I'm out $10/night, the flat screen, my massage, and the cleanliness of the room. We did get somewhat of a breakfast out of them, though, because they gave us coupons for Starbucks which was one tall coffee and a choice between a banana nut muffin, a blueberry scone or a bagel. That is not the same as the continental breakfast. We didn't even get to speak to a manger because he was in a meeting, so we left our cell phone number, and he called our home number, which we didn't get until we got home from vacation. We were tricked, and we were stuck on an island so we couldn't do anything about it. My advice is, book with one of the major chains that are on the mainland as well.

This would actually be considered our third time staying at this hotel since we stayed here twice in 2007 when we split time between Oahu and the Big Island and then back to Oahu again. I had corresponded directly thru email with the Manager of the hotel a few months in advance when booking our room. I had asked for the upper, quiet side of the hotel and was given what I asked for. We were on the top 11th floor at the back. The view was nothing spectacular as you just see other hotels but thats pretty much the view you get anywhere in Oahu unless you're directly on the beach facing it. I dont go to hotels to stare out at views anyhow so this was not an issue. The room itself was clean. A few things could have used touch-ups but nothing major to worry about it and it never concerned us. At first I couldn't connect to their complimentary (free) internet and a technician promptly came up. He retrieved their laptop and was able to connect so the issue was on my end. Fortunately I am well versed in computers and realized the problem was with my network card. I was able to connect to the wireless in the lobby no prob but that was not convenient for me. A short walk to the Ala Moana mall and I picked up a USB external network card and voila, I had internet. Two times we had problems with our a/c and both times it was taken care of promptly. One time it was an issue fixed by the tech as he had to take apart the thermostat. Next time it was a different tech who just had to slam shut the patio door which was causing the issue due to a contact. I was impressed with how quickly every issue was taken care of. Maid service cleaned the room although some days it seemed slightly later in the day. But it could have been our fault since sometimes we took awhile to get out and about or perhaps were in the room when they were coming by and they had to delay for us. Again, this really wasn't an issue. The hotel is a good walk to Waikiki beach but the better beach IMO is the Ala Moana park right nearby or even the Hilton beach across the road. We rented a car for a few days. Parking was not an issue although it is a little tight as some have already stated. $20/nt to me is a high price to pay but this is a city and this seems to be the norm. I hated the highways in Oahu and found them confusing and traffic was quite bad. In fact, we quickly tired of the whole busy aspect of Oahu....at least on the south side of the island. Coming from a town of 1000 people, its always a shock to be thrown into a big city. Honolulu is not how you picture it to be. Its all hotels, concrete and tons of cars! But this review should be more about my Aqua Palms experience then Oahu itself so I am getting a little off track here. Had no problems with any staff. All seemed courteous and friendly. The laundry facilities on P3 is a little small and some people just left their items in the dryer so you had to wait. Two dryers were malfunctioning but a repair tech solved that issue as well which we were appreciative of. The elevators were quite slow at times but then again, I think the hotel was quite busy as the week went on so there was reasons for it. No issues with our billing, check in or check out and cab fare to and from airport will cost you roughly $35. I'm not sure if we'll ever be back to Oahu just because we've been there twice and found Maui more laid back and hope to hit Kaui next. But if someone hasn't been to Oahu, they really should go at least once and Aqua Palms is a more affordable solution to stay at and I would recommend them without hesitation.

After traveling for 16 hours and arriving at the hotel for check in, I was told that I had been chosen for an ""upgrade,"" however, the ""upgrade"" was to a sister property on the other side of the island. I had chosen the Aqua Palms and Spa for its close proximity to the Hawaii Convention Center, where I would be all week, so I said thank you for the offer, but I made my reservations here and will be staying at the Aqua Palms and Spa. The front desk clerk then spent over 5 minutes trying to convince me that the other hotel was better, but I still insisted that I wasn’t interested...finally the truth came out! I was informed that the hotel was overbooked and that I had no choice but to move to the other hotel. I told the clerk that this was unacceptable and that I had made my reservations 4 months ahead of time and received a confirmation number the week of my trip and I was never contacted or informed that the hotel was overbooked. Finally, I asked to speak to the Manager, and waited several minutes before he came out to talk to me. He also began his speech about why the sister property hotel would be much better and when I tried to tell him that I was not interested in changing hotels he told me to ""be quiet so he can finish"" and that I “need to listen."" Finally after another 15 minutes of telling the Manager that I was not leaving and that it is unacceptable to send me to another hotel, the manger finally said ""okay, we will let someone else have this great opportunity."" My room wasn't ready until later in the evening, and for the rest of the week, the front desk staff gave me rude looks when I walked through the lobby. Also, I was surprised by the behavior of the front desk clerk and the manager, never once did they try to apoligize for the overbooking, they were only forceful and demeaning during my check in and tried to mislead me by telling me I was “upgraded.”Overall, the actual hotel was adequate but nothing fancy. As mentioned by other reviews, the elevators are very slow, the free breakfast is pretty much just muffins and fruit and the pool is very small.

When we arrived, my reservation was fine, but my three colleagues were informed that their reservations were at other hotels, which were apparently owned by the same people/corporation. When we confronted them with reservation numbers and confirmation emails, they finally admitted that they had overbooked the hotel, and that my colleagues were being moved to another hotel. No amount of arguing could change their mind, despite valid confirmation numbers. The other hotels were about 15 min walk away, and this inconvenience severely damaged our business trip. Other aspects of the hotel were OK, but I can't recommend a hotel that doesn't honor confirmation numbers and reservations.

Such a stupid rule only succeeds in inconveniencing the customers.","Stockholm, Sweden",18,2.0

A few slight letdowns makes me not give it 5 stars, which i'll outline below.First of all location is fantastic. It's not in Waikiki but just outside it on the Ala Moana BLVD. I picked this because I didn't want the noise of an inner-waikiki hotel and it worked a treat. Waikiki at any time of night is noisy. After about 11PM the Aqua Palm is not silent but quiet enough for even the lightest sleeper. It is about a 15 minute walk to the center of Waikiki. The great thing is in the other direction it's about a 15 minute walk to a major tourist shopping center; the Ala Moana Shopping Center. I went there 4 times over my fortnight stay and the shopping is great as is the selection of restaurants! Within a 5 minute walk of the Ala Moana Shopping Center is a Walmart and the Ward Mall. Not only all this, but directly attached to the hotel is an IHOP and within a few minutes is a Waikiki Cheeseburger (a must try) and McDonalds. Did I mention the beach is 5 minutes away?Check-In was OK. Not fantastic but OK. Official Check-In time was 3PM and we got in at 2PM. We were not offered any refreshments but there was a $2.00USD coffee machine in the lobby. The lobby was nice with a leather couch to sit on and lots of tourist brochures to read. I found it odd that on registration at Check-In desk staff said they ""did not know"" what level my room was on. Strange? A few hour wait ( as was dead tired from the 10 hour flight ) and we were told the room is ready to go up but they are changing the A/C filter, I was also told I was upgraded to a room with a balcony which was nice.On arrival of the room an engineer was just leaving after changing the A/C filter, which was good cos' we used that baby the entire trip. Honolulu is so humid compared with my home South Australia. ""Mark"" our baggage handler gave us a walkthrough of everything in the room and some close attractions. He was the nicest staff member, pity we hardly saw him.The room was very clean, expectations were met. The balcony was nice, big TV with free cable and free internet access was accomodating. In regards to cleanliness, we did see two baby cockroaches during our stay, but that is to be expected when in this tropical climate I would leave the balcony open for hours at a time. It did mention in the hotel room book that if creatures appeared to call guest services and they would be removed immediately. I didn't bother as they scuttled out of site pretty quickly. The ""partial city view"" was actually pretty good. It was looking opposite to the Hilton Hawaii Village and next to that a large park area. The Ala Moana BLVD directly below sometimes had some protests and things in the morning which was interesting. I remember one Gay Pride protest and one day it looked like the entire Honolulu Army was running down the street.On to the staff. Most were friendly, the day staff more so. There was one woman who was extremely rude and really ruined it for the hotel. About 10PM at night I went down to the front desk to ask for some cutlery and plates as had been told many times on Check-In that they were available anytime. She said that she doesn't have any and made a weird hand gesture I am unaccustomed to. I asked if she could recommend anywhere where I could purchase or obtain some in which she reacted in a loud tone ""I cannot help!"" with the same hand gesture. I took it upon myself to walk down to McDonalds and they gave me some cutlery and plastic plates for free. Yes, McDonalds had better customer service than this desk staff person.Now, yes you may have read in other reviews the elevators are slow. They are very slow. Sometimes in excess of 5 minute waits, and then they may be full. 2 of the 3 elevators were working, the last one had a sign that it was being maintained. Now personally this isn't a big issue for me as i'm pretty fit but I can see where some people may have an issue. I mean this is an 11 floor hotel. Lots of people were moaning about it when they really didn't need to. Sheesh, you're on holiday!One last whinge is the member from Expedia (they book tours for you in the lobby) was always busy. We waited for an hour once and then was told he was going on his break and to come at 9AM in the morning when he opens. I tried this twice only to find people already waiting. He made some bad jokes in that we should come at a better time. I didn't really find this funny as we had tried. We eventually caught his relief a woman this time who was able to fit us in and book our tours. You think that when you spend over $1500USD on tours that they'd have more staff on hand.Room cleaners were nice and did a decent job most of the time. They were happy to take a $2.00USD tip but it would've been nice if they replaced our shampoo.The pool was good, we used it twice during our stay. It's not really big enough for more than 6 people and often there was more than this, but occasionally it was free and nice to have a swim in the warm fresh water. Sometimes beach saltwater is the last thing you need.The continental breakfast was great, we used it almost every day. It's open from 7:30 to 9:00 every morning. It had orange juice, guava juice, an assortment of muffins and fruit. All free and always fresh. Impressive.At the end of the day I would go again. The location for the price is pretty hard to beat. We paid $94.00USD + tax per night. It's a shame that some aspects of customer service let the entire hotel down but what can you do. Some people shouldn't be in customer service.For those interested in tourist things I would highly recommend a day tour of Oahu, parasailing, shopping in the International Market Place & Ala Moana Center, definately visiting Waikele Premium Outlets if you like your brand name stuff & Pearl Harbour. If you're with your partner I can't recommend more the sunset dinner cruise on the Navatek-1 cruise ship.For good eating, you can't go past ""Waikiki Cheeseburger"", IHOP, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company and ""The Cheesecake Factory""Unless you're with family or big on culture don't bother with the Polynesian Cultural Center (bit boring for me and an 18 year old tour guide was a let down), watch out for rough sea if doing a shark dive (seasick) and going out after midnight, it gets scary. Hobos and people with guns about.","Adelaide, Australia",74,4.0

We were upgraded to a Diamond Head view on the 11th floor free of charge. This was nice, but I would have rather stayed on the other side of the hotel because of the street noise. It didn't bother my husband, but it woke me up several times. The room was decent with a nice flat screen TV. The carpet was damp though and the balcony door would not shut completely. This may have contributed to the street noise. Access to the beach was good through the Hilton Hawaiian Village across the street. Make sure to turn left out of the hotel and cross the street there instead of down to the right. The hotel is at the edge of the beach, but we enjoyed walking down the beach and then cut into the main street where all of the shops and restaurants are located. There are fireworks on the beach on Friday nights at 7:30pm right by the HHV so we had a great spot on the pier and then it was an easy walk back to the hotel. The location also made it easy to get down to Pearl Harbor early in the morning. Just take Ala Moana the whole way. Breakfast wasn't much, but it was fine and free and tided us over until lunch. Parking was $20. Overall the hotel was good and what you would expect for a three star.",Kansas City,29,3.0

The room was tastefully decorated, clean and spacious and I had a beautiful view of Diamond Head and the city. Very comfortable bed and minimal street noise. The staff was very helpful and friendly at all times; they assisted me with directions, calling a taxi, arranging for a tour of Pearl Harbor, and restaurant recommendations. The location is great as well. The parking garage seemed a bit tight but I ended up never using my rental car. The trolley picks up right out front if you want to go to Ala Moana shopping center and the Wailana Coffee House is less than a block away, great food and possibly the best coffee I've ever had.

She has the fastest response time of anyone in Hawaii. She is so nice and really works with you. It was a pleasure to work with her. The location of this unit is great. Towards the beginning of Waikiki. Directly across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Lagoon. Fantastic for young children. We have a 2 and 4 year old and took the 5 minute walk to the lagoon each day. They loved it!The unit itself is immaculate. It has one queen size bed(so comfortable) and a pullout sofa. Perfect for the kids. Plenty of pillows and blankets. The unit also has a mini fridge, microwave, iron/board, cable tv w/ dvd player and telephone with local calling which comes in pretty handy when making reservations for things. Also has an IHOP downstairs but the Wailana Coffee House next door is much better(and less expensive). Eugenia's place also has it's own private parking stall which was fantastic. The pool was great with a pretty big sunbathing area. I would recommend Eugenia's place at The Palms to just about anyone who'll listen. The unit is great, the location is great and Eugenia is GREAT!

I was happy with the room, No complaints there. However, I noticed that the sheets were not changed until my 3rd night there. The breakfast was good. It was free. There were muffins, Croissants, fruit, juice and coffee. It was enough to get me thru until lunch. I did not like the location as much, It was about 1.2 miles walk to Waikiki beach. That is the best beach, the water is beautiful and shallow during the day, the sand is soft and clean. The beach next to Hilton Village is not so great (even though it is like a 5 minute walk), The sand is rough and the beach seems dirty. Next time I go to Honolulu I would stay in a hotel directly in Waikiki, We ended up spending all of our time there anyways, There a ton of restaurants and things to do there and the beach is wonderful.

My partner and I enjoyed a 2 week stay at the Aqua Palms and Spa in Waikiki. The service was excellent and the staff are wonderful. Thank you to Mark for ensuring that we felt right at home. I was very impressed with our room and felt extremely comfortable there. The bed was very comfortable as well. It is a hotel that I would definitely stay at again as it is quiet and the elegance that you see throughout the building is first class all the way. I liked the fact that it is a smaller building and you can sit in the lobby and enjoy a coffee while you relax in a warm and hospitable surrounding. I would like to upgrade when I return to a room with a kitchen and living room. That way I could do some cooking and feel like I was right at home. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed using the BBQ on the second floor by the pool to cook up some really delicious steaks. I highly recommend the Aqua Palms and Spa in Waikiki as you are 3 blocks away from the beach and the mall is right down the road. The location is perfect and the view from the upper floors is really cool. Again, staff were more than willing to address any concerns and ensure that we were comfortable. I look forward to staying with them again.Only one downside. The elevators were painfully slow. I believe they were working on this problem and trying to get a third elevator up and running.

Previously, we stayed in Kailua in a vacation rental home, and at the Marriott in Waikiki. For the money, we would definitely stay at the Aqua Palms again ($70/night through Priceline). It met our needs as a clean, comfortable, welcoming place to sleep. The room was adequate size for two adults and an 11 yr. old, with a queen bed and a fold-out couch. It was nice to have the couch during the day, along with the chairs on the lanai. We were in room 225, facing away from busy Ala Moana Blvd. so no noise except the birds. The view was of the small street behind the hotel, palms, etc. Not ocean view, but pleasant enough, again, for the price. Being on the second floor eliminated any elevator waiting, as we took the stairs, and were on the same floor as the pool and breakfast room. Big tv, free internet, bed was comfortable, AC worked fine. We love to swim but never got around to using the small pool, as we went to Hanauma Bay several times and to the Windward beaches.Breakfast is muffins, apples, oranges, bananas, juice and coffee. Dull but free. Wailana Coffee Shop is great, if you need a change, just on the corner, all you can eat pancakes with 2 eggs and bacon for $5.95! Food Pantry or ABC Stores are within a short walk, if you want to make use of the fridge and micro (these were handy for leftovers, too.)We did not have a car, as we have family in the area. It was an easy walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center, and to Waikiki in the other direction (5-10 minutes.) I agree that if this is your first time in Hawaii you might want to choose one of the bigger, more atmospheric beach hotels.

Now, although the property is located close enough to all the action in Waikiki, and the rooms have partial ocean views, if this is your first time in Waikiki, I would recommend staying at one of the oceanfront hotels on Kailakaua Avenue. I'd definitely recommend having a rental car if you will be staying at this hotel and are planning on spending a lot of time in Waikiki.We arrived at the hotel at around 3:00PM and were very cheerfully greeted by the front desk agent checking us in. We were there on our anniversary, and when we told him this he upgraded our room. (There is also a bowl of crisp, red apples at the front desk that was always full)Although I wouldn't call our room luxurious, its basic decorations were very aesthetically pleasing. The room had a partial ocean view, it isn't that the hotel is very far from the ocean but that the view is covered by the buildings adjacent to the hotel. All in all it was a very nice hotel, particularly if you are able to get it at low rate, as we did.It should be noted though that my partner had a hard time sleeping on the bed. I am not sure if it was the pillows, or just the condition of the mattress, but he tossed and turned a lot, something that never really happened anywhere else we ever stayed at.PS. the televisions placed at the corner of the room were a little umcomfortable to watch while laying in bed.","Norfolk, Virginia",27,4.0

We had been to Hawaii several times, but this was the first time I was going alone. I was looking for a small, reasonably priced hotel in a quiet part of Waikiki where I could walk and shop. I decided to try the Aqua Palms based on tripadvisor.com reviews and absolutely loved it. I paid $108 senior rate for a room on the 8th floor with views of the ocean (between the Hilton towers), Diamond Head, and the city. It was a fairly small room with two queen beds, huge flat screen TV, free internet, microwave, small refrigerator, coffee maker, and a balcony with two chairs and a table. The continental breakfast was served down by the pool and included coffee, juice, and several types of pastries. There was also a manager's reception on Wednesday evening with entertainment and complementary cocktails, the ""Sway."" The hotel is right next to a IHOP, a minute from a 24-hour coffee shop, three minutes from the Hilton Hawaiian Village, and five minutes to the ocean. I enjoyed strolling the length of Waikiki along the beach and back along the main street, going in and out of shops. I felt very comfortable walking by myself during the day and evening. The staff were very friendly and helpful. When I checked out, I received a free box of chocolates.

The beds (2 queen) were comfortable and the plasma tv was a nice touch. The room's view was not ocean or Diamondhead but was still pleasant. We were able to open the lanai door every morning and evening-- no traffic noise, just birds. There were no loud noises or ""party heads"" on the floor, so our nights were peaceful. Yes, the elevators were slow but anyone with access to internet should know that. The wait for an elevator during the week was less than two minutes but on the weekend, I made sure I had something to read.  Our room cleaner forgot to empty the garbage twice -- thus the 4 star rating. However, she still did a nice job of getting the room clean (we learned to put the garbage in a visible place before going out for the day). We tracked in a bit of sand at times, but it was alwas cleaned up and we learned to take beach socks and towels directly to the lanai. I enjoyed: a complimentary bottle of cold water at check-in, complimentary ""Lion"" brand coffee in the lobby, helpful staff (especially Sergio and Mark), apples at the front desk, the free continental breakfast, the nearby bus stop, the beach towel service. I wish there would have been washable plates and silverware in the room. I called the front desk and they immediately sent up paper plates and plastic silverware.

What more could you ask for? Met lots of nice people each morning and shared tips on where to go for the day. One of the three elevators was closed for renovations, but the wait wasn't bad. Chill out. You're on vacation. We chose not to get a rental car this trip and tried doing the island by city bus. Parking is a problem every where and very expensive. We took the Roberts Shuttle from the airport ,because you can't take more than a small carryon bag on the city bus. You don't need a reservation and just hop on the Roberts Shuttle outside luggage claim at the airport. It costs $9 one way or $15 roundtrip (good for 1 year) compared to $35 each way for a taxi. Bought a 4 day city bus pass at ABC for $20. The city bus stop is right outside the hotel and you can navigate the entire island easily. Bus drivers were friendly and helpful, as were the passengers.

About a 5 minute walk to the west side of Waikiki beach.BREAKFAST: it's what everyone said: fruit are oranges, bananas and apples (why don't they serve pineapple???) along with coffee, 2 types of juice (orange plus one other - either pineapple or guava), and 2 types of muffins (the small kind) and one danish or criossant (mini ones). TIP: bring your coffee pot from your room down and fill with juice!!! Or better yet: but a TO-GO coffee mug at the ABC store, and use that!INTERNET: There is pay-per-use internet in the lobby. I brought my laptop due to the advertised ""wireless internet"" - which did not exist in my room. There was wired (ethernet) internet in my room, on a cable attached to the desk. It was free and worked well. There were also a couple of wireless internets in ""range"" but I was unable to connect to any of them.ELEVATORS: there were 2 in service when we were there, and the wait was sometimes long, but not that bad... they were servicing them while we were there, so once there are 3 working, things should be ok. I would say we never waited longer than 5 minutes, and the average wait time was about 2 minutes.SERVICE: everyone was great, maids left extra coffee and lotion when we asked. front desk was courteous, check in and out were QUICK, and the guy at the activity desk (Robert?) was great! Our room was always clean every day, and we always had clean towels, and a clean room.PARKING: was $20 a day in the hotel. The parking garage is cramped, and tough to manouver, but handy in the hotel.Overall, we rented a car, so didn't spend much time in the room. For a place to sleep, shower and change, it was great! I would return.","Winnipeg, MB Canada",214,4.0

I wasn't expecting this place to be as good as the Hilton across the street, but I thought that given it's three star rating, and the positive reviews on this site, and others, that it would at least be adequate; unfortunately I was wrong. This place is a dump. The elevators were broken, the lobby smelled musty, the carpets in the hallways were all torn up and worn. There was a huge trash bin just sitting in the middle of the hallway outside our room when we checked in. The room was awful. Very small, furniture was all beat up and dirty. There was a dirty rag sitting on one of the chairs, not sure if the maid left it behind or one of the last guests. There was some sort of brown stain on the headboard. Very gross. I complained to the front desk, and they immediately changed our room. I will give credit when credit is due. The staff at this hotel was very helpful and friendly. I guess they have to be, to make up for the fact that the hotel they work at is such a dump. The second room was cleaner, however at that point I was so disgusted by the first room, and overall just disappointed by the hotel itself (the photos online are very deceiving), that I decided I didn't want to stay there. After about an hour on the phone with Expedia customer service, and $400 later, I ended up switching to the Wyland hotel, which was a hundred times better than this dump.","Boston, Massachusetts",26,1.0

In fact, we're already planning another trip next year with other family members.The Aqua Palms exceeded our expections. Anyone complaining about this hotel should just stay home. If the worst thing you can find is randoms scuff marks on the door jams and a rather slow elevator....get over it!From the time we walked through the front entrance, we were greeted with warm, friendly service. We were greeted with a refreshing bottle of cold water and a snack of cookies. The staff are friendly and helpful....from the front desk, to the management, to the service staff. Everyone was great. We were given TONS of information about things to do, places to go, bus routes, restaurants, bars, etc. They were all willing to help.The rooms were perfect for our needs. We were in room 1110 and had the perfect view of Diamnond Head, the Pacific and the city.....perfect for a glass of wine and cheese before heading to dinner. LOVED it. The room was very adequate with all the amenities listed on the site....coffee maker, microwave, mini fridge. The flat screen was great for watching some TV prior to bed time. The room was cleaned daily without exception. Our first day, we had a problem with our patio door...it kept jamming. We called and maintenance was there in minutes and the door was repaired that afternoon. The A/C worked perfectly as well. We had no complaints about the room at all.The breakfast is exactly what it says it is.....Continental breakfast.....fruit, pastries, coffee/tea and juices. Not sure how you can complain about it since that's what's advertised. It worked perfect for us. We always found a place to sit while having our breakfast...people are always coming and going. If you want something more substantial, head next door for the best all you can eat pancake breakfast for a few bucks at the Wailanai (sp?) Cafe. That place is always packed and you receive a 10% discount for staying at the hotel. I wouldn't recommend anything other than breakfast though. I didn't have the best experience at dinner, but live and learn....breakfast was GREAT.The dreaded elevator!...haha!....yes, it's pretty slow, but there are 2 of them. It seems the mornings are worse for some reason, but nothing to get too excited about. You are on vacation so relax. There was maintenance going on with the 3rd elevator while we were there so it may be up and running soon. The location of the hotel is perfect....about a 10 min. walk to the beach....just through the Hilton Hawaiin Village across the street. The beach is beautiful and there is lots of room. The main Waikiki Beach is fairly busy, but still plenty of room. You can rent an umbrella/2 chairs for around $20 for the day...not bad. We chose to take a blanket and it worked fine. The hotel is in a great location for shopping with trollies running by every few minutes. Buses are $2 for anywhere you want to go on the island....easy transportation. We didn't rent a car, and found the bus a great and inexpensive way to get around.We hike Diamnond Head which is a MUST, in my opinion. The view is breathtaking! The hike isn't that bad and takes about a half hour each way. It is challenging in places, but not impossible. We saw children to elderly people doing the hike wihtout problem. We did 3 ""tours"" with Affordable Tours. They were considerable less than a lot of tour companies and worth booking with. The Grand Island Circle Tour was great. It's an A/C bus that takes you around the entire island and stops at different points of interest.....very informative. Cousin Dave was our guide and VERY good....a real comedian. Germaine's Lua was lots of fun. Holly was our guide and she was GREAT....another comedian and crazy as ever. It was a great evening and a must do. Lastly, we did a sunset dinner cruise. Although nice, it was not a favourite of mine. It's not something I would do again or recommend.There are tons of restaurants/bars in Honolulu/Waikiki. My favourite dinner was at Ocean House. It's a beautiful restaurant that's oceanside and open air. It was an amazing meal for a decent price. The coconut lobster was to die for. The prime is some of the best we've had.....great all the way around....food and service made the evening. Moose McGillicuddy's was a perfect spot for lunch. The biggest burgers I've seen.....really good. Great $3 Mai Tai's...mmmm. Keo's is another great place for dinner with amazing Thai food...soooo good.All in all, we had a great trip and there's nothing I have to complain about. I would recommend the Aqua Palms to anyone in a heartbeat. We will be returning for sure and can't wait!If you have any questions, just let me know and I'll answer away.","Dieppe, Canada",5,5.0

However, if you get a rate of 65$ a night to stay less than 5 minutes from the beach in Waikiki, you are willing to overlook many of them.The good: location is excellent. Bus stop nearby. Within walking distance of fantastic beaches. Short bus trip to Ala Moana, downtown Honolulu, Diamondhead, etc. The front desk is always happy to offer info about bus routes etc.The room was spacious enough and quite clean. Being on the 11th floor, it was also incredibly quiet, even with loud roadworks downstairs. The room has a coffeemaker, microwave, a flatscreen TV and a fridge. The hotel has a coin operated laundry room, which is good news because you can pack less. You get towels to carry to the beach from the front desk.Staff was amazingly helpful. Yes, we were denied late checkout, but that was not up to staff. Otherwise, they were always ready with suggestions. You also get free apples.Ethernet cable in the room. It was fast and very helpful.The 'room for improvement':Maid service was less than optimal. They'd occasionally not clean the coffee maker or fail to replenish bathroom supplies. They'd be working on floors until late in the afternoon. My suspicion is that they should just hire more maids.Breakfast is acceptable, although this must be the only place on Oahu where they have unripe bananas. What is annoying is that there are no tables to sit down and enjoy your breakfast. You get muffins and croissants. The person who complained about jam must really have a sweet tooth, because those croissants are very sweet as it. Also, you get so-so coffee and nice fresh fruit juice. Overall, breakfast would be more enjoyable if they provided a few more tables and a larger room (it's a big hotel and the room is very small for that amount of people). I guess they just want you to get out of there ASAP. Not very welcoming.The downright unacceptable: elevators. I understand that we are in Hawaii and no one is in a hurry, but three elevators for a hotel that size is unacceptable. Moreover, one has been under repairs since November, according to the sign. My husband and I are in good shape and walked up and down 15 stories of stairs, but I saw a person with crutches hobbling down. Shame on you, management.","Lubbock, Texas",169,4.0

The outside of the hotel and the lobby were dated and with zero wow factor.We received a free room upgrade and had a nice view of the sea. The room was a good size with a kingsize bed, sofa and large flat screen TV. The decor was what I imagine to be 1970's style - i don't think the hotel had been decorated during my lifetime! But then you don't go to Hawaii to stay in a hotel room, much better sights to see. Minimal cleaning work was done in the rooms - sheets were changed maybe twice during my 2 week stay. The shower was powerful just what you need after a lazy day in the sun. The room had a fridge and microwave but cutlery and plates would have been useful.... There was a coffee machine in the room but no tea facilities although there was a complimentary tea / coffee located in the lobby area if you could handle the wait for the lifts.The lifts. Hmmm. Expect a wait of up to 10 minutes. One of the lifts was being renovated during our stay and although I can appreciate the necessity of this (working lifts were slow, outdated, doors open before you stop and you risked amputation holding the lift door open as it started to close before you had a chance to get in!) it was still infuriating. My advice, take the stairs.The continental breakfast was disappointing and only availalbe until 9 a.m. Jam with crossiants would be a good idea but the muffins were fresh and a good alternative. Avoid the queue for the coffee shop next door and head to Denny's for a good cooked breakfast at reasonable prices if you can handle a 10 min walk.The pool was TINY and the loungers were again old and covered in bird mess. Use the hotels towels if you are going to use them! Personally I'd go to the beach which is just a short wak away through the Hilton Hawaiian Village opposite.The hotel was in a good location, close to a lovely beach and a short walk to the Ala Moana shopping centre and the main city life was a 10 - 15 min walk away, good to burn off some calories but not too far to avoid.I think the hotel is too highly rated on this website and expesive for the quality. If you've got the extra cash I'd stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Hotel. $70 per night would be the maximum I would recommend spending on this hotel.","Port Talbot, Wales",0,2.0

It's such a bargain when you compare it to other budget hotels in Waikiki, especially the older apartment-style hotels you'll find around here.PROS:* free wifi in room, not just in lobby/poolside (as is the case at countless Waikiki hotels)* basic breakfast (muffin, fresh fruit and coffee/juice/tea) is just enough to get you going in the a.m.* secure parking garage* cracker-jack staff are the most efficient I've seen in HawaiiCONS:* lots of construction going on outside during Nov. 2008* parking garage entrance/exit can be a bit tricky* 'exercise room' was so cramped (just one treadmill and one weights machine, both not very new) that the guy using the weight machine smacked into the treadmill while I was on it!* very small pool (but hey, the ocean is just a few blocks away!)I moved to the Best Western Coconut Plaza after my stay here; both hotels are owned by the Aqua Group. The BW is more expensive, but also offers more perks.

When my wife and I arrived, we encountered numerous issues with the hotel, and those issues were:1. ElevatorsThe two working elevators (the third elevator was under renovation) were slow and the doors quickly closed on people. During our stay, there was one day where none of the elevators worked.Aqua Palms and Spa personnel made comments about the elevators. One staffer stated that it is frustrating that the elevators do not work and that Aqua Palms and Spa does not have a service elevator.2. Condition of RoomMy wife requested clean drinking glasses, and a hotel staffer informed her that the hotel does not provide clean drinking glasses daily. Please see other reviews for confirmation of this fact.There were stains on the lamp, headboard, and sheets. Also, there also stains on the walls and wallpaper was peeling. During one night of our stay, we entered the room to discover that maid service placed a stained upper sheet on our bed, which we found disguisting.3. Room ServiceThe maid did not clean the coffee pot everyday and neglected to provide coffee service for the majority of our stay. In other hotels that my wife and I have lodged at, it is customary for the maid staff to replenish soap and other hygiene items. Unfortunately, the maid staff did not replenish soap until we begged for more soap.4. Location of Laundry and Ice MachineThe self-service laundry and ice machine are located in a parking garage that is accessible to the public. If you went down to use the laundry room or obtain ice during nightime hours, it was very dark and unsecure/unsafe environment. One day, three out of the four dryers were not working, and my wife had to walk approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile to a laundromat to dry clothes. 5. Guest ServicesThere was a mixed attitude among the staff. Some staff were very helpful. One example of this was Sergio, the front desk person. Sergio would go out of his way to assist you. However, there were other staff members that possessed a poor attitude about helping the guests.Once my wife and I complained about the non-working elevators and how the lack of elevator service created a situation where the hotel was in non-compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The guest services manager agreed to comp two nights for the inconveinence of non-working elevators. 6. Representation of Hotel on hotels.com and Aqua Palms and Spa web siteIn all honesty, I believe the hotels.com and Aqua Palms and Spa web site provide misleading information regarding the conditions of the hotel. I am not the only individual that noted this fact. If one reads other reviews posted about the Aqua Palms and Spa, one will see that others noted that they believed that the Aqua Palms and Spa web site provided misleading information regarding the hotel.7. OverallGiven the numerous issues, I cannot recommend this hotel to any friend or foe. I believe that physical amenities of the hotel are poor and that the hotels.com and Aqua Palms and Spa web sites dramatically overrate and vastly exaggerate the conditions of this hotel.Therefore, I would recommend three things to individuals contemplating a trip to Oahu and reading this review. The first recommendation is not to use hotels.com to book a room due to overexaggeration of hotel conditions and the poor customer service that I received reporting the previous items to hotels.com. Second, I would read the reviews before booking a stay at Aqua Palms and Spa or any other hotel. Third, I strongly recommend that you stand up for your rights if you believe that you received no or poor customer service from this or any other hotel.",Arkansas,2,1.0

I considered this price to be a little on the low side of the median price compared to other properties. Beings we were traveling on a budget this time, I thought this would be a good less expensive option. Once I booked the trip I realized that the $105 a night was actually an average. The nights ranged from $125 (I think) to $81. If I had realized that the normal rate was $81, I would have considered a different property.  The property sets itself up to be a ""spa like (relaxing) facility"" which is far from reality. We stayed on the third floor over looking very busy Ala Moana Blvd and the parking garage. This room was considered a ""premium"" room by the person at the front desk. I am assuming that is only because you could see the De Russey Park and the Hilton waterfall across the street. Unfortunately included in this ""premium room"" also the daily wake up call of construction deliveries starting at 5:30 in the morning and drilling and banging from then on. I imagine this would not have been as big of a problem if the slider and windows had been upgraded sometime recently to a more soundproof system. Though the construction will come and go, the noise from the busy road below, which only got louder as the morning progressed, is unlikely to go away and a better buffer to the noise would make a big difference. When I asked if we could move to one of the other Aqua properties I was told I could move to the back of the building in a non-premium room but would not be compensated for the difference in room rate. I was not very pleased with this option and felt that it did not represent great customer service.  I didn't look up the location before we booked (big mistake). It is on the far north side of Waikiki. You'll have quite a walk to get down the the ""heart of Waikiki"" though only a couple block walk to the Ala Moana Mall.  Generally, the room was fairly clean and what you would expect for $81 a night. The fold out mattress in the hide-a-bed couch needed to be upgraded as it was very thin and was uncomfortable to sleep on.  The TV was small and was attached to the ceiling as you would expect to see in a hospital. The TV was so far from the bed that only on our last day did I realize that it included a DVD player.  The kitchenette consisted of exactly what was reported on the website but it seemed kinda thrown together.  Get used to either long waits or taking the stairs as the three elevators in the building are excessively slow.  There is a pool. It is about the width of a standard cubicle and in an ""L"" shape. It is enough to get wet in though.  There is a breakfast in the morning but it literally includes only fruit, muffins, juice and coffee. It is probably sufficient for some people but I would suggest purchasing additional items and keeping them in your room to supplement the limited fair.  If you are looking to stay on a budget and don't mind the inconveniences listed above then this is a fairly clean and reasonable option.",Renton,1,2.0

We were really impressed and pleased even before the trip starts.We checked in around noon, the lobby is cool and nice. Front desk staff are very polite and helpful. Our rooms are on very high floor away from elevator, rooms are very very quiet ( by Waikiki standard). We don't need to worry about any noise at all.

The longest waiting time I experienced is 3 minutes, and I don't mind even if I have to wait longer, I am in Hawaii, why should I always be in a hurry?And yes the bellman named Ryan provided high class service. He is a credit for this hotel.Yes the bathroom is tiny, and the bathtub is outdated, the housekeeper could pay more attention to hairs on the floor, but hey, how much do I pay for the room?

As I sit in the lobby observing how he helps hotel guests, I am impressed with his great attitude. Any hotel would be lucky to have someone like him on their staff.The Aqua Palms is a small boutique hotel and our room with a kingsize bed was on the small side, but location and attitude made up for all that. If you don't need the SPECIAL ATTENTION of a luxury resort, then you won't go wrong with the Aqua Palms.When a traveler is searching for a hotel and is reviewing it using the standard rating system, on some web sites the Aqua Palms is listed as 2 1/2 stars, and on others as 3 stars. In my opinion, I rate it 4 stars. Perhaps I shouldn't be sharing this choice bit of information with fellow travelers, because I tend to be selfish about my discoveries and want to keep them to myself, but when it comes to this little hotel, I just can't. The Aqua Palms deserves all the recognition it can get. ENJOY!!","Portland, Oregon",2,4.0

Linens were always clean along with cups etc. The hotel staff, especially the front desk were so kind! While my Mom checked us in (a little early even) we had to park partly on the sidewalk... a gentleman on the staff came out and told us that she was about done and how to get into the parking garage once she was out. The only problem was one of the elevators was not working, but their were 2 others. But, like I mentioned before... $115 is a WONDERFUL DEAL for the room we had in that area!

That's a poor management response to a problem. First, I must say that we also didn't receive clean glasses daily, nothing was ever cleaned except that we received fresh linens and the bed was made. Other than that, it's an old hotel that elevators don't work, and everyday we had to take the stairs. Ghetto! The manager who will respond to this is very sweet, and the staff is very kind, however, this hotel needs alot of work. On our last night we actually got lucky and caught the elevator, one of the staff had a can of Raid in their hand. We asked, ""where are you going?"" He said, ""They've got ants on the 5th floor."" I don't know, but we experienced a beatle in our room. The manager and her friendly staff organized a great Wednesday night happy hour that had free drinks, live music, and food. I must say, the manager definitely knows how to get me to come back if they offered those free coctails and that awesome guitarist & drummer.

The reviews looked excellent and we thought that we couldn't miss. Two years ago in August we had stayed at the Aqua Palms, but thought that we might try something different. Upon arriving late at night, we found out the room that we thought we had requested on the 15th floor was not available. We were put in a suit on the 11th floor, but it was very noisy and the patio door did not lock. There was another room on the 15th floor which we took, but it was still extremely noisy, granted it was a Saturday night, but I do not like to hear partying and yelling outside from the near bye rooftop parking lot until 5:30am. The next morning however we had decided to leave the hotel and were going to stay at another hotel. Trina, who we had originally spoke to for booking called up to our room and was concerned that we were upset about our room etc., which she learned about from the desk clerks notes from the previous night. We went down to the desk and she was extremely apologetic and wanted to make sure we were happy. That is when we asked if she could check to see if we could stay at the Aqua Palms and Spa. Within a half hour we were at the Palms and knew we would have a room on the tenth floor. We left our bags there for the day and wandered Waikiki. We arrived back at 3pm and checked into a lovely room on the tenth floor overlooking the beautiful grounds of the Hilton, Fort DeRussy and a lovely view of the ocean. Within minutes our luggage was brought up to our room by Ryan, one of the wonderful bellmen at the hotel, and we received some treats. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Palms. The staff is extremely courteous. Sergio, Mark, Ryan and Keola at the front desk were always most helpful and accommodating. When we needed extra towels etc they were always at our room within minutes and they were wonderful about booking transportation. We would not hesitate to stay at the Palms again. Although Ala Moana blvd. is very noisy, it is not near as noisy as the main drag in Waikiki and the views from the hotel are excellent. We even managed to have a front row seat for the Honolulu Marathon which passed by the Palms on Sunday morning. We found the deck to be ample room to sit on and enjoy the views of Waikiki both day and night and the people watching is great too. There are always lots of people coming and going along the road. We found the facilities in the room to be great for making breakfast, lunch and snacks, with a fridge, microwave and various utensils. Daily there was also a breakfast buffet with fruit, muffins, coffee and juice on the 2nd floor, which was also very nice. Well done Aqua Palms. Look forward to staying with you again.

After much deliberating between the various recommended hotels on tripadvisor, we decided on this one. My girlfriend and I arrived separately, so I checked in alone. I had no problems at check in but I was disappointed to find that the room had no balcony. I had requested a balcony so I called and the next day they moved me into another room, this one with a balcony. The problem was that I was relaxing on the beach when I got a phone call saying they had another room for me and could I come back and move all our stuff. It wasn't the end of the world as we weren't far from the hotel, but still a bit annoying. The rooms themselves are just fine, had everything we needed and were great value for the price. It's about 20 mins walk to the centre of waikiki and about 10 mins to the nearest beach. The beaches near the hotel are much less crowded so I would recommend these over the more central ones. The continental breakfast in the morning was adequate, but there's nowhere really to eat it so there's kind of an awkward atmosphere when everyone is trying to perch themselves somewhere in the reception area. After the first morning we just brought it up to our room.We only used the pool area once and it's true that it is very small but at the same time hardly anyone seems to use it so the size isn't really an issue.

Some of the furniture is a little worn and rooms could stand some new wallpaper, but for the price we paid, I didn't expect a lot.

The furniture looked like something from the early 70's (Hey, we were told that this hotel had been recently totally refurbished...:-( The cabinet where you would hang your clothes had large messy gobs of what I THOUGHT might be glue- however, when I spoke with Aqua after arriving back home again, I was told that there had never been a mirror there and there was no guessing, I assume, what the gobs of stuff were..what a lovely thought. The ironing board had dark stains on it (I don't even want to know what they were). The bathroom was finished with grout that did not match, the back wall were crooked - very crooked - so much so that at one side, the tile grout was at least 1.5"" thick to make up for the poor wall alignment - wake up, Aqua - why didn't you fix the WALL that was causing the problem. The tub drain cover was not secured and popped off every time we took a shower. The door frame at the entry door looked like someone had chewed on it and instead of replacing the frame or patching it where possible, they just painted over it. There were two pictures under the bed - I guess they forgot to rehang those after their ""renovations"". The bed was lumpy at the bottom third.The only positive about that place - the flat screen TV and every time I asked for fresh towels they were promptly delivered.  The pool is a joke - I have never seen one that small at a hotel. The continental breakfast was to be expected - I have never seen a continental breakfast that was anything more than pastries that are bad for you and a few bananas with coffee.I took a lot of pictures of the room. I will post some of them with this review (only allowed 10?). I am going to post them online as well as send them to both Aqua corporate and the company that sold me the vacation package (Continental). They should have given that place a much lesser rating than it has.I asked for a change of room but the only one that they had available was worse than what we had. I asked for a refund on the ""deluxe"" part of the cost and was told that they could not help me at all in that regard and that I had to go back to the vacation provider (that they kept calling Elite Vacations, even though I corrected them a few times because it was Continental Vacations) - if I had a complaint. I asked for a print-out at the end of the stay so that I could ensure they were not trying to charge anything against our card (which had to be presented at check-in for misc. charges) - they refused to give me a print out showing a zero balance and told me I had to get that from the package provider?? I asked to speak with the manager on duty and he told me that he was it (Sergio, if you read this - you need an attitude adjustment!)On the final day, we were waiting for the taxi pick-up (Star Taxi, who will do hotel to airport for $28 if you call in advance to book it). I need to mention here that when we arrived at the airport, they had sent an alternate company to pick us up (someone they worked with) which was fine. The guy had our name, knew how many there were and all was cool. So on the last day, when the bellhop asked me who was picking us up & at what time and I told him, I didn't think anything of it. He took longer than it should have to get our bags from the storage room where they had been since check-out. When a taxi pulled up at 2:45pm, he said ""your taxi is here...time to go. "" I hesitated and he asked me what was wrong. I told him that it was not Star Taxi. He said , never mind that..they share with this company (""The Cab"") - WELL...he is a liar. We found out after we got into the cab and were on our way that he had called this guy 20 min. before. The driver told me directly ""the guy at your hotel. He is nice guy. He calls me every day because he knows I have nice clean cab""...I was soooo infuriated. Now,yes, I know that people all work together and there are kick-backs all the time BUT..I had been specific in saying who our taxi was and now that poor company had sent a cab to the hotel for 3pm, through nasty Waikiki traffic and wasting his gas, only to find that we were already gone. I was wondering why the guy was rushing us into the cab so quickly. I should have been more ademant about checking first with the driver but at first I thought that because it was a different company that picked us from the airport that this was the same deal. What a snake that employee is..Because we spent little time in Waikiki itself and were only there to sleep, I tried to keep it in perspective and not let it ruin my trip.Anyway, I will post a full trip report but maybe this review will save someone else from Aqua. DO NOT STAY THERE - save your money and go across the street to the Hilton Hawaiian (btw, the HHV was great, we used them a lot for Oahu advice and they were helpful to us, even knowing that we were not staying at their hotel).The other two big problems - NO water pressure. The hot water turned on full force was scarcely noticeable at times -didn't matter if it was late at night or early morning. Nothing like having to take 5 min. to rinse the shampoo from your hair in the shower. :-(Also, what was up with the bed linens and towels? EVERYTHING was stamped in big letters with the hotel name. Granted, there are some people who would stoop to trying to steal the sheets, (why in God's name would you do that?? and if you WOULD, I don't think that someone stamping their hotel name on them is going to stop you.).And finally - the floor was very unlevel. There were two distinct humps in the floor running the width of the room.We were not only unhappy guests - we spoke to 3 other couples during the week who were in the same situation.There are some people who would not be affected in the least by the condition of our room but keep this in mind: We were told by Aqua that the room was newly renovated and completely re-done (their words, not mine). We PAID for a DELUXE room. Yes, it was a ""budget"" hotel by Hawaii standards and most other states but there is no excuse for the poor service and lack of attention to detail. You can be ""budget"" and ""simple"" but you do not need to leave the room in a bad way, you do not need to have stains on the draperies and the ironing board, you do not need to refuse to give your guests printouts showing a zero balance at the end of the stay, you do not need to refuse to find a better room (if you can't and you are fully booked, you should provide a monetary refund for a room that was not as it was professed to be) and you certainly do not need to have employees so obviously on the take.I am NOT comparing the HHV to this hotel in that the furnishings were obviously better (of course they are, the hotel is an entirely different class). I AM comparing the fact that the employees at the HHV went out of their way to be of assistance (when we were not even guests there and they knew that!). I AM comparing the fact that their property was kept clean.I have many more photos - I could only post a few. I am still downloading from my cameras and there were some that did not turn out unfortunately. If you have questions, I am happy to answer them.I found out from Aqua, who responded to me as a result of one of my posts on the forum. It turns out that they cannot control the quality of the rooms at all in most of their properties. Each room is individually owned by someone. In order for Aqua to make ANY improvements or changes to that room, the owner has to approve of it. I was given this information by the manager of Aqua who contacted me so I can only assume it is correct. As of the time that she spoke with me, she had not seen the room that we stayed in. So...in knowing their process, anyone who would venture to stay with Aqua is taking their chances because there is no way that they can guarantee consistency in all rooms in even the same hotel. There are a small percentage of their properties that are NOT run this way, but most of them are. A few days ago, I was given a partial refund from Aqua - nowhere near what I wanted and deserved - and I am still pursuing this with Continental Vacations as well. Never again..---------",Florida,1,1.0

The decision to stay there is mainly for its proximity to the Hilton, relatively lower price, good reviews from here. However, our experiences at this hotel is at best mediocre. We had a rental car and knew in advance that they (similar to most others) charge $20/night parking. The hotel is located on Ala Moana Blvd, with a narrow (one car width) and invisible parking entrance. Since there is no registration parking, you will have to enter the garage before doing registration. Just call the front desk from the parking entrance and they will open the door. After registration, the room key card will be used to enter but ours never worked. We had to call the front desk every time. There are lot of comments on the tight parking garage. It is no kidding the narrowest parking garage I've ever seen and I live in LA! I can see many marks on the pillars and walls left by drivers not use to a different (rental) vehicle and tight parking spaces. They have three elevators and they are fast. Well, a bit too fast that the door will close after only one person gets in. The second person always has to fight with the door. I booked directly from the Aqua web site and the registration process was smooth and the staff were friendly. However, the keys didn't work for the room and I had to go back to the front desk to get it re-programmed. At the same time their computers crashed and I had to wait 20 minutes for this to be done. Since they DO NOT have air conditioning in the corridor, it's a very long and hot 20 minutes. The hotel is old with small rooms. The bathroom is newly remodeled but is one of the smallest I've seen. There's ventilation fans in the bathroom and the towels are clean and comfortable. The room comes with a microwave oven, a refrigerator and coffee maker. The best part of it is the 42"" flat screen TV, but since we're in Hawaii, it was used much. Beside free local phone calls and wired internet, the hotel also provide free continental breakfast. The problem is that it opens at 7:30am and there's always a long line. There's also not much eating area that most people eat by the tiny swimming pool. There's a business center in the small front lobby, but is operated by a separate company. They charge $0.75 per printing page and $.25 per minute using the computer to print. There's not much instruction on the confusing registration process and you're for sure to use it much longer (and be charged more) just to find out how to print. The staff are friendly but not very helpful. Overall, I think this is an average hotel in an average location with average service. The Hilton is about $50/night more expensive but is a much better hotel.","Los Angeles, California",76,2.0

Also well situated to get into Honolulu, on foot (3.5miles) if you like to walk which we do took about 1hour or the tram/bus stops out side every few minutes and costs $2 great for sight seeing as you can go right round the Island on it.The staff were most curtious and friendly and happy to deal with any problems we had even changing our room just after check in as we had booked a twin and had been asigned a double.The Room we had was a twin and was quiet spacous with a fridge, mircowave and untenils all supplied as well as coffee which was replenished on a daily basis. the Lani was just big enough for the table and chairs which enable us to watch the sun go down over the ocean.The only complient was the ongoing renevation which upon returning from a trip one day found a wet paint sticker on our door.",Derbyshire,3,5.0

I booked a 7 night stay at the Aqua Palms & Spa based solely on reviews here on tripadvisor. My husband worried a bit that I wouldn't like it because I can be picky at times, but I said I just needed a clean hotel with a decent bed and good shower. Aqua Palms was a great, comfortable stay and met my expectations! The room was a decent size, but on the smaller side and we didn't have the greatest view. I would've asked for a room facing Ala Moana Blvd to get a better view of the water and Diamond Head, but we were satisfied with it. I think that the better view also makes you more susceptible to street noise from what I heard, but not sure on that. I think it's nice that they offer breakfast; they do that as a courtesy and it's basically just muffins, fruit, and juice, but I don't understand other reviews complaining about it when they don't HAVE to provide anything. It was nice to know there were free muffins downstairs every morning. The lobby was nice, clean and cute, nothing fancy. The staff was super friendly as was most everyone we met who lived there -- the bus drivers, the people working on the tours, etc... -- very nice people. Our bed was comfortable, we had internet access, they had nice big LG flat screen TVs mounted on the walls, and the bathroom was new-ish looking and clean. I especially liked that the water pressure in the shower was nice and strong (I've had hotel experiences when the water was too weak). There's coin laundry on the 3rd level too. On the downside (but very minor): the furniture was a little old and worn and the carpet had a few stains. Also, the pool was extremely small, so if you're dying to book a hotel with a great pool this isn't the one for you. The beach was great though and very close by. That's about it though. Despite what other reviews said, I thought the elevators were fine and came fast enough. The hotel also offers a shuttle for $10/person I think to take you to and from the airport so call and ask about that if you need transportation.You can walk across the street to the Hilton for beach access or to eat and shop that their many little shops, walk to your right out of the hotel lobby about 10-15 min to get to Ala moana Shopping Center (a mall) and there's a park, Ala Moana Park, right across from there where we watched the most magnificent sunset. You can rent a car or buy a 4 day unlimited bus pass from ABC for $20. I'm glad I made the choice to stay here.",Washington DC,2,4.0

However, it seemed the best of the bunch for the price so we decided to give it a try. When we arrived, I really could not get over what a great deal we got. The hotel was wonderful, and for the price- a steal. We will definitely go back. Our room seemed freshly renovated, and it had a huge flatscreen tv. It was large enough to be comfortable, and had a wonderful, huge bed. Some people complained about noise from the street in their reviews. We were only on the 2nd floor, but we faced the back and couldn't hear a thing. We visit Hawaii frequently and will definitely stay there again next time. Of course, if you are expecting Ritz Carlton standards, you will be disappointed. But for the price we paid, I was expecting something like a Holiday Inn or worse, and it was much nicer. The pool is microscopic; and the hotel is a 10 minute walk to the beach. However, it is right across from the huge Hilton Village complex, full of restaurants and shops; and it is only a 5 minute walk to main strip of Waikiki. Great location.

We had mostly stayed in 4 star hotels in the year previous, so we did not expect much, thinking, ""Hey, we will be in Hawaii. Who will be spending much time in the room anyway?"" The location, across from Hilton Hawaiian Village gives you fairly easy access to the beach, and it is a lovely walk. You appreciate the shade in August! The only differences we saw from a real 4 star hotel was the lack of a fabulous lobby area (the lobby is modest, but with Hilton Hawaiian Village across the street, and a park right beside that, you feel like the grounds are lush, rather than in the middle of city hustle bustle), no gift shops or restaurants, but the area was packed with more than enough to fill those gaps. There were at least 3 ABC Stores within a block if you needed anything at all, from an aspirin to souvenirs. The room was really lovely, more than comfortable. When we got there (no wait to register!) they told us that the bargain room we had reserved was not ready yet, but if we wanted, we could upgrade for $25 a night to a room with a partial ocean view and balcony plus better sleeping accomodations, so we asked to see the room first. I fell in love. The view was from Diamond Head to the beach in front of Hilton Hawaiian Village. We could have sat out on that balcony for all 5 days and it would have been worth it! We loved all the people there, especially the concierge who helped us with our tickets to the Polynesian Cultural Center, and the gal that upgraded our room.

My room was large and the bathroom had a large counter to spread my stuff out on. The staff was super helpful with ""first timer"" questions. The Tripadvisor site is a great tool to research trips.

Hotelroom was great. Enough space with complimentary bathrobes, magnetron, fridge. The pool is not that big though and is affected by a lot of street noise (cars and building activities across the street at the Hilton). Beach is like 5-10 minute walk so that's no biggie. We used the beach in front of the Hilton and that was less crowded. We did walk to Waikiki 15-30 minutes away from hotel and the beaches over there are way more crowded with surfers and what not. Hotel is not far from the beaches and shops of Waikiki and the Ala Moana Mall. The front desk was helpful and did that with a smile. On our trip we also visited New York so the attitude of the Hawaiians were much more appreciated by us.The complimentary breakfast was not that big of a deal. mini croissants, muffins, fruit, coffee or juice and that's it. breakfast was served at a room next to the pool. Not much room to sit so we brought our breakfast to our room on those little plates that would fit 2 mini croissants and 1 muffin.anyways we had a great stay. not that luxurious as the hilton, but just decent.","Capelle aan den IJssel, The Netherlands",20,4.0

The price included roundtrip airfare from SFO to HNL and the entire stay at the hotel. When we arrived at Aqua Palms, I was pretty impressed with their lobby. They had a sign in the lobby indicating that there was a special on massages at the hotel for $69 for one hour. You can't beat that! After checking in at the front desk, they gave us 2 bottles of water. Our room was a decent size that included a large bed, sofa, work desk, flat screen TV (oh yea!), microwave, fridge, iron, ironing board, hair dryer. Our room was cleaned each day.

But I was expecting a bit more...The 1 st room they booked me in was completely unleveled (referred as the Circus room by the staff!) !! Fruits rolled off the desk, I'm not kidding you! Asked for another room.. The staff was nice enough to help me out with a slightly better room. Fairly leveled this time but with a strong moldy smell...Oh well. I just needed a place to crash and put my bags for 3 days so it did work for me. However, if you're planning a nice resort-like holiday where you wish to spend time in the hotel, i would make sure you're booking one fo their ""highest rate"" room (don't use Hotwire/Priceline). Also, this hotel is a bit far from all the action that Waikiki has to offer, but the location doesn't offer a peaceful environment either...Therefore, I think that action seekers/quiet travelers will all be disappointed by this location.

I chose this property entirely due to the reviews here at Trip Advisor and the price. And let me say, Trip Advisor did not steer me wrong in the least. It was great.So, now, a bit more in depth:Check-InCheck in was at 3pm, and I arrived from the Airport at 3:15pm. Check in was completed quickly and easily, with very friendly service. They also provided two free bottles of water, which was a nice touch.The RoomI had a room with a king bedroom, and a normal city view. The view was nothing special, but I certainly didn't expect it to be, so no problem there. As for the room itself, the bed was cleanly made up, with lots of fairly soft pillows. I found it to be a comfy sleep. There was a 42"" LCD mounted on the wall, which was gorgeous. There was quite a bit of storage space available in the room, if needed. A nice touch I thought was the addition of a microwave and mini-fridge. So if you are on a very tight budget, you can definitely keep food costs down by eating in your room, if you so wish. They also provided plates and utensils in the room. The room was well lit, and the desk had the free wired internet connection. The bathroom was in good condition, with a good counter-top, though I found the lighting to be a little darker, especially when in the shower. There were 3 towels to be used when I arrived, and they were changed daily.ServiceRoom cleaning and service was done very well. No complaints, the sheets were changed, the towels replaced, and the shampoo/soaps constantly updated as necessary. They appeared to get my room cleaned from about 10-1pm.The BeachWhat many people come for, Waikiki Beach. The Aqua Palms is not directly on the beach, though it is across from the Hilton Hawaiian village. This is where personal preference comes into play. The HHV beach is about a 7-10 minute walk, which is great. However, I was not overly fond of their beach itself. The sand isn't overly soft, there is a lot of (not sharp, but not pleasant) rocks in the water, and there is very little in the way of waves or interest from the ocean itself. However, it is fairly quiet, peaceful, and would be a better area for kids I would think than further south. For myself though, I far more enjoyed the area further south, specifically at the Sheraton area where the Sheraton folks have reserved chairs near the beach wall walk. The sand was far softer, there were very few rocks in the water (though there are still patches), and there were waves to play in, if you enjoy that kind of thing. This part of Waikiki beach was a further 5-10 minute walk from HHV, and I made it several times since I found it much more enjoyable. There were no huge, rowdy crowds or anything like that, but then again, I was there in the offseason. Still, either spot has it's pluses and minuses, it will depend on what you like (calm and quiet, though lesser sand, or waves and soft sand, but busier).Location (Other than relative to the beach)If you don't mind a little walking, the Aqua Palms is in a pretty good location, but more in a jack of all trades, master of none kind of way. It's a 10-15 minutes walk to the main Waikiki area, due to the more northern location, but at the same time, that puts you closer to the Ala Moana Center /or Ward Center, if you wish to head up there. It's about a 10 minute walk to the Ala Moana Center, another 10 to get to Ward. There are several buses that stop nearby that can also shuttle you around as needed. They run frequently and can take you all over Honolulu as needed. There is food surrounding the hotel, including a diner next door that is 24 hours, so there are options nearby, though wandering may be in order to try different places each night. Check OutCheck out was at 12 noon. No problems at all, took all of 2 minutes and I was done. They provided me with free baggage storage while I toured around a bit on my last day. Very clean and smooth.Other AmenitiesBreakfast - Free cold breakfast is provided, but I didn't have a chance to partake in it. It runs from 7:30-9:30am and I was usually out the door by 7am, though reading other reviews, it doesn't sound like I missed much. Still, good to have, again especially if you are on a budget.Internet - The free in room high speed internet was fast and responsive, no down time noticed. There was also free wireless in the lobby. Finally, there is a business center (2 computers and a printer) in the lobby as well, and can be used for a cost. Parking - Did not use, but as others have mentioned, it's $18/day.Phone - Free local calls, used without issueAll in all, for what you pay, it is amazing the quality of hotel that you get. Rooms are likely 1/2 - 1/4 the price of HHV, and you get a huge array of services (and can use the restaurants in HHV if you so choose, though they are overpriced). I very happily saved my $75+ a day to make the extra 10 minute walk each way. Very highly recommended.","Sydney, Australia",42,5.0

We stayed for 2 weeks.Location: Best, away from Waikiki, close to Ala Moana and walk across the street to the beach. Love to just walk across the street to Hilton Village. Room: Best part of the room is the new TV, microwave and complimentary coffee, nice quality towels, big shower (without a door, the curtain is kind of gross), bed is not comfortable. As a matter of fact, the floor is not flat. I am not kidding. You can feel it when you walk around the room. So I put a bunch of phone books under the mattress to level my side of the bed. Very weird.Very quiet the whole time. Didn't hear any noise from neighbors or service people. Good sound proofing. I am glad we didn't upgrade our room because it was so hot out there, I didn't really feel like sitting on the balcony. There wasn't much of a view anyway. Most people use the balcony to dry their wet clothes. Not worth the money.Breakfast: Nice. Good enough to start the morning.Pool: Small. didn't look inviting. I have a much nicer pool at home. But someone (I think it was the maid) took my lipstick. I know that because I only brought one lipstick and I always left it in my bathroom vanity bag. I noticed that it was missing the day the crew came in to install the new plasma TV. I think it was the maid. We talked to the management. The maid denied. What could we do? Not worth ruining our trip over a lipstick, right?Overall I would stay here again because it is honestly the best 3 star hotel in Honolulu. They try everything to stay competitive.",USA,4,4.0

The staff is superb. The room was perfect (see my photos) and included a flat screen TV and a coffee maker and even though I booked a room with a ""partial view"", the view was great! The location is very good, although it is a bit of a walk to the ""Waikiki"" beach proper where all the ""action"" is, believe me, you don't want to be on that beach! Go instead, right across the street to the HIlton's beach which is gorgeous, large, and the evening I was there, offered lovely music to accompany the waves lapping the shore. (Note: ALL beaches in Hawaii are public, by the way, so you can walk through even the fanciest of hotels or as far as you want on a beach with your towel and snorkle and set up where you want. That's why if you're on a budget, you don't need to stay in a hotel ON the beach - just find one across the street from one that's on the beach and walk over!) The beach at the Hilton (again, across the street from the Aqua) also has some decent snorkling, although when the tide is out, watch out that you don't bark your skins on the reef.There is parking at $18/day - steep, but I don't have anything to compare it to and I needed a car.The 2 biggest problems with this hotel, which other reviews have mentioned, are:1) the breakfast. Paltry, unappetizing, and set up in what looks like an unused hotel room! There are 2 couches inside the room where the food is (with a flat screen TV where everyone was watching the Olympics when I was there), and then your alternate choice is to go outside by the pool (problem 2) and find either a chaise lounge to balance upon with your coffee and muffin, or try to nab one of the 2 stand up bar-type tables, or the one ""breakfast-style"" table. It makes for an awkward meal. No hot food available. Just bananas, apples, and muffins, with juice (NOT fresh), coffee (NOT fresh) and tea.2) the Pool: tiny! You can't believe it's their pool - you might think it's a goldfish pond! only good for dipping, not swimming.Other than those two BIG problems, if those issues aren't killers for you, the hotel is otherwise GREAT.",New York City,13,4.0

The most I like about the hotel is its location. Across the street from Hilton Village, you get the best location with much lower rates. It's only about 5-10 min walk to the Waikiki beach, and it is close to shopping, restaurants, and fast-food stores (if you cannot afford more expensive restaurants.) The hotel room also has a fridge and a microwave, so you can really save money on food if you want to. The plates and bowls also came handy. It also offers complementary continental breakfast, and free Internet access. There is also coin-laundry facility. You really get the most value out of it.

On the desk ,I believe Mark is his name, was great as they don't have to assist people in private rooms like I had but he did as 1. my luggage didn't arrive 2. my check in was a bit wierd and then on the last day the shuttle didn't arrive so he called them and then a cab.

Ala Moana Blvd is a very busy road ! I saw 40inch LG screens beng unloaded, location is 10-15mins walk t Ala Moana and 20 to center of Waikiki (best along beach cutting through HHV).

We brought others over from other hotels and condos up to six rooms and 2 nights at the Penthouse. Mark was again the important cog in the wheel. He went above and beyond by recommending restaurants, cheap transportation, less expensive sites including a certain flea market and actually secured pastries for my daughter wedding functions.

Additionally, the hotel ranked pretty good with most reviewers, I proceeded to contact Mrs. Doss directly to address what I thought might be potential issues for us. Mrs. Doss answered our questions in a very professional manner and super fast. That gave me the confidence to book the hotel at a good price. With that in mind, here are our grades...The grades:Hotel Manager (A+) - can't say enough good things about Mrs. Doss. If you have any questions, just contact her...she'll respond! :-) She was kind enough to upgrade us to a Diamond Head view (highly recommend) and ensured our concerns were addressed. Also surprised us with boxed chocolates and biscotti’s since we were celebrating our 10th anniversary. All staff acknowledged our anniversary which was very nice!Lobby (A) - it was clean, well appointed and inviting. Check in and out (A-) - fast and trouble free. On the downside, I requested a late checkout but was only granted an additional 30 minutes. Would have liked at least one hour since our flight that night was leaving VERY late (9PM)...instead was offered the room until 6 PM but for $99. However, I understand they're not required to grant anything so was grateful and it was not a big issue. Does not change my overall opinion.Staff (A) - friendly, helpful and always available.Elevators (A) - fast and always operative during our stay and clean. (I believe they are going to be replacing them soon)Pool (B-) - small, needed some minor detailing (missing tiles) but it was clean and inviting (important to note that most pools we saw were small as well).Parking Garage (B-) - small but manageable (actually saw a smaller garage at IHOP restaurant that one deserves an F)Rooms (A-) Clean, well appointed, VERY comfortable beds, nice 42"" LCD TV, nice carpet although a bit worn, small bathroom but nice granite countertops, full tub but paint was peeling. Nice balcony (lanai) and nice fridge and microwave although the microwave did smell like burned food. Overall, better than expected.Cleaning Staff (A) - very friendly, always left our room very clean and respected our stuff (of course used safe for valuables) No issues here at all. Continental Breakfast (B-) would have scored better if not for the coffee which IMHO was plain bad. However, the muffins are great, plenty of fresh fruit and sweet rolls, as well as Orange Juice and either Pineapple or Guava juice. Great way to start day and save some money of breakfast.Amenities (A+) - free internet, free safe, continental breakfast. Perfect for our needs. Never had any issues with internet...Outside Noise (A) - really a non-issue for us, we were up in the 11th floor facing Ala Moana Blvd and it was fine, at night we closed the glass door and did not hear any unwanted noise. I did however, encountered a noise issue on two days, once on a Saturday at 7:45 AM which sounded like drilling coming from above, called Guest Services and issue was not resolved until 10 AM or so. Can't deny that it was annoying but we just dealt with it...on a Monday, it appears that the room next door to us was undergoing a possible LCD TV installation since there was noise coming from the wall near the location of our TV however, it was after 8 AM on a weekday so you'd expect any work to be done those hours and I was made aware of the project so it was not really a big surprise for us and again, we just got up enjoyed breakfast and then onto to our daily routine :-)Cannot grade the SPA and Fitness Room since we did not use either.The Aqua Palms is a good hotel in a good location with great staff. The rooms are well appointed and clean. We took advantage of a free night special and we feel we got a lot for our hard earned money. Great value.

Very pleased with excellent service and truly boutique feel of the Aqua Palms, 1850 Ala Moana. I would say this boutique hotel gives the larger chain a run for its money. AP is near a fantastic ""local"" breakfast spot where just as many locals as tourists wait for as long as it takes to eat there -- and it is well worth the wait. Just take a 3 minute walk east and you'll find it. You'll also find the prices very affordable.Also, Roy's is located street level of the AP and is a terrific place to dine, inside for more formal or outside for a casual romantic, island experience. On the next block, practically next door, is another coffee deli and cafe, however, it serves up a full menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Across the street is a Thai restaurant that I recommend. If you want a serve yourself, all you can eat buffet style restaurant, I recommend Todai's, upstairs, street access, from the Thai restaurant.After saying all this, I want to reiterate the Aqua Palms is clean with recently refurbished rooms. That is, the one I stayed in on the 11th floor was quite nice and quiet with doors shut. A small balcony was just that, small, but room enough for a small table and two chairs. Partial city view was that of a parking lot and run down apartments in the forefront and taller buildings in the background. This was okay since I didn't spend a whole lot of time on the balcony as I was out and about. Free daily Continental breakfast is on 2nd floor, next to outdoor pool with a nice view of street and shops below. For the very affordable price, less than $90 per night total, comfortable, clean and quiet room(s), great location, friendly, efficient staff, I highly recommend the Aqua Palms and Spa!KS, Saint Charles, IL","Kewadin, Michigan",2,5.0

Hotels in Honolulu, particularly Waikiki Beach, can be pricey, so we booked a room after reading some Trip Advisor reviews. The best mainland comparison to this hotel would be The Hampton Inn chain. This hotel was more upscale than, say, Motel 6 or Red Roof Inn, but it wasn't a Hilton. It basically lived up to our expectations. We got a nice room for a reasonable price and it was in a good location. There is a continental breakfast included with the cost of the room, although the food selections were somewhat paltry. There was a bowl of apples, oranges, and bananas and two plates of muffins. We had a nice lanai included with our room, but be aware that there is currently construction going on both on Ala Moana Blvd., on which the hotel is located, and across the way at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The hotel pool is tiny, but you are located a very short walk from the beach. The elevators need some work. They are slow and small and the doors close very quickly. The bathroom in the room was very small. There was some ""gunk"" on the headboard of our bed, which kind of grossed me out. It was hot in the hallways, but we saw a sign posted in the elevators that the hotel is working on that issue. We got very good massages for a very reasonable price ($65 for a one hour massage) in the ""spa."" I put spa in quotes since it is just a hotel room with two massage tables, so don't expect a fancy atmosphere. Overall, a good value, a clean, comfortable room, but it's not the Ritz. It pretty much delivers what it says it will, and not a bit more.","Aurora, Illinois",5,4.0

I booked this hotel based on generally good ratings on Tripadvisor. Overall, for a base cost of $90.00 per night (AARP or AAA rate on the hotel's website), the hotel was a good deal for Honolulu. Add $18.00 per day for secure parking under the hotel (still a good deal for Honolulu). I liked the parking, and didn't mind paying, in order to have a car available. Unless you plan on staying/walking around only in crowded, hectic Waikiki (and you really shouldn't), a car is a good investment on the Island.The room was really clean, with a unique, colorful Island decor. Not fancy, but it made me smile. The pillow top bed was made for getting a good night's sleep - very nice. I also thought my room, at the end of a hall (no balcony/lanai, though many rooms have them) was quiet; I heard nothing that kept me awake from any direction. One welcome source of music from outside my room was the chirping of a friendly mynah bird that came back often during my stay, perching on the adjacent balcony (did I mention that I didn't have a balcony? --- and wished I did! --- next time).I was told on booking that with an AARP rate, I was eligible for an upgrade, based on availability. When I arrived at the hotel, the clerk seemed surprised to hear about this (I had it in writing, as part of my reservation confirmation). She told me no upgrade was available, unfortunately. A box of macadamia candy was given to soothe my distress. Ah, well. Overall, the hotel was a good deal for the price, a tradeoff for being on or closer to the beach. I felt safe and welcomed generally by the hotel staff. If you want a fancy pool or other facilities, be prepared to spend more money...quite a bit more, probably. If you want a clean, quiet place to sleep in between exploring the amazing sights, smells, and sounds of Oahu, this should more than fit the bill.","Austin, Texas",38,4.0

We had a room with the recently upgraded bed/bedding and flat-screen television. This is added to the walkout lanai, free in-room internet (wired), refrigerator, and microwave. All of the staff we encountered were friendly to us during our stay; and the manager, Ms. Kahea Doss, personally hosted a get-together by the pool on Wednesday afternoon. She also uses the reviews on this site as a tool to improve her hotel. The hotel is directly across Ala Moana Blvd. from Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV) and the adjacent Hale Koa Military Resort, which share one of the better stretches of beach in Waikiki. The walk from the hotel to the beach is about 5 minutes, and there are several accesses to the beach through HHV. Military connected visitors can also use many of the Hale Koa facilities and parking garage ($7 daily). Aqua Palms and Spa is also within easy walking distance (about 5 minutes in the other direction) to the Ala Wai Marina, Ala Moana Beach Park, and Ala Moana Shopping Center. These are locations where locals and visitors both go, and present a more realistic view of Honolulu life than does touristy Waikiki.The downsides we found are generally related to Honolulu being a big city. The traffic is heavy on Ala Moana Blvd., and there is presently construction going on at HHV and on the utilities that run along the center of Ala Moana Blvd.. Both of these projects look like the noisy phases should be completed soon. The construction noise doesn’t get started until about 8:00 AM through about 5:00 PM, but late/light sleepers should consider asking for a room on the Ewa-side of Aqua Palms and Spa. Also, as it is in most of Waikiki, the parking at the hotel is tight and expensive ($18 daily).","Shell Island, Florida",2,4.0

We had a room next to the end room, so the room was a little small, but it was fine for what we wanted. (We don't stay in the room much.)The room had a refrigerator (not the cube size, but the bigger one - 3 foot tall?), microwave, dishes, utensils (no dishsoap though), coffeemaker, iron, TV /DVD and Internet hookup. There were also 2 computers in the lobby business center (didn't try them). Air conditioning worked great. The room was clean and nicely appointed. Local calls are free and the number on the phone goes direct to the room and not through a switchboard. Desk area and table were a little close to the bed, but I think that was just our room. The shower was a little cramped (narrow), but had good water pressure, and nice toiletries. The laundry facilities were fine, but there wasn't any place to sit while you wait for the laundry and it frequently was busy. It is a spa, and if you book the day you arrive you can usually get a discount on the spa treatments (mostly massage and facials).The staff were great when I checked in - friendly and helpful. The lobby has a sitting area and some small tables. Also a tour desk that will help you arrange tours and get around. Free newspaper in the lobby. There were at least 2 pool areas, but we didn't use them. They also have a breakfast in the morning, but we didn't try that either. The elevators can be slow (3 elevators) and there's no real indicator on the floors that tell what floor the elevator is currently on (except in the lobby). There's an ATM in the lobby too. My main complaint was the parking and driveway. Due to the location, there's not really any area to pull up into when you arrive. You basically pullup onto the sidewalk (there's actually a pseudo ramp to drive onto/off of the sidewalk). The parking lot is on the first few floors within the building and the rooms are then higher up. This means the ramp into the parking lot is a little steep and the ramps/turns going from one parking level to the next are tight. We were renting a PT Cruiser and the turns were touchy. If a large car parked close to the ramp, we had to stop backup and re-angle the car to make the turn to the next level. This happened to several of the guests, not just us. The room key activates the gate into the parking structure and it was no problem, just a little steep. Parking is $18/day (ick)On the other hand, the bus stop is literally a few steps from the hotel (which also means you dodge the buses and pedestrians when driving into/out of the parking lot/building). If you don't need a car, skip it! The location was great. Right across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village at the edge of Waikiki. Its a couple blocks from Ala Moana shopping center too. So if you don't have a car and don't mind walking, its great. Its at a fairly busy intersection, but the noise wasn't bad. There's a bunch of smaller and local restaurants and some fast food places. Not many chain restaurants until you get about 2-3 blocks out (if that's your thing). Local coffee shop right on the corner was fine and filled with local characters. The crowd was mostly families and young couples. A couple of families that were in town for a soccer tournament and some Euro-travelers. We had the town view (view of other hotel buildings) but the other buildings were far enough away that you didn't feel like people were looking in.I was very satisfied with our experience. I would stay here again. My ""complaints"" are mostly just heads-up for those that rent a car.","Sacramento, CA",53,4.0

We had a wonderful view of both Diamond Head and the Pacific Ocean. Our room was very clean and included a mini-fridge, micro-wave, coffee maker, and in-room safe. We were only there for 3 nights, so we were not able to go to the pool or use the other spa amenities We could, however, see the pool from our lanai and it looked great. There was also a complimentary continental breakfast served poolside every morning. The hotel is within walking distance to the beach and park. It is also across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village, so getting to all tour busses was fast and easy. Even though it is located on busy Ala Moana Blvd, we never heard traffic noise in our room unless we had the door to the lanai open.

Of course, if you're looking to spend about a *third* of the cost of a Hilton room, and you don't mind walking all of two minutes to get to the beach, the Aqua Palms offers about the best value in Waikiki.I think that's why this hotel has been so favorably reviewed by most of my fellow travellers. The Aqua Palms doesn't pretend to be the fanciest hotel in Honolulu. What it does is promise a decent room for a decent price, and it delivers on that promise. We paid $85 a night for four nights, and got exactly what we wanted -- a clean, comfortable, decent room.I asked the front desk, and the hotel itself was purchased by Aqua just over two years ago. It appeared to me that they were doing their updates and renovations in stages. In our room, the bathroom looked to be 100% brand new -- shower, toilet, sink, etc. all appeared to have been just recently installed. Likewise, the appliances (microwave, mini-fridge) looked quite new. The rest of the room was more dated. The sheets, blankets, and bedspread seemed new, but the rest of the sleeping area was decades old. So, the furniture and bed itself and especially the decor all were in acceptable condition, but were more than a little tired looking. No idea if the bathrooms were their first stage of renovations and the sleeping area the next stage planned, but I'd speculate so.The location was just perfect for us, toward the northwest end of Waikiki Beach. From the hotel's lobby, we could turn right to walk to the Ala Moana shopping center, with 250 stores and restaurants. Or we could turn left and head toward the upscale shops or the International Market with their fun open air shops and booths. Or we could head straight across the street to the beach to relax. And when we got tired of Honolulu, we rented a car from the local rental place just nextdoor (Paradise rentals) and spent a day driving around Oahu.The front desk staff was quite friendly and incredibly helpful, suggesting fun activities and providing useful information about getting around town.So, bottom line -- could we have had a fancier room?

Location was fine for us as we were without a car - walking to the beach, the Ala Moana Shopping Centre, local restaurants was easy. Also being at the western end of Waikiki made it a quicker journey each way to the airport.We were glad to use the baggage storage while our room was being made ready and found the service was good. Our internet special offered a free upgrade and chocolates - the chocolates we got only after reminding them, and the 'upgrade' they appeared to have forgotten about, as what we were eventually offered after reminding the staff was not really an upgrade at all.The room size was fine for two people, we had a room facing the street with an 'around the corner' small view of the sea. It was clean and comfortable, with internet access. The air conditioning was quite old and noisy. The kitchenette facilities were handy. Some parts of the room (eg ceilings, walls) looked like they were in the process of being re-painted, as there were visible touch up points here and there, ready for the final coat of paint. This gave the room a depressing feel.We did not partake of breakfast as it was scheduled too late for us - and I'd recommend that with the number of early morning departures for Australia now occurring from Honolulu, perhaps the Aqua Palms could accommodate these travellers a little better.These are not major issues though.

Sergio and Mark were the best!! We knew the room would not be ready until 3 - so do not sit around the lobby waiting for it as we saw others doing. Mark took all of our luggage to a holding area, gave me a receipt, complimentary bottled water and we were off to hike Diamond Head. I felt totally comfortable leaving all of our possesions with Mark. I only took a fanny pack for the day (not wanting to leave anything in the car).When we returned around 3:30, all of our luggage had been delivered to our room. After reading some of the reviews about the small rooms, I worried, however, coming off a cruise ship, any room would seem huge. I worried for nothing, because our room was huge. Yes, the elevators are old and slow, and the hallway scared me a little. It looked worn and was hot. The room, however, was modern and immaculate. Our room, #822, provided a good view of Diamond Head and Ft. Derussey Park and the Hilton. Construction is going on, but it never bothered us. The view is not the best though. I think this can be said for most all of Waikiki - unless you have a true ocean front hotel.We had no noise issues. Perhaps being on a higher floor helps with this. Some of the rooms are smaller and do not have walk -out balconys. It is best to upgrade to avoid that situation. The bed was extremely comfortable, with excellent linens, towels, bath ammenities and bathrobes. ( I am very picky when it comes to bathrooms and beds) The kitchen area was spotless but we didn't use it. We also did not use the pool, fitness center, nor did we take advantage of the breakfast and cocktail party. We watched it from our balcony. We did not have a single problem and as such, we had no further communication with the staff until check out. Housekeeping was excellent. One day I was ill, and came back to the room early and slept all day. When you are sick, it is the little things that matter, and again, I cannot say enough good about the Aqua Palms.We never planned on using the hotel as a resort and that is why it was perfect and at a perfect price. I did use the laundry room and was pleased to get some clothes cleaned after the cruise. It is a little strange room, but it served it's purpose. We got a rate under $80 per night through Book It.com. That rate only lasted one week, but you should go for a low rate - call the hotel. The parking was tight, but we had a large car and if you go up a few floors in the garage the spaces open up. To us, the location was perfect. We ate at the restaurant on the corner and again, it was perfect for our needs and very budget minded. I could eat their pancakes with coconut syrup all day! There is also a MacDonalds and a Subway around the corner towards the Ala Moana Mall. We walked over to the Hilton every night and blended in as if we were reaping all the benefits of staying there, without paying the resort prices. This is what made the location truly perfect for us!! The Hilton has the best stretch of beach in Waikiki and it is right there for the Aqua guests to use. We walked down to the Royal Hawaiian for Happy Hour and beachfront entertainment. It was an easy stroll for us to walk all of Waikiki and we are 50-60 in age.We drove to Hanauma Bay for snorkling and drove around the island. Check out was a breeze, done the night before an early flight. If we had stayed longer, I probably would only have rented the car for two days. My only regret was not booking an entire week at the Aqua Palms to enjoy Hawaii longer. Every aspect of our Hawaiian vacation was without a hitch. I realize we were lucky and others can have problems. For a more precise review, scroll down to amoose99. I think that says it all.Mahalo.","Wellington, Florida",150,5.0

Because we booked in a hurry for a last-minute trip, we regretfully didn't check out the reviews ahead of time. However, I am extremely surprised by the reviews I'm reading today -- most were positive, yet I just came back yesterday and I find it hard to believe we were all staying in the same hotel. I thought that the room was too small for two, only partially renovated, awkward decor -- furnishings were old and worn -- the bureau was placed in an awkward spot and not easy to access. The pictures on the wall were crooked and I tried to straighten them out, but they were adhered to the wall -- very strange. The television is old -- no flat LCDs here. It was attached to the wall with a mounting bracket, much like you'd find in a hospital room. The carpeting throughout the hallways must be from the previous property owners -- it's old, worn and dated. Often there were garbage bags sitting in the hallways for a good part of the day -- every day. Elevators were slow. No restaurant or lounge on the premises, so we spent a lot of time across the way at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and in Waikiki. The pool is tiny, but served the purpose the 2 hours I spent by it. Fitness room has about 4 or 5 machines crowded into a small room. The laundry room on the parking lot level was a little creepy, especially at night. Only two ice machines, also located in the parking lot, not on any of the guest room floors!! The Aqua Hotel Website is misleading and they definitely did a good job of making the hotel look and sound much better than it really is. I would no more call this a spa or resort than I would a Motel 6. On a positive note, the room was clean, the bed was comfy, the spa robes were new and beautiful, and the staff were friendly and acommodating. If you're on a budget and don't mind not being next to, or in our case, not even seeing the beach from the room, then The Aqua Palms may work for you.",San Francisco,1,2.0

The ""spa"" was a room on the 2nd floor, and the pool was about the size of a small kiddie pool. The nice thing about our room was that it was clean. It served the purpose we needed it for - a clean place to stay for the few night we were in Oahu. That was about the extent of it though. It was so odd, because the room was sloping - we've never seen this in any hotel. We noticed it in the hallway too, which was sloping to one side. It was even odder seeing our bed posted on a piece of a wooden block, in order to even it out due to the sloping room. Very strange indeed!",irene08,2,2.0

Second time was for a week in a much larger room (at same price) and everything was just fine with the room. Only problems seem to be that the breakfast, while fine for a continental breakfast, had such long lines that several times I had to give up waiting since I had to get to work. Also it really doesn't start early enough for a business traveler, although probably fine for vacationer. Room cleaning was overall ok, although sometimes they forget to leave certain key items. But they'll bring them if you call. Parking at $18 is a rip-off, but since the hotel rate is good for what you get, call it even.

Both times the room was clean, had all the expected facilities, and perfectly met my needs.Both stays, I booked the cheapest room rate. These are for rooms located on the lower floors facing west (towards Honolulu, or Ewa direction) on the ""back"" side of the hotel (facing away from the road). From these levels you don't get much of a view, except across parking lots and into other hotels. However the lower guest floors are quite a few storeys about ground level because their are multiple parking levels between lobby level and the first guest level (level 3). So even on level three (my first room) you are up a little way.The back side of the hotel, since it faces away from the quite busy road, is likely to be quieter than the front side (Diamond head side). However you do hear some vehicle noise on the back side. Nothing particularly loud to worry about, however.The rooms themselves are quite small but perfectly adequate with a desk, table and several chairs. The rooms were also both very clean. Bathrooms are small but aqeduate. On my second stay I noticed a bit of noise from another room coming in through the ventilation grill in the bathroom (hearable only from within the bathroom). You get an in-room safe and free Internet (wired). Location is good provided you don't want to be right in the heart of Waikiki. It is located about half-way between central Waikiki and the large Ala Moana shopping center. You can walk to both from the hotel, or take buses or trolleys either way. The location is a busy road for both cars and pedestrians, and there is no problem walking around outside the hotel late at night. Lots of restaurants in the immediate vicinity, or walk to the food court at Ala Moana, or to the expensive restaurants in Waikiki such as Ocean House or Roy's. The beach is a couple of minute's walk away through the large Hilton Hawaiian Village resort area.Parking is expensive, at $18 per day (up quite a bit from last year). The parking area is quite tight but is fine for any normal sized car (I am not sure I'd recommend trucks or SUVs). It is quite quick and easy (once you get the hang of the one-way roads) to get from this location to the H-1 freeway or downtown Honolulu. However when you first arrive it is easy to miss the entrance to the hotel and you have to circle around (since you cannot enter the hotel from the other direction on Ala Moana Blvd). Breakfast is a simple continental style, with danishes or muffins (seems to vary by the day), fruit, juice and coffee. It is available just off the pool area (last year it was off the lobby which was too crowded). The pool is quite small, located on the Diamond head side about three levels about the road.My only complaint this time was that I paid an upfront room rate of about $120. It later went down to under $90 a night. Since I'd paid up front I couldn't rebook without loosing money. You might want to stick to a refundable rate or wait for the price to drop below $100/night before prepaying. I will not be inclined to pay above $100/night next time. These prices don't include the parking fee.Overall a perfectly reasonable hotel for the money (better if you get the sub-$100 rate) and a good location. Remember to add $18/night to the room rate if you plan to have a car. I'd absolutely come back here for a third time.","Seattle, Washington",49,4.0

The king bed was very comfortable. It's not a Westin bed, but it was still nice. The A/C worked very well. Nice balcony with a pretty city view and partial view of Diamond Head. Room also came with a pull out sofa bed. Very cute decor. The TV is a bit outdated. Nice size mini fridge. Kitchenette also came with dishes and utencils.LOCATION:This hotel is located on the far end of Waikiki. It's far from the center of Waikiki where all of the action is. It's a nice walk away from everything else. It's close to the beach, a nice 8 - 10 min walk. I've stayed in Waikiki several times and the location wasn't optimal. There is an ABC store around the corner and down the street off the main strip is an internet cafe. You're basically next door to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. When you drive up to the hotel, it's a bit tricky because the driveway is actually on the sidewalk. For first time visitors, I recommend staying somewhere more central - Hotel Aqua Renew (looks VERY nice and perfect location, right by the beach). FOOD:Decent continental breakfast served every morning by the pool. Get there early. Pastries, fruit and juices. The cafe next door is very GOOD, they serve large portions and the service is very fast. We ate there each morning. Breakfast was our favorite meal there.Most of the staff was very nice and friendly, very helpful and always greeted you. Except for Thomas. Never smiled and was quite cold. Was not friendly at all.

Ignore the Tripavisor #6 out of how many hotels in Honolulu inflated rating....Definitely not a #6 hotel. Also, ignore any 4 star reviews...its not a 4 star hotel....it is a dead on 3 star hotel. I am paying $18/day parking in a tiny garage...I asked for an upgrade to a bigger room and got denied and they want to charge $25 per night more and since i am here with a 2 year old, theres no way in hell that i could stay in the same tiny room for the next 5 days so I will now be paying more for the room. I asked the lady if I pay for the upgrade for 3 nights and if they can give me the two nights for free as a courtesy(which mind you that other hotels have done this for me for no charge at other hotels), they would not. Having checked out other hotels since I've been here, I am now convinced that they sucker you into the cheap small rooms and they figure that you'll want to upgrade to a bigger room. I am also convinced that since i'll be paying for more for the hotel, I probably have should picked another bigger, better hotel. The small room is fine for one person, but not for any one person more! The staff is ok, they give you the ""smiling [--]"", you know the one where they just constantly smile the whole time they talk to you but never really do anything for you that you ask but that is nothing out of the ordinary.

I did a ton of research and read a lot of reviews before booking this hotel. It was an amazing deal for $110/ night (including tax) through bookit.com. My overall thought is that it was a good bargain. I don't know if it should be rated #7 out of 85 hotels in Honolulu, though.I had requested a room with a king bed and when we arrived in our room, it had two queens (looked like fulls). i called the front desk and they told us that they couldn't move us until the next morning, which we were okay with. we moved into our room the next morning and to my husband's disappointment, we no longer had a lanai. instead, we opened up the sliding door to a tiny strip of concrete. we didn't want to switch rooms again so we stayed put. our room faced ala moan blvd. and all the construction but it didn't bother us too bad. The room was clean, and it's nice to have a fridge and microwave. The tv is small but adequate. What bothered me the most was the bed. The sheets were too small for the king bed and bare mattress was often exposed. The sheets are a bit threadbare and the bed had a coverelet, which always gives me the heebies because I doubt they're regularly washed.The bathroom was clean and had nice papaya/pineapple scented products. The tub is standard-sized but not really the kind you'd want to soak in. It had a slip-resistant mat on the bottom.The front desk was very nice, and we often checked out beach towels, boogie boards, etc.. It's about a leisurely 10 minute walk to the beach through Hilton Hawaiian Village. It's about a 30 minute walk to the center of Waikiki Beach.My husband and I had a car the entire week which was super convenient, though it cost $18/day to park it. Since the hotel is located on the west end of Waikiki, it's nice to have a car.Overall, I would probably come here again because of the price. It's a pretty good deal and it's clean.The hotel staff was nice, but in my experience, Hawaiian people as a whole are nice and helpful.If you're used to fancier hotels, I'd recommend you go somewhere else.

The reservations and checkin staff were very helpful and pleasant. The location is right on a busy street, but it's across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village (they had fireworks at about 8pm on Friday night), a 15 minute walk to the Ala Moana shopping mall, and a 15 minute walk to the beach, shopping, and restaurants - not a bad location to be in. There's a bus stop 10 steps from the front door if you want to use public transportation to Pearl Harbor (about an hour on line 20, can also use 42) - ask how much a shuttle would be though.The room: The furniture is positively shabby and the bathroom is small. There is awkward, wasted space in the entry way. I did appreciate that there was a mini-fridge and microwave. The bed was terrible - both of our backs hurt the next day. I wasn't entirely sure if the sheets were clean because I found hairs on the pillows. The sheets didn't stay tucked in when we slept. I saw in a previous review that the mgmt plans to renovate the beds - make sure they've done this before you stay!It's nice that they offer the free breakfast, but you get what you pay for. It's just juice, coffee, fruit, and cheap pastries. I would suggest tacking on an extra buck to the rate and offering some milk, cereal, and bagels/toast.The ATM in the lobby charges $2.50.They use Ilima shuttle service to/from the airport - ask for the number when you make your reservation. It was $10 per person and it takes about a half hour.On Wednesdays they have a ""manager's reception"". Basically that's a free punch drink and a bowl of chex mix.When I made my reservation, I was under the impression I was getting a specific rate per night. When we checked out, my rate on one night was higher - I had no way of checking if this was the right rate or not, so I hope I didn't get cheated.Except for the back-breaking bed and the shabbiness of the room, I was ok with this place for the money.

At an average of $129 per night in Waikiki, I expected a clean room at a great location and Aqua Palm was more than what I expected. The room was very clean and it came with plenty of great necessities and features: coffeemaker, fridge, microwave, iron/ironing board, hairdryer, cable tv, mango/papaya toiletries, FREE HI-SPEED INTERNET, balcony, and comfy bed.  All the staff was very nice and they were able to answer any questions that I had for them. The breakfast consisted of juice, coffee, fruits, and a bit of pastry. But there's so much variety of food available in Honolulu that I don't know why anyone would be eating at the hotel.  If you go out the hotel, turn right, and cross the little bridge, you'll see the Ala Moana Shopping Center which has a great food court that has a massive variety of different kinds of food. They also have a Japanese supermarket, Shirokiya, on the 3rd floor, which has some authentic cooked Japanese food also. If you go across the street and through the Hilton Hawaiian Village, you'll be at Waikiki beach. If you make a left out of the hotel, there's Singha Thai Restaurant and Todai, then you make a right on Kalakua, there's loads shops that open late, nightlife, people walking around, lots of things to see. Great atmosphere. Some reviews said the elevators were slow. The elevators work fine and they aren't slow if no one is using it. Of course, it would take a while if people are using it and it has to stop on every floor. As for street noise, it's at a minimal when you close the glass door to the balcony. I'm sure it's a lot quieter than if you stay on the busy street or right on Waikiki beach. Also, there is a bus stop to the right of the hotel. Though the bus can pretty much take you anywhere in the island, it takes a while to get to the destination and it could get crowded in the bus sometimes. It may be faster to rent a car. The parking in Aqua Palms is a bit tight and the scariest part is going up the steep ramp in the parking deck.

The staff are very friendly, but don't expect a relaxing stay in paradise. While close to the beach, the hotel is located on a very busy and unpleasant stretch of Ala Moana, so most of the rooms (and the pool area) are very noisy. A few other pointers about this hotel:The small lobby has a very strong mildew smell.Breakfast is served in a converted hotel room adjacent to the small pool - a very odd room, where they serve poor quality packaged food and bad coffee (no milk or cream, just packets of creamer).The elevators and corridors are shabby and run down.The rooms are well sized, but oddly furnished, and the sofa in our room was not clean.The very hard king sized bed was made up with sheets that did not fit - they must have been queen sheets, so the edge of the bed was exposed.While we got new towels every day, and the trash was emptied, the bed was not made on typical days.If all you care about is an affordable place to stay, this might work, but don't expect it to be a relaxing place where you would want to spend any time, or get a good night's sleep.","San Francisco, CA",1,1.0

The hotel is only about two blocks from the beach and is right on one of the main roads making it easy to use public transportation.We stayed in a city view room. The view was quite nice, especially at night. We looked out at the grounds of the Hilton, which is quite spectacular. One word of warning. A lanai is not always much of a lanai and whether you get one or not depends entirely on availability. It does not reduce your rate if you do not get one. In our case we had patio doors that opened up to about 10 inches of concrete. Some rooms appeared to have lanai's large enough to sit on. We booked using their website and the photos are misleading on this point making it appear that these larger lanais are what you will get. To be fair, when we expressed our concern to management they compensated us.The hotel serves a continental breakfast in the morning which was average. The pool is quite small but we did our swimming at the beach anyway. The view from the pool area is quite nice and that is where breakfast is served. The hotel has a spa but we did not make use of the services. The staff were extremely friendly and they were very helpful about storing our baggage both on the day we arrived and departed. This made it possible for us to use those days to the fullest instead of working around check-in/out times.We had a couple of odd housekeeping issues. When we arrived our mini fridge had not been cleaned out. Towel service replaced the towels but left the old ones on the floor. In both cases, management was quick to deal with our concerns. The rooms are a reasonable size and felt clean.

The bathroom had a very small tub but it was clean and tastefully decorated with granite countertops and tile floors. Other reviews have complained about the noise but it is not the hotel that is noisy but simply the fact that it is located in a major city on a major road so you have street noise along with constant construction noise. Yes you hear the garbage trucks at 6am but I would venture to say you also hear the garbage trucks in your own hometown. If you want a tranquil beach holiday, Honolulu and Waikiki beach is not the right place...spend time on the windward side of Oahu and you will find a more peaceful environment; turquoise blue water with squeaky white sand without the wall to wall crowds of waikiki. Or of course, the other islands are much less developed than Oahu.

However, the room renovations are overrated. Baths were brought up to 3-star standards with granite (or a reasonable facsimile) - but if you want a real tub, you won't find it. It's barely four feet long. Ownership should have done the right thing and simply created a large shower surround rather than stick with the old and dated tubs.High speed internet access is wired-only in guest rooms, and I was lucky to have brought my own cable, as the hotel's had a broken pin and wouldn't connect. After a talk with a bored guest services agent, the engineer replaced the cable, which promptly wouldn't connect at all, even though my cable worked fine. This was later explained by guest services as a problem with the internet provider - the problem was most certainly the hotel choosing the wrong LAN cables to place in the rooms.My king-bed room was small but not tiny. There are three chairs crammed in the room, none of them comfortable. No matter, as even if you had a reasonable chair to relax in, you'd have to crane your neck skyward to view the ""flat screen"" TV that's mounted high on the wall. In the 21st Century, it really should be illegal to refer to ""flat screen"" TV's as tube-style; almost everyone these days associates ""flat screen"" with ""flat panel."" The Aqua Palms' tube style TVs are also small, perhaps 20"".Also small is the pool area, though it appears clean and sunny in the afternoons.Though some hard goods are truly renovated in the rooms, such as draperies and countertops, the furniture appears worn and dated. Hallways are dark, with dirty carpet.The value proposition rests primarily on the room rate. At $84 I can be forgiving of many flaws, so I gave the property three out of five.

I went down to the desk to advise them there had been a mistake, and was simply told that if we wanted a twin room we would have to bring our luggage back down to reception and wait until after 3pm until a twin room was available. I reminded the man on reception that I had booked and paid for the previous night's accommodation and asked if we could at least have another room to use until 3pm so we could shower and change (we were in no state to go sightseeing or even shopping and had nowhere to change even to go for a swim). The rude man on reception said we couldn't have any room until after 3pm. I was completely taken aback and he didn't care that I had already paid for a room for the previous night. He didn't even apologise. I was suprised at this treatment as I have never had a bad experience like this in Hawaii and have been there many times for holidays.We took our suitcases and left and booked in to the Ohana Waikiki West on Kuhio Ave. This hotel is fantastic. Very well run, clean and friendly. We were given a large room on a high floor with a kitchenette and views. We were also given $15/day in vouchers to use at the Food Pantry supermarket next door plus our keycard allowed us free travel on the Pink Trolley. It was a fantastic deal for around the same price as the Aqua Palms, there is no comparison between these hotels. Ohana West is a large hotel with a great pool and facilities and in a great location. Aqua Palms is in a bad location, has the smallest pool you've ever seen, the lifts were terrible and the man on reception I had to deal with was rude and unapologetic.I had a wonderful holiday in Hawaii and will return again next year, but I will never again book into an Aqua hotel and won't be recommending them to friends.","Gold Coast, Australia",18,1.0

The gentleman at the front desk was very nice but didn't really offer a lot in the way of information when asked. The parking garage at this hotel is a nightmare if you have anything less than a compact car. At every turn in the garage we had to back up in order to make the turn. The room we checked into was possibly one of the smallest hotel rooms I've ever seen. There were 2 double beds and there literally was just enough space between the chest of drawers in the room and the beds to get a suitcase through. The room was clean but we had someone knock on our door twice asking if we were sure we had the correct room. Evidently the hotel gave this couple keys to rooms that were already occuped several times. The continental breakfast was o.k. but it's in a strange location. It's located on the second floor in what looked like a former hotel room and it next to the pool. Not a lot of room to sit but I can't really complain when it's juice, coffee, and muffins. Overall, the stay was o.k. but I'm not sure I'd stay at this hotel fo a longer period of time. Maybe because we were only there one night we got one of the smaller rooms.",,46,3.0

The guy working at the front desk seemed to have an attitude and only told me that the room was not ready. I asked him when it would be and he said it would be ready by 3pm. (Check-in time was 3pm so I was fine with that - I just didn't like his service attitude) We decided to wait the half hour. At 3pm, we checked with the front desk (new people were staffing the desk) and were again told that our room wasn't ready and that it would be about 10 mins. We waited near the front desk for 15 mins and decided to check again. Our room was ready this time...it would have been nice if they would have let us know (as we were standing in the lobby area). No apologies were given for the delay. On to our room...The room itself (room 1123) was quite small. The bed linens (sheets and blanket) seemed to be made of pretty cheap materials. The TV was small and set in the upper corner of the room. The bathroom was also small and the shower was tiny (and very dark).The hallway carpets throughout the hotel needed cleaning.Very disappointed overall.

We also didn't use the spa, but there was someone available in the lobby to book appointments. I had thought there was a continental breakfast available, but apparently it is located on the second floor, and only after 7am.

The local bus & tours stops directly outside the hotel or in the Hilton Hawaiian Village located directly across the street from the Aqua Palms&Spa. I also recommend purchasing a 3 or 5 day ""Go Oahu"" card prior to your visit. this card gives you great discounts on local tours. Hilton Hawaiian Village has an exciting fireworks display on friday nites for all visitors to enjoy. Book a sunset dinner at ""Dukes Bar/Restaurant"" in the Outrigger Resort Waikiki. Food is fab& you can buy an authentic flower lei for $5 made on the premises by a wonderful Hawaiian family. Make sure to attend a local Luau, we went to ""Germaines Luau"" food & entertainment were terrific, our tour guide ""Reilly"" provided great tunes& jokes..And be sure to book a dinner at Kobe's Japanese steakhouse, directly across from the hotel, great food & entertainment by the chef. And if you're craving a great hamburger, try ""Cheese Burger Waikiki, 1945 Kalakaua Ave. just a few blocks from the hotel.

We stayed in two twin-bedded rooms (queen size beds) with adequate, well-stocked bathrooms and useful amenities such as a full-sized fridge, complimentary broadband access and balconies with great views. The rooms were clean and room servicing was prompt and meticulous. Mark and colleagues on the front desk could not have been more helpful: chasing down luggage misdirected by the airline; looking out for replacement fishing tackle mailed to the hotel; and arranging to look after those items we didn't want to take with us to Christmas Island.Amenities, including the excellent beach and good restaurants, are only a short walk away. The hotel itself only provides a basic continental breakfast but it included a range of fresh fruit so were happy. There's a very good coffee shop and cocktail bar, almost directly beneath the hotel, serving breakfasts and other meals around the clock. Hotel guests get a 10% discount on showing their room keycard.The hotel was pretty busy, even in the Waikiki the low season, and it was clear from conversations with fellow guests that many are dedicated repeat customers.The rooms were good value by local standards and matched the description we read in advance. One of our group tried the spa and massage facilities and pronounced himself content. The hotel boasts a pool and sun terrace but both are small affairs. The pool, in particular, is pretty tiny and would disappoint anyone expecting to keep up their swimming training, But the scrupulously clean beaches and the refreshing waters of the Pacific Ocean are only a few steps away so there's no real reason to complain.In short, good value; clean, comfortable rooms; friendly, helpful staff who are a credit to the hotel and to the City of Honolulu.

We asked if they knew which bus to take to go to Diamond Head and not only did they not know but they also told us that it is really far from the hotel and pointed to the wrong area on a map. Diamond Head is a major attraction in the area and it is not normal that they do not know about it. We asked the concierge at the Hilton across the street and they had the information right away. It also only took 15 minutes to get there unlike what the front desk staff at the Aqua told us. So my advice would be to do your homework before coming to Hawaii or go ask the concierge at the Hilton!The room was comfortable and clean but a little on the small side (so was the bathroom). We liked having a microwave, fridge and utensils in the room. The DVD player in our room didn't work, but this could be an isolated problem.

Aqua Palms is about 4 blocks away from the Ala Moana Beach and the Ala Moana Shopping Center. It's also close to numerous restaurants and shops. Great spot for a great price. Rooms are relatively cheap compared to all other properties around Waikiki, so make sure you get a deluxe studio, it will only cost you about $20 more, but well worth it because you will be on the top floors, have a better view and get a more spacious room overall. Their deluxe studio is probably the size of your standard Sheraton/Hilton room, but as I mentioned before, very worth it because they cost half as much as the other hotels. Don't expect super fancy rooms for these prices, but the decor and the overall ambiance is very nice. They do extra little touches such as place a cute bonsai tree in your room, match the curtains to the beadspread and place little welcome statements from the hotel manager, housekeeper, etc. on the desk. Their pool is pretty small, smaller than on pictures available from travel sites, but who needs one if you have the ocean right next door? They also offer free continental breakfast every morning, wich is a nice touch if you are in a hurry to get out and enjoy Hawaii. One thing to note, rooms on higher floors facing Ala Moana Blvd. have a nice partial ocean view. However, they're also facing the Hilton Hawaiian Village construction. I did not hear any noise in the morning, but this is something you might consider when choosing your rooms.Front desk clerks and luggage handlers were all also very nice and tried to be very helpful when asked for directions, bus stops, where to eat, etc. I am a frequent traveller and am typically very picky about my hotels.

We enjoyed the daily free continental breakfasts although it would have been nice to have had some protein with it. The view from our room deck was great. It looked down on the beautiful landscaping of the Hilton Hawaiian Village and Ft. Debussy (like a park) across the street.

For example, the large Ala Moana Mall with its 260 stores and the largest food court we've ever seen in any mall was just a few minutes bus ride. We also took the bus to many other places such as the Honolulu Aquarium and Zoo. We found and enjoyed the Waikiki Baptist Church within a 15 minute walk of our hotel. Many good restaurants were within a 3 block walk from the hotel. Groceries were available nearby which was handy since our room had a small refrigerator and microwave. We were able to book several attractions and tours right from our hotel lobby.

We had booked some time ago to save money and at the time of booking the hotel had received some great comments. We wrote to the Hotel Manager to express our concerns. He responded acknowledging those concerns but promised to take care of our visit. We arrived and checked into room 205. A great room with a separate lounge area, huge kitchen and large bedroom. In addition we had two balconies. Our booking had been up graded. The hotel is on a main road and opposite the Hilton Hawaiian Village. If you are looking to be in Waikiki this is not the place for you. The hotel is on the edge of Waikiki and Honolulu. A short walk through the Hilton Hawaiian Village places you on Waikiki Beach and the centre of Waikiki is about a fifteen to twenty minute walk away. Personally we were happy with the distance and appreciate being a little way away from the noise and commotion of the centre. The hotel does not have a bar or restaurant and the pool is situated on the second floor, but is small. The gym is in a converted bedroom and offers minimal equipment. Our room was always maintained to a high standard to cleanliness, but some of the light bulbs were broken so that meant that not all the lights worked. We were unimpressed with the very basic 'continental' breakfast offering and would strongly suggest booking room only. Overal we had found the staff friendly and helpful but we had little cause to interact with them on a regular basis. Only the Concierge seemed happier when making a booking for you rather than simply providing helpful advice - unlike the Concierge at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Maybe it is because he was Expedia and Hilton Hawaiian Village is American Express. The hotel offers a basic laundry facility in the car park. Basic, but functional and welcomed. The overal look of the hotel does suggest a need for renovation and as such it did not inspire me to book a spa treatment having also seen the gym. The hotel is keen to have guests fill out the room questionnaire and they really seem to value the feedback, so its worth doing and not just because the room attendant was overly insistant!We recommend going to the diner next door. Your room key gets you a 10% discount. Take a trip up Diamond Head and take a visit to the Polynesian Cultural Center. Hanauma Bay Beach Park is a great beach day out which is easy to get to and from by bus and the snorkel activity is great fun with amazing opportunity to see the sea life. Avoid the 'twlight zoo visit' and just go to the zoo during normal opening hours. The tour is a sweet idea but it just does not work as it gets dark quick and the zoo has no lights. The torches they give you don't help either. If you are coming to Honolulu for the first time you are bound to visit Pearl Harbour and it is worth it. Again, easy to get to by bus so don't pay over the odds for transport there unless you really feel you need the help or wanted an extra tour guide. The volunteers at Pearl Harbour offer everything you need including free advice and answers to questions. Pearl Harbour is free and you should get there early to avoid a long line. We found the people of Hawaii to be friendly and helpful and social. Easy to chat with and keen to chat. We were nervous at first expecting to be 'sold' something, but is just not the case. Just warm and friendly people. Finally we were impressed at how clean Hawai'i is and strongly recommend a visit regardless of where you chose to stay!","London, United Kingdom",259,4.0

My expectations were not terribly high when I booked a room here, but it exceeded my expectations. Our room was 218 on Ala Moana Blvd side of the hotel and I had no noise complaints at all. We requested two beds and got them. The lenai overlooked the parking garage and all the action on the street. The beds were comfortable and the air conditioning worked well and quietly. There is no chance of seeing the ocean from your room, but the ocean is only a short walk away. We were close to the elevator and pool which is located on our floor. Actually never used the pool as we walked over to the Hilton every day and sat on the beach. The room has a nice sized minifridge, microwave and some eating utensils. I never waited long for the elevator. Luck was on my side! The only complaint was that the carpet could have used a good cleaning. I had a couple of minor problems with the safe and door lock, which were attended to immediately and actually was the fault of the operator, not the equipment. We had a rental car that was helpful in getting to a grocery store and less expensive restaurants. But there were plenty of restaurants in the area as well as several ABC stores. The buses will take you all around the island, but we had five total in our party and the minivan worked well for us. The parking stalls are tight, but there was adequate room for the vehicle. My son rented a moped for a day and parked it overnight in the secure parking area below our lenai. The ramp had quite a steep incline to get into the parking garage and coming out, but any experienced driver can handle it. Access to the parking drive was easy to find. The laundry room is on the P3 parking level and quite nice to have. So, definitely recommend this property.","La Crosse, Wisconsin",40,4.0

The Aqua Palms is by far one of the best Hotels we have stayed at. The welcome we got as we came in the door was very nice. They helped with our bags and just made us feel welcome. The room was very nice,coffee, small fridge, micro wave, coffee, very comfortable bed, lots of room, coffee, high speed internet, and did I mention coffee, the best coffee around. Also located in the lobby was an Expedia desk with one very helpful Agent, Roberto went over our schedule of events( we booked all our tours etc thru Expedia as we did the Hotel) and found we were going to do almostthe same tour twice, he cancelled one of the tours and signed us up for another. He was very polite, knowledgeable and made sure we knew all about the events we booked, where to go for transportation, the times, and what to bring. Can't ask for anyone better to help you plan your stay. Remember he is one person and when making your plans he makes sure you know all about them, so if you are in line waiting for your turn it could take a few minutes. I am sure you would like him to take the time with you also. So our trip was over, we were checking out and Mark and Reberto made sure that we collected everything and got off to the airport ok.

Location: a decent 15minutes walk to the Waikiki beach (we walked through the Hilton huge complex (shopping village/hotel) across the street to get to the beach. The hotel faces a construction building. Otherwise, not near the central bustle of Waikiki. It's like a hotel at the end of the Las Vegas Strip.Hotel: The staff was friendly especially Mark with helping us get taxis. The front desk was friendly too. However, not much help in terms of ""things to do, places to eat, etc..."" recommendations. Kept referring to the concierge. The room was nice and comfortable. However, the ""king""size bed is actually a ""queen"" size bed. The place was overall nice. Near a convenience ABC store. The coffeeshop/diner down the block was always packed. Tasted good and cheap ($10 or less per person).Concierge: Luckily, I've been to Oahu before. The concierge reminded me of a slimy Joe Pantoliano/scam artist style. Very rude. Would make you wait forever to help you. He appeared to have the ability to serve only one couple at a time. We were ""lucky"" enough to get a map of Oahu/Waikiki from him.

I'd originally booked at the Ala Moana, but decided to give an Aqua property a try. Our room at the Aqua was slightly less expensive, but I think we should have stuck with our original choice.Although the property is conveniently located, clean, and fairly well-appointed, the elevator needs some serious repair and the parking garage set-up is confusing. My daughter and I waited approximately 10-15 minutes for the elevator on two occasions. I'm not sure if it ever made it to the fifth floor, because we finally gave up and took the eight flights of steps. Normally, this wouldn't have bothered me much, but my daughter is tiny and we had our luggageto haul, etc. I'm still worrying about the family with the stroller and several large suitcases whom we left--still waiting hopefully for the elevator. There are no lights to indicate if the elevator is going up or down and the doors shut before you can ask passengers inside. If the elevator is empty, you just have to take a leap of faith. Also, the elevators tend to ""reboot"" themselves before arriving at a designated floor--suddenly heading south. Harrowing. I travel extensively and have never aassigned so much mental energy to the elevator portion of my journeys. Parking costs a hefty $18 per night, but it's not clear which stalls belong to the hotel. There are ""reserved"" signs posted, but one would assume those stalls are ""reserved"" for patrons who have paid $18. All they need to do is post signs which read ""Parking: The Palms Hotel."" This would keep hotel guests from inadvertently parking in residents' stalls. The good news is: these issues can be easily remedied.

My son, Dylan (now 16) lost his father when he was a baby. He actually was In Oahu with us at two months of age. At age 11, Dylan and I decided that rather than going for a larger living space, we'd go for memories. Hawaii was our first real departure from Los Angeles and he felt like he was in a foreign, mystical land. Dylan fell in love with Asian girls for the first time along with the waters and beloved local artist, Christian Riese Lassen. We'd stayed at Maile Sky Court an incredible deal I got which resulted in smoke filled rooms, broken elevators and fleas on top of no decent service. As much as I disliked the hotel, we went with an attitude of, it's where we just lay our heads. We have been to Cabo San Lucas & other parts of Mexico, New York, the south, most recently the Grand Canyon and Big Sur. Hawaii wasn't in my mind but for some reason people kept bringing it up. Since teenage years are hard on both the kid and the parent/s, I knew I needed a break... I just wasn't sure I wanted to bring the teenage years with me. Hawaii kept being brought up with people here in Los Angeles. After speaking with a lady from Expedia, she told me all about Aqua Palms & Spa, how it was newly renovated, close to the Hilton and beaches and really felt more like you were in Hawaii. A rarity for an online place to suggest a hotel. I'm not a fan of the Hiltons, Sheratons or any of the American chains all over because they're all the same feel inside, executive. Just as I was about to book 5 days, my phone dropped and I lost this kind woman who shared her experiences which was rare. Intrigued by her candor, I decided to write the Aqua Palms myself and do a story as well as a review, if I felt what she told me was true. I immediately was met with email replies from the kindest offers in all areas. It was Erik who got me to stay from my initial 5 to 7 days and Sandi who accommodated a free massage to try with the Spa portion connected to the hotel. From giving bargains on the rooms to allowing a treat for an overworked solo mom, the Aqua Palms is THE place I'd return to. Dylan even met a mainland college student who resides there to go to school and she taught him a lot about Hawaii's islands and ways. They met at the gym then went for a swim in the pool, which isn't that large but who needs a pool by the beach? We got a great deal, a welcome basket and FREE boogie boards that the bellhop told me about. The candor, laughter and care was what Hawaii represents to me as a people and the Aqua Palms came through with flying colors for us. If anything, Dawn, Princess and all the employees were more than helpful, they felt like family and I will go back. The free fireworks from the Hilton across and their village of overpriced but best ice cream around, Lappert's and great to hop on local free trolleys or on Island tour buses. We like to walk so the Aqua's location rests in the midst of many events we wanted to experience: Makatani Catamaran, International Market Place, Christian Riese Lassen's gorgeous gallery (he IS the true artist of the Islands and cares about the land and waters), surf lessons, canoe and kayaking, (Pearl Harbor, Hilo Hattie and the many main shopping marts we passed on because we did that last time) and more. Taking my room coffee pot to fill in the lobby's machine and take back to the room was my delight. I stuck with fruit because I'm not into the continental breakfast so much but for a kid to start the day? It was fine. We had a special dinner night out together at Outback's nearby and it was delicious & affordable with great portions and a true sense of still being near the healing waters of Oahu. We went twice to Hanauma Bay and it was there that I fell in love with my teenager again. We swam side-by-side discovering eels, fish of all sizes, colors and shapes looking for a sea turtle. The safe in our room secured our passports and other items so there was no worry to just up and leave at any time. Is there noise and new construction with a hotel that is now obstructing a larger part of the ocean view? Yes. Is Waikiki also known as the nightlife, happening singles place as well? Yes. So, live with it and go for what truly counts. The people and essence. If you're not happy with something, it's simple, pick up the phone and it's taken care of. I was reading about the fleas, found those in hotels around the world. If the bugs bug you, tell the hotel and they'll zap the little nippers for you. I suggested that the hotel's Spa consider selling cheaper combo packages for a parent and teen because teens ache a lot as they grow and a little kneading the tensions makes for a calmer mind and easier living quarters so the parent can relax. We loved our room and the wi-fi kept Dylan busy playing games and talking to friends back home the little time we were actually in our room. I cannot thank everyone at the Aqua Palm's staff enough for a wonderful time away that a journalist mom could have to work, play and feel the joys of the rebirth of her relationship with her son.

We decied to stay at the Aqua Palms after much research on this website and their own. Well, shame on you Aqua Palms! You have a lot of false advertising out there. The pictures of the hotel on their website are beautiful. The rooms are colorful, and looked really nice, and I read several places that this place had been recently refurbished. The price was really good for Waikiki (should have been the first warning). Reviews on this website were mostly positive (I don't know where these people have been staying but this place is nowhere near a 3 star). And as far as the refurbishment, if it has been they got ripped off. I don't call putting up a couple of shiny granite tiles a refurbishment.We were so disappointed with this hotel from the minute that we walked in the door. The enitre hotel is dirty, dingy and looks like it is ready to fall down. I thought to myself well the room will be better. We were booked into one of their deluxe rooms. Room 702. Well if this was there deluxe room I would hate to see the others. When we walked into the room there was a smell, not a horrible smell, but a smell. The ""kitchenette"" ha ha, was right as you walk in the door. It consisted of a 24"" x 30"" (appox) counter with a tiny refrigerator, and a microwave. The room was falling apart, the wallpaper around air register was all missing, and the rest of it was all peeling off the walls. The carpet in our room was so filthy that we would not even let our 7 month old on the floor. The couch in our room was thread bare, completely worn through in some spots, and lots of questionalbe stains. The furniture was worn, old falling apart as well. The dresser drawers would hardly come out. The televison is so small and located all the way across the room way up high, so you can hardly see it. The airconditioner in our room rarly came on during the day and left the room hot and stuffy, but at night it ran full blast getting the room so cold that you could store meat in it. It didn't matter what setting you put it on, including the hotel recommended setting. The bathroom was small, there is no way two people can get in it at the same time unless one of you was standing in the bathtub. The bathtub was half size tub, literally, I have never seen anything like it. The hotel is on a super busy street so the noise is horrible. Ambulances, car horns, you name it we heard it. The balcony is small and the view nothing to write home about. We never used it because the railing looked as if it was about to come off and the bars were so far apart our two year old could have slipped right through. The hallways and elevators are another story. The carpet in the hallways is gross and so dirty I felt like I might catch something. The other funny thing is that the carpet doesn't go all the way to the wall on each side. It only goes to within about 3"" and then there are these old, nasty, linoleum tiles, the rest of the way. That haven't been washed or swept for months (you could tell by all the dust). The hallways are not airconditioned. There was graffitti on the walls in the hallway on our floor, and in the elvevators.I didn't bother calling the front desk and complaining because I figured if this was one of the deluxe rooms it wasn't going to get any better. Also during check in Sergio was so rude and short with us I figured that everyone else would be as well. We used the Expedia concierge desk to book tickets which was convienient. However we had to wait for about 10 minutes for the guy to finish his personal phone call before he could help us. The breakfast is such a farce. They had two kinds of muffins and two kinds of juice and coffee. We ate there once and never went back. The pool is also a joke. They should probably call it a thimble. It is so small that only about 4 people can fit in it at a time. Overall this hotel is on par with a Motel 6, Super 8. Maybe a 1.5 star at most. On the mainland boutique means extra special, extra nice. This hotel left me with the feeling that maybe ""boutique"" means junk in Hawaiian. Spend a little more money and stay somewhere that is actually nice and not just made to look nice on a website. Remember you can do a lot with photoshop. Our entire stay in Ohau was marred by this hotel. Luckily we spent the next week in Maui at a great place. So don't make the same mistake.We didn't take any pictures because we just tried to stay away as much as possible.

Since then, I've tried to make it back every year, or two. I used to stay at the Outrigger Hobron, but it was converted to condos a few years back. I tried a hotel way down in the middle of Waikiki, but I was miserable. I've always stayed on the Ewa end, and enjoyed its proximity to Ala Moana, and the Hilton Hawaiian Village beach and lagoon. So, after painstaking research, I ran across the Aqua brand. Had never heard of it before, but was willing to give it a shot. The Aqua Palms and Spa was in the perfect location, and was a good price, so I booked through hotels.com.What I didn't expect were all the 'perks'. Loved having a lanai in my room, along with a good-size mini fridge, good-size microwave, and my own iron, ironing board, and plush robes.The biggie, however, was the free high-speed internet. I use my computer alot (yes, even on vacation), and sincerely appreciate its availability in the room. Too many hotels either charge for this service, or make you go down to the lobby for wireless access. Also, the central air worked perfectly. Much better than those window-units that so many hotels have. Easy adjustment via a thermostat, and it held the temperature well.Another thing I really enjoyed, and appreciated, was the fact that the staff remembered my name, and greeted me whenever I passed through the lobby. Special acknowledgement goes to Princess, at the Front Desk, and Mark, the Doorman/Bellman. Both went out of their way to make sure I had a comfortable stay.I was in Honolulu to scout out accommodations for an upcoming family reunion, thinking we'd stay in a vacation rental, or condo. After staying at the Aqua Palms and Spa, I'm going to reserve five rooms there. :)","Denver, Colorado",6,5.0

Got to the garage, where the entrance is on a 60 degree incline and barely wide enough for my midsize car... but this is nothing too serious, it just makes me want to walk everywhere. I have to go up a vacant and musty stairwell with all of my bags, arriving at a nondescript elevator which takes me to the pleasant lobby. The staff was very nice, free water bottles upon your arrival and a map of the area attractions. At this point, things were looking up. took the crowded elevator to my room and walked through a stinky hallway (smelled like cigarettes and feet) and find that the lanai I was promised when I booked my reservation is nonexistent. Also, the ""partial view"" of the ocean that you will pay $30 more a night for is a joke. Basically you get a tiny slice of the ocean (no beach) after you have cocked your head around the imposing view of massive construction. I immediately called downstairs about the lack of lanai, and they apologized and said that they could get me in the room I asked for in two days - no offer to refund the difference during that two days. Changed into shorts and tried to wrap up some work that I couldn't complete on the plane... after thirty minutes of sitting at the desk, my legs started itching. 15 minutes later - MY LEGS LOOKED LIKE A CONSTELLATION HAD FORMED ON THEM. I could literally see the fleas!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was furious, and felt like I was the hotel reviewer in Ocean's 13. Itching, and in a mildewish room, I was SHOCKED. Immediately, I called some other hotels, hopped in the shower, changed clothes, went downstairs and asked that I be checked out. I told the desk that I had literally been eaten alive by the fleas in my room and they offered me another... I said ""no way"" in the most polite voice I could muster. THEN - SHE ASKED TO SEE THE BITES ON MY LEG!!!!!!! I showed her, demanded a full refund for the $20 parking and the room, and, albeit reluctantly, she complied. Booked at the DoubleTree and had a great stay with MUCH nicer accommodations. It is worth the few extra bucks folks.I am not a terribly particular person, and I rarely complain about anything - food, hotel, service, etc. but this was the WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE I""VE EVER ENCOUNTERED.

We came for a last minute anniversary trip and they upgraded us to a higher room, The manager emailed me personally. The manager called me to make sure our stay was going well. She even set us a little box of Hawwaiian treats. This is not a resort hotel, but with the Hilton village across the street it might as well have been. Rooms were good with a micro and fridge. You have a direct line to the owner and CEO from your room of the company. Do not expect a resort but when your in Hawaai your pretty much in your room to sleep. They did everything well. The morning breakfast was good although they could use some more seating. My only complaint would be that the elevators were really slow.

I also noticed that every negative review on Trip Advisor receives a personal response from the hotel with specific information on how the guest's problems have been addressed/resolved. The best thing about the hotel was the staff. Each staff member I spoke to, either on the phone or in-person was helpful, cheerful, knowledgeable and accomodating. Really very capable and friendly folks with some great perks like cold water and fruit upon check-in, free newspapers in the morning and they said they upgraded us free, apparently for no reason at all (although I sincerely appreciate the fact, after seeing the room, that fact was a bit hard to believe). The Aqua group of hotels all have a sort-of ""flavor"" and are all quirky and unique. It piqued my interest. Bottom line: The marketing is too good. Cool color schemes, hip names, free high-speed access, cool notepads & pens all make you think the hotel is a understated and no-frills but without being run-down or or boring in that Hampton Inn way. Unfortunately, our experience was that they spend a lot of money on expensive lipstick for the pig if you know what I mean. Furniture is old and rickety, bed was uncomfortable, carpet was dirty, halls and elevators were dirty. In addition, the ""Continental Breakfast"" should have been called quite literally, ""2 kinds of bread, 2 kinds of juice and coffee."" There was no milk, sugar, cream, etc. for the coffee, no jelly or jam, no Fruit Loops, no oatmeal. It was simply not a Continental Breakfast and so should not be marketed as one (see Wiki definition of CB for clarification). We were not expecting anything elaborate, but we were expecting milk and sugar for our coffee. I don't expect a CB, but I also don't expect to be misled. Hotel is right on Ala Moana Blvd. so even higher floors are very loud, and the hotel is not built to filter noise.

Everyone at reception (and the cleaners) were great but we had an exceptionally great experience with Princess. She remembered us from check in, remembered which kinds of massages we were interested in, and gave us everything we needed including great recommendations on where to go at night. Book your massages ahead of time if you know you want them because they were often booked if I tried to get one too last minute. The hotel itself is a perfect distance between Ala Moana Shopping centre and the main Waikiki strip; we never wasted money on cabs. I would definitely stay there again.

The rooms are clean and quite spacious (most have a small lanai) and come with fridge and microwave and nice-to-have stuff like bathrobes, hairdryer, iron etc. The bed is comfortable, there's a decent-sized TV with most cable channels, and the bathroom is good too (decent sized vanity, good water pressure in the shower, overall clean and well maintained) and the toiletries were nice. this hotel has central air conditioning in the rooms - thermostat controlled and it's quiet enough to leave on at night (once you've stayed at one of the numerous hotels in Hawaii that have a noisy old-school wall-mounted aircon with no temp control you'll realise why i think this is such a plus!). There is free high speed internet in the rooms (and wifi in the lobby), and local calls are free, so this would be OK for a convention/work trip too. The pool's not the biggest, but this is Waikiki so i don't get why anyone would hang out by a pool when there are lovely beaches just a short walk away! This hotel is about a 10min walk to Ala Moana Center mall/convention center, or to the beach. Also, just FYI, the sheets are changed about twice a week (which is perfectly fine with me since we don't change the sheets everyday at home), towels are replaced daily though. Overall, and especially considering the price paid for the room, I would say that this place was excellent and I'd definitely stay here again and would recommend it to my friends/family.","Auckland, New Zealand",27,5.0

I am the type of person who will cabin and sleep on the floor of a tent, but when it comes to staying in a hotel I am extremly picky. After reading all the reviews, I decided to stay at Aqua Palms. The reviews did help and the positive out weighed the negative. As with others, I agree the elevators can be slow at busy times. But, it was not to big of a deal. The hall ways on the two floors I stayed did not have AC or it was not on. It was a little warm waiting for the elevators, and that is what probably made the wait worse. The only other negative, though not a big deal was the first room we had (pre cruise) the bathroom was oddly shapped and a little dark. This room faced the Holiday Inn behind the hotel. The second room was on the top floor. ***JUST AS REQUESTED*** at the time of booking. It was next to the elevator shaft, so you would here the vibration of the elveator.Room noise from the road was normal for a city room. It definitly was not as bad as people say. There was construction going on all around, but not once do I remember hearing it. The rooms were clean. The bathrooms were clean. The beds were clean. The accomodations in geneal were better than any of your average chain hotels. The staff was extremly helpful and quick to respond when you needed something.

It stinks of diesel fumes, and is rather filthy. Not a pleasant place to be, at all.It is not the Palms fault, since the law applies throughout the state, but they COULD clean up that area a bit, and make it more presentable.Apart from that, its an average hotel, and like most in Honolulu, over-priced.

Very impressed - and this coming from us who prefer places much less commercialised than Honolulu (we like to get back to nature) - we found it very busy (we're spoiled by Sydney beaches!) and Waikiki not to our liking but it was all good fun, shopping close by, lots of good restaurants and the local people were lovely.

White sand, wide and not so crowded as in the heart of Waikiki.All in all, a superb property close to the ocean with very friendly staff. And I am glad I spent my vacation time in this hotel.Probably the only, ! but very small !, negative, was the noise from the street. But that was nothing to be concerned about too much.We definitely want to come back to Hawaii. And if we do, hotel Aqua Palms will be our choice again.","Bratislava, Slovakia",10,5.0

Oahu was the one island where we were trying to save money a little, so we booked this less expensive hotel. It is on a busy main road, so if you have a street facing room (which we did), you can definitely hear the traffic (and the construction noise from across the street). But we weren't expecting the sound of waves so not a big deal, especially considering you won't spend much time in the room.The room itself was big, really nice marble bathroom, little kitchenette, really comfortable bed and a nice balcony with a nice skyline view. Even though we were on the fifth floor, the parking garage takes up 2 big floors, so you feel even higher.Check in was annoying, because we got there 2.5 hours ahead of check in time, and they weren't able to accommodate us until a little after 3. I'm not used to that, most hotels I've stayed at the rooms are always ready, and of course we were antsy to get our vacation started and get settled in. They weren't very apologetic either. The free breakfast is great for saving money - mini blueberry muffins and joices, nothing fancy (it's a small spread right in the lobby) but a nice touch.The bus stop is right outside the hotel door which was very convenient for some of our day trips. The Hilton is right across the street - they supposedly have a great bar, but we didn't make it there. Two great restaurants that we ate at were right down the street - a Thai place right on the corner (I think it was called Singhai, best spring rolls we've ever had!!!) and Cheeseburger's, which had some great food and drinks. Duke's in downtown is a fun place, very hopping. Avoid the Shore Bird restaurant, you have to grill your own food and it takes forever, total disaster.Other things to note, Pearl Harbor is packed even by mid morning - we got there at 10 am and couldn't get to the Arizona until 1pm. Hanuma Bay (sp?) snorkeling is completely overrated - we snorkeled in Maui and the Big Island afterwards and HB pales in comparison. Go to Kailua Beach instead if you want the beach experience, we heard it's beautiful but never made it.All in all, it was a great stay in Oahu, our first taste of Hawaii, a decent hotel, a lot of history and landmarks to see. We did most everything we wanted to on this island, though, so when we go back to the islands we probably won't do Oahu again.","Thousand Oaks, California",13,4.0

We picked the Aqua Palms due to having excellent reviews on here, and because the price was so reasonable.The rooms of the hotel were absolutely stunning. Our room was huge, but was decorated beautifully. We had a small kitchen area with a fridge and a coffee maker, along with complimentry essentials. We also had a balcony which was overlooking the back of the hotel, but we could see the ala wai canal.The pool of the hotel was a bit small, but there were plenty of sunloungers and chairs. We also used the gym a couple of times and had a massage in the spa room, which was pretty reasonably priced, but book in advance if your planning on having one. The staff at the hotel were very friendly, and helpful when we had various queries, and there is also a guy called Roberto who is an Expedia rep, which is great if you want to book day trips. The location was fab as it is around a 10 min walk from Waikki beach, 10 min from the shopping centre and 15 min from main Waikki town.

Although the hotel was fine, it was nothing exceptional.Having arrived in Honolulu in the evening, we drove by the hotel the first time - more signage visible from the street would be a big help. There wasn't a clear indicator as to where we should park to check-in. Some signage would make the arrival process a bit smoother. Tip: Drive just past the front door and park in the loading dock.As other travelers mentioned, the hotel parking lot is fairly tight. Having a smaller car makes things easier. When you push the elevator button, make sure to pay attention when one of the cars arrives - the doors close pretty quickly.Our room was spacious and clean. We had a studio that included a microwave and refrigerator which came in very handy. Our room didn't have a balcony, which we didn't mind as our room was at the back of the hotel not facing the ocean. The bathroom was a nice size, but the tub/shower were smaller than usual and a little dark because there was only one light in the bathroom. The bath amenities were great.The hotel is across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village where you can easily get to Duke Kahanamoku Beach. The Hilton is also a pick-up spot if you plan on taking any tours (we took a snorkel tour with Captain Bob).The Aqua Palms is about a 20 minute walk to downtown Waikiki, which can be good or bad - depending on how you look at it. But it's only a 5 minute walk to Eggs and Things, which is a great breakfast spot. Try and get there by 8:30 to avoid really long lines. The hotel is a short 10 minute walk to the Ala Moana Mall which is the largest outdoor mall in the world! If you get tired of going to the beach, you can spend plenty of time at the mall.I think others may have mentioned noise being an issue. Although the street noise didn't really bother us, our neighbors did. The balconies are very close together. So if your neighbors are outside late at night having a party or talking until the late hours (which ours were), you can hear every word of they're saying. It made it difficult to go to sleep.This was our first visit to Hawaii, so I can't compare the Aqua Palms to other hotels in the area.

The location is perfect, you are away from the hussle and bussle of downtown Waikiki, yet you can walk to the mall, the beach, a park, and several restaurants and stores. Our room was very spacious containing a king bed and a pull out sofa. We had ample closet space and a nice view of the pool. Plus if you looked to the right (past the construction), we had a view of the ocean.The room was very clean and the houskeeping staff was very friendly and extremely accommodating to our schedule. The front desk staff was very helpful and accommodated our late check out request. By far, my favorite person there was the Concierge, Roberto Vargas. Not only was he extremely helpful with directions and planning activities, but he was super nice and very entertaining-he should have his own comedy show!I also had a wonderful experience at the hotel spa. The prices are pretty reasonable in comparison with what you would pay at some of the larger hotels. Although the hotel does not have a restaurant, the rooms do have a fridge and a microwave. Plus there is a grill at the pool which you can use. Also, the diner next to the hotel has great food. Very inexpensive (you get a 10% discount with your room key) and very larger portions.

First day, we found ants on the desk which the cleaning staff promptly took care of. But it left the room a bit smelly. I did find some food crumbs on the carpet which might have been the cause and led me to believe the room was not vacuumed. The next day, the cleaning staff did not clean our room when we came back around 2pm. But it was cleaned after coming back from the pool later that afternoon. Our room was simple and had a very small balcony (other rooms had a full lanai with chairs and tables). There was a decent view of the ocean behind the massive Hilton property. It was nice that the TV had a DVD player so my daughter can watch her videos. We found the ""Aqua Kit"" useful for storing groceries and for heating up leftovers. Bathroom was clean with granite countertop and what appears to be travertine tile. But we could've used more lighting near the shower/tub area. Although we had no trouble sleeping, this side of the hotel can be a bit noisy with traffic from Ala Moana . The pool was small (4 ft. deep) but perfect for taking our toddler in. The free breakfast had small pastries, fruit, coffee, and juice which was fine to start the day. They have gated parking ($15/day) but the garage is a little tight. We took ""The Bus"" one day and it stops almost in front of the hotel. The hotel is across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village where there are shops, eateries, and beach access to a less crowded portion of Waikiki. We went through the Hilton almost everyday and enjoyed some of the property amenities without paying twice as much to stay there.

I love the big, upscale hotels with all their glamour, but for the money, the best bet in town is the Aqua Palms. Its a bit rough around the edges, could use a carpet cleaning and some touch up paint, but the staff is friendly and helpful and the location is excellent. I had to get a cab at 5:30 a.m. to catch my return flight and the cab was there ready and waiting thanks to the hotel setting it up in advance. The bed was comfy, the room large and nice toiletries in the bathroom, which was also clean and acceptable. The room comes equipped with a microwave and fridge as well as coffee maker. Its all good. As for the construction.... well, most of Waikiki is under construction right now, so you will be hard pressed to miss it regardless of where you stay. The pool is tiny, but that is typical for Waikiki hotels. The only down side was the hotel not having some sort of pool/beach towels to take with you... they probably lose quite a few bath towels because of it.

Porter service was excellent and they had our bags up in our room in no time and also took time to explain the room fixtures etc...Room - newly-renovated and very well maintained. Beds firm and everything was spotless. Bathroom was small and really had nowhere to hang our towels but the hotel toiletries were great and replenished daily. Housekeeping also very friendly and everytime we popped by, they were vacuuming the room which is good to know. Our lanai had a great view of the quieter (back) of Waikiki and the mountains afar. The room was also exceptionally quiet which is very unusual for Waikiki! Brand-new fridge/ microwave/table setting/coffee maker with complimentary packets of coffee, also replenished every day. Free Wi-Fi came in very handy. Safe also free. Air-con did its job but comes in blasts which can be noisy! We noticed too that our room seemed to be sloping ever-so slightly at an angle but it wasn't a big deal.Parking - if possible, rent a smaller car! The ramp up and down the parking lot is at a steep gradient and corners are tight. We had no problem with our Compact and lots are plentiful. $15 a day self-park cheap for Waikiki.Lifts - they have 3 but at times can be rather slow.Laundry - 5 washers and 4 dryers on the Parking Level 3. $1 per load. Detergent dispenser machines also available. Did laundry twice and didn't have to wait both times. Decor much to be desired. Looks like a bad dorm laundry.Location - across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village, next door to the 24-hour Wailana Coffee House ( you get 10% off your bill when you flash your room card). The rooms facing Ala Moana look like they get an amazing view of Waikiki!Lobby - coffee free all day and simple Continental breakfast everyday from 7.30-9.30am. Free newspapers at reception. You can get beach towels and deck chairs also from the reception.Staff - all full of Aloha and all seem to be happy and proud of their job. Nice people at Aqua Palms.Check-out - room bill not itemized but accurate and fast. No complaints.Overall, the best value hotel we've stayed in Waikiki so far! Love it that's its newly renovated and well-maintained. The staff make you feel right at home and location is fab. Will return to this hotel in flash! Enjoy!","Honolulu, Hawaii",290,5.0

The hotel staff was nice, and that was the ONLY plus for staying there. The lobby was very smelly, smelled like a sewer, all 5 days I was there. The elevators were snail-pace slow and hot and sticky. the hallways were also hot. The only Ice machines were in the parking garage, which did not look safe at all. My first night was spent in a very tiny room right beside the elevators. Every time the elevator went up or down, I felt I was riding it instead of ""trying"" to sleep. I was moved, after much complaining, to a better and bigger room; however I was charged more after being told I would not be. The continental breakfast was very bad and there's no restaurant in the hotel. There is no view except for other high-rise buildings. It was an overall awful experience, that I will never repeat. If you want to save money, staying at a One Star would probably be better, because this was NO 3 star as it has been advertised!",Las Vegas,4,1.0

The hotel is at a good location just across from the Hilton Hotel. It is not as busy as the Waikiki beach area. You can access the beach by walking through Hilton which, by the way, is a pretty nice hotel. It’s about 10-15 minutes walk to the beach. There’s an ABC convenient store around the corner of the Aqua Palms. The Ala Moana Mall is also nearby, about 15-20 minutes walk from Aqua Palms. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful. There’s a complementary internet access and a continental breakfast in the morning between 7:30 and 9:30. There’s also a laundry room with coin-operated washers and dryers. All rooms have a small refrigerator and a microwave. The rooms are clean and tidy, some with balcony and a view of the ocean. We stayed in one of those rooms with an ocean view and it was nice having breakfast on the balcony overlooking the activities on the street and the ocean. There’s a trolley stop right outside of the hotel, and the trolley or “The Bus” ($2/person) will bring you all the way to the busy Waikiki Beach area. We rented a car so we can drive around in Oahu, and there aren’t too many street parking choices nearby the Aqua Palms area, so we parked in the hotel for $15 for 24 hours with in-and-out privilege. Overall, we had a good experience at the Aqua Palms Spa & Resort. It’s good value for the money we paid. After we returned to Oahu from our cruise, we stayed at another hotel owned by Aqua Resorts (see my review for Aqua Ocean Tower) which is at an even better location, right across from the Waikiki beach and lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance.",Seattle,44,3.0

I had never been to Oahu so I wasn't familiar with the city. Upon arrival, the staff was very courteous and put me in a 9th floor room on the back side of the hotel after telling them that I am a light sleeper. Even though they put me in one of their quiet rooms, the sound of traffic was deafening throughout the day and night. I slept with earplugs and noise cancelling headphones just to try to block out the noise. There was no sense in asking them to change my room because it was in their quietest location. During the day, the sound of construction at a nearby hotel was awful. I had no peaceful time at all in my room. In addition, the bathroom was small and did not have a bath tub. Other than these negatives, the room was fully updated and decorated very nice. I enjoyed the fresh fruit from their continental breakfast in the morning, but don't expect more than apples, bananas, juice, and muffins. I was hoping for pineapple. The bed and pillows were comfortable and I was never without hot water. The walk to downtown Waikiki is short. Beware of the $15 parking charge that is not advertised!

We had stayed in far nicer rooms for far less money - the room was ok but nothing to get excited about3 nights in Waikiki was more than enough for us - terribly commericalised, unattractive beach, constant traffic. The hotel concierge was very entertaining & we booked two trips through him - one whale-watching which was quite good and one tour of the island including pearl harbour.

When we arrived our room was waiting and was even upgraded to a balcony room with a peek view of Diamond Head. While this is not a ""plush"" hotel, I would say that it would be comparable to a Hampton Inn on the mainland. . Many have complained about the small breakfast, but there was more than enough to take seconds and thirds if you wanted. The room was very clean and quiet. Breakfast consisted of two different juices, coffee, muffins, croissants and assorted fruit. Certainly more than enough to get you started. I must say that the coffee is terribly strong so unless you like it that way, stay away from the coffee. There is no restaurant at the Palms but you do get a 10% discount at the diner next door however it was truly a ""diner"" and not to our liking although the service certainly is quick. The elevators were not slow at all as others stated. Since we were proceeding to cruise for 11 days I needed to do laundry and found the machines and dryers easily accessible and the dryers very efficient as they dried a load with one use rather than twice like some machines require. While the soap dispenser was out of soap, once I reported it, within 5 minutes they came with my choice of soap and even offered to explain how to use the machines etc. which I didn't need. They have 4 washers and 4 dryers but I was told virtually no one uses them and I can see why. When in Hawaii unless absolutely necessary why would you do laundry?The managers reception is a wonderful time to get to meet others and the wine, entertainment and free massage was fantastic. As others have stated, it is walking distance to everything and if you didn't want to walk, The Bus stop is across the street by the Hilton. We didn't rent a car and did not feel at a loss without it at all. In fact, most of the locals don't own cars but use The Bus system.When leaving they called a taxi for us and were so pleasant and kind I would definitely stay here again.

The amenities that we received for approx $130 per night were outstanding. The rooms were clean & comfortable and the continental breakfast was very good. With the location only about 1.5 blocks from the beach and only 1-2 blocks from the Waikiki Strip, we found it to be the perfect distance to the majority of our wants & needs...The Aqua Palms staff was helpful and courteous and went out of his/her way to make our stay memorable. One of the employees, Mark, was especially helpful and took his own personal time to tell us about great hiking spots, restaurants, beaches, and special areas of interest. As first time visitors to the island, it was very helpful in making site seeing decisions.As much as we enjoyed our stay, we did have a couple of concerns to pass on... If you are staying at the Aqua Palms, know the directions to get to it! The parking ramp is steep and located on a busy street (Ala Moana) so a little preplanning will really help out! Our last concern was the laundry facilities... There were plenty of washers but only 2 working dryers for all of the guests.

The Wednesday night Managers Reception was enjoyable with wine and a live 4 piece band. The Hotel itself is very clean and features some nice amenities. Our room had 2 very nice bath robes, shampoo, soap and body scrub with Aqua Spa’s own label. . First 3 days we were on the 2nd floor and last 5 on 10th, both rooms were comfortable with ample space. The pool was clean and well maintained with plenty of lounge chairs. Our view was limited to seeing Honolulu as we opted for a city view instead of an Ocean view, we were there to sleep. Access to all of Oahu is right at the doorstep with tours or rental vehicles. We caught “THE BUS” Oahu’s transit system and got over to the Arizona Memorial for $2.00 each. Take Bus #42 or #20. Around the corner is Alamo Car rental with cars right on site, no need to go to the airport to get a vehicle. Tours are available right from the front door, we did 3 tours with Oahu Nature Tours booking them on-line before we left for our trip.At the corner is a fantastic restaurant the Wailana Coffee House- excellent food at a reasonable price. You have got to try their Banana Split. Another excellent spot is the Shanghai Bistro in the same mall as Alamo. The Continental Breakfast at the hotel is very basic but good, juices, fresh fruit, muffins, croissants and coffee. Overall the Aqua Palms exceeded our expectations for the price we paid.

It is not on the beach, which is a walk of a few hundred yards either through the Hilton Resort opposite or through the local Park. Buses run to central Honolulu, Pearl Harbour and other areas of Waikiki from just outside the hotel - the 4 day bus pass on the local buses for $20 is a good buy if you want to visit places around the area.Location is good for shopping - the huge Ala Moana shopping center is 1/2 mile to the west, plus the Waikiki shops are an easy walk in the opposite direction.Room we had was a good size, with a separate small area for coffee and with a microwave. Nice balcony, though this was overlooking the main road, which is noisy during the day. Also there is building going on at the Hilton Resort opposite - again only during the day and it did not disturb us.Facilities at the hotel are limited.

We booked a standard room on Expedia. When we checked in, I found the room we were given to be small but impeccably clean. There was only a shower in the bathroom and the window (not lanai) overlooked a parking lot and the roof pool of a nearby hotel. Still, you don’t come to Hawaii to stay in your room! When we returned from sightseeing on that first afternoon, management informed us that they needed to do unscheduled maintenance on our room and would we mind moving? Since we hadn’t unpacked yet, this request didn’t faze us a bit, and they moved us up several floors to a very large room with ocean views. Would I have paid more for the ocean view given the choice? Maybe not. The view was very nice, but there was some traffic noise even though we were high up. (This never kept up from getting a great night’s sleep, though). I might have paid more for the larger room, but I am not sure that all ocean view rooms are larger. As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms are nicely decorated with a beach theme, and the granite countertops are a nice touch. Our second room had a good-sized bathroom with a bath. The bed was very comfortable. The continental breakfast served right to your room or available for pick-up at the front desk is a nice touch. Service was always extremely friendly. The pool is small, but is nice for a quick dip, and the beach is a short stroll away. There is a grill available for use at the pool area. One morning, we picked up fresh shrimp from the seafood market downtown, put them in Ziploc bags with some marinade, and left them in the fridge. That night, we skewered the shrimp and threw them on the grill and picked up some rice and vegetables at the Chinese restaurant next door – a homemade meal at a hotel! I found the location to be great – just a quick stroll away from beaches and shopping and easily accessible. The coffee shop around the corner is great value, and your room key gets you a discount. When you check in, you receive a coupon book. Check this out – I didn’t flip through it until after I had paid two full-price admission tickets to the battleship next to Pearl Harbor, and the book includes a buy-one get one free coupon!

Return flight didn't leave until late p.m.; but Aqua Palms kept our luggage locked up for us all day. Great location - trolley stops in front; Diner next door serves good food -especially breakfast. Hilton across the street - can catch tour buses there; Used Roberts Hawaii for excursions - excellent service for excursions and to/from airport. Easy access to Waikiki Beach - just walk through Hilton. Aqua Palms front desk personnel always courteous - processed our return airline boarding pass. Not a great continental breakfast - just small muffins and croussants - but juice and coffee plentiful. Mall within walking distance (long 4-block walk) or just take the trolley. Beach towels at the front desk a nice amenity also. Street noise pretty bad for floors 6 and lower. Halls are hot - elevators are slow - but I can live with that at the rate I paid compared to other hotels in the area. A great hotel for the price.,"Lufkin, Texas",9,4.0

My roommate had to sleep on the sofa after one nite of sleeping on it as a bed. (He did not want to report to the front desk) The toilet seat cover (top part) broke the first day we arrived...no big deal. I reported it when we checked out, then went back to the room to get the luggage. Before we even got our luggage out the door, a maintenance person came to repair the toilet seat.

The first three nights were spent at the Halekulani, then flew to the Big Island, then back for one night at Aqua Palms. After staying at the Halekulani, I was prepared to be disappointed but chose Aqua Palms because it was inexpensive and sounded clean. I had no idea what a great deal I was getting!! We had a deluxe studio with a living area, balcony, kitchenette area, sofa and king bed. The room was super clean, view overlooked the ocean with peak at Diamondhead. This room fronted Ala Moana Blvd and construction and was on the 6th floor, but noise wasn't too bad. I expected it to be much worse. I'm a light sleeper and I slept like a baby. Amenities were from their spa....shampoo, conditioner, body scrub, lotion and there were 2 great bathrobes in the room! Much more than I expected for $113 (AAA rate). Staff was great....gave me two bottles of water on check-in which was nice after a hot trip from the airport. Hilton is across the street and worth checking out...lots of animal exibits and beautiful gardens. Diner next door is good and cheap.....lightning fast service. Overall, this place is a gem....only negative was slow elevators.

Some rooms have a small balcony but ours did not but I would rather spend the time at the beach than on a balcony anyways. There were nice granite countertops and nice new carpet. The front desk will give you a beach towel and that towel service was great. They are also very friendly. Continental breakfast was mini croissants, small muffins, juices, Lipton tea, and coffee (that looks like sludge and tastes awful). If you want to walk to Waikiki beach be sure to cut through the Hilton Hawaiian Village to shorten the walk. You can also walk to the busy touristy part of Waikiki in about 20 minutes (1.2 miles to the Waikiki Shopping Plaza). The bus stop right outside can take you to Ala Moana Center (biggest outdoor mall in the world) and downtown Honolulu. We even took the #42 bus all the way to Pearl Harbor in 40 minutes for just $2. From Honolulu you can also transfer to a bus to go to Bishop Museum. We also got massages at the spa and they were the best ever. Only complaint is the slow elevator and the fact that it is a tad bit further from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki than I would have liked. But for that price, it's fine to walk.","Seattle, WA",17,4.0

In fact, the ONLY room in the hotel with direct access. We were worried the pool would be loud in the evening, but not so.....and it was spring break. The room was recently renovated and is in pristine condition...king bed w/queensize couch pullout which was new and a HUGE room. Even had a breakfast room sized glass top table with three side chairs upholstered in a tropical motif. Very nice indeed. Also, has the small refrigerator, microwave, few dishes, coffee w/maker which is so convenient. Continental breakfast consists of bananas, apples, oranges, orange juice, pineapple juice and coffee.....plus muffins which was plenty for me and served from 7:30AM-9:30AM.On Wednesday we were there for the ""Manager's Reception"" in the Lobby with a band, wine and cheese. Derek who was serving the wine made sure we were well taken care of...what a sweetie..! Front desk personnel were very, very helpful and cheerful.... Location is great just as the other reviews say. I can't address the small rooms since we were upgraded and only on the second floor, so the slow elevator wasn't an issue for us either. We didn't have a car, but we told at checkin the parking rate. Actually I knew that beforehand from their website. If you do book, go on their website and book as that was the cheapest rate I found........look for ""special offers"" or something like that.Yep, we'd sure stay there again -- especially in Room #206...GREAT.

The hotel sits directly across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village on the edge of town. My wife and I celebrated our 25th anniversary in Hawaii and spent the first 3 nights at the Aqua Palms (before going on a 7 day cruise). The hotel is clean and had everything you need, hair dryer, coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator, etc.(the bed was awesome). I read all the positive reviews on here before booking the room and decided to take a chance. NOW, I can tell you first hand they are all 100% true. DON'T waste your money paying $300.00 a night to stay 100 yards closer to the sand. We stayed on the 19th (?) floor and had a great view of the ocean and Diamond Head. Not to mention, when you are walking to the beach you walk next to or through the gardens of the Hilton Village. The staff was friendly and always helpful, especially at the conceirge desk. The clerk (I think his name was Robert) booked an island tour for us. The continental breakfast was all we usually eat anyway, but if you want a complete sit down dining breakfast, a restaurant is next door and gives you a 10% discount if you show your room key. When it was time to leave for our ship, a staff member had a cab waiting for us within 2 minutes. I can't get over how perfect the Aqua Palms made our vacation. Like most of you reading this, you've probably never been to Hawaii and have no idea what to expect other than what you read in reviews.

Only a few blocks from Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana Shopping Center. There's a great little coffee shop just a block away.The rooms are very small! We checked in late and were put in 703. This is the smallest room in the hotel. We requested to be moved and were moved into 809. Still, the room was very, very small. Every third room has a pillar that runs down the front of the hotel and cuts the room size and cuts off the balcony that other rooms have. This was very disappointing. The bath tub in this room was too small to bathe in. There is virtually nowhere to hang clothes or wet towels and there is almost nowhere to set your luggage.There is a nice refrigerator and microwave in each room. There are even dishes to use. However, when you use the dishes they are not replaced. They are only rinsed by housekeeping and put back. This is not sanitary. The room was clean over all and there were very few bugs. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. The pool is miniature and not big enough for swimming. The fitness room has one treadmill and one eliptical machine.The staff is super nice and friendly! Overall this was an average experience for me. The room size was a major problem and there were only two of us. Perhaps this is the best value for the money in Waikiki.

The hotel charges an extra $15 per day to park. You can walk a block over to the beach but have to acces the beach through hotel alleys or through the hotels themselves.

It is away from the mainstram madness of Waikiki which is a plus for me, yet convenient to a number of places. My room looked over the Hilton which a view of the ocean on either side of the rainbow tower and had a nice balcony with e chairs and table. The room was good sized with a most comfortable bed. Climate control was easy and effective. The bathroom was quite small but utilized the space well. I liked the idea of the microwave and refrigerator along with coffee pot. Another complimentary feature that was greatly appreciated was the high speed internet as well as the safe. Both of those items usually feature surcharges at more expensive hotels, but were free here. People have complained about the slow elevators, but they must have fixed the problem by the time I arrived as I rarely had to wait more than 30 seconds for one. Also, regarding the breakfasts - how often do you have any sort of breakfat included with the hotel. For me, coffee, fruit pastries and juice was just fine....and you could have as much as you wanted. Yes,the pool was tiny but provided a sunny and relaxing place to read a boook or take a quick dip. The beach is 5 minutes away. I had a massage and I know therapists can differ, but the massage I received from Dante was one of the best I've had I felt like a new person after getting all those sore spots worked out! Other staff were friendly and very accomodating. This is not a deluxe hotel, but it had some features that are not iincluded in the room rate of more famous establishments.

There were no rooms available but we were told they would put the person in their sister hotel, the Aqua Marina and would move her into the Palms in two days. BAD mistake! The Aqua Marina was a dive: dirty floors, no A/C, bugs, shower not working, rude employees, and the dead bolt was broken. However, being the only option, she kept the room. When we went back in two days the Aqua Palms had again lost her reservation! That was it. We all checked out and fortunitely able to get rooms in the Waikiki Hilton across the street (a very, very nice hotel). The Aqua Palms itself is not that great either. The rooms are adequate, but nothing to write home about. The staff is courteous, but don't go out of their way to help. The elevators are slow (only 3 of them for the whole hotel).

It is across the road from the Hilton Village and a 5 minute walk to the beach. It is on the west end of the main beach stretch and therefore is a cheaper taxi ride to the airport or cruise piers. We stayed both in the back and the front. The front has a better view of city happening below and the ocean, while the back is quieter and looks onto other high rises with a wedge view of Ocean - both are good depending what you want. Also rented a car from Enterprise which is a few blocks away and parked it overnight on the street behind the hotel - you can wall thru next door Holiday Inn roadway to get to back street- it is only street I found that was free - put spots are hard to find free - so it is abit of a want and grap scenario. Bottom line - I travel a lot on business and stay in the Shearton's and Hiltons - but we walked by most of the hotels in the area and unless being on the beach is critical - I feel the Aqua Palms is a great hotel when the money is coming out of your pocket.

Having traveled to numerous U.S. and foreign destinations on a budget and on company expense, I feel I'm qualified to comment on accommodations ranging from the most basic up to a $200/night room. Anything above that is beyond my ken. Since moving away, I've stayed with family/friends whenever I visited Honolulu. This was the first time I actually stayed at a hotel in Waikiki. I visit was in January 2007.The Aqua Palms is a perfectly decent budget hotel with many amenities that the Hiltons and Sheratons have. I chose the location because it's so close to Ala Moana beach and the shopping center. The far end of Ala Moana beach has a great view of Diamond Head to the left with the deep blue ocean and surfers in front of you. If you want to go to Waikiki beach, it's still within easy walking distance, but I'd take a bus or trolley.I opted for the deluxe room, which may be why I have so few complaints. There was ample room with a very firm king-sized bed. Because of all the outdoor activities, I was always able to fall asleep despite its firmness. There was a small balcony facing the Hilton Hawaiian Village (i.e. partial ocean view and a view of Diamond Head) with two chairs and a low table, which caught the morning sun. Actually, this side of the building faces the sun all day. The bathroom was small, but the space was used efficiently. There is enough counter space for all the toiletries you wish to bring. There was even a hairdryer attached to wall. The free use of the in-room safe was a plus. With other hotels, there is a nominal daily fee tacked on to the hotel bill for its use.Note that during my visit, a new Hilton tower was being erected between the Ilikai hotel and the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The noise from the construction did not really bother me for several reasons. I got up at 7 AM; I was hardly ever in my room past 9 AM; I'm used to the noise, being a city dweller. This may be an issue for people who like to sleep in late, however. I expect the construction to continue for at least another three months.Climate control was very good. I actually don't care for the heat/humidity of Hawaii, so I like a pretty cold room. However, there is no fan to vent the humidity in the bathroom so the mirror fogs up. This was not a big deal since I used the attached hairdryer to blow off the condensation.I used the mini-fridge extensively during my stay, but not the coffee-maker or microwave. There are many choices to eat within a one block radius of the hotel. Instead of the breakfast that was available, I went to the ABC Store and bought the fresh fruit pack (which usually had papayas, grapes, and melons). The use of the safe was free and you can get free beach towels for use at the registration desk. I disliked the fact that the television was mounted on the ceiling, since I don't think it would've taken up much space mounted conventionally. I did appreciate that it had a DVD player and I was actually able to watch some DVDs before going to bed at night. Parking was tight, but I've parked in hotels with even worse conditions. I had no difficulty with the parking situation other than the fact that some other drivers were not conscientious enough to park evenly within the stall. The other drawback was the bank of three very slow elevators. At one point, I'd been waiting for about 30 seconds, when I realized I'd forgotten something from my room. I went back, took some time to find it, then headed back to the elevators. I was sure one had come and gone by then, but to my surprise, the light on the call button was still lit! I figure the average wait for an elevator was around one and a half minutes, which really isn't very long in the scheme of things.Most of what I've written has been mentioned by other reviewers. It was based on those reviews that I chose this hotel, in spite of the few bad complaints. I placed my trust in my fellow travellers, stayed at this hotel and was not disappointed. If you're used to budget accommodations, the Aqua Palms shouldn't be a disappointment.

They did their best to accomodate our needs -- however, the room was very tiny, the toilet ran all night, and the television set was ceiling mounted, making it very difficult to watch. The room was clean, and the carpet and drapes were new -- but the furniture was old and shoddy. If you're looking for the lowest priced place to sleep, this will due, although they short sheeted the bed, which further annoyed the situation. Parking fee is high - $15 per day -- and their garage was the tightest I've ever been in. The hotel is centrally located -- the bed was comfortable enough to sleep on -- there was a small fridge, micro, and cups, plates and bowls for 2 -- but, next time, I'll pay another $50.00 and stay in a better quality hotel.","Kailua-Kona, Hawaii",17,2.0

Both rooms were adequate size with comfortable furnishings. Both rooms had a refridgerator, microwave, coffee maker and a lanai large enough for two chairs and a small table. One room was ""pool side"". This room had a great view. It overlooked a park, so there was a nice green space. To the right you could see the ocean between a couple of buildings. The view at night was beautiful with the city lights. This bathroom was small but adequate. The view from the other room, on the ""back side"" was less attractive. Another condo hotel was pretty close - no park to serve as a nice green buffer. But sitting on the lanai was still an enjoyable way to spend an evening. The bathroom in this room was large and well designed. The rooms and public areas were very clean and well maintained. The staff was very nice and helpful. Keali'i was particularly helpful. They are happy to give you towels for the pool (or beach). Your in-room coffee is not restocked, however, if you ask the front desk they will give you additional packets of coffee.

My family stayed here for 5 nights in Nov. 2006. The hotel was clean and nicely decorated. The hotel is located directly across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village on the west side of Waikiki and we had a view of the Hilton and the park. Beach access was a short walk though the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I personally prefer the east side of Waikiki Beach near the Hyatt Regency about 2 miles east (because I like to walk the paved walkway along the oceanfront in the morning). Comparable hotels in that area are typically much more expensive.The hotel offers a basic continental breakfast of muffins and juice. The hotel had a decent pool with a grill on the pool deck for guest use. Our room also had a microwave and refrigerator so we could eat in and save some money instead of always going out to eat. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance (a few blocks) including Outback Steakhouse, Tony Roma's, Red Lobster, Waikiki Cheeseburger, and many locally owned and operated restaurants and coffee shops. There is an ABC convenience store in walking distance right around the corner.Parking costs $15/night which is typical for Waikiki. The parking deck is very tight. Luckily the hotel was not very busy so there was plenty of parking spaces, which was good because we usually used two of them. We had a minivan and it would have been difficult to park if the hotel was busy. I would recommend getting a smaller car if you're traveling during the busy season.If you don't plan on spending much time in your room, why pay big $$$ for it? We paid $99/night plus parking.

If you want to stay away from major beach crowds, stay at the Aqua Palms. You will save money and have a prime beach location. They also have a complimentary breakfast that includes yogurt, juice, and a pastry. They deliver it to your room at the time of your choice or you can pick it up in a to-go bag if you are heading out early that day. We usually had ours delivered (they were always on time or a couple minutes early), but one day we scheduled an early morning trip to Hanauma Bay so we picked it up at the front desk. Perfect little snack! The rooms look exactly how they are in the photos. Also, the staff is great. They have an Expedia activity desk person to help you with booking any activity.

I booked these rooms several months ago requesting 2 beds with each room. My request was confirmed. If you book 2 beds for your room be aware that one of them will be a sleeper sofa. It was only upon arrival and first examination of the 2 rooms that we discovered one bed and a sofa sleeper in each room. The hotel staff claimed a 2 bed/room confirmation is for the second bed to be a sofa sleeper and also claimed the sofa sleepers to be new and in excellent sleeping condition. My son and father shared one room number 412. Son, who weighs about 225 pounds, slept on a sofa sleeper the first night. He said it was the worse bed he's ever slept on. The cross rails cut into his bad back and the innerspring mattress was no thicker than about 4-5 inches. I'm significantly smaller and upon laying on the bed myself put a huge bruise on my elbow from hitting a cross brace. When we filed a complaint we were told there were no other rooms with anything but sleeper sofas for the 2nd bed, they would check into a foam pad from housekeeping - no such foam pad available at this hotel. A sympathetic desk clerk arranged for a rollaway twin bed to be brought to the room and did not charge us the extra $15/night for it's use. My son slept much more comfortable on the rollaway bed.I stayed in room number 714, a studio, and since my traveling partner expected to use the 2nd bed couldn't make the trip I had plenty of room. The room was obviously remodeled in the past couple of years and was fairly comfortable. But when the air conditioning activated it sounded like a hurricane going through the room. The thermostat allows the temperature setting but not the fan speed. Given it's warm in Hawaii there is a need for air conditioning. Everytime it turned on in the middle of the night it woke me up.On the last night I was there I moved to another room, giving my room to my son's arriving wife and child for their remaining 3 day stay. The new room, number 720 just down the hall was very similar and had a much quieter air conditioner.The rooms are basic studios with the single bed, sofa sleeper, nice flat panel tv, granite countertops, microwave, decent sized fridge, and a coffeepot (flat bottom filters).I also had an interaction with the Monday-Friday ""Manager of Reservations"" located at this hotel when I tried to book the single room for one night. He was pretty nasty at me, quoted a rate, and said ""take it or leave it"". He needs advanced training in better customer relations skills. The remaining front desk staff were all very professional and helpful, especially Sergio and Ginger.My family didn't partake in the morning continental breakfast for many reasons. One of which was the availability not being in a breakfast room but in the lobby, meaning any person wanting a seat pretty much had to fight for it. I solved the problem with the purchase of single serving cereal boxes, a quart of milk from the very conveniently located ABC around the corner. Grab a banana or two from their bowl and you're set to go. I also brought extra coffee pot filters and purchased a 1/2 pound bag of Starbucks pre-ground to use in my room.You can't beat the location of the Aqua Palms. It's right across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. If you're attending a conference at the HHV and want to save a few bucks on a hotel room it's the ideal place to stay. Starbucks, McDonalds, and Subway are a block down on the same side of the street. ABC is just around the corner. One of the trolley lines stops right in the front of the hotel and can take you to the Ala Moana Shopping Center for $2.00 each way (although it's a walk of only 1/2 mile or so).The parking is very reasonably priced at $15.00/day. Although the spaces are close together and it's a tight garage it is secured with gated keycard entry. The reported street noise on the front side of the building is very true, but I never heard any wild parties going on from that level. It's basic automobile traffic, and if you're used to that from living on a busy street you will be okay. In-room internet access is free, and a cord is provided on the desk.I'd stay at this hotel again only if I required a single bed in a large room with comfortable surroundings. You can't beat the price for the location. But be aware of the ""rough edges"", especially confirm and double confirm if you're really getting two beds. Their definition of two beds is very different from what most travelers expect.","Santa Rosa, California",30,2.0

Yes, location is good...walking distance to Ala Moana shopping center, Waikiki main drag, restaurants, busses/trolleys, etc.Yes, the price is VERY reasonable for Hawaii. BUT, I have to agree with one review who alluded to the fact that after you leave the comfortable lobby, it goes downhill.We checked into a non-smoking room, only to walk into the room and barely be able to breathe - it was like someone who smoked had been living in there until just prior to our arrival. When I called the front desk, they first (rudely) pointed out that it WAS a non-smoking room, but then directed me to housekeeping who said they could bring a machine up to remove the smell. I've not heard of such a thing, but thought we'd give it a try since we'd be away from the room for a few hours. Either there is no such thing, such thing was not effective, or no one ever came up. When we returned a number of hours later (probably around 11pm), the room still reeked. We called downstairs and there was one room available, so we had to go down to get the key and check it out. We walked in and there was no smell (thank goodness!), so then went back downstairs to tell the desk clerk that we'd take it (who made us promise that we hadn't made the first room dirty?!), but we would need to move our stuff (which was still in the smoke room). We got back up there to realize that he had deactivated our original key, so by the time we got up there to get our stuff, we were locked out and had to make an additional trip downstairs, then back up, etc. It was a HUGE hassle.Definitely forego the ocean/Diamond Head view...it is VERY noisy on that side of the building, some rooms have an actual lanai that would fit a chair and others are the cement ledge that barely fits one foot.Finally, regarding the Spa - my sister-in-law and I scheduled massages for the end of our trip. When I called, I was assured that there would be a place for us to shower (as we were leaving for the airport and would have already checked out). We also scheduled it so we were at the same time, no biggie. The first clue that we were in for an interesting experience was that we got to the 2nd floor and needed a key to access the pool (through which was the Spa entrance), so that required (yet another) trip to the front desk. Once inside, we were asked to pay first - something I have NEVER done in many a spa visit. TACKY! My massage was fine, but my sister-in-law had a TERRIBLE hot stone massage - pressure was inconsistent and the woman was frantic. Not to mention, when mine was done, I was trying to be as quiet as possible so as not to disturb my sister-in-law (little did I know, she was suffering in silence), but the 'massage therapists' talked not just in normal voices, but loudly to me and each other. This was not quite the relaxing experience we had in mind for our last bit of Hawaii.If we ever make it back to Honolulu we will look elsewhere for accommodations and spas.","Portland, Oregon",10,2.0

The hotel has been renovated a year ago, all the rooms are the same with kitchenette (stainless steel microwave oven, and refrigerator). It is a great location if you don’t want to be in the “heart of Waikiki” and rather walk a little if you feel like you want to be there. Across the street is the Hilton Hawaiian Village; at the end of the block is one of the best Thai restaurants of Honolulu and Todai Buffet. The rooms are nice, extremely clean; the stuff is very friendly and helpful. The morning breakfast is muffins and juice, nothing special, but we enjoyed it. The local newspaper is free in the hotel, I liked that I had something to read on the beach. We were very satisfied and had no problems with the parking (we rented a Jeep Wrangler) I think this is one of the best Waikiki hotels for the price!

My wife and I stayed at the Aqua Palms with our baby at the end of August and start of September. This is a budget hotel. The positive reviews it receives are no doubt based largely on its low rates. We spent our first 6 nights in Honolulu at the Hawaiian Prince Hotel and it was far superior to the Aqua Palms. It was also approximately 50% more expensive. If you are looking for a budget place with minimal amenities and relatively small but well furnished rooms Aqua Palms could be for you. If budget is not your primary concern, then you may want to stay elsewhere. PositivesThe hotel location is good for Waikiki and it has been recently renovated. The staff were friendly. The rooms are well decorated. Having a balcony was nice. We stayed on the west side of the building, which was fairly quiet. The price was surprisingly low. NegativesThe hotel could have been cleaner. The hallways do not appear to be air conditioned. The elevators are very slow and are often used by hotel staff for service purposes. There is no room service and no restaurant on site but there are a number of restaurants nearby. The pool is small and there is no shade nearby. We are not usually too concerned with room service or the quality of the pool but if you have children you may be more likely to appreciate these amenities. The staff was less than competent on certain occasions. We never received housekeeping service a couple of days because we returned after 2:00p.m. to give our baby a nap and found the housekeeper had not made up the room. We were told that the housekeepers went home at approx. 4:00 so we never had time for them to attend. Leaving the sign on the door or speaking with the housekeeper upon departure did not appear to help. We also had trouble with the DND on the phone. When we spoke to the front desk about the issue they called us to see if it was working. This woke our baby. A couple of days later housekeeping called on the phone to note that we had our DND sign on our door and asked if we wanted maid service, again waking our baby. We decided to unplug the phone whenever the baby was sleeping. These are not issues you would expect encounter at a four star hotel. ConclusionThis hotel is ok for the money but it is not without its problems. Perhaps at these prices you can live with them. I have to admit that my wife would not have been as generous with the rating.","Calgary, AB",9,3.0

Given the poor reviews of the airport hotels on Tripadvisor, and the relatively positive ones for this hotel, we decided it would be worth schlepping downtown (and it was).The Aqua Palms is a very good value. For about $100 per night, we got a a decent, clean room with a sofa and writing table. The bed was a bit lumpy, the sheets a bit scratchy, the decor a bit cheesy, the floors a bit dirty and the balcony a bit small. But all acceptable, especially given the price. Where the Aqua Palms really distinguished itself was the service. When we arrived (almost at midnight), the front desk clerk (Larry) was friendly and got someone to help us with our bags. He arranged for a 6 am wake-up call and a called us a cab.

We read the reviews at TripAdvisor and felt confident we would be satisfied with the quality of the hotel.We stayed on the 8th floor.

The room had recently been updated and was nicely decorated. The fridge and microwave were nice. It even came with plates & utensils (although one of the utensil sets was missing).

The Exercise room was decent, we used it twice. We never visited the spa.Our one major complaint -- The hotel’s website claimed to have services that we never received or witnessed others receiving:• Welcome Oshibori (cool towel) upon arrival at check-in -- We did not receive this at check-in, they did give us beach towels though.• Complimentary Continental Breakfast delivered daily to your room or to-go bag for added convenience -- We had to go to the lobby for the breakfast and it was difficult to find seating. The continental breakfast was lacking, just juice, muffins & fruit (banana, orange or apple – no tropical fruit like you would expect). • Complimentary Coffee & Tea Service in the Lobby 7:30am-Noon -- We never saw it. We don’t drink tea or coffee, so it didn’t affect us, but did hear some complaints. In fact we saw people paying $2 for a cup of coffee out of a machine at breakfast. (there is a coffee-maker & cofee packets in the room).• Daily turndown service with orchid on departure night -- We received the daily turn-down service, but never got the orchid.We also thought the parking fee of $15 was pricey considering the parking garage was hard to access even in our small sports car (we still can't figure out how the SUV's managed the tight corners) and condition of the garage itself.The maids were very helpful and left out room in excellent condition.The price, the quality of the room and the good maid service made up for what was lacking in other areas.

The current Aqua Palms reviews are far and above 'more positive' than what we experienced. Our recent 5 day stay at the Aqua Palms was much different than the majority of other traveler's reviews here. We found the lobby to be beautiful and the staff very friendly and kind, several great restaurant choices (all within walking distance), but that is where the ""good stuff"" sadly ends. Our reservation was for a deluxe ocean view room with TWO Queen beds... during check-in we were given a room that had ONE actual Queen ""bed"" and a ONE Queen pull out sofa bed. Upon inquiry, the staff insisted that the room did indeed have the TWO Queen beds that we'd reserved (far, far in advance I might add), saying ""it's just that ONE is a bed and ""the SECOND is right there in the pull out sofa."" They were adamant that the room description was absolutely accurate because the room did have TWO Queen beds... we really needed the second 'bed' to be a ""real"" bed/mattress as we were traveling with our 2 nearly adult sized teenage children. Sleeping 4 nights on the standard 2 or 3 inch pad over springs is not an experience that is pleasant or relaxing. The ""deluxe"" ocean view is blocks away and minimally visible through neighboring buildings and construction equipment etc. This ""deluxe"" room mentioned a balcony - it was actually sort of a foot wide cement ledge. The noise on the ""deluxe"" view side of the hotel is unbelievably loud as there are about six or eight lanes of traffic directly in front of this property. That, combined with the constant construction and heavy equipment noise leads to a very non-relaxing atmosphere within the room. Add the incredibly loud air conditioner fan volume within the tiny room and you have an experience that is a true exercise in patience and tolerance to say the least. Breakfast was dismal... tiny pound-cake type muffins(?) with either nuts or raisins stuck to the tops of each one, fruit, small cups of juice. If you'd like coffee/hot chocolate etc., it is $2.00 per cup and is dispensed out of a vending type machine. Hmmmm... the rock hard beds, cockroaches in the halls, tiny extremely noisy street side pool with old, stained holey (sp?) deck furniture, aqua plastic accordian type headboards with hair and sticky ?? stuff caked on/in the ridges, blood spots remaining on the bathroom floor for the entire 5 day stay etc.are all issues that can and should addressed by management.We would not recommend staying at the Aqua Palms if you are looking for clean, quiet and comfortable - all of which we prefer when vacationing - especially in Hawaii!",Idaho,16,1.0

Round trip from SFO + 3 nights at Aqua Palms $368. Airfare alone was $300 so we really made out (Expedia.) A cousin told me that Aqua is not the best chain of hotels and that I would probably see Dog the Bounty Hunter running through the hallway. At $368 we really didn’t care and braced ourselves for the worst. We were in for a pleasant surprise. Check in was a breeze and our room was clean and even came with a mini balcony. The location was awesome. It was just far enough from the hustle and bustle but close enough to stumble back when you’ve had a tad too much to drink. We rented a car but only really used it one day to cruise the island and souvenir shop at Wal-Mart and Costco (way cheaper than the ABC stores.) The rooms are pretty comfortable and not at all like the Motel 6 I imagined it would be. It was perfect for two people with two queen beds but if you add kid(s) or perhaps another adult that would definitely be pushing it.,San Francisco,2,4.0

We are frugal travelers but like 3 & 4 star hotels if we can. We had stayed the week before on business at another place: Ocean Resort at the other end of Waikiki. That place was terrible compared to this. See that write up also if you are interested in a cheaper place. Back to the Aqua Palms. I made the reservation based on Trip Advisor members, from AAA at a rate of $125/night. The beds were very comfortable and I am very picky. We had a studio deluxe on the 9th floor with a wonderful view overlooking a park, Hilton Hawaiian Village, the ocean, and Diamond Head mtn. Our room had a small refrigerator and microwave. We had a King bed, small table, small desk, and large sleeper couch. The room also has a large chest of drawers, small closet next to the bathroom. The bathroom was small in that the door opening and closing didn't give you much room to stand. The counter was nice and long at the sink. The sink was in the same room with the toilet and full length tub/shower. The microwave/refrigerator and closet were next to the bathroom by the front door. The closet has extra pillows and ironing board/iron. The bathroom had a hair dryer. The kitchen area did have a small cupboard. There was a small 4 cup coffee pot with free coffee provided the first night. You can purchase more coffee pods at the front desk for $1.59 each. It was 10% Kona but was good. The other 90% was arabica beans so I couldn't complain. Nothing was provided except for two small microwavable containers. I didn't expect that so was pleasantly surprised. The couch was very comfortable for sitting and for lounging stretched out. We didn't try pulling out the sleeper bed. The hotel is a smaller complex which I wanted. The rooms have room darkening drapes (needed to block out the early morning sun and the heat of the sun in the afternoon.) We were there right before the earthquakes hit. We stayed Oct. 9-13 and the earthquakes came Oct. 15. It was very hot and humid and even the locals complained. But our air conditioning kept us comfortable. The TV is high on the wall and had a great picture.The room also had free internet though a broadband connection.Parking is $15/day just like about every hotel. Parking was not too tight. We had a rental car from Hertz - Subaru Forester and had no problems fitting anywhere. Nearby restaurants - 1 block away was where we ate: Outback Steakhouse, and Red Lobster. Across the street is the Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV) where we took in a poolside show one evening and also watched the sunset. We also strolled the many shops there and bought a few souvenirs - better quality and choices than the ABC stores on every block in Waikiki. The do have some of the same things as ABC, so check there too for better prices on many items. In fact I found body gels and lotions priced differently at two different stores in HHV. One store offered them $2 more each. So, you never know. By the way, I purchased several coffees (10% and 100% varieties) at ABC store & another grocery store on Lanai, to take home. The best is 100% Kona from Ferrari - Hawaii Mountain Gold. I will be ordering more from their included order card I found in the package or off the internet.","Denver, Colorado",37,4.0

We shopped around online and found the best rate, then rang Aqua Palms and they beat it by 10% We ended up paying around $126 per night, with the fifth night free. Fantastic value! Our check-in experience was not the best - while the majority of staff are very friendly and go out of their way to be helpful, we found ourselves at the mercy of an older woman with glasses who didn't dein to look up and answer our rquest to check in 30 minutes early. She simply walked off into the back room and said ""they're not ready yet"". The rest of the experience was fantastic. The room was spotless, and the decor, while typically bright colours, was first rate. There is a TV/DVD player, small bathroom, kitchenette with minifridge. Our breakfast pastry was just fine, although it tended to be the same thing every day, which was no bother. We only had the 2-foot lanai but in truth it's so warm and the street below busy, you will not want to be sitting on the balcony below. The proximity to the beach is excellent, a 5 minute walk through the Hilton. The trolley to the Ala Moana mall (do not miss it!) stops right outside the hotel, or would be a 10 minute walk. The location is nice because you are just that little further out of the craziness of the main strip, whilst everything is in walking distance. Most days we walked to the other end of the beach and the surroundings are so nice, it's not a hassle at all. I would definitely go back if I could get a similar deal to previous.

This was our first time in Hawaii and we were happy to see that all of the hotel staff were very very friendly and accomodating at all times. The room was quiet and very clean, our bed was big and very comfortable, and the microwave and small refridgerator came in handy. We never heard any noise from other rooms and the only time we heard construction noise (they are doing construction across the street) was when we kept the door to the lanai open. Our room had it's own AC control so we could stay as cool as we needed to in our room, but the temperature in the hallways was pretty hot.The elevators are quite slow, but there are three of them so we didn't have to wait too long to get on one at any point. The free breakfast of danish, yogurt and juice was a nice touch and we liked the fact that we could either have it delivered to our room or take it ""to go"" on the days when we were heading out early for various island tours. The pool was a bit small but we never used it because we preferred to go to the beach, which was a short walk away via the Hilton Hawaiian Village across the street (the lobby of that hotel has a lot of cool birds and fish, so it's definitely worth walking though). The front desk at Aqua Palms gave us free use of beach towels anytime we needed them, so that was a great bonus.The 24-hour coffee shop next door had really great food which was dirt cheap (cheaper than McDonald's) and if you mentioned that you were staying at the Aqua Palms and showed them your room key, you would get an extra 10% off!We never rented a car, so the bus system came in quite handy for us, it was affordable and it took us anywhere we needed to go.Since the hotel is located a fair bit away from the heart of Waikiki, we were always either the very first or the very last hotel to get picked up and dropped off from for the various tours and fishing trips that we took (they all provided transportation to and from the hotel).For those on a budget, there are coupons everywhere!

There is a bus stop a few steps from the front door of the hotelThe bed was comfortable, view was nice, and I had a basic room...I could see to the Ocean. I also could see the construction. It didn't wake me, nor did I hear much of it untill the beach (see below about that) The breakfast was delivered each morning to my room, pastry, yogurt, and juice. And a paper was offered at the same time (not the Sunday) The room included a microwave,coffee maker, and small refg. They even washed my coffee mugs when they did the cleaning. The bathroom has the curved shower curtain rod to give a more spacious feel, and granite countertops. The shower was clean, hot, and the water pressure was good. The AC worked fine in my room, not too loud, the hall ways are warm.The front desk staff was great, very friendly! The bell boys were super helpful! The beach is a short walk, but if you want quiet on the beach away from the construction walk down a little bit further, as the noise it kind of annoying. The pool is on the second floor, quiet most of the time and only 4' deep at the deepest end. I didn't try any of the spa services, and it didn't look like they were very busy. The hotel in general seemed clean, and they get a B for decor, this coming from an Interior Designer. I think they made a good effort at a resort look. Usually better decor = more costly accommodations, that being said...I feel they found a good mix for an enjoyable reasonably priced stay. I would defiantly consider staying again.",PA,10,5.0

I was here to help my dad in the hospital so I just wanted an inexpensive room that didn't require driving into the heart of Waikiki. I had a queen bed with couch, room also had a lanai, frig and microwave. King size bed rooms don't have a lanai, just a small ""juliet"" balcony. Couch was a very nice touch, made for a fairly roomy room. Clean, good A/C, parking lot does have tight ramps and turns but not as bad as the reviews make it sound. All day coffee and tea in the lobby is a nice touch, I didn't try the room service delivery of continental breakfast. Pool is a joke, so small with very few lounge chairs. Much better to cross the street and hit the beach at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. For the price (under $100) I thought it was great. I wouldn't pay more than that - for over $100 I expect a real pool and poolside service and outdoors restaurant.

(I've attached views of the ocean and Diamondhead from our window). Personally, I should have listened to other reviewers who said the same about the ocean view.Pros:* Within walking distance to Ala Moana shopping center (about 3 blocks), and the local trolley/bus line stops right in front of the hotel.* Waikiki beach is within a couple of blocks - just walk through the Hilton Hawaiian complex to the waterline.* At the edge of Waikiki, so traffic isn't too bad around the hotel compared to further into Waikiki.* Nice TV with DVD player (if you bring your own DVDs).* Small refrigerator.Cons:* Major construction is going on at the Hilton complex across the street. They start working around 6AMish, and continue to 5PM. Don't even think about taking a nap in the room during this time. (My sister had a room on the other side of the hotel away from the ocean view, and could hear the construction.) * The king size bed was very hard.* The A/C cycles loudly on/off. When the A/C was on, it would cover the street noise. There was no fan mode on the A/C. Most of the street noise died off around 10PM.* Bathroom was small, and does not have a ventilation fan - so its gets pretty steamy after taking a shower.* Breakfast buffet consisted of a sweet roll or muffin, yogurt and juice. The muffin and yogurt are very sweet, so make sure you brush your teeth thoroughly afterwards!* Our ocean view room did not have a balcony, just a sliding door with a small 1 ft ledge. It appeared that the rooms on the end of the floor had a balcony overlooking the street.* We arrived at 2:40PM, and they wouldn't let us check in until 3PM.* Parking is $15/day (which is about average), but the structure is very tight. If you have anything larger than a compact, be careful!Would we stay again - maybe in about a year after the construction is completed.

This hotel is for you. If you are wanting a hotel with all the little extras, do not book this hotel. I was there for part of my honeymoon in July and was so disappointed. I had read the reviews and research the hotel on the internet. It claimed to serve a breakfast to your room, deliver a paper to your room, and be brief walk to the beach. The breakfast is in the lobby. I know many hotels do serve in the lobby, but they don't claim to have in the room. I didn't receive a Sunday paper. When I called to ask why , they respond by saying they don't deliver the Sunday paper. The real bad part was construction going on across the street. It was so loud early in the morining. I know they can't help what other hotels are doing, but they could mention it on their website. I think I brief statement about construction would be helpful to future customers. The construction also blocks quick beach access. You should expect about 10 minute walk . I also booked a massage for two. They overbooked. My husband and I were sent to aqua bamboo(about 1 mile away). We did agree to go. We were told to come down for a cab about 6:30 p.m. and didn't get to leave to after 7. I hate to admit I like the Bamboo hotel better. The deluxe view is not woth the money. I know these are small things, but they are reason I booked the hotel over others with miltary discounts. I thought the attention to detail would overcome the fact it was away from the beach. It wasn't. Tripadvisor did exactly job on the rest of my stay in Hawaii at maui and big island.

It is a hotel, NOT a resort - i.e. no formal sitting room beyond 2 chairs and a small table, 12 inch balcony, has 10% Kona Coffee maker in room and a small sink/kitchenette space. Our room faced away from Ala Moana Blvd, with a view of neighboring buildings rather than the beach or park across the street on the opposite side.-good location. close to the Ala Moana shopping center (5 blocks away), across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village (with shops, restaurants, and the nicest strip of Waikiki beach to walk along in the evening - you can see the whole city reflected in the water), 20-30 minute walk to the International Marketplace and Royal Hawaiian hotel.-good price. resorts across the street & further down Waikiki charge twice as much for location and beach views alone. staying at the Aqua Palms lets you access these locations for less, but if you're big on remaining inside your hotel room, sitting on your lanai and passing the time, this is not the hotel for you. -friendly staff. they give you the option to pick up your daily continental breakfast or have it delivered to your room (2 yogurt cups, a danish and/or muffin, bottled water or juice).-little traffic compared to the heart of WaikikiWorst:-the parking garage is narrow. we recommend the most compact car you can get away with because the turns at each floor are tight. they charge $15/day parking (which is comparable to or better than other garages on Waikiki).-it is NOT a resort; if you expect a restaurant in the hotel you will be disappointed. However, they have many restaurants at the Hilton Hawaiian Village across the street, shopping center 1-2 blocks away (they give you a coupon book for many of these), coffee shop 2 doors down, and the Ala Moana Center 5 blocks away.I would definitely stay at Aqua Palms again. It is a great place if we were looking for a clean, well-kept, moderately priced hotel, well-situated to enjoy Waikiki and the rest of Oahu.

I reserved the top-tier room, with partial ocean view, but the room I was assigned had a lousy view of construction and only a juliet balcony (i.e. railing without a proper balcony ledge). I asked to change rooms, and they were very nice about letting me see another room before deciding whether to move my luggage. I wound up two floors higher, closer to the park, with a much better ocean view, and with a real lanai.- Breakfast is a lowfat fruit yogurt and a cheese-and-fruit danish. They tend to run out of yogurt and replace it with an extra little muffin. The canned ""juice"" however is actually like fruit punch. It's about 30% juice and the rest corn syrup and water. I asked them to skip on the juice and got bottled water, which seemed a step up.- Ala Moana Blvd. (ocean view side) is quite busy, and for now there is construction across the street at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. If you ask downstairs they can give you a paper clip to clip together the curtains.- I got a free tote bag on check-in for registering with the Expedia!Fun concierge desk. It's convenient to use their service, but they will definitely NOT get you the best deals. E.g., I went snorkeling in Hanauma Bay and it cost $21 for dry snorkel while other tour operators charge $12. (That's before the $5 park entrance fee.) I asked for a better price at the Expedia desk and she said that the only other one she could book was $2 cheaper.- There is 10% Kona blend coffee in the room and toiletries (shampoo, lotion, oatmeal soap) are all made in Hawaii.- They give you a 50% off dining coupon book when you get there, which has some decent deals, like buy-one-get-one at Subway and half-off the very good pizza at Harbor Pub two blocks away.- Retail and dining on the same block:Wailana Coffee House (not-great diner, but affordable for Waikiki and you get 10% off for staying at Aqua Palms)McDonald'sStarbucksSubwaycandy shopFox and Hounds pub/cantinaAloha Sushi (has 99-cent rolls and bubble tea drinks)Shanghai Bistro (very expensive but they have 50% off select appetizers 4-6 p.m.)Capriocciosa pasta and pizza (about $14 for pizza)Kobe steak houseBig ABC convenience store",usa,44,5.0

However, it was not what we expected. Our reservations for a deluxe studio with king bed -- paid for upon booking -- ended up to be a queen bed with a balcony that was literally 12 inches deep. Albeit, we were travelling on Memorial Day weekend, so the hotel was pretty booked up.Upon a friendly and speedy check in, we opened the slider doors that lead to the balcony in our room, and could clearly see into the windows to the left of us -- below and above -- where people wait for an elevator on those floors. That meant other guests could see US in our room! I don't wear clothes in my room and therefore didn't wish to give everyone a peep show while they wait for an elevator, so we inquired about alternate accommodations. They kindly gave us keys to view another room, but it was smaller and the headboard of the bed was backside the elevator shaft. That wasn't going to suffice due to the noise, so we inquired about yet another room and ended up with a studio deluxe with a queen bed on the 10th floor with a want-to-be balcony that my foot barely fit on from toe to heel (woman's size 9).For the same price as the private condo in Kona and the B&B cottage we stayed in near the volcano on the Big Island a few days prior, we were disappointed.At 6:00 am we awoke from our sleep by a lady talking on her cell phone on a regular-size balcony next to us, below. It must be what they call a lanai because it had 2 chairs and a small table. It was annoying because we wished to sleep in longer. She must have phoned everyone she knows that morning from her balcony and would not shut up. We closed the slider, but could still hear her. There was also traffic and bus noise from the boulevard below. Not very peaceful. I've stayed in quieter hotels in downtown Los Angeles.On the positive side, there were no bugs, it was clean and had good water pressure and central air conditioning, which worked most of the time. The hotel is not far from the beach (easy walking distance), had a nice view of the Hilton's roof, but very little ocean view between the Hilton towers across the street. Perhaps it was a much better view of the ocean before the Hilton was built? The photos of the pool area on their website are deceiving. It looks like it's on the roof top with a great view of the city. Try again. It was below us, probably at the 3rd or 4th floor near the noisy boulevard.There were no ice machines on the floors we visited.The parking is very tight. Don't rent a truck or long vehicle if you plan to park there. We rented a convertible Sebring and it was fine, but we had to be careful not to hit the wall making a turn in the garage parking lot. Yes, it's $15 per night, but they have security in the parking garage.The staff was friendly and tried to be as accommodating as possible, I just believe the hotel is not exactly as presented to the public via advertising. Somewhat deceiving.We spent more time across the street at the Hilton grounds than we did at the Aqua Palms, to access the beach and roam the Hilton's various shops. We ate a late dinner at the Singha Thai Restaurant at the nearest corner on Ala Moana Boulevard. Very good food with excellent service and is open late.In a future visit, if our budget were limited, I would probably stay at the Aqua Palms again (short term), but if our budget permitted, I would definately pick better accommodations.","Ventura, CA",33,3.0

What a great condo hotel! We booked our rooms over the phone after reading some great reviews here on Trip Advisor. The room was a great deal (about $150. per night including tax) and the location was SUPER! This was a pre-cruise stay for us as we were leaving on the Pride of America for a 7 night cruise of the Hawaiian Islands. We couldn't have been more pleased with our 9th floor end room. We had a SUPER view of Diamond Head and nice views of the ocean and beach around several buildings. We were directly across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village and walked over there to see their fabulous Polynesian show on Friday night as well as the fireworks! Our room was very clean and comfortable with a great king sized bed. The coffee maker in the room, as well as the free continental breakfast either delivered to our room at the time we picked or available for pick-up at the front desk on an early morning was a nice touch. I don't think everyone was offered this free breakfast, but I asked for it when making reservations and so we got it both days.The Bus (the city bus line) has a stop right in front of the hotel. Very convenient and just $2. per ride which includes one transfer! We took it to go to Pearl Harbor and to the entrance of Diamond Head. Both outings were well worth our time. Pearl Harbor was very moving and we are so glad we went to see it. If you take the trek up Diamond Head be sure and take water and go early as it gets quite warm and is not recommended if you are not physically up to the challenge of climbing several hundred steps! The way down is a breeze, but that climb up - 8/10 of a mile but seems longer - left me winded and panting and I am in good physical condition! The lobby of the Palms, though small, is very lovely and well done. The elevators are a bit slow and the hallways hot, but our room was perfect! We saved a bundle over the cost pf similar hotels in the area and it is so well located. Close to the Ala Moana Shopping Mall and the beach on Waikiki! We walked the beach all the way from in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village to the statue of Duke Kamehameha where they have a live web cam and you can call back home and they can see you on their computer in real time there at the statue! Just have them google 'Live web cam Waikiki' and the first picture that comes up is there at the staue! Very cool!A stay at Aqua Palm is really great! You will not be disappointed with these top-notch accommodations on Waikiki.","Flagler Beach, Florida",96,5.0

We really wanted to write a review in return for all the help TripAdvisor gave us. Anyway, before my wife and I went on our honeymoon, we reviewed this site extensively for the best accommodation at the fairest price. We definitely hit the mark with the Aqua Palms. Most people had nothing but good things to say about the Palms, and we agree. It was great, but keep in mind with economy, you don't get four stars. What you do get is a nice place to stay and value for your dollar.We stayed on the Ala Moana side, across from the Hilton Village on the 5th floor. We had wonderful city views, with a partial ocean view to the extreme right. The hotel underwent renovations within the last year or two. Everything was clean with comfortable beds and reno'd bathroom with nice tile and countertops. The room had a microwave and little fridge to keep the beer cold. Plus a safe for all the valuables. Every morning we got a small breakfast package with local canned juice, a danish and a yogurt. It won't fill you up, but it gets you started for those early tours, and it's complimentary. The pool is small and not heated but who cares. You're in Hawai'i.We shopped around for the best internet price. Although there were cheaper, Bookit had the best price with a room upgrade to a Superior Studio. We paid approx. $150 canadian/night including taxes for 10 nights, averaged with two free nights (every fifth was free). You can't beat that for a nice, clean, friendly hotel on the edge of Waikiki.The hotel as an Expedia rep in the lobby that will book anything that you want from several different tour companies, which was real convenient. She would know the pros and cons of each company, best prices, best departure times. It's like ""I want to go to Pearl Harbor."" You just go down to the lobby and Sheila (usually) would set everything up for you for the next day or whenever. Fantastic.The hotel is about a 15-20 min walk from Ala Moana shopping mall for everything you need, and there is always an ABC store right around the corner. If you use travelers cheques, go to ABC, they'll cash any denomination no problem and always with a smile. If you are a history buff, check out the Fort DeRussy museum on a rainy day, just a short walk away, admission by donation. The bus system is great and it takes you anywhere easy. To get to the beach, just walk 5-10 min through the Hilton Village and use the beach there. All beaches in Hawai'i are public. See how the other half lives!!We would highly recommend the Aqua Palms. Nothing fancy, but good and clean. Hard qualities to find in Waikiki on a budget. We will definitely stay there again. Aloha and Mahalo!!","Vanderhoof, BC, Canada",17,4.0

We chose the Aqua Palms after reading several Trip Advisor reviews and doing some price-comparisons online. This hotel was a great value. Yes, the rooms are tiny (like a shoebox compared to the next hotel we stayed at), but they were clean, the staff was incredibly friendly and they even had a small continental breakfast boxed up for us the next morning as we left for Pearl Harbor. For the approximately $130 we spent for one night here, I don't think we would have found a better deal. We were exhausted from travel, so there was no point in staying at a pricey beachfront hotel. I'd even stay here longer if I return to Oahu. It's basic, but it's clean and affordable. My only complaint is that it wasn't super well marked; we had to circle the block a few times before finding the hotel and its parking garage.",New York,45,4.0

We booked two rooms, one with a king and one with two queens. The rooms were on the 7th floor and faced the street. To address comments from previous reviews:* There is definitely traffic noise from Ala Moana Blvd. and the rooms are not very sound proof. If one is bothered by city traffic noise, be sure to ask for a room on the other side.* Do NOT get a room near the elevators. We did not encounter this problem, but met some folks who had to move rooms because of elevator noise.* The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. One young lady remembered my name and addressed us every time we came through the lobby.* The elevators have not been renovated, and there are only three. However, we did not wait any longer than 3-4 minutes at any given time.*The pool is small, but clean and pleasant for a swim. The beach is only a two block walk through Hilton H.V.*Yes, parking is indeed rather tight, so if you have worries, be sure to rent a small car. We rented a Honda Pilot and had little trouble.*Location of this hotel is awesome. We really liked not being in the heart of Waikiki and away from the major traffic. *The 24 hour coffee house next door (Wailana Coffee House) is very good. We also ate at Cheeseburger Waikiki just down the street and the Chart House around the corner. A McDonalds and Subway are just down the street as well (this made our two teenagers very happy!)We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. With the money we saved on room rates, we were able to do a Helicopter Tour and Swim with the Sharks on the North Shore (that was one INCREDIBLE experience).

We checked in promptly at 3pm and were upgraded to a partial-ocean view room facing Ala Moana Blvd. as our intended room was not ready. The view was nice; however, light sleepers should beware. The traffic noise is considerable and the rooms are not soundproofed. The room itself was nicely updated, stylish and clean. The bed was among the most comfortable I have slept on. As other reviewers have noted, the location is good; on the edge of Waikiki, convenient to everything, yet not smack in the middle of all the craziness. Do take advantage of the 10% discount offered to all hotel guests at the coffee shop next door. It is an old-school classic and recently named by Honolulu Weekly as one of the 3 best 24-hour diners on the island.

The weather couldn't have been better! The hotel is small but charming with an inviting lobby. Check in and Check out was super fast. I've read about issues with the elevators and we have NO problems at all with any of the 3 elevators. Front desk and maid service was extremely efficient. The free breakfast was not too bad. No problems with the air conditiong as stated by previous posters but I did notice that if you open the door to your room then the AC stops but will resume when you close the door shut! We had a studio facing the street with a fantastic view of the park and the Hilton Hawaiin Village. The hotel is a short bus ride to Kuhio Avenue where all the action is. Within walking distance from the hotel is the Ala Moana shopping center. The food at the mall was great and not your typical ""food court"". I do wish the pool area at the hotel had more lounge seating. They only had 4 but there seemed to be plenty of room for more. The pool area had about 6 regular chairs, a dining table, and a barbeque.

Probably about a 15-20 min into Waikiki and the Ala Moana Shopping Center. Continental Breakfast is a little more than a child's snack pack (Danish, Warm Juice, Yogurt). Eggs 'n' Things is about a 5-10 min walk. Great food, good prices, you can't go wrong. When we first arrived, we were given a room that wasn't cleaned properly, so we were promptly accomodated to a different room. However, the room we got was adjacent to the elevators which kept us up all night. Not what you expect especially since we arrived a few hours prior. In the morning we complained again. We were moved to a lower floor, but the room was much better, clean, and spacious. If you plan to rent a car, don't bother renting from the hotel agent. We were able to find much better rates just outside Waikiki (Enterprise rent a car on Ala Moana Blvd. near the Honda dealership). Parking will cost you $15.00/night.

As mentioned in previous reviews, the bathroom and closet are small, but the bathroom is quite elegant. We dined twice at the Walilana Coffee House next door.

I extensivley researched to find a decent hotel for a resonable price, and for the most part Aqua Palms fit the bill. First of all, some of the pictures on various websites are misleading. They make the lobby look big and spacious, however this is not the case. It's not a cave or anything but it is snug. The parking garage is a tight squeeze you might have issues if you're driving a bigger SUV. We had a honda pilot and managed just fine. There is always a parking garage attendant in the parking garage that checks you in and out each time, it's a bit annoying but worth the extra security. Parking is $15.00 a day, but seems about average for Honolulu. The people at the front desk were nice and extremely accomadating. We had searched for the lowest fare on the internet and found it at Tripres.com When we called the Aqua Palms they matched the price and took an extra $15.00 off. It get's better, a few days before our scheduled trip I checked the prices online again and saw that they had dropped even more. When we went to check in my husband showed them what we had found, and although they didn't match it they took another $60.00 off the price and threw in free breakfast. (Some people get offered breakfast others don't, I'm not quite sure their policy on this) We ended up paying $87.00/ night before taxes and surcharges we're added on. Breakfast isn't anything to write home about, but it is free. You get a danish, yougurt and a juice. The juice was always room temperature, but it was enough to get you going in the morning, but you could not survive on it alone. Another perk, you get to choose what time you want it delivered to your room. The elevators in the hotel are a NIGHTMARE! We would sometimes wait 5 minutes for the elevator. They have 3 elevators, and while the hotel has undergone extensive remodeling the elevator system has not. We were on the fifth floor and opted for the stairs most of the time. We were a little worried when when we got off the elevator the first time, the hallways were stifling! They were so hot and humid and I started second guessing our hotel choice. Once we got in the room though doubts vanished and we were fine. The rooms are comfortable and bright. Everything looks brand new. There is a mini fridge, microwave, and a few plates, cups, and utensils for your use. The rooms also have a tv with a built in dvd player. Everything in the room is extremely modern and up to date. The bed was extremely comfortable not to firm or soft. The bathroom has granite countertops and they have your basic shampoo, lotion, and soap. Housekeeping always got to our room in a timely matter and we never felt worried leaving anything valuable out. They do have a free safe in your room if your worried about that sort of thing. This hotel is close to lots of shopping and restaraunts. The beach is very close and you just have to cut through Hilton Hawaiian Village (Be careful or you will have hotel envy) The beach adjacent to hilton is not all that, if you want a good beach go down further toward diamond head and you will find waves that are rideable. Because of the Aqua Palms location it's alot easier to get in and out of honolulu. You're not in the thick of the city but close enough to enjoy all it has to offer, bring your walking shoes! If you want a good restaraunt reccomendation ask the front desk and they will give you an honest opinion. They even offered us a free coupon to the place we were going to. Another note, I didn't see ANY children here, I don't know if there really wasn't any or if I just didn't catch them. Never had any problems with noise from neighbors. Noise from the street was a different story. I don't know if Ala Moana (the street the hotel is on) is popular for street racing but you could hear it going on at night. We were always so tired it didn't really bother us much, if you're worried about ask to stay on the back side of the hotel that faces residental housing. Stay with your laundry if you use the laundry room. Some guy got his jeans stolen out of the dryer (at least they left his underwear!) and wasn't too happy about it. All and all we had a nice stay and would stay here again.","Gilbert, Arizona",35,4.0

Also the front desk's staff and travel desk is incrediably friendly, knowledgable and ready to help. The best part is that it is priced less then other hotels that offer much less.

I would have to agree with the positive ones. The location was perfect just a short walk through the Hilton to a not so busy beach. We were just about a 10 minute walk to the Ala Moana shopping center just around the corner. This is were all the locals go not to mention a fantastic Ross store, Walmart and Sams club that's were the most amazing deals can be found. The hotel was very clean, the continental breakfast wasn't the healthiest meal but it was a very nice touch being brought up to you at whatever time you requested it for. The staff was very friendly. The only suggestion I have is that when you check in you are given a voucher for a free bag from expedia be sure to pick it up within 24hours or they won't give it to you. I guess it's their chance to try and get you to book some tours towards the beginning of your stay. The pool was L shaped and to be honest I never saw anyone there but then again the beach is so close. Don't forget to pick up your large beach towels from the front desk. As for dining we really recommend a Thai restaraunt called Singha right on the corner diagnal from the Hilton it's a bit pricey but one of the best Thai places we have ever eaten at.

I stayed at the Hale Koa (military resort 1 block away) for 3 days and moved over to the Aqua Palms for 3 days. As mentioned previously - Aqua Palms is directly across Ala Moana Blvd from Hilton Hawaiian, Hale Koa, etc. Rooms great, amenities great. No closet in my room - but an armoire to store clothes. Microwave and fridge nice! A few tips - whether you are or are not military - check out the ""Barefoot Bar"" on the beach at the Hale Koa. The only place at the Hale Koa that they do not card for military IDs, and I guarantee you they make the best (and least expensive) Mai Tais in Waikiki. Beautiful sunsets from this location. MaiTais are pretty powerful, but hey - you can walk back to the hotel. Some bartenders have been at this bar for 25+ years. As mentioned before - the beaches at this end of Waikiki are the best! If you are military or DoD - you can park in the Hale Koa parking lot versus the Aqua Palms. Aqua Palms parking lot is $15 per day. $12 per day at Hale Koa - or you can buy an advance pass (for a 3 day minimum) for $6 per day to park at the Hale Koa. The parking lot is so big, if you park at the far end, you can walk out of the parking lot practically at Ala Moana Blvd. Cross the street and you are at the hotel. To get to this parking lot, from Ala Moana Blvd, make a right on Kalia Rd, and make the left at the second light - you'll see the parking lot on your left. One last tip, google Waikiki Beach Cams, and the first link that will come up is the Duke Kahanamoku statue in Waikiki. That cam is a living post card. Called ALL my friends from this statue.

According to the hotel staff, the tub is clean but it's scratched and unfortunately they can't take out the black straches. They are accommodating enough to let us switch. I think this is a great example of the kindness and services they are willing to do for their guests. By the way, if the scratches don't bother you, consider asking for room 1110. Pretty good decent view (Read on to ""Fair"" section before deciding to go with the oceanview)I would say the location is pretty good if you don't mind NOT being in the heart of waikiki.

Great restaurants, good shops, markets, etc. I walked everywhere and frankly it wasn't that bad. it's about 10 - 15 mins to Ala Moana Mall in one direction and to heart of waikiki in the another direction. We got a rental car so I didn't exactly get a chance to try busing around. I did notice that the bus stop is VERY CLOSE to the hotel (like 1 min walk)Cleanliness: The place is fairly clean and new. No complaint other than the scratched tub. I do have to say that I'm usually picky with this topic. Other than what is mentioned, the hotel really keeps it clean. Amenities: TV with DVD, Microwave, Plates, Utensils, Iron (by request only), and basic toiletriesFair:The ocean view is good considering the size and location of the hotel. Some rooms have really good view of the Ala Moana State Beach but I would say the Hilton (being quite a bit taller) takes away a great deal of ""what could have been"" Keep in mind that this property is NOT exactly on the beachBathroom size is small but it's ok. The bath tub/shower could be a problem for tall individuals... I say taller than 5-9. I'm small so I'm lucky that it was not a problem for me at all. However, if you're tall..I can see that it wouldn't be too comfortable. For people who like to take bath, don't choose this hotel. The tub is even too small for me! Breakfast: I hope that nobody pays for it. If it's free, it's okay. The hawaiian sun drinks are handy when you're off sightseeing. Yogurts and pastries are basic but adequate to get everyone going in the morning. There's no fresh coffee :( I mean you can make it as it comes in a package like most other hotels.Not so great:Parking is EXPENSIVE. We got a rental car and ended up paying $15/day. I tried looking around for lots to park but didn't find any. I think there is a smaller street (maybe EWA) that you can park overnight. We didn't try but would be a good option to explore if you want to save $$.Elevator: It's kinda slow and old. It's not a big point to make but I'm just throwing in to be complete....Water in the room: They charge $$ for it. We drink a lot of water so it was a must for us to take a trip to longs and stock in the fridge.",California,20,4.0

The staff is very friendly, rooms are really clean and comfortable and the location is terrific, just across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village with access to the widest and best kept beaches in Waikiki. The room had a good-sized frig with a little freezer section, full-length mirror, internet access, coffeemaker and microwave, flatscreen TV, free Kona coffee provided every day both regular and decaf, comfortable bed and sofa, little balcony with nice furniture. The hotel has a spa, small pool and an excercise room as well. The air conditioning works great and there is plenty of hot water and really good water pressure. The lobby is beautifully decorated and the management hosts a little get together once a week to chat and have a glass of wine. Honolulu is noisy so upper floors are best. You cannot beat the price.

There's a bus stop and a trolley stop directly outside the hotel for access to the essential Ala Moana center. Having said that, it is a busy road outside, all night - but its' so easy to get to some good restaurants, even in the torrential rain.If you're looking for a resort hotel, this isn't the place, there's no bar, or room service, but if you just want a place to crash between trips out to the beach/shops/restaurants, we would recommend it very highly.Would we go back to the Palms?

It was very nice and clean, no bugs, no stains, no crowds. I had a room on the 5th floor with a balcony that had a table and 2 chairs. There's a queen size bed and a pull-out sofa, ceiling-mounted TV(78 channel), free internet, free local phone calls, mini-kitchenette (microwave and fridge). There is a spa on site and I will probably opt for the free massage next time instead of the coupon book (which didn't have anything of interest to me). Be warned though that the tub is small, but I didn't have any plans to soak while there. That's what the ocean is for!!The staff is very helpful. The water in my shower wasn't hot enough and they sent the plumber right up and fixed it. Also, the hotel was able to accomodate letting me stay a half-day until 8pm for $85 on the last day since my plane didn't leave until 11pm.The price was tough to beat for the quality: $570 for 6 nights(got one night free for length of stay), incl taxes, free continental breakfast, coupon book, and 2-for-1 luau coupon. There's no restaurant in the hotel, but Wailana's Coffee House is just next door and they are open 24-hours. The food is delicious and prices very reasonable.The bus stop toward Honolulu is right next to the hotel and it is only a 15 minute walk to the superb Ala Moana Shopping Center. To catch the bus toward Waikiki, you just have to go across the street to the Royal Hawaiian or to the end of the block on Kuhio street. You can get a $20 pass for 4 days that will take you all over the place. But to go out to Pearl Harbor (1.5hrs by bus) or further like to the North Shore, rent a car (although be prepared to pay through the nose for it and the gas!) To go to/from the airport, you can get a RT ticket on Robert Transp. buses at the airport shuttle desk for $14 (pay on the bus).But there is plenty to do in Waikiki and for free too. The beach was a block away and uncrowded. The park across the way is Fort DeRussy (sp?).

All rooms are about 300 sq ft and rectangular. Half face Ala Moana Blvd, and half face the residential neighborhood behind the hotel. As others have mentioned, the rooms were updated last fall (2005) and are clean, modern and generally free of the stains, blemishes and mold that you can find in high-traffic destinations like Waikiki. We never saw any bugs. The finishes and fixtures are high-quality. Three elevators provide quick service to the 11 floors. Here are some details I did not see in previous reviews...o The bathroom is quite small, but has nice touches like a bowed shower rod that keeps the curtain out of your way. Typical quality hotel amentities are provided.o The beds are really, really firm but I still found them comfortable. We had the two bed configuration which made for lots of lounging space. The pillows were not obnoxiously bulgey like some are.o Lighting is just OK in the rooms.o The TV/DVD combo is modern, works well (even with DVD-Rs), but has a modest 20"" screen and is suspended six feet above the ground. It has numerous inputs including S-Video in case you wish to connect a camcorder. Just bring a 6 foot cable.o Soundproofing between rooms is excellent. I never heard a neighbor. HOWEVER... street noise is impossible to ignore. Everytime a trolly stops... ""ding"". The street is a major arterial.o The AC works excellent with one major drawback... it is a central AC arrangement and the only control you have is the temperature. Normally there is a ""fan on"" setting that runs the fan all the time, which actually drowns out noise. This baby cycles on and off and on and off and... if that bothers you, earplugs are in order.o The workout room is sweet with the same TV/DVD, a nice treadmill, an eliptical, and a weight machine.o The pool is small, 4ft deep, and unheated as far as we could tell.o Yes, free DSL internet is in every room, and wireless internet is in the lobby. It worked well.o Storage is at a premium. Three bureau drawers and one free standing 3x3 closet.o Safes are provided, which are free and are fairly roomy.o If your rate includes the continental breakfast, it is a danish and or a mini muffin, a can of juice, and fruit yogurt. What is interesting is that they deliver it to your room at the time of your choosing if you turn in your slip by 10:00PM.o 4-cup coffee makers are provided, as is one package of Kona blend each day. It was a little weak for my tastes, so we bought some 4-cup filters and ground coffee at ABC stores. Coffee is also served in the lobby. Bring your own filters and save $2.49.o A mangers reception Wednesdays from 5-6PM includes a complementary beverage. We were served wine, but I heard Champagne is sometimes served as well. When we were there, they were also giving 5-minute free chair massages.So there you have it. Close to the beach and transportation, great rates, friendly staff, easy shopping and dining, not to mention free internet and a quick walk to the mall. If you can put up with the traffic and AC noise, do stay here. The views are really spectacular from the front of the hotel, but the back is undoubtably quieter. Either way, you won't be sorry.","Beaverton, Oregon",40,4.0

It's an extremely nice boutique type hotel. The rooms at the Palms are almost brand new and have wonderful designer decor that mixes traditional/vintage/modern. Every room has a large mini fridge (an oxymoron- but true), a microwave, a coffeemaker (the Hilton gets $4.95 a cup and the Palms gives you Kona coffee for free),some utensils, etc. There's an ABC store around the corner on the same block and you can get soda, cereal,bread, milk, snacks, etc. Of course there is also a truly yummy breakfast buffet at the Hilton for $20.50 a person that's worth trying at least once, too. And with the $$ you save on the room, you can afford to splurge some. We paid $86 a night (thank you Orbitz) for a room on the 9th floor facing the ocean (and the Hilton)and watched the Hilton fireworks from our room. You can also go over and watch from there, use their beach, access any of their restaurants, and shop their shops. The Palms is also close for going to the Ala Moana shopping mall (we walked)or the downtown stores (Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, International Marketplace, etc) The Waikiki trolley stops right out the front door and is $2. There is a coffee shop type restaurant right next door that's good for burgers and eggs but nothing special. There are any number of ""special"" restaurants within 6 blocks (starting with just across the street at the- you guessed it- Hilton. The Palms has their own private pool and sundeck and fitness area. They also have some pretty good rates for massages and a good variety of spa services available right there or in your room. The Palms is also across from a large park that is like an oasis in the city. The location of the Palms means you almost don't need a car to do Waikiki activities. But do get out and explore-there is so much more to Oahu than Waikiki-the island is always sunny somewhere, if it rains on the east end- go to the west end. We like the Waikiki part but that's not the REAL Hawaii. The Palms charges $15 a day for parking and the ramp is really tight for space/corners-rent a compact car if you're planning to park there.

It seemed like we were the first ones to stay there after the reno's. It was great to have such a clean room as we were travelling with an toddler. Everything was brand new, even the kitchenette appliances.We got a deal through Travelocity, approx $110 a night. The fifth night was free and included daily breakfasts (full breakfast, not continental) and 1 hr massage. The hotel itself is very low key, bare minimum staff and small pool. No big deal as we're there for the beaches and aren't high maintenance guests. Our room was a bit small, but for that price, can't complain. The hotel is not close to the beach, so I don't think it would be worth the extra money for an oceanview. Parking is $15/night and practically every hotel in Waikiki charges for it. We paid for parking the first night, but were able to find street parking on subsequent nights. We were able to look down on our car from our room, so that was a plus. You wouldn't be able to do that in the middle of Waikiki. The hotel is within walking distance to Hilton Hawaiian Village, Ala Moana Shopping Centre and some great restaurants. Keo's (Thai) is great and very busy for takeout. Next door is Wailana Coffee House (breakfast included with our deal). The service is great and the food is great! It's open 24 hours.As for the free massage, they were nice enough to split the hour into two 30 min sessions so that we could both get massages. You can either get it in your room or go to the Aqua Bamboo's Spa. We opted for the latter. The massage is done in a Cabana-like building beside their pool, which was a lot nicer than the one at the Palm. However, I don't think the rooms would be nicer. There were bedframes being stored on a bunch of the balconies. Anyway, the massage was excellent. With the hotels in Waikiki starting to age, I highly recommend the newly renovated Aqua Palms. Definitely would stay there again. Maybe next time in a larger room.","Vancouver, Canada",17,4.0

Everything here is brand new... They apparently just finished a major renovation. We especially loved the location - Right across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the beach. The people at the front desk were really friendly, and everything was really clean. We'll definitely be back!",Los Angeles,25,5.0

The rooms are BRAND SPANKING NEW and we got a nice peekaboo view of the ocean as well as diamond head. One thing that impressed us was the nice decor and wow, granit countertops in the bathroom? While the elevator was still old, I was told it was because they were still undergoing some renovations in certain floors and the elevators were to be renovated last (so that construction equipment do not damage the interior of new elevators). Other than that, I found the location to be extremely convenient and the hotel to be much more elegant compared to the other 3 stars I've stayed at (ohana waikiki west, marine surf, continental surf etc.) It is directly across the street from Hilton Hawaiian Village where people are paying over $289+ a night! And that's for a room without ocean view! We just walk through the Hilton Hawaiian to get to the beach. You can check out the penguins on your way through the lobby and if you're there during 3-5 or so, you can get free hawaiian fuit punch drinks. Pretty convenient. I think not too many other tripadvisors know about the palms waikiki. It used to be called the parkside and some other online hotel travel sites still list it as such. I think that's why it's still a bargain. I would definitely stay here again.",Los Angeles,26,5.0

In the past we have stayed in some old beat up, not so clean hotels so this time we wanted to be sure not to make this mistake happen again. This hotel was just renovated and is still finishing some minor renovations but is as new and clean as you'll find anywhere. The rates are very reasonable and it was just really pleasant to stay at a nice new, clean hotel. I travel a considerable amount for business and this is one of the most friendly, attentive and accomodating staff you'll find. There is not yet a Concierge service but the front desk staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. The hotel is located just across from the beach and its very convenient to catch numerous trolleys and busses to get around the island. We will be going back this winter for a week and have already made our reservations at Aqua Palms.",New York,19,4.0

Our room had a nice view of the ocean but when it came to finding activities to do we were on our own. The hotel staff was kind of nice but they did not offer any information about the island. There was no resturants in the hotel and no room service. It was within walking distance of shops and resturants but it was kind of a far walk compared to other hotels just blocks away. It was nice to have a microwave and a small fridge. For the price it was nice but just keep in mind that the Hilton Hawaiian Village is just across the street so if you need to talk to a consierge or book activities that is the way to go... Also i would not recomend the pool but who needs one... You are in Hawaii!,Dana Point CA,32,3.0
