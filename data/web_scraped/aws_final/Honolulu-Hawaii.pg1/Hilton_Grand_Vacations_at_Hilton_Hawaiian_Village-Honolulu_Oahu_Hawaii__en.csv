Clean, convenient and staff were friendly and very helpful. Rosalinda at the check-in counter was the best. We had trouble with our credit card when we first go there and she was so patient and helpful while we got everything straightened out. All the pictures you see on the website represent the property completely. Beautiful scenery. Breakfast buffet although pricey was very good - so was breakfast at the Tropic Bar & Grill. Pizza at the Round table was good and the ice cream at Lapperts was delicious. With all the guests staying here we never had to wait more than a minute or so for the elevator. Did most of our shopping at the ABC stores (more than 1 on the resort property) and Honolulu surf company. Other stores tended to be on the pricey side. If you're staying at the Lagoon tower and you are setting up tours with transporation pick up tell the tour company youre staying at the Grand Waikkian which is attached to the Lagoon tower and your pick up with be either at the tower or a 2 min walk away. If they pick you up at the hilton hawiian village bus stop its a bit of a walk to get there. Mattress was very comfortable.

We stayed in the one bedroom suite partial ocean view and LOVED it!! Most evenings we sat out on the balcony and watched the beautiful ocean, lagoon and a few nights of private luaus on the grass below. The kitchen was stocked with almost everything we needed. It was just my husband and I so we ate out evenings, but it was nice to have things for breakfast and snacks ready. This would be perfect for families to save and cook their meals in the hotels. We were in the lagoon tower by the way. We also commented that the insolation was so good in our room, we never even heard anyone in the hallways.We loved having so many shops to walk around so close to the hotel - the village has a little of everything.

Check in was a breeze, less than 10 minutes. The Bell Desk delivered our luggage immediately. We had a corner room on the 12th floor. The room was well stocked with the exception of a needed blender, which was requested and delivered timely from housekeeping. No kitchen towels were supplied. The room was clean with the exception of the doors which needed a good cleaning. The doors were white and had finger prints and dirt that was extremely visible. I did wipe down the doors as the Corona Virus is spreading and I was concerned with the germs. The Luau and fireworks shows were enjoyed from our balconies, what a nice treat. We had an incredible view of the ocean and saw several Whales from our balcony as well. We attended the Big Game (super bowl) party at the Tapa Bar. The location was good as the kids could remain at the pool and were visible from our seats. . However, the food could have been better and was cold by half time with no heat on the Chaffing Dishes. Lappert's Ice Cream by our Tower was great, although pricey we still enjoyed 4 times. We utilized the National Car Rental onsite 1 day, which was easy to reserve.

From our 11th floor room, we enjoyed lovely sunrises, sunsets and views of the lagoon! The front desk staff was absolutely superb and checkin was very quick and efficient. However, the valet staff is especially deserving of special lauding as they were ALWAYS amazingly quick in bringing our car....but do note valet parking is not cheap! There is a self park option but we decided to treat ourselves! We last stayed at the Lagoon Tower over a decade ago and the property, while beautiful, needs a refurbishment as the room decor and common areas such as the hallways and elevators are in need of a makeover which is due to how busy this property is year wide and how difficult it is to take down rooms or areas to refurbish! The Hilton Hawaiian Village is HUGE! Besides countless stores and too many restaurants to count or mention...there are numerous (5 I think) pools, a lagoon which offers paddle boats, surfing lessons, kayaks and other forms of entertainment and of course a beautiful stretch of beach on the famous Waikiki Beach. The super pool was unfortunately always very cold which explains why it was also always, relatively speaking, fairly uncrowded. Our favorite pool, The Paradise Pool, was located right next to the Lagoon Tower and was always packed. The pool includes several water slides, two hot tubs, a waterfall or two and a small grill offering hamburgs, hotdogs, a few Hawaiian staples such as Kalua pork sandwiches, and drinks. This pool was significantly warmer than any other pool on property explaining why it was always packed and why finding a chair after 9:30am was almost impossible. The most significant issue with this pool was the failure of the staff to enforce posted rules. Although there were security personnel present and the hot tubs had signs clearly stating in English and Japanese that the maximum occupancy was 9 people, I often counted upwards of 17 - 20 people in the hot tubs. This was not an infrequent issue but constant unless you used the hot tubs early in the morning! Something needs to be done as this level of occupancy is both unsafe and unsanitary! It is also annoying as parents bring infants, very young children jump into the hot tubs, teenagers congregate and adults can often barely maintain a space. There is no control and there is going to be a very unfortunate accident unless something is done to enforce the occupancy standards especially when counting 9 people in the hot tubs is fairly easy to do and enforce! Another issue involved a lack of coordination of Hilton Honor perks. We were never given or informed of a mythical passport book, which offers numerous discounts throughout the massive Hilton Hawaiian Village, until two days into our stay and purely by accident. And when we did find out about this program, the books were still using the 2019 books even though it was two months into the new year. This resulted in our missing at least four opportunities to save 10 - 15% on meals we had consumed in the Hilton Hawaiian Village which were all quite expensive. The books should be included with the the packet of information provided at checkin and not have to be discovered by visiting the concierge.The last major issue involved the perks offered to HGVC Owners after attending an owners update. I completely understand HGVC sales is a separate and independent beast from the Lagoon Tower!! However we were offered a experience card and told it offered 20% savings on food purchased at ALL restaurants in the Hilton Hawaiian Village and select restaurants out in town on both Oahu and Hawaii (Kona specifically) AND 15% savings on ALL merchandise and activities purchased at the shops in the Hilton Hawaiian Village and out in town at select stores on Oahu and Hawaii (again specifically Kona). Needless to say these promises were all lies as this card was not recognized at most of the restaurants on property and was not even recognized by one of the Lagoon Tower Resort Managers. As a long-time HGVC Elite member I should have known better! However, senior managers should know what perks are being offered by the sales team! Kudos to Resort Manager Sausito Sato for taking the time to walk with me to various places to try and find out about the card offered by the sales team. He was extremely patient and willing to even walk to a restaurant to try and address the issue with me. He exemplified the traditions and values espoused by Conrad Hilton more than any other staff member I encountered and should be lauded for his absolutely superb customer service!

It is actually a 1 x bedroom suite that interconnects with a twin studio room. It was absolutely fantastic and suited our needs perfectly. We had ample space and the kitchen meant we had a coffee machine and refrigerator to store snacks etc. The kitchen could do with a top up of items such a cutlery and tea towels as its very bare. We didn’t cook our own food but if you wanted to you would find it very difficult with the limited utensils in the room. We couldn’t even find a tray to heat up pizza! The food in the village is all over prized rubbish food that is typical of hawaii, chips, burgers and salads that are 90% lettuce. There is limited food options outside of the village nearby and its at least a 15-20 min walk to anything semi decent food wise. However the lagoon pool was fantastic for families. Has 3 slides and is heated to a lovely warm temperature so our kids literally spent all day there. As long as u are down at the pool by about 10.30am u can always get a sunlounger. I had read many reviews complaining about the wait for elevators, we had no such problem! All in all a great stay but a bit let down by a lack of nutritious food options at a reasonable price. But the room and amenities at the hotel were fantastic. If u like to ear burgers, hot dogs and fries all week at twice the price then you will be right at home.

A van came to the hotel and took us over to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Our representative Julie was amazing to say the least. The inventory rep Chris was also excellent. They both stayed late to get the purchase processed. We did buy and then changed our minds and cancelled later. It was a two hour presentation that became five hours due to the many questions I had, weighing options, paperwork... After additional research upon returning to our hotel room, we decided to cancel as we were unsure about the amount of points and the home resort we bought into. Home resort is a big factor if travelling during holiday season (priority booking).However, the biggest drawbacks are the fees associated to any transaction (to book your points, roll your points , transfer your points...) and parking fees. Their motto is “you only pay for what you use” which isn’t accurate - if you touch your points, it’s going to cost you. Although annual fees seem cheaper than Marriott or Disney vacation clubs, they are comparable to Hilton when transaction fees are added. I haven’t received the refund of my deposit yet so I won’t comment on the cancellation process. If the refund gets processed promptly, I will certainly re-consider buying after visiting their big island resorts. Although it’s a no pressure sales presentation, all offers are off the table once you leave. This tactic is rather stupid if you ask me. It would be much wiser to give people 48 hours otherwise it’s just a waste of everybody’s time when someone buys only to cancel later. So we had to buy in order to think on it.Their presentation is quite well done but I would prefer an opportunity to research the points charts and benefits of various resorts on my own before deciding. Upon pulling up all the vacation club resorts in Hawai’i, I found that all the studio suites only hold 2 people. This was the deciding factor in cancelling as both Marriott and Disney have 4 person occupancy in their studios. I did ask to see a studio suite but was never shown one. Their new tower Grand Islander has beautiful suites. We have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village before and very much enjoyed our stay. Hence our interest in their vacation club. There are many benefits like no expiration of Hhonor points and open season rates (last minute rates only for vacation club owners).If you’re serious about buying, plan to be there for about 4 hours and do some research ahead of time.","Vancouver, Canada",77,4.0

Check in was easy, the staff brought bags up to our room along with a crib. Our 1 king bed oceanview room was spacious enough for the 4 of us (1 child on the sofa bed) and we had a great view. The room felt quite dated, especially compared to photos we'd seen before visiting and it wasn't exactly spotlessly clean with thick layers on dust on top of the fridge & light shades. There were also rips in some of the bedsheets which was a little disappointing given how much we had spent on this accommodation. Maybe not a big issue for some, and to be honest it seemed to be the norm in Hawaii and then in California afterwards, but there is no recycling option! We only had a garbage bin in our kitchen, and don't get me started on those plastic bags with coffee whitener and sugar in them. It's very old school and completely unnecessary in this day and age when the environment is such a big topic. But hey doesn't appear to be in the US! anyway, the other thing we REALLY didn't enjoy was the daily sales pitch and push to attend a presentation where they try and sell you a condo. Can they not just ask you once and if you decline make a note on their computer system that you've already been asked? Back to the positives, we loved being right on Waikiki beach and having the lagoon, as well as all the shops and restaurants on your doorstep. I very much enjoyed the poke bowl at Tropics Grill. All the extras are very expensive eg 50USD for an hour on a pedal boat?! So factor that in if you're booking. We also attended the lu'au one evening which was worth it for the experience. With experiences like the lu'au or a spa treatment it's worth waiting until you're at the village before booking as you can get a money off voucher.

We stayed in the Lagoon tower and were upgraded to a far superior room than we had booked (2 bdrm/2 bath/ocean view/kitchen/living room) - it goes without saying that the suite was 5 stars. Immaculate, modern, spacious, elegantly decorated with a well appointed full kitchen (dishwasher, full oven, microwave, garburator, full sized fridge, everything necessary for basic cooking and eating including silverware, mugs, glasses, etc.) This tower was definitely quieter than others and had a short check-in time (we had no wait at 9 pm). The concierge and other staff were personable, friendly and attentive at all times. We have been to Waikiki several times with children and stayed in a variety of places along the strip. This was a first 'resort experience' in Waikiki and I doubt we will ever choose anything but this. The property is far enough away from the strip that it isn't completely overrun with crowds. Most people on site seemed to be actual hotel guests which builds in a safety and community feel. The grounds are immaculate and gorgeous, with a variety of shops (including ABC), restaurants and activities (music, fireworks, luau, etc.) We felt comfortable letting our teens wander by themselves. We enjoyed Lappert's icecream and coffee, Hatsuhana Japanese food, teppanyaki (a highlight) and the Tapa open air bar at night for live music. Getting to the strip is a bit of walk, but we easily took Uber from the designated Uber pickup location (it's approx a $9USD ride to mid-strip). It's a 10 minute walk to the International Marketplace grocery to stock up, but the on-site ABC has an impressive selection of tourist needs including fresh food and dairy, alcohol, salads, fruit, coffee. The lagoon in the front is perfect. It's drained and cleaned often (we saw staff walking around it with a garbage bag and metal detectors early morning for cleanup). We will definitely stay here again and encourage other families to do so. I took .5 stars off for:- Lack of recycling (I know this is a Hawaii issue, but perhaps some small changes can be made to reduce water bottle and disposable toiletries waste, such as water filters in the rooms or on the floors with water jugs, and soap/shampoo dispensers). It felt terrible throwing away piles of water bottles and plastic). - The beach right in front of the property has coral/stones. Not a huge deal as it's a short walk to better sand, but it's good to know- The parking lot next door to the lagoon by the marina has a small homeless camp set up. There is no locked gate to the parking lot. We were never bothered or concerned for our safety, but it was an unnerving and sad discovery. Again, this is not a Hilton issue, but as a parent it's a good thing to note. I realize that Oahu has a big homeless issue and they are trying to help people. - You have to rent beach chairs and umbrellas. Towels are available for guest use. - The elevators are incredibly busy at checkout times - they send a notice about it. We waited for elevators with our luggage for about 15 minutes as we were on a lower floor and people checking out above us filled them up with luggage at this time. We realized that sending a teen down, then having them take the elevator back up to our floor allowed us to get on into an empty elevator, in order to work our way to the lobby.

This was our first trip back with kids as a family and we stayed on the vacation rental/timeshare side (Lagoon Tower) which we booked via Chase Reward Vacations. We were fortunate to be assigned the 22nd floor and had a 2 bedroom 2 bath booked, which gave us a very spacious condo to enjoy for a week with a view of the marina and ocean. The reservation came with daily cleaning service and pool towels were plentiful at all the locations (though quite worn out). I would say overall it is a super busy like a popular cruise, people are Everywhere so don't expect quiet and peace like the North or West Shore. There are decent restaurants though very pricey (we only ate one time on campus and chose to cook every meal except our first). On resort Starbucks is very popular and expensive (30% more than CA). Pools were chilly in April, but I imagine they would be perfect in the summer. The kids' pool with waterfalls, slides, etc. was literally teeming with children; like way TOO many for me to enjoy being in the water LOL ;-). As a result my kids, who were in there for hours at a time, had a skin rash after a week in the chemical laden pool; they had a ton of fun though so probably to them it was worth it. Lounge chairs were sometimes hard to come by, but if you were patient you'd eventually get one. The beach sand is gritty and tough, so go past the dock/pier where it is much much softer. We indulged in the submarine ride which was a good one time experience and found cheaper fares online, which the staff were willing to match. Overall a cheerful fun atmosphere despite the crowds and costs. One major advantage is the easy walk to Waikiki shopping and eating. Island Vintage Shave Ice stand is truly delicious; fresh fruit flavors that I dare say are better than Matsumoto's (not the mochi rice balls though, tiny and dry). Here are some tips for condo dwellers who plan to cook:1) ask for more plate ware and an extra water pitcher. Filtered water was downstairs and we used our 2 pitchers to avoid paying for bottled water (plus the wasteful plastic).2) kitchen is not as equipped as Marriott Ko Olina in case you are comparing the two. Not as many appliances to choose from or space to cook etc. you will have to make do with an 8"" frying pan (I had to cook pancakes for 3 kids individually Gah!), but if you don't mind being creative it's not terrible.3) Laundry, while not in the suite like Ko Olina, was easily available on the floor. 4) Grabbing a taxi/lyft/etc is easy to get to a decent grocery store (Safeway, Whole Foods is about 10 mins with the traffic) and much better prices. We saved by not renting a car since there is plenty to do around the Waikiki area and we have been to Oahu many times before.5) Ala Moana Shopping Center is a 15 min walk and there are many food courts to choose from. The special Japanese focused one has every type of food prepared so you don't have to cook at all. We walked there and took a taxi back to save some $.We enjoyed ourselves plenty and had a positive experience, but upon reflection we will return to Ko Olina on the West Shore for the quieter resort and better equipped condo. The only thing Ko Olina really lacks is a decent hotel spa in case you want that for your vacay. Aloha!","San Francisco, California",18,5.0

It was one bedroom with almost full kitchen and nice size living room with balcony. Very spacious and clean, also pretty impressed that kitchen had almost everything needed (even rice cooker). Although I live in Hawaii, and had a lot of cheaper options to stay as an active duty soldier (like Hale Koa right next to Hawaiian village for $150 a night), I wanted to spend little more to show my sister who visited me from Canada some good resort experience. I stayed 3 nights and the last night I stayed, we got a burglar came into our room and stole my camera bags with wallets and car key fob in them, and my sister's purses with her and her daughter's passports, wallets with all their identifications on the day she was supposed to fly back to Canada.Long story short, after spending all day dealing with police, embassy and TSA at the airport, she had to spend tons money to change her plane tickets, and we lost over 6K worth stuff (my camera and lenses were more than 4K) while this burglar went out and made so many transactions with our credit cards overnight. Yes, burglary can happen anywhere, but I'm writing this review 40 days after the incident because I'm very disappointed with the hotel. I spoke to the manager, she told me that hotel's insurance company will contact me. I got in touch with them a week later. The insurance company then got back to me that hotel had no fault on this so no compensation will be given.  First of all, Hilton grand vacation doesn't have a key scanner at the elevator. Which means anyone can come to any floors. Also they said they don't have cctv in the hallway which It's hard to believe...not even the elevator area?  secondly, the person broke into the room while we are sleeping! this could have been much worth problem than losing some cameras and wallets. To me this is so obvious that we (two asian ladies with small children) were the target by someone who works there, thinking 1. no man in the room 2. they look like Japanese tourists so they will be gone before they can do anything, which I heard later that this happens a lot downtown to tourists and they can hardly charge anyone even if police catch them..because they are already out of country so they can't work with the case. (additional statements or going to court)  Obviously there was some kind of security bleach on hotel part while they charge me $1535.00 for 3 nights (this include $40 resort fee a day and $45 parking fee a day!). I don't mine spend money for good service and quality accommodation but I also expect they would handle something like this better.

You can’t beat the location on Oahu/Waikiki. The resort is beautifully landscaped with several pools and beach/lagoon access. The staff was friendly and service was excellent. The village includes many shops as well as restaurants. You could spend your entire week just at the resort and have an enjoyable time. That said, please be aware that you will pay for much more than the price of your room. Hawaii is expensive no matter where you go, but nowhere more than this resort. Despite a resort charge of $45/day, you will pay for renting beach items like paddle boards. You will pay $175 for breakfast for a family of 4 and more than that for lunch or dinner onsite. We opted to go to the IHOP or Starbucks instead for breakfast and we were out and about during lunch and some dinners. And if you have a car, which you need on Oahu unless you plan to book tours all over the island, be prepared to pay over $50/day to valet park your car and about $7-10 less to park it yourself. The resort charge covers things like DVD rentals and two waters per day, but for $45/day, I think parking at least should be included. Further, at least for our family, we spent most days exploring the island. I am not going to be renting DVDs to watch in my room when there is so much to see and do. We have stayed here twice and will likely stay here again if we return. We were well aware of the expense having stayed here before.

We had a spacious 2 bedroom suite with 2 nice sized bathrooms, 2 balconies with lagoon and ocean view and an extra large living room area. The full size kitchen was stocked with utensils, and the dining table was large enough for all six of us. Although we didn't use it because we couldn't resist the balcony view which easily accommodated 4 chairs and a large table. One small little thing which could have been better was that we were registered as 4 adults and 2 children, so they should have known we would be needing the fold out sofa bed? When we arrived we had to pull out the bed, and the mattress didn't have linen. We had to find someone and ask for bedding. A staff member returned quickly with two sheets, one blanket and one pillow. I was told ""Here you are"". After a long flight with 2 small kids we weren't really in the mood to make a bed. The sheets didn't fit and we were one pillow short. Not a big deal, but that was the only complaint with our stay. Everything else far exceeded our expectations.

We stayed here 2 years ago and got roughly the same room but on a lower floor. They did accomodate my request for a diamond head view and since we were checking in on a Thursday we couldn't get a higher floor which worked out. Before arriving I sent several packages from Amazon to the hotel. They were delivered however upon checking in with the resort manager they couldn't find the one with the snacks, gopro, chargers etc in it. They had my small packages but somehow they managed to lose a big box. I checked in with them a week after it arrived and they said they couldn't find it even though the tracking shows it was delivered. Several back and forth and because it was over thanksgiving that slowed things down. Basically they didn't take ownership of it. I asked for some sort of compensation since I was out money and had to quickly reorder the items again so it'd arrive in time. When I got there the resort manager who I was dealing with the whole time kinda brushed it me off. Maybe shes used to dealing with tourists from another country? I'm not sure but basically i needed to spend even more time dealing with this so they can start an insurance claim...really? just deal with the facts you have. I'm still dealing with this after i've come back as I did not want to spend another minute on it.Other then that, the elevators were troublesome. As I said we were on the 5th floor so we could just take the stairs down. Some ladies were complaining that they waited 30 minutes...not sure where they got from complaining to the front desk.Pool boys were cool with the towels and the pool itself was great, the kids didn't want to leave. We'll probably be back again in 2 years however we are looking elsewhere as this is the 2nd time there has been a problem at HHV. I'm not sure if its due to management and the lack of training but given the price they charge, it should be pretty damn good. Oh yeah the bell boys were awesome.

The front desk staff were so good! You check in at the Grand Waikikiian. They got for us a really nice one bedroom high up on the 22nd floor facing the sunset and Magic Island.It was so nice - we spent quite a bit of time on the balcony since the sun was only on there from 4-6 pm. Looking at the floor plan, there are not very many rooms per floor and 24 floors. In fact, there is only one 1 bedroom facing west on each floor so we were indeed fortunate. Another reason was that there had been some major electrical issues going on so there was a generator going 24x7 on the east side - would have hated that noise. Also, the east side of the tower overlooks the big green lawn area - where they often have weddings and convention events. We had the Dentist ADA convention going on.What we like about the entire Hilton Hawaiian Village area is the location at the end of Waikiki at one end and close to the Ala Moana Mall and Magic Island the other direction. Perfect for getting around walking. No need for a car here - and you can also take The Bus - which is great and easy to do!The room itself was quite nice and fully furnished. Extremely quiet as well which was good since lots of families with babies and strollers here - but we didn't hear them. And everyone at HGVC was so so friendly and helpful. Not used to that! We also liked the ability to go to all the different pools (only the Alii Tower is not available). We enjoyed the fun pool at the Lagoon tower with the slides and then for a change of pace, went to the Kalia Tower pool on the 4th floor - very quiet and peaceful. The Tapas pool the time we were there was basically a kids day care center so we didn't go there. There are so many different places to eat and explore right within the village too. Nice ABC store and 2 Starbucks, along with many eateries. Hilton does a great job with this Village - and we especially enjoyed the Lagoon Tower.

The unit was nicely furnished. The living/dining area had a queen sized sleeper sofa, large screen TV, and dining table. There was a island/bar surrounding the kitchen area with additional seating. A family of 4 could comfortably stay in this unit. The kitchen was well equipped with sufficient serving pieces for 4, and all the cooking utensils needed to make meals. It included a coffee maker, rice maker, and microwave as well as a full sized range and refrigerator. In the bedroom there was a wall unit that included a desk and closet. We had a king sized bed. Hilton buys the best beds and this was no exception-very comfortable. The unit was well maintained and very clean. There is a pool which is conveniently located on the fourth floor of the tower. Across from the pool is a large work out room that is quite well equipped with stationary bikes, weights etc. The tower is a short walk from the lagoon and the beach. Kayaks and paddle boards are available for rental at the lagoon.There are numerous restaurants in the Hawaiian Village complex. Our favorite for a nice lunch is Tropics, which is a short walk from the Tower, and located right on Waikiki. The Kalia Tower is mixed between time share units and hotel rentals. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, as well as several souvenir shops. Just across the road is a large ABC store where you can purchase chopped fruit, coffee, and any number of snacks.

It made my holiday so much better as I was there solo (I planned on bringing someone however it didn’t end up that way) and is located in a safe, secure and friendly environment. The hotel staff are amazing and show an enormous duty of care I say this from my personal experience.Having come from the Australian winter, I ended up with heat stroke. Within that time I was advised there was a Doctor on site as well as other services which were great to know were on site.The location is perfectly situation on the most beautiful beach i’ve ever seen. In addition to this there are so many shops on site you literally could get anything you needed without leaving.I personally recommend this hotel to all Australians who are making there first trip over to Hawaii. The amenities are vast, you can keep in contact with the hotel through the mobile app and they always make sure you receive the best care.When I arrived I was early. I was in a very spacious Diamond Head room with an amazing view. In saying that, I asked if I could upgrade and paid the difference and stayed in a corner room in the luxurious Rainbow tower.There is also a dedicated area where you can organise your day trips. I organised Pearl Harbour tour this way and it was the most amazing experience and is a must do for anyone who goes to Oahu.The entire area is beautiful, given the time difference with Australia it took me a while to kick the jet lag but I highly recommend a stroll on Ala Moana Boulevard, the area is just so amazingly clean and breathtaking with Diamond Head always in view.I also cant recommend enough the Tropical Bar and Grill! The service is spectacular and is the food and drink. It is one of my favourite bar i’ve been too. In addition to this, there is an IHOP on Ala Moana Boulevard and if your Australia you have to check it out you wont regret it.This is seriously the only review I could literally list 100’s of positive point and it would never end. All I can say is I highly recommend it for everyone and if you can spare that little bit extra you really need to stay in the Rainbow Tower.I personally stayed 7 nights and this trip was spectacular. This trip will always be close to my heart and the next time I return to Hawaii I will certainly stay at this resort again.Make sure to put on sunscreen and were a hat as although its beautiful weather its very humid and given most Australians are of European decent like myself you will find yourself burnt very quick. It was the only mistake I made on my holiday.Again I want to thank Hilton Hawaiian Village for such a great stay. I am recommending you to all those I know heading your way.I also want to finally add that Waikiki Trolley was a fantastic experience. If you go and you aren't driving I highly recommend getting a pass. The staff are well educated and will remind you of famous places your passing that you didn't even realise.",,22,5.0

Nice rooftop pool area.The remaining four clubs, sorted by newness, are located in the HHV cluster, sharing common pools, the lagoon, parking, facilities, and a two to four minute walk to the beach. Self contained resort, a 10 minute walk to Ala Moana Center (west) and the heart of Waikiki (east).

More details below.Kalia Suites (2001)- Mostly hotel rooms, furthest from the lagoon and main pools, some street noise being directly on the main intersection, mostly city views, ocean views are obstructed by the other towers. This usually has the greatest availability.Lagoon Tower (1950s) – Oldest and closest to the beach and lagoon. Higher floors have unobstructed views.Now onto my most recent stay at the Grand Waikikian. Stayed at a two-bed premier room, high floor with ocean view, in the mountainside tower (versus the ocean tower). 1200+ square feet, huge master bedroom and bath with Jacuzzi tub, but a bit undersized living/dining/kitchen area. Can accommodate six, comfortable for sleeping with two per each of the two rooms and two in the living room, but living room could feel slightly cramped during waking hours. Here is the website’s write-up. “This spacious two-bedroom, two-bathroom ocean view suite with balcony features a master bedroom with a king bed and bathroom with a free-standing shower and separate soaking tub. The second bedroom is furnished with a king bed or two double beds and bathroom with a shower only. The suite includes a generous living room with separate dining area, cable TV, PlayStation 3, and queen-size sleeper sofa, as well as a full kitchen with rice steamer and washer/dryer.”Spacious lobby, plentiful bi-lingual (Japanese-English) registration and concierge desk staff. As noted in the hotel’s room write-up, the unit was well equipped with everything you would need to make and enjoy a dinner and night in.I would definitely stay at the Grand Waikikian again if I wanted to spend more time within the unit, at the Hokulani if spending more time outside in the heart of Waikiki, or the Lagoon Tower if going to and from the lagoon or beach.","Honolulu, Hawaii",170,4.0

During peak times it takes forever for you to get on the elevator since everyone is trying to go to every floor.

We loved our 1BR suite in the Lagoon Tower and made use of the full size fridge, the utensils and plates, though we didn't make any food beyond a few bows of cereal, and some fruit. I would say that Hilton has a lot to offer guests of all types. If you want to shop at upscale stores, there are plenty here in the outdoor mall area between towers - not our scene, but fun to stroll through once or twice. If you need your Starbucks in the morning, you have 2 on the property. Even the cheaper ABC beach shops are located on the property and also just on the street side of the property. We ate meals on and off the resort. We really enjoyed the Tropics Bar and Grill for lunch and dinner (great food and location) -- in a different tower on the property, but everything's close. For families with younger kids, in addition to the multiple pools on resort, you have their great shallow sand-bottomed lagoon with small fish swimming around and no waves or current to worry about. The pool at the Lagoon Tower is probably the best on the entire property with water slides, hot tubs, and other fun features. Finally, the beach at this resort is probably the largest and safest in the area. The staff all around are excellent!My main reason for not 100% recommending this resort is that there are so many costs associated with staying here. Over $50 per day for use of an umbrella and 2 loungers at the beach? What is the resort fee for, if not to offset some of these costs. Then the audacity to charge $50 for valet parking (vs. $43 for self park) and it doesn't include PROPER valet service where I can call down from my room and have car ready when I get down. I was told this is because too may people don't come get their car. I'm sure it's a headache for all hotels, but it's a minor annoyance if you are charging this much. Buffet breakfasts were about $10 overpriced. Maybe a couple of free vouchers would have been nice, or kids eat free at the buffet, if you're going to charge the adults $30 each.Also, there is live music at the resort, so sometimes at night it is a bit loud around kid bedtime hours.Overall this is a wonderful location and a great resort, but when people are paying a premium, and are likely going to keep spending on the property (there's conveniently not much else around within a short stroll to eat, drink, etc) maybe don't so blatantly gouge us at every turn","Toronto, Canada",18,4.0

Also super close to Ihop, Red Lobster, Outback Steakhouse and Ala Mona shopping center. Checking in process was easy. The concierge desk was left unattended at times which was disappointing. Easy for Uber drivers to find us as well in Kalia tower. The apartment was clean and tidy and new. Just love it. The only negative was the main pools. The public can access which drove us insane as we couldn't find chairs at times. How's that fair that anyone can use the pools when we pay resort fees etc... to use the facilities. There's has to be something done about it. I wouldn't care if there was a gate erected to keep the public away. There also needs to be more wait staff around the pools for drinks and food. we waited an hour sometimes to be served. Faster to get up and go get drinks from the bar.

We apparently did not do enough research. We are HGVC owners in New York but thought it would be fun and interesting to try a different place in a Paradise resort. The Hilton Vacation Club is huge and situated on 22 acres, right on Waikiki beach. There are three Time Share towers and I believe five hotels under the Hilton Brand, so one can imagine how many people are on site. We did make a point of stopping each day at Lappert's ice cream as well as Honolulu cookie. There are two ABC stores on site where one can basically get anything one needs, as well as a Safeway less than five minutes away drive. There are multiple restaurants and cafes on site as well. We stayed in the Grand Islander tower which was lovely. The front desk staff, bellman and valet were delightful, friendly and helpful. Despite asking four different concierges for help, we found them much less helpful. We were on the 18th floor in a two bedroom and two bath suite. The kitchen and living room were well appointed and had everything we needed. There is also a washer/dryer. The views of the beach were lovely and we also looked out over a park. There was a nice balcony to sit out on. I am not certain I would want to stay much higher up as it is a busy hotel and sometimes there were a lot of stops on the elevator to get to the higher floors. This tower also houses the bus terminal for all of the resort. Our tower had a lovely lap pool and hot tub but it was not an adult pool so virtually impossible to do laps as kids were constantly jumping in on my head. It was the same with the hot tub. While there are multiple other pools, the beach and a lagoon, again there were always too many kids in the pools and hot tubs. There were times that we could not find a place to sit as all the lounge chairs were taken. In addition, one has to pay to rent a chaise or cabana on the beach. There are multiple activities that one can do but again one pays extra. There were beautiful fireworks on Friday evening over the lagoon.There is self parking on site which cost $43/night. As we traveled all over the island, we did use a car a lot but if one doesn't want to go too far, I am not certain one necessarily needs a car. So, I think this place would be great for families as there is so much to do for them. It is close to the Ala Moana and Beachwalk shopping areas so great location for shoppers. Also, if one wants to be in Waikiki, this property is right in the smack middle. It is easy to walk anywhere, either on the beach boardwalk or the street. Lots of shopping close by. I would not recommend this property for anyone that wants a quieter or more laid back experience. People, people, people EVERYWHERE!!","San Diego, California",69,4.0

We are not particularly fond of staying in Honolulu, big city, LOTS of tourist and traffic...but the staff, from valet to housekeeping, at Kalia towers, makes they stay a pleasant one. Within a day or two, the valet remembered who we were and a year later, when we returned, remembered us. Housekeeping does a GREAT job on your room, and are ever so pleasant when you see them. Front desk staff are very nice. They can run a little slow, but it's because they want each and every person to feel they are VIP. Unlike a lot of vacation clubs, this staff does not push you into having to talk with the HGVC people, they don't call your room every day trying to get you to come to a timeshare presentation. In fact, the ONLY time they have ever called us was when my husband had set up an appointment, then forgot and didn't go, They called and I told them we were no longer interested and they were very polite and they didn't bother us the rest of the trip. There is several ABC Stores within walking distance and they carry everything! There are places to eat and other shopping places within walking distance, you don't even have to leave the Hawaiian Village. For smokers., there is a limited amount of places you can smoke, they make it most difficult for you(Hawaii all around is trying to go non-smoking), which I find interesting since a vast majority of the locals and visitors are smokers.

Easy access to the parking garage (walk past the ballroom and it takes you to the elevators of the parking garage).

Elevator: We’ve read about the slow elevator but we were underestimated how SLOW it was. On a Thursday morning around 10am, we waited over 15mins to get down to the lobby from the 11th floor. On Saturday morning, we had to wait again when we wanted to go down to the lobby around the same time. The only way for us to get down was first we had to go up. Then of course, it had to stop at every single floor on the way down. We heard from the people on the 20th floor they waited for about 30mins. This was absolutely ridiculous. Check-in/Concierge/Customer Service: Upon check-in, a booklet with our room keys were handed but there was no mentioned of what’s in the booklet or where we can get a hotel map, activities calendar, etc. The staff we encountered (concierge desks, customer service, towel stations) did not seem friendly (no smiles) at all except for housekeeping. To be fair, we just spent 4 days at Aulani before taking the kids to spend some time in Waikiki so we did have some high expectations coming from such a happy and friendly resort. Pools: the water was too cold. The “hot tub” was too small and too crowded. We barely spent any time at the pools because of this. Towels: one towel person. You have to return the soiled towel to get a new one. This policy makes it tough when we have the little ones. Water bottles: for each night you stay, a coupon for 2 complimentary water bottles was given at check in. (We were not told how these coupons work at check-in). Well, to get your water, you have to take the coupon to the unfriendly concierge who are sitting right across from elevator. They then unhappily asking for your room number and confirm your name before giving you the water bottles. It was so unnecessary. Why are they inconvenient us for these water bottles? Why can this be part of housekeeping? Then it just clicked with us when they started talking about the “welcome packet” and timeshare opportunity. Aha!!! What a mediocre way of pitching!Kids Club: nothing for kids under 5 except ukulele lesson. We tried to sign up after 20 minutes of different people misinformed us where to sign up. Then we were told it’s full and that we should have signed up the day before. What a joke! And if you’re expected to see bath robes and slippers in your room, don’t. We’ll not return to this hotel the next time we visit Waikiki. If you have young children, for the price difference which is not much if you factor in the gear/chair rentals, stay at Aulani. Kids club are awesome there; pools are huge and warmer with unlimited towels; floaties, life vests, boogie boards and sand toys are all free; no $75 charge for chairs and umbrella on the beach; great private lagoon; lots of activities throughout the resort on a daily basis; rooms, bathrooms are nice and clean; staff are friendly; I could go on and on...","Danville, California",11,2.0

The “super” pool is not that big and if you choose to sit on the beach, be prepared to rent chairs and an umbrella because they are not provided for guests. It’s a $36 charge for two chairs for the day. It has a great shopping area, nice dining and options so that you never need to leave the property if you choose so, that was nice.

Totally loved this property as Hilton Vacation Time Share owner.Booked this on short notice, less than 2 months prior to trip was able to get a small but efficient room at The Lagoon Tower. Can't be too picky as rooms among the whole HHV (Hilton Hawaiian Village) 8 towers get snapped up quickly.Our first 5 nights at the Lagoon Tower was great. Room not as big as suites. No balcony and lower floor. Not a big deal as we did not spend a lot of time in the room. Bed is big queen, comfy. Small kitchenette has sink, microwave, toaster, coffee machine, all kitchenware, utensils. Strong AC. Only drawback (negative) is bathtub fit a small person under 4 feet. If you were to sit in the tub as a grown up, it is impossible. Treat taking stand up shower in this as if you were on a cruise ship. They do have a clothes line you can pull out to hang dry clothes, so that's nice.As for access to amenities like the lagoon in front on the beach it's just a stone throw away, fantastic.Then we got upgraded to the Grand Wakikian for 3 nights. What an upgrade! It's a suite, compared to our Lagoon room, this felt like a palace. Separate living room with sofas, TV, full sized kitchen, big bedroom with a 2 person bathtub. Bathroom has a good sized shower stall. And balcony facing Ala Moana Blvd. And a washer and dryer--what a surprise. Again, location is superb as far as accessing all the amenities HHV has to offer: restaurants, many ABC convenient stores, shops, lagoon, beach etc etc. Walking on the 2 miles stretch of Waikiki is not a problem for us. Beautiful sunrise, sunset etc.Both rooms we have were quiet, free WiFi was great.Service from Hilton from start to finish and in between was PAR EXCELLENCE! From valet to check in staff. Housekeeping (remember this is timeshare so only every so often they clean the time share room which is fine for us).

Also, I was given inaccurate information on several occasions, always to the benefit of my hosts. Starting with the room, it appeared generally clean, except in the bathroom, where you REALLY want clean. Instead, the door was filthy with hundreds of fingerprints and there was buildup accruing in the caulk. Worse still, there was a buildup on the bidet wand that I didn't notice until AFTER first use. I am STILL concerned about the consequences of that. On the service end when adding this stay at Laguna Tower to the beginning of a previously booked stay at another tower, I was inaccurately told I might be able to hold the room until the next room (same HGVCresort complex) became available. After arrival, they wouldn't even consider it. When deciding on valet or self parking, I specifically asked if I could call to have my car brought up. The answer was ""yes"" ... until I was on the hook for valet parking. ($47 daily).That leads to the next innacuracy. They gave us distorted maps that make it look much more difficult to get to off resort (affordable) dining and entertainment options than reality. Use google. The worst inaccuracies of all were conveyed by the concierge staff, who it turns out are part of the Sales team. They claim to offer discounts on services and experiences, almost all of which are offered for less from the merchants. After surrendering my car due to parking costs, they steered me away from the trolley shuttle to their partner cab company, wildly inaccurately forecasting the cost. And they persuaded to take their discounted luau in exchange for a ""60 minute, no pressure"" sales presentation"" (ok, my fault for believing that one) that almost interminable alternative offers each time you decline. If you do this and you're not buying, count on 3 hours. Bottom line is that the location and views are very nice.

The rooms were beautiful and the view so nice! It was also great to have access to the full facilities of Hilton Hawaiian village of which there are many. This is a huge family hotel so maybe not great if you don't like thousands of kids running around but I think this comes with the territory. It has direct access to a really lovely swimming beach and also one sand bottom pool you can rent kayaks and peddle boats. Really unique and fun. It's also cool that there is some wild life like fish ponds and parrots through the complex. Also a huge selection of restaurants and shops. You really don't have to leave the complex if you don't want to and still have a great time. The front desk staff were really nice and helpful but the ancillary staff not so much. Found it pretty difficult to get things done through the concierge staff and they seemed pretty grumpy like we were a burden for asking for restaurant reservations. I also found out they were meant to give us a welcome gift but didn't realize until it was too late. I feel like they should have asked if we had received this. Also, we asked the bell desk staff for directions to the trolley or bus stop and they refused to tell us and kept trying to convince us to get a taxi. We were heading only to ala moana mall and ended up just walking out of frustration. Seemed like maybe they are getting pay offs from taxi services and this should be looked into. Other than those minor things we had a really nice stay and would recommend the Kalia Tower to our friends. ","Sydney, Australia",22,4.0

They were used by the staff and hotel guess I like. So when a bellman or a cleaning staff was using the elevator with their cards. You couldn't fit in there with the stroller and your kids. Many times when we use the elevator we were packed like sardines. We were on the 20th floor and we would have to ride the elevator packed and stop at several floors. That was kind of a headache. I asked if there was a service elevator and they said there was not. That's one thing that I dreaded about using the elevator was being packed like a sardine. Also we had the Studio suite. Which was located right next to the elevator. It did feel like we were walking into a storage room but it was not bad size when you got in there. And it wasn't that noisy as I thought it would have been. Overall I enjoyed the hotel and the staff.

The kitchen has also been nicely updated and fully functional with all of the utensils and cookware you need.The check-in process was quick, easy and the staff are very nice and friendly. The front desk no longer gives out leis, but when I told them it was my fiancee's parents first time to Hawaii, he went out of his way to track down the kukui nut leis just for them. Great customer service! We received great service from the bellmen, concierge and housekeeping as well. They were quick to deliver anything that we ran out of in the room and were always courteous. The Lagoon Tower is very close to the lagoon (thus the name) and the beach. We like this location because it's a short walk to Kalakaua which is the main stretch of Waikiki. Being a short walk away means it's not in a crazy busy area, yet it is close enough to walk out to the many restaurants and shops. The minor drawback is that laundry is located in a shared area and not in the room itself like in some of the other HGVC properties. It was never a problem for us though as every time we went to use the washer / dryer, they were readily available.We loved staying at the Lagoon Tower and can't wait to come back again!","Campbell, California",12,5.0

Where do I start? Airport arrival: Took Charley's Taxi from the airport to the hotel. Called them once we arrived at the airport-- they came 5 mins later. Only $29 flat rate for my family of 5. No one can beat that price! Also used them going back to the airport, they already had taxi's lined up, so we didn't need to call. Hotel arrival: We saw long lines once we arrived, but thanks to being a timeshare member, we walked right up and was able to check in. (Lagoon Tower is for timeshare members, but you check in at the Grand Waikikian). Bell men where right there to assist with bags. I did not receive a lei upon arrival, but the resort was so breathe taking-- I didn't care! (Well maybe a little). Hotel room: We received a 2 bedroom suite, with 2 balconies, full kitchen, with bar and stools, full dining table, 2 bathrooms, and a wonderful view of the pool area. Grounds: Everything was perfectly manicured to make you feel like you are in paradise! Some colors of the flowers or on the birds were some I have never seen before. Plenty of picture perfect opportunities. Ponds, waterfalls, clean beach and pool area-- grounds are well kept. Water activities: Pools, pools, everywhere! And a beautiful lagoon for activities for a fee. The beach was absolutely stunning! All of the water is in walking distance, and close to each other. Food: There are so many restaurants, grab and go, and bars available. Believe or not, I chose to stay in my food comfort zone. I did Benihana, Ihop, Starbucks, and Buffalo Wild Wings. (Yeah, I know). Shopping: Lots of stores within walking distance. Souvenirs, crafts, etc... all await you once crossing the street. Exploring: I was able to book a Luau, Pearl harbor, and other activities all at the desk in the hotel. The price was the very same if I would have booked online. Conclusion: The staff is friendly with warm smiles, the grounds are well kept, food and drink are at not a shortage, and the weather is near perfect. We flew 11 hours and had to adjust to a 6 hour time difference. I'd do it all again for this property. We will be back! Mahalo for an amazing vacation.",Middletown,25,5.0

How we almost got a free upgrade to a 2 bedroom condo. 2. Once you've stayed at a Hilton Grand Vacation timeshare, you can't go back to the standard Hilton hotel rooms anymore. 3. Hilton Hawaiian Village is a complex of 9 towers in Waikiki.  3,000+ Hilton hotel rooms and 1,000+ HGV timeshare condos.  4. February 2016, I stayed in the Kalia tower in a regular 12' x 24' room.   HHV towers with standard hotel rooms include the Alii, Rainbow towers, Diamond Head towers, Tapa Towers, and the regular rooms in the Kalia tower.  5. I purchased a Waikiki Hilton timeshare for $37K, with $4k worth of annual timeshare usage.  Must use the $15k in bonus timeshare money to stay at Hilton and RCI timeshares for the next two years.   6. We arrived at 230pm, and checked in at the main lobby.  Hundreds of guest in line.  I ask where to check in for the HGV Lagoon tower.  Lady says this is the line for the hotel guests.  Lady directs me to walk to the Grand Wakikian.  7. In the Hilton Hawaiian Village, three of the eight towers are HGV buildings: the Kalia suites, the Grand Wakikian, and the Lagoon Tower, and they have their own separate checkin.  8. We walk the 100 yards to the Grand Waikikian.  No line here for HGV guests!  Registration says we were checked into a two bedroom HGV unit for one week.  My wife said she thought we had a one bedroom unit.  9. Room not ready, so we took a 10 minute walk to Food Pantry on 438 Hoborn Lane to pick up groceries, avoiding the overpriced ABC and Whalers General Stores in HHV.10. At 330pm HHV texts that our room ready.  No, not a two bedroom unit, but thanks to the wife, who doesn't know when to keep her mouth shut, a one bedroom unit, room 361, on the third of 26 floors in the Lagoon tower.11. Room right across from elevator, almost triple the size of the HHV hotel rooms.  700+ sq ft, with full kitchen, living room, dining area,  bedroom with king bed and bathroom.  Two flat screen TVs, including a 60"" TV in the living room.12. Granite counter top in kitchen and bathroom sink area.13. No sheets by themselves on the bed, but sheet wrapped comforter, so we can't kick off the comforter alone, with only a sheet on top when sleeping in the buff.14. Electrical outlet closest to dining table not functioning.  Refrigerator did not keep food cold enough, at the coldest temperature setting.   Milk spoiled after 5 days.15. Pull out bed sofa in the living room, but not to sleep on unless you want to wreck your back. 16. Saw 5 minutes of fireworks from the balcony on Friday at 745pm.17. Wife would have preferred a bath tub instead of a shower.  I asked the housekeeper and they said most of the rooms in the Lagoon tower have showers, not baths, due to guests bringing in sand from beach.   18. Free communal laundry room on each floor.19. Not a great view on the lanai, with the lagoon in the background.  However it has it's advantages.  Great for people viewing, especially looking down on young women in bikinis walking below! 20. Better than viewing the busy street access to the Marina on the east side.21. Easy to get up or down the stairs to the lobby when the slow elevators to all 27 floors packed.22. The third floor lanai is shielded by the Rainbow Tower 100 yards away, from the  tropical sun that makes most of the higher floor lanais too hot to use during the day.  23. We had a ring side view of a Hawaiian dance show as part of a private buffet on the Great Lawn between the buildings.  Night time serenaded by the Hilton Luau on top of the parking garage next door!  24. Free AC, wifi, and unlike the Hilton hotel rooms, no resort fees, and no 24%  state hotel tax.  $35 parking per day for both hotel guests and HGV guests, so don't bring a car. 25. Every tower has their own pool, and there is a main pool with slides, for hotel and HGV guests only.  Good enforcement preventing guests trying to save unoccupied pool chaises when not in the pool area.   26. Avoid all the overpriced restaurants on the premises, and eat fast food take out from Food Pantry, or eat nearby at Wailana Coffee Shop, Goofys, Steak Shack, Waikiki Cheeseburger, or Grand Harue, all within a 10 minute walk from our room.27.

Yes, Hawaii! This has always been on my bucket list of trips. Never did I ever think I would go to Hawaii but there I was. We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach on the island of Oahu so don't let the name fool you. The resort? Amazing! The service? Amazing! The food? Amazing! I could not have been more pleased with this vacation. The amenities on site include pizza, pasta, sandwiches, ice cream and my favourite...Starbucks! Two of them to be exact. If all of that was not enough, the shopping is ridiculously great. My favourite store? Louis Vuitton, yes there is a Louis Vuitton on site. On top of everything else, the fireworks are the cherry on top of the sundaes (yes sundaes...plural) that we indulged in almost every night. Our room was immaculate, two bedrooms plus the pull-out sofa, a full kitchen with fridge, stove, microwave and coffee maker. The lagoon was like having your own personal beach, the kids enjoyed paddle boarding, water trikes and kayaks, as well as the basic swimming. The pools were clean and although two of the water slides were closed, the kids enjoyed riding the same ones over and over again. The staff were great, very personable and always willing to help. As for the surroundings, there was no shortage of places to be and things to see. The mall is a short 10 minute walk and there are multiple restaurants surrounding the hotel grounds. Being from Canada, the kids were keen to attend IHOP everyday and the Buffalo Wild Wings was not far at all. The McDonalds was always on the kids list, although we never made it (I want to so this was an accident but Mama Bear, is not keen on McDonalds).

HHV is an extremely busy property year round. We choose to stay at the Lagoon Tower because of the size of the rooms, the location of the building, and the ease of getting into and out of Waikiki. It's not smack dab in the middle of what everyone imagines Waikiki to be, but that's what we like. The Lagoon Tower is a converted condo so the room sizes are comfortable, as opposed to the more recently constructed Grand Waikikian, where the rooms are more hotel sized. We always stay in a 2-bedroom ocean front because those are the nicest rooms. These rooms were recently refurbished. Carpets are not as drabby and worn and the furniture is new. Kitchen appliances seem to have remained the same, though. The chairs in the living room are a joke. It's quite possible the designer never sat in the chair. It is downright uncomfortable. There's two of them, so really the only seating options are the couch and the patio furniture.Lagoon still has an elevator problem where you have to make sure you allot enough time to catch an elevator during peak times. They are fast cars so once you get on it's not so bad. Guests seem to have learned to queue better except for the occasional rude head of the family that thinks they are more important than everyone else waiting for the elevator.Aside from that, if you want to stay in the middle of Honolulu with a larger family, hands-down, this is the place to be aside from a vacation rental home.

Still, the Hawaiian Village location, with its expansive ocean and lagoon frontage, wide beaches, lush landscaping, abundant on-site dining and shopping, and proximity to other attractions, including Ala Moana Park and the shopping center, is unbeatable in Waikiki.

The property is immense, and it was nice to have shopping and small restaurants on the property that accepted room charge payments (but were not necessarily part of the hotel's restaurant choices). For example, you can eat in/take out at Round Table Pizza, CJ's Deli, Fresco Italian restaurant, and Blue Water Crab. There is easy quick access to the beach (crowded but nice), the Atlantis submarine tour company is right on site, service at the restaurants was very good and friendly. The pool was very nice, w/ several water slides. 2 were not operational when we were there, but the one that was involved a dark tunnel - very speedy and fun! My 5 year old son had a blast with that water slide. You have access to free DVD rentals of new releases (DVD Now). That is a nice thing for families. Stayed at the Lagoon Tower, one of several tower residences at the HHV. We had a 1 bedroom suite with a full kitchen (full size refrigerator and 4 burner electric stove, full size microwave, dishwasher, utensils and plates - wonderful for families). The other really great thing is the free use of laundry & drying machines on most if not all the floors of the Lagoon Tower. This was invaluable as we had been vacationing for 1 week at other resorts in other parts of Hawaii, and being able to do laundry conveniently and for free is AMAZING (any family with small children will definitely agree). There is a Play station 3 in the living room, attached to a 50+ inch size flat screen TV. Self parking is available for $32/day. It was convenient. One complaint - no recycling on the property. That may not bother some people, but it did bother me. There was so much in terms of water bottles, cans, glass bottles, paper, etc that were just thrown into the trash.

The view was gorgeous, couldn't ask for a better view well maybe a oceanfront. Glad to see they updated the furnishings and that tv is awesome..well besides the tv guide not really being accurate. the kitchen was fully stocked with everything you need including a rice cooker.the master bathroom..man I read abut the bidets and I loved it. at first it took a little getting used to but man once you use it you can't go back. The sofa is a pullout bed but we never used.okay now on to my main complaint..it's the noise. we couldn't get away from it. the lounge plays music till 1030-11pm and it carries all the way over. slightly annoying but whatever. my sister and brother rin law took the other bathroom and thr delivery trucks and the little sand grooming carts would wake them up at 530-6am everyday. would a higher floor solve that? maybe..so I regret not going to themanager about the noise.we used the pool once and it was cold..we preferred to go to the beach itself and it sucked not having a shower or foot rinse thing besides at he pool area..hassle to go there with kids and ur beach crap.laundry was convenient we ran several loads but ran into the problem of people leaving their laundry in the machines and not taking them out..house keeping can't touch t so you have to call for a manager to move it and bag it up. housekeeping was great since we were using a timeshare they cleaned it once for us and they were great about providing anything else you needed by calling or texting.the location is good and bad...the good it's way easier to drive here then our usual destination at the wyndham beachwalk. the bad is that it's damn far away from everything 15 mins walk to ala moana or 20 min walk to kapahulu or Kuhio. my feet were killing me by the end of our trip.during checkout the power went out..lol I seriously have the weirdest moments ago the front desk area..always an adventure! that being said..our family enjoyed the hotel and my kids would have enjoyed it more if they were older..PS: food on site is a marked up eg. blue ocean shrimp is $18 vs 15 at the mall..we would drive to get food like at me bbq, poke from foodland or udon from marakume, also a food pantry on Hobron.","Vancouver, Canada",22,4.0

The way I understand it,the first 12 floors are hotel units and the upper floors are the timeshare units. Our stay on the 16th floor was ocean front and was very nice. I'd guess the unit size was approx 1000 sq ft with typical HGVC features. I guess each resort in the complex has its positives and maybe negatives. One thing that we liked about Kalia was it was closest to the entrance of the Hawaiian village and thus quieter,without the crowd of pedestrians about the area.(Also,you can check in at the Kalia bldg if staying there)There is a Starbucks at the lobby level. Observations:the beach will be the longest distance to travel amongst the buildings. The Kalia pool appears to be smaller than the other resorts/buildings. Incidentally,none of the pools throughout the complex are heated... and they are cold until ya get use to them. Only things I could say that could be an improvement are: The AC fan speeds on high provides minimal circulation. Ceiling fans in the bedroom and living room would be helpful. At times,It felt like a hot 68 degrees.Parking: Parking is not cheap at 32 bucks a day. 39 for valet.Pay the extra bucks for parking,as getting to your car isnt the easiest and... when the resort is crowded or conferences on site... you can drive around a bit before finding a space- Pay the extra 50 bucks(as nothing is cheap in Hawaii).Should I rent a car? YES. If you really want to see the island,just booking tours isnt going to do it... Getting out of Waikiki will allow you to drive to the more natural,scenic areas. Traffic won't be alot of fun but things will quiet down once you get off the ""H"" highways and cruise along the coast around the island. Restaurants: there are plenty of choices within the area. Some at the village can get quite pricy,which I guess is ok if you are rich like I'm not(30 dollar breakfasts come to mind). Another good reason to rent that car. Also,a drive to the nearby Walmart worked for us for getting coffee and mornin stuff. Other good choices within 1 mile or less walking distances(see those reviews) and plenty of choices by car and cheaper.Lastly: all the staff was very nice and helpful at our Kalia Tower stay.","Hernando, Florida",64,4.0

I love Hilton Hawaiian village and have stayed here about 10 times so far - always in the rainbow tower: this time the hotel was sold out and had to get a room in the timeshare tower - Lagoon. I do not like staying at a timeshare in Hilton compared to the hotel - as a diamond member the benefits are terrible. In the hotel you get all the benefits of being diamond including room upgrades, late checkout and food vouchers for you and a guest each day of your stay (they used to have a lounge but no more). When you stay in the timeshare section you get two bottles of water during your stay and 2,000 Hilton points - that is it! Really no benefit at all which is frustrating. Plus checkout is firm at 10 AM. The timeshare rooms are bigger and have a kitchen which can be useful for some families (I have never cooked on vacation - well, don't cook at home either so I guess I never need one :). Bathroom was outdated. Balcony was nice. Hallway loud with doors slamming all night (that can happen anywhere). Views not as nice as rainbow tower.The Hilton village itself though is wonderful and I would not stay anywhere else on the island. Beautiful grounds and pools. The gym in the Tapa tower could use some updating. The resort fee is outrageous! Come on - 30 bucks plus tax for internet?! That is not unique to this hotel but is just a travesty in the hotel industry. Just add hat to the cost of the room and not call it a resort fee. (Personal pet peeve there).The timeshare sales pitch is relentless. Asked where the bathrooms are and got cornered into a 5 minute spiel. Although we ended up doing the presentation for some Hilton village dollars to spend during our stay. 90 minutes of our time was well worth it and it was pressure free. The beach is amazing. Last minor complaint is with the towel stands. The pools close at 7 yet the towel stand closes at 5 at some pools? It then directs you to another pool and towel stand which was also closed. This happened on two nights. Can't they keep the towel stands open till the pool closes? Overall though will definitely stay at the hotel part of the Village again. But if you end up at the timeshare it is nice as well!","Minneapolis, Minnesota",298,3.0

Room was a 1 bdrm garden view third floor unit facing the pool. Issues: Noise :Due to the fact that we were on a low floor the noise from the pool area was extensive which could be expected however the noise from the pool was still quite loud with balcony doors closed. (very poor sound proofing) I have stayed in low floor units at the grand waikikian (newer tower) and the soundproofing is so much better. (hilton needs to improve soundproofing at next refurb of lagoon tower)Pool with slides: Pool is way overcrowded to the point the pool was shut down multiple times for cleaning. (I am not just talking about unavailable chairs which is also an issue but literally the pool itself and number of bathers) This pool has the only slides on property the majority of families flock to this pool which is grossly undersized. I also question how good of a job they do cleaning the pool based on the dirty towel that was at the bottom of the closed slide the duration of our trip. (see photo) When the new timeshare tower opens which has only a plan for a small quiet pool which won't attract families I can only imagine the crowds then. Another issue I have is that the slides close at 5 pm. When on Oahu I believe many vacationers do activities during the day and return to the resort around this time only to discover that the slides are closed on the most popular pool. (why? cost cutting?) I stayed at Disney aulani and the water slides were open to 9 pm.Pool Staff: I have stayed at a good number of family timeshare resorts (multiple Disney Vacation Club resorts and Marriott vacation club resorts) and the staff here had to be the most unprofessional I have ever experienced. The staff was constantly on their cellphones talking / texting / listening to music and not doing an adequate job of monitoring the slides and pools. adults and children were jumping and climbing on rocks into the pool / at closing of slides adults and children climbed over fences and went down slides / no staff in area (one caveat security officers when on scene did enforce rules) Food: Specifically Poolside Pronto Pickle / food was premade, over priced and disgusting. Again I have stayed at dvc resorts and marriots and understand the premium price paid for poolside food (convenience etc.) however both those hotel chains provide good edible food. (hilton should be ashamed)Positives: Staff Front Desk, bell services, bar staff, restaurant staff (besides pool staff) were all very friendly and accommodating.Rooms: Clean,comfortable and spacious (except for soundproofing) and a good home base for a family visiting Oahu. Location: I have stayed at both Disney Aulani and Marriott Koolina and although I favor those resorts over HHV they are far away from the locations I like to visit on the island (south and east sides) Also as part of my Oahu trips I love to explore the local cuisine and HHV being located in Honolulu provides an abundance of dining opportunities touristy and non touristy unlike Koolina Resort Area which lacks the variety that HHV'S location provides.With the pros and cons of this resort I think people need to be aware of the issues before booking a stay and make their on choice on whether or not to stay here. I just wish Hilton would listen to some of the issues I have addressed as well as countless others which would really improve the quality of this resort in relation to other big name timeshare resorts.","Quincy, Massachusetts",8,2.0

While I expected a nice stay at a nice resort, the magnitude of this resort and the surrounding area caught me completely by surprise. I'll try to sum it up here as best I can. As I always do, I'll start with the cons and finish with what I really liked.Note that this is the Grand Vacations portion of Hilton Hawaiian Village, not the hotel/resort. I was very happy to find this time share section separate from the hotel. The hotel towers offered mostly basic hotel rooms and mostly double beds. Here we got a one bedroom, with kitchen and separate living room, for just a bit more than standard rooms at the resort cost. In my mind, it's a no brainer to book with Grand Vacations when possible.I only really have one gripe about my stay, and that was my room assignment. While I looked up floorplans for the building (Lagoon tower) and was happy with what I saw, the room I got was actually a little different. I was given a smaller room than the standard 1 bedroom because of the stairwell next door, so the room configuration was different. Instead of the open floorplan with kitchen+peninsula overlooking the living room, our small kitchen with little counter space was in a space no bigger than an oversized closet. After returning and looking more into it, it appears that these rooms are the *68 rooms on floors above the 8th floor. My brother and his family, who also booked a 1 bedroom, got the nicer floorplan across the hall. At the end of the day it didn't matter all that much to us. Our oceanview room overlooked the pool (from a high floor, very little noise), the marina, and the ocean. We could watch planes take off and land from the airport, and even saw our cruise ship come in the morning of our cruise. It was a spectacular view overall!Other than that minor gripe, I don't have much else negative to say. The resort is massive! I knew that going in but didn't fully grasp the magnitude. Lots of restaurants, shops, and activities right there in the village. The lagoon had a number of water toys to rent, provided a safe/calm area for young kids to play, and was gorgeous to look at. There were a number of pools, however we only made it to the one next to the Lagoon tower, which was the best in my opinion. There really was a lot to see just walking around the resort, it was fun to just grab a drink from the bar and walk around checking everything out. Restaurants ranged from nice sit-down restaurants to quick carry-out type places. It was great being able to grab a pizza and take it back up to our room. The only activity we did was SUP, which was a lot of fun. Very expensive, but the Lagoon is a great place to learn and find your sea legs.The location is great, right there at one end of Waikiki beach. It is possible to walk the length of the beach, though there's one section in front of the Sheraton where you need to go up and walk along a sidewalk right at the edge of the ocean. We walked about half way down the 1.9 mile beach one night before a thunderstorm pushed us back to our own resort. When you're tired of the beach, the Ala Moana shopping center is basically right across the street, and Waikiki itself is very walkable directly from the hotel. We walked to a good vantage point to watch the parade the day after thanksgiving, and then rushed back to the resort to see the Friday night fireworks.Parking is convenient to the tower, but expensive. However, when you have a kitchen if you take a trip to the grocery store and eat in for a few meals, you can pretty much make up for the parking charges right there. While it is expensive, it's a flat daily fee with in/out privileges.We checked out on a Saturday to head to the cruise port, and the lobby area (open air) was an absolute mess with the hordes of people all checking out. I don't know that there's much the property can do about that, as it's probably just a once-a-week occurrence. But it's something to be aware of. It took us about 30 minutes from when we got to the lobby until we were in a cab heading to the cruise port.All in all, I was very happy with the stay here. We definitely didn't stay here long enough (only 5 nights) to do everything the resort had to offer, and we are planning another trip. Next summer we'll be staying in a 2-bedroom for another 5 nights. I honestly wouldn't pick any other Waikiki property.","Cincinnati, Ohio",11,5.0

The unit was beautiful and very big. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, full kitchen - every thing you need. It was fantastic for our family of five. We booked a garden view and i was a bit worried about what our view would be. We had a corner unit with two balconies. The back balcony looked over the road and a carpark but the side balcony had a view of the great lawn and lagoon and beach - it was beautiful and perfect!!! From the back balcony you could see the resorts Luau each night - by night 10 i was a bit over it though!!! So loud! Also if they have a function on the great lawn it is very noisy. They had one the first day we arrived and after no sleep on our flight over it was awful as the children kept waking to the sound of loud drums and singing! Lucky they don't have functions on every night. We had housekeeping daily - all very satisfactory.The Lagoon Tower also had its own check in - when we arrived no one was waiting and the lady at check in was lovely. Compared to the main check in where i never saw a line of less than 20 people i was very grateful for this.The resort is huge - very much a village but we loved it! It was very busy and children everywhere. The pools were packed and there was never an empty pool lounge but if you wait a few minutes people are always coming and going. There isn't enough shade by the pools though especially in the middle of summer. My children loved the beach so the fact the resort was on the beach is perfect. There were so many options..beach, pool, lagoon - it was perfect. Only a 10 minute walk into town too!We ate at Tropics, the pizza store and got numerous items from the ABC store as well. It had everything you need. We ate brekky in our room every day all with items purchased from ABC Store. For lunches you can have ready made sandwiches and salads too - all very nice. You couldn't order food to eat by the pool - you had to go and get it yourself but you could order drinks. It was expensive to hire beach umbrellas and chairs from the resort - crazy you have to pay for shade when you are paying so much for the resort. If you walk down the beach a bit SUP's and umbrellas, chairs are cheaper. Surf lessons should be done on the iconic Waikiki Beach - a lot better than at the resort.The resort was great - we loved it but its huge and there is nothing personal about it. I would recommend it though and stay there again.","Sydney, Australia",47,4.0

We wrote a lengthy complaint on a HGVC form provided by our long-term Sales Rep. As we were leaving for our return, the Resort Manager who had evidently seen the complaint approached us and promised to do better on our next visit. If you look at my review for our stay in 2014, we were less than enthralled with issues that were not resolved to our satisfaction by this same Resort Manager.Our room which did not face Diamond Head but an ""eyesore hotel"" next door to the property was located adjacent to the elevators. The noise and vibration caused by the operation of the elevators was a source of sound intrusion day and night. Particularly disturbing for those in master bedroom and trying to get to sleep at night.During this stay, we received 2 notices that puts a damper on things:1. June 1, 2016--On June 2nd from 10:30 am to 4:30 pm you will not have any hot water supply.2.June 2, 2016--On June 3rd from 11:30 pm to 4:00 am you will not have any hot or cold water service.The room renovations and furniture/appliance upgrades that were made are OK. The furniture for our 2 bedroom Penthouse was very basic, non-descript, and functional. The appliances were not of a superior nature. The shower heads were not full flow water; it took us 3 times as long to shower and rinse that it does normally. I would have preferred a larger shower head, higher up with full water blast versus the Japanese toilet seat in the master bathroom which boasted remote controls, heated seat, and bidet functions. Plus no washer and dryer in your room it is down the hall for you to access with everyone else on the floor. By the way they are in the rooms at the Grand Waikiki'an!Why have a gate at the pool if you're not going to supervise the non-guests who seemingly walk-in without key access or those who simply jump over the unguarded pool gates? This has happened year after year at the Paradise Pool and we have complained to no avail. That and under age children in hot-tub/whirlpools is prevalent and not enforced by staff.Overall, our whole experience as Lagoon Tower Penthouse Owners was not up to the expected HGVC standards or the HOA maintenance fees and taxes paid annually.","College Station, Texas",50,2.0

It was about 80% parking lot/hotel and 20% ocean. The hotel manager has addressed this on other reviews stating that you can technically see some ocean and that people should have booked an ocean front room. ""Ocean view"" is an industry standard term. You don't get to make up your own definition for it. The room we had was a resort or island view, maybe a partial ocean view or obstructed ocean view. We received a letter in our room that we would have no hot water from 10:30a-4:30p on our last day. No offer to compensate guests for 6 hours without hot water. By 6pm, the hot water still wasn't on and I had to take a cold shower to get ready for dinner. I called the concierge about it twice. The first employee had no idea the hot water was going to be off that day and said she would call back after asking about it. She never called back. The second employee cheerfully said the hot water would be back on at 5:30pm. This was at 6pm. I finally had to ask for some compensation for 7.5 hours without hot water. I was given a $100 resort credit. I thought the property was beautiful, but I would stay somewhere else next time. We really wanted an ocean view (which is why we booked one). It's sad that the staff can't understand why that would be disappointing. I also can't believe they wouldn't offer any type of compensation to everyone that had no hot water for an entire day. They just didn't care.","Overland Park, Kansas",0,3.0

We booked using points rented privately through a HGVC member.The resort its self is large with lots to do. The pools are hectic and there isn't much in the way of staff supervision. On one occasion in the Tapa pool some young teenagers were playing rough and throwing balls around the pool. It wasn't enjoyable to sit around with this going on so we moved on to another pool. I'm not against pool games but it was rowdy and there were no staff to calm the situation down. The other pools were always busy but in general you could get a chair close by. The kids pool in the super pool area doesn't have any seating around it which is odd considering that it is a kids pool. There is the Hau Tree Bar right next door, we went for lunch and a few drinks and could watch the kids swim at the same time.Lagoon pool was fun but again, always very busy.Don't expect to have a serene cocktail by the pool experience, this resort is go go go all of the time. There is a pool up in the Kalia tower that seemed much quieter but its a bit of a hike to get to if you arent staying at that tower.The food options are OK, nothing special and again very busy. We didn't eat in at any of the restaurants for dinner, instead opting for the walk into Waikiki or getting take out and eating in our rooms.The rooms in the lagoon tower have recently been renovated and are really nice. The one bedroom was easily big enough for a family (King in the bedroom and a pull out sofa in the lounge) and the small but well equipped kitchen made it possible to make breakfast / lunch etc.We had family staying in a 2 bedroom suite and it was massive (2 bedrooms with a king and twin beds plus a pull out in the lounge). The lounge, kitchen and dining room were huge and easily accommodated us all for dinner etc.We have travelled to Hawaii many times and for us the location of the resort wasn't convenient. We only stayed here as were were travelling with family who wanted to stay and they did enjoy the location and facilities.

Our room (for two adults) was clean, comfortable and plenty of hot water. It was a basic room with no balcony - we chose this as it was a cheaper option. The rest of our family, daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren, aged 5 and 2, had a very large two bedroom suite with lounge area. Their balcony looked over the lagoon and out to the ocean. The Hilton Waikiki is a great place for children with kid friendly pools, shallow in some parts, and with three water slides, which our five year old grandson loved. The lagoon is also a great place for the children, with paddle boats (for a cost) and the beach is also lovely and very warm. We ate at the Tropics restaurant on a couple of occasions and the meals were enjoyable though perhaps a little expensive. The staff were, on the whole, friendly and helpful, although we did strike some on the front desk who were, perhaps, having a bad day! It is an easy 10 - 15 minute walk to Ala Moana shopping centre and about 20 mins to the busy downtown area.

I will always stay this hotel if I can as I love the rooms, view, service, eating options, multiple pools, semi-private beach, I could go on and on....I do wish is was a little closer to the downtown core, but a quick taxi, bus ride or a lovely evening walk will get you there no problem.",Vancouver,2,5.0

Thank God for Duke's Lagoon and the massive beach to offer some relief.

There was literally a line to board 3 elevators in the Lagoon tower at 4pm on a Saturday!!Other than that, staff is friendly and surprisingly patient considering the mayhem. Our room in the Lagoon tower was fantastic and completely renovated. Highly recommend Lagoon tower for closest to pool and beach. Kalia is significantly back from the water.No presumptions here but be prepared for a significant number of foreign visitors at this resort. Oahu is most popular for non US visitors and HHV attracts a lot of them.In summary, Hilton GV has the right moves on most properties but due to a variety of factors they are working hard to maximize their waikiki property for profitability at the cost of visitor comfort. Sure there's 20 restaurants but there is very little open space in an area (waikiki) which is already dense with tourists!

We booked thru a booking website which would only allow 4 people on the booking even though the Apt could sleep 6, but Hilton were kind enough to not charge for the extra person utilizing the sofa bed, which was great. Apt was very modern, spacious, with large flat-screen TVs in both bedrooms + living room. Kitchen was well appointed, with electric oven, cooktop, microwave, dishwasher (& plenty of washing powder provided!), filter coffee machine (coffee provided) & large pantry. We had 2 balconies, one overlooking the Starlight Rooftop Luau at night! That was very loud & ran from about 5.30pm-8.30pm so for us, with older teenagers, that didn't disturb our sleep. Keep it in mind if staying with younger children & ask to be at the other end of the tower. Oh & at 7.45pm every Friday night there's an amazing fireworks display which you have a perfect view of from your room (if it faces the lagoon, as ours did)! Again, very loud but incredible, & can't believe they do it every week!Restaurants around the resort complex include a number of Japanese restaurants, a pizza restaurant (eat-in & take-out), a pub-style bar/deli, an Italian restaurant, a fish & chips shop (eat-in & take-out, with HUGE number of choices & very cheap), a couple of bars (big shout-out to Cindy at the Tapa Bar!) & Pronto Pickle joints serving poolside snack-type foods, plus ice cream & coffee shop. Had to walk to main shopping area for more choice of better restaurants though (15min walk). ABC stores on-site provide limited supermarket & alcohol supplies + some pre-prepared meals, as well as touristy souvenirs (cheap but good Hawaiian shirts!). Save all your receipts from every ABC store purchase & redeem them for a free gift before you leave - spend $100 & get a coffee mug or shopping bag, or $300 gets you an excellent beach bag, towel or t-shirt!We were charged compulsory resort charge of US$30/day which entitled us to 2 bottles water per day, DVD rental (which we didn't use), cultural activities & morning yoga classes (which we only did once), family movies by the pool (which we didn't do), some sort of photo (which we didn't do), possibly free access to their Atlantis underwater viewing submarine (which we didn't do), free wifi (only worked in the room, not in public areas) which everyone got anyway I think! So quite a rip-off for us, but if we were more organized we could have got more benefit. Take note! Use what you've paid for!Biggest negative was being hassled about doing a 90 min Time Share ""information session"" & ""receiving a free gift of a whale-watching cruise"" every time we asked the concierge for anything. Particularly as we didn't find the concierges very knowledgable about most things - like shuttle bus times to & from Waikele Outlets (""Come back whatever time you want"" but actually 2.30pm at earliest), or car hire (""What? What? Oh you mean vehicle rental"") or what time to check in for a domestic flight between islands (WAY WAY WAY too early!).Overall though it was a fantastic place to stay, a perfect home away from home.

On 2 separate days, our beds were not made and the room was not serviced at all when we returned in the evening. Both times we called housekeeping.

The second time, we came back around 5 pm and the beds were not made and the room hadn't been cleaned. We asked for someone to come and cleaned the room while we went out to dinner. There were other misses as well .... where they cleaned the room and did not clean out the coffee maker or left the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and not run it. I had to run the dishwasher in the evening in order to have clean dishes for the morning breakfast.We stayed at this same building last March for 10 nights and didn't encounter the same problem.

This resort is in a great location right on the beach compared to many other hotels that are across the street from the beach. The lagoon in front of the resort is also perfect for kids. The hotel has a kids pool with long slides, apparently only 2 hotels in Honolulu have this. Our kids just love it. Being a resort village, one has access to all the amenities right on site. It's about 10 minutes walk into Waikiki in one direction and to the Ala Moana Mall and Walmart in the other direction. Extremely convenient. Lots to do, see and eat. We had stayed in the hotel side of this resort in the past. This year and last year we stayed in the Hilton Grand Vacations because we wanted a suite with a kitchen and there's also a complimentary laundry facility right on the floor. With 5 years old twins, the Grand Vacations rooms and amenities just make more sense. The room rate is the same as a similar sized room on the Hilton Hotel side but those hotel rooms/suites do not have a kitchen. The kids' pool just happens to be right downstairs in this building too so it's very convenient for us. The front desk, bell and concierge staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The cleaning staff are not that friendly. You're greeted with a lei/mac nut necklace upon arrival. The room is well appointed and looks like a very nice condo. We had a one bedroom suite with a pullout sofa bed in the living room. It's about 700 sqft. The room is nice and quiet. The one qualm I have is the water pressure from the shower head is very very weak. Also, during our 11 nights stay, 2 of those days the cleaning staff didn't come to clean our room. The first time, we came back after dinner to find the room unmade. It was too late to have someone come so we just asked for some fresh towels. The second time we came back around 5 pm to find the room unmade so we asked for someone to come up to clean while we went out to dinner. This didn't happen when we stayed last year. There's a resort fee and as a part of this, you get access to movies and games rental. There wasn't much selection whatsoever for games or movies that are appropriate for kids under 10. Luckily we brought our own ipads with movies and games, and we could also access Netflix through wifi, My husband wanted to use the gym while we were there. There's only one small gym located in a separate building at another end of the resort. It doesn't have a lot of equipment so just be aware. There's also a kids club on site but the fee per day is high. We ended up hiring a baby sitter from happykidsmaui.com for 2 evenings. We used them last year as well. The sitter and the over service from Happy Kids were excellent. Overall, we had an excellent stay and have just booked our trip for next February last night. :)","Toronto, Canada",1,5.0

There are several pools to take advantage of. One with slides for the kids, an even small pool that starts very shallow for younger children, a super pool, etc. There are restaurants, including a Round Table Pizza (good for take out).

We stayed in the Lagoon tower, a 1 bedroom apartment for 3 adults. Booked last April having read lots of good reviews, then of course just before we flew out, i did the usual thing i guess we all do, i looked again, and all i could see were peoples gripes and negativity . so spent 10 hours on the plane over there convinced we d get the worst rooms, next to the building work !!! How wrong we were....!! It is just awesome. The lagoon tower has had some dodgy reviews in the past, but in our opinion, its the best tower in the quieter part of the resort, had its own check in and was close to everything on site. Yes , there is another tower being built but it is away from the lagoon tower and we were not bothered by it. there seems to be some snobbery about the lagoon tower, and its reffered to as the ""timeshare' accommodation, but it was just great , we cant fault it. Our apartment looked like it hadnt been used before it was in such immaculate shape, obviously newly refurbished from top to bottom, spacious, lovely , modern furniture full sized kitchen and sumptious bed linen. The sofa bed in the lounge was for our adult daughter and unlike most sofa beds, this one had a proper bed mattress, not the thin foam type you usually get in hotels. We had a view of the paradise pool below,the marina and partial lagoon ,sea views from a good sized balcony. All the balconies are well spaced apart from each other . We were not hassled by timeshare sales as previous guests had mentioned, yes there were vouchers for ""free"" prizes and "" 50.000 honors points "" ,in the apartment but they clearly stated in the small print that it was time share promotional stuff and you had to attend a presentation so we never attempted to claim our 'free gifts "" !! Every staff member we encountered was friendly and courteous, the room attendant/maid did a great job and topped up our towels and toiletries daily. Yes, its a huge resort, but with lovely gardens and pools, ornamental waterfalls etc, and yet everything was so clean and tidy. We are fortunate to be able to take our holidays anytime and i guess that in school holidays , the place is packed full, which is why we avoid those times. There is so much space to wander around the resort both on and off the beach and pool areas, it never felt crowded and never had to wait to be served at any of the bars or restaurants, unlike when we went for a walk to the Moana Surfrider Hotel, supposedly a 5 start hotel where we encountered surly staff, had to wait to get served and saw they had a rammed full, squashed pool area, no thanks, couldnt wait to get back to the Hilton Village ! A great resort, both family and couple friendly brilliant location, we couldnt fault it and i would love to go back BUT..our problem has started since we returned, i booked and paid back in April thru a high street, well known travel agency, who use via expedia , on check out, 5th March , i was told we had to pay USD $2777 approx, whoa, i said, its all pre paid by agent and expedia, heres my reciept , the clerk said, oh , yes, that fine, so off we went to start our reluctant journey home, on tuesday, i was checking my credit card statement, and to my horror, the hilton had charged me that amount after we had left. So, since then, i ve been battling to get it refunded, yes, its an error i ve been told, and it will be processed, but will take days to come off my statement, at which time its gaining intrest every day, and fluctuating exchange rates will likely leave me out of pocket even today, its still on my visa account. Suffice to say, this has spoiled an otherwise truly wonderful stay in Hawaii. Apparently, they had us down for 2 rooms in error, a system glitch by someone,some where but our agent and expedia rectified that back in April and even when i emailed the Hilton just before we went, ( i explained it was my husbands 50th birthday and was a surprise ) i was asked to confirm how many rooms we had booked,as their system said 2 so i confirmed then on 7th feb that we had only the 1 apartment. So still they charged me AFTER check out, without my consent, fingers crossed i get my refund this week as its AUD $3997 , so lets see how good the Admin team are at this resort, as everyone else has been brilliant","Adelaide, Australia",13,5.0

The Kalia Suites is farthest from the beach but houses the spa and fitness center, the Grand Waikikian is newest, and the Lagoon Tower is closest to the beach and oldest...but is in the midst of a complete renovation. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower.I cannot praise this property highly enough. We LOVE that it is right on the beach, that it is an easy walk to the rest of Waikiki in one direction and Ala Moana in the other, that 90% of what we want to do on Oahu is less than a 20 minute drive away, and that the suites themselves are large and comfortable with full kitchens and with washer/dryers on each floor. And that most of the rooms have great views of the ocean and Diamond Head or the harbor and the pool next to the Lagoon tower has awesome waterslides and hot pools. And that there is a Lapperts downstairs offering amazing Kona coffee starting at 5:30 (for those of us with jet lag) and Hawaiian ice cream all day. And that Honolulu offers some of the best food we've ever eaten anywhere in the world thanks to the fusion of Asian, Polynesian, and European heritage and ingredients but when we are just too exhausted to do anything else we can just go down and eat at one of the many HHV restaurants.We've been bringing our kids and parents to the HHV every other year for 9 years now. This year for the first time we splurged and got one of the few oceanfront (not just oceanview) rooms at the Lagoon Tower - and it was completely worth it. Are there nicer places to stay in Waikiki if you are just a couple - absolutely. But once you have kids (and/or parents) with whom you want to stay there is simply no place better.Lastly a note for all those Hilton Diamond reviewers who complain about the HGVC at HHV mistreating them. For whatever reason Hilton has made a corporate decision to treat the HGVC as a completely separate entity. Neither I nor the Hilton reservation staff can see my HGVC reservation in the Hilton system. HGVC stays don't count toward my elite status and my Hilton elite status doesn't affect my HGVC room selection. Marriott doesn't work this way - even though MVCI is a separate company (just like HGVC). Marriott tracks my MVCI reservations in their system, my MVCI stays count toward my Marriott status (most importantly my lifetime goals), and MVCI resorts 'care' about your Marriott elite status.So please, please, do complain to Hilton corporate about their decision to ignore us when we visit HGVC properties. But HHV is just following Hilton's policies and procedures.","NY, NY",278,5.0

It took a few days to become familiar with the various parts of the village and even then I don't think we covered it all. The village itself is a very busy place with constant flows of guests walking the streets - not so much the beach surprisingly. If it's a relaxing time your seeking I probably wouldn't be considering the Hilton.We had a 2 bedroom suite which was absolutely perfect for ourselves and our 3 teens. On average the size of the suite is probably bigger than the size of some people's average 3 bdrm home. The main bdrm was luxuriously huge and the ensuites were adequate. Our suite had been recently renovated with a contemporary modern touch and the cleaning was tops! - thank you to our maids.The swimming pool areas were small and given the number of guests this property accommodates, they appear far from adequate. Our kids chose to swim at the pool area where there were pool slides. This pool is located on a dark side of the building so wasn't an appealing place to sunbathe or relax. The other main pool area often looked crowded and the seating area is very squashed looking.Both reception and concierge were very helpful and nicely pleasant with socially engaging conversations with ourselves and our kids. Any enquiries/requests made to both reception and housekeeping were answered and met straight away. Our welcome with leis and beads on arrival was a nice touch and Honolulu-like...aloha!We ate within the village at the Tropic restaurant a few nights. The menu wasn't that great but the service from staff was really nice and went out of their way to accommodate us - thanks Brian. There was live music each night as well which were really good and made our night. It's expensive and there are cheaper but still nice places nearby you can wonder out to.We felt the beach was a bit of an overstatement. Although I think that's because we're spoilt for beaches in New Zealand. The sand was gristly and felt hard underneath, i.e. you could wriggle down into the sand if you wanted to. Overall the Hilton Grand vacations is a nice property and we found all staff to be very helpful. Some staff were looking to help us even if we hadn't asked them - that's awesome. I had read in other reviews that people regarded Hilton visitors like a factory-run business - we didn't find this at all and staff at all levels from ground-staff upwards were all so pleasant and helpful.

Upon an early arrival in the morning, check-in staff insisted on a 4pm check in time, so we hung around the shopping just around Hawaiian Village. Ended up sitting next to a fish pond with security wondering what we were doing with the fish in the pond for hours.I booked a 2 bedroom at the Lagoon Tower. It had an apartment style setting and the quality of the room was true to its Hilton name. The site was well maintained for a time-shared property. There were 2 balconies at the room we stayed at, one facing the man-made beach, and the other onto the rooftop of the car park where there are shows happening every night. Every Friday, there is also fireworks at the man-made beach and the view was just to die for. I spent a day sleeping outside on the balcony on a high floor and it was just awesome all rounds.Here are my standard pros and cons:Pros:- Convenience of food and shopping (ABC store) within walking distance- Very discreet room service (ninjas in action)- Super friendly staff (sorta like something out of Disney movies - lilo and stitch comes to mind)- Discount vouchers for Hawaiian Village offered on check in- Nice sun tans on the balconies (but I did get a heat stroke after spending the whole day sleeping in the sun. Serves me right for being an idiot)- Laundry rooms for washing clothes- Great for families who want a ""controlled"" environmentCons: - Can get expensive in the Village (hence most guests are in their 30s-80s possibly due to their sheer amount of wealth accumulated on their pension funds or massive credit card bills)- Got bitten by ONE mosquitoes/sand fly at a high floor. I can't imagine what a lower floor would have to go through- Parking can be confusing (after the first time, you should be right)- Random people yelling in the middle of the night (not Hilton's fault, more like crazy tourists with brain problems)- Time shared property so you will get asked to attend their seminars (a lot)- Noise level can get out of control outside of normal sleeping times (easily fixed with closing windows and turn on the air con)- Self Parking is $24 a day (got given a pass to go in and out of car park during my stay) I think for the amount of $ paid for the rooms, this should really be included.If you are interested in my experience please read on (or you can choose to not be bored to death).I was there during Holoween and it was quite an experience. Hilton had something set up in front of the hotel lawn. It was great for photos and Facebook.Just a note, get a rental car to drive around. Walking downtown or to Ala Moana can be a challenge in 30 degree celcius heat/ 86 fahrenheit. Every time I walked around, it felt like I am being showered in my own sweat. That meant having to wash or buy new clothes. I guess those hawaiian t-shirts that I wear around does look ""unique"" in Australia.This hotel is quite close (15 min walk) to Ala Moana shopping centre or strip mall as you Americans call it (nobody strips). It has every shop (I can think of) under the sun. A short walk the other way is downtown and you will find all the big named brands like Gucci, LV, etc. I'm pretty sure my cracked credit card (due to overuse) is a testament of the sheer amount of things you can buy. Looking forward to my replacement credit card soon.Hilton Honors Gold did make a difference as we were offered to access to Executive lounge.Hope you enjoy this hotel as much as me writing this review.","Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",28,5.0

The village has everything you need, but is a little more expensive then the rest of Waikiki. For a Hilton resort I expected more in the customer service realm, but I think they have gotten so big that they no longer have the luxury to care about its guests individual experiences. Here's my pros/cons if you're debating. Just as an FYI for management: We stayed in 1168 and 1166 at lagoon tower while there with our family during Thanksgiving week.Pros: rooms are a nice size and can provide lots of room for a big family with children: living room, balcony and bed room(s) with great views-fully capable kitchens with dish washing detergent, trash bags and paper towels.-cleaning crew comes once mid-week-The front ocean front suite at lagoon tower was great for Friday fireworks. -The resort has several fun pools-each have their own cool feature so try all of them. The tappas pool was the best for babies because it has a shallow area with bubbles. The lagoon pool has lots of slides and it was really fun, but the water was super cold.-The village has several restaurants that were coco enemy, but most of them lacked quality and reasonable prices so I would else where for dinner. Lunch was convo enemy to have there. I recommend pronto pickle for breakfast. -DVD rental: free unlimited DVD rentals during your stay. There were lots of current movies available.-They provide towels for pools but you have to return them to get a new towel rental card. Each card is $10. This was a hassle, but I understand it.Cons:-There was mold all over our shower head cord in 1166. It had been there a long time. It was easy to wipe off too because I did it. --Cleaning crew turned on one of the stove burners and left it on high. It was the one with an empty tea kettle. We found it hours later. -Hotel customer service lacked initiative or desire to please customers. The feel I got was that the staff there let the location of Waikiki and name of Hilton say it all. They made no attempt to make the guests experience memorable like other resorts I've stayed. Examples below:-We tried to get a taxi at lagoon tower and we had to interrupt 2 hotel staff members whose job is to find out where we want to go and then whistle to the taxi in line. They kept talking even after we arrived and stood next to them and they made eye contact with us. Finally after a couple mins, my husband, annoyed with them, interrupted and they kindly got us a taxi.-They are doing renovations, so before you book, call to ask what week they're renovating each floor. At Thanksgiving they were doing the 12th floor and it was SO loud. We had a baby who was woken up. We called several times to complain. It woke us up a couple days and our neighbors came to us because they also had a baby woken up. The front desk gave us $50 credit on our first complaint, but then apologized for every call afterwards. They were supposed to be moving down to the 11th floor soon. -There are two hot tubs at lagoon, but despite having signs that say a max 9 and no one under 5 yrs old allowed, I never saw it without those rules broken. At one point there were 25 people in both tubs and several people had floaties in their arms, so yes they were under 5. -The rentals for the tiny lagoon are CRAZY expensive. A paddle board for 1 hour is $41 with tax. Just go to the beach down the side walk and it's $25. I think it should be more reasonable prices for guests who are paying to stay here!In summary, it's a beautiful place that provides everything you need in the village, for the right price of course. It was a lot of fun, but I wouldn't expect a lot of extras besides a place to sleep and shower and cool pools near by. This place is massive and has thousands of guests each week so expect crowded pools and average to less than average customer service. ","Charlottesville, Virginia",43,4.0

I found a 1/2"" hole in the bathroom wall at the paper dispenser. The sleeper sofa was quite worn. On the positive, all appliances worked well, though the main television required some maintenance (sound with no picture a couple of times).I had added an additional two nights onto this stay. This required moving into a different two-bedroom suite because the ocean view room I originally booked had no availability past the originally book six nights.The second room was even roomier, but again, the need for renovations was quite evident. I found trim around the floor to be badly in need of replacement. The sofa was also worn, and the tables had similar chips, scratches, and scrapes.The front desk was adequately responsive to any concerns. The AC unit in the second room malfunctioned, and it took about one hour for this to be corrected.

The cleaning service was very good.You will need to be prepared to pay premium dollar for items (food and otherwise) at the stores and restaurants in the village, but this shouldn't surprise anyone. There are plenty of places to purchase food and souvenirs within easy walking distance of the resort.Overall, the Lagoon Tower is a nice place to stay. However, if you are more interested in a more luxurious location, including having in-room washer/dryer and whirlpool tub, then choose the Grand Waikikian instead.

It is NOT the owners fault that you rate this room that way. We would had been better off with resort view at least then the place across the street isn't looking at me sitting in my living room. Will be looking to take the loss and leave the property. We are Hilton Gold members and a hotel would not get away with this. Looking to move out as soon as we find something and lose our prepaid money. Never again will we use HILTON Grand Vacation Club for our travel.","Jacksonville, Florida",13,1.0

Not a bad deal $799 for 6 days. I was specific that I could only travel if I had a business center access. Having stayed in Hilton's around the world, I was shocked to learn that the HIlton Business Center here is NOT 24-hours and you have to PAY FOR USING IT. Coupled with a sluggishly slow internet connection in the rooms, the inability to work while traveling at the HIlton Hawaiian Village was incredibly ridiculous. As a single mother who owns my own business, I can only travel with my children when I am certain I can use a business center or internet connection during prime business hours on the mainland. The sales team lied directly when they told me the business center was 24 hours. I mentioned it to the hotel and I was given another wifi password - which was also sluggishly slow. Top that off with this is the only HIlton I have ever stayed at that had no room service, and you can call the vacation frustrating. On top of that the food on the property is super expensive and pedestrian. If I wanted to go to an overpriced Benihana or eat hamburgers and hot dogs, I could have stayed in NY or LA. The food here lacks the cultural emphasis one would wish for on a Hawaiian vacation. Also, the luau that were were given tickets to as part of the package was c classic rubber chicken style hotel event. It was held in a conference center and not on the beach so it really had the feel of a obligatory business dinner in a cheap hotel, not a rich Hawaiian flair one would except. Thumbs way down.

Granted, back then I was a HHonors Diamond member and was upgraded to a very nice suite in the Tapa tower. But then, after a stay at the Hilton Seychelles property (see my review on tripadvisor) during which I was downgraded (yes, downgraded) from an Ocean front villa to a regular villa, I swore to switch my business over to a different brand and I did. 8 years later, I decided to see if it was worth giving back my business to Hilton. The short answer is: no. This year, I tried the Hilton Vacations Suite at the Hawaiian Village which is the time-share property in the Hilton Hawaiian resort. We arrived at around 10.30pm after a very long day (we flew all the way from France - no less than 13 hours on two different planes) and pulled into the main lobby driveway with our rental car. There was not a single staff member to help us out with our luggages or with our car (we wanted to valet park). We waited a good 10 minutes. Finally, someone showed up and asked us what we wanted. Ok, if we stop on a driveway where you are supposed to stop to valet park, what is really the purpose of asking us what we wanted? Anyway, we kindly explained we wanted to valet park. The staff member gave us a receipt and drove our car away, not offering any assistance with our luggages. We made our way to the main lobby where someone - who did not bother to ask the simple questions they train clerks to ask, like ""how are you today?"", ""where are you visiting us from?"" - asked us for our name. We did show our reservation print-out and were told we had not stopped at the right place. Hilton - word of advice : when people book at your facility, kindly tell them in an email where to stop and where to check-in. It is nasty to have to stop in one place (after 13 hours on two different planes) only to be told it is the wrong place. We were told to check-in at the Kalia tower, which we did. There, a clerk checked our booking and gave my friends key cards to their room. No polite questions, no information about the resort, not a single nice word welcoming us to the resort. I found out that my booking was yet in a different tower - the Lagoon tower. We asked the clerk if I could also have a room in the Kalia tower. After twenty minutes on the phone, he finally said no and I was sent to the other side of the resort to check-in at the Lagoon tower. Needless to say, by that time I was pretty furious and thought: ""now I remember why I said: Hilton, never again"".I arrived at the Lagoon tower and found out, with horror, that my room was right next to an elevator. As in, the door that you would not believe is a a door leading to a bedroom. You would think that that door (room 1071) would lead to a janitor closet. No, it was actually the door to a bedroom. Amazing! And what happened to my online prefrence ""away from elevator""? Ah, sorry, this is Hilton standard. I opened the room and discovered what Hilton calls a ""studio"". Needless to say, this is just a more fancy way of saying ""bedroom"" with a kitchinette. The room was SO outdated. I had read the reviews here on tripadvisor and unfortunately, they are all true. Those studios are really dated. But you know what, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was decent, the kitchen area was neat. So, apart from the decor which is really old, I have no major complaint about the ""studio"" except that I paid $260/night + taxes: I am afraid to say that this is clearly not worth it. As in, not worth it at all. In the lobby of the Lagoon tower, they had displays of the future makeover due to start in september 2015. The rooms will be beautiful then (and the room of my friends in the Kalia tower was truly beautiful). But there will still be one major issue with the studios in the Lagoon tower: no proper windows. So, you feel really cut out from the world in those studios.Otherwise, I really liked the Lagoon tower. It has a ""vintage"" touch which makes it, in my view, the best tower on the property.Lots of people complain about Honolulu and its gigantic resorts made of concrete. I do not. Do people realize that when these resorts were built, they also embodied a dream, that of affording nice vacations to a larger spectrum of the population? This is what I love about the Hilton Village. It is definitely ""inclusive"", whereas newer resorts strive on ""exclusive""-ness and truly sabotage the dream of vacations in Paradise for the mainstream that represents Waikiki and its big resorts.The resort itself is really nicely located, in the heart of everything you could possibly want. Shops, beaches, restaurants, excursions, you name it.I love the fact that the resort is like a small city. I like the fact that it is crowded. I like the fact that it is anonymous and that you can blend in, without any expectation on the part of the property. You come in just as you are.I would have loved to find a note in my room saying ""welcome back"", given that is was my second stay at the resort. It is good practice to acknowledge returning customers. Is Hilton aware of this? Apparently not.The resort has 2 ABC Shops where I bought fresh fruits in the morning for breakfast ($7 for a small cup of fresh fruits is a bit steep but I guess this is the price to pay in this location). I had coffee at the Starbuck's stand in the Kalia tower.We tried the Benihana restaurant on property which was decent.I found it unacceptable to have to pay for lounge chairs around the lagoon (they will nickel and dîme you).I do have to acknowledge the cleaning staff who did my room. Wow! Cleaning was always impeccable. Great job. Thank you very much.3 days was not enough. I wished I could have stayed more but my next adventure awaited me (a cruise around the Hawaiian islands).Upon checking-out, the clerk was really cold. She did not offer any assistance for a cab or with my luggages. She handed me out the bill and I was the one to say ""good bye"". I got barely a smile back.All in all, I really liked my experience at the resort. I have highlighted the deficiencies above. My main complaint goes to Hilton as a brand: they just do not - as in NOT - have any proper regard for their customers. I felt like a cow ready to be milked. What a shame. Will I switch my business back over to Hilton? Hell, no. I have one more stay coming up at a Doubletree in Anaheim and I expect nothing short of the worst in terms of customer service.

The Tapa Tower, Alii Tower, and Rainbow Tower are for hotel guests, unlike the HGVC towers which are time-share properties with owners who can stay for a few days to a week or more. We love the Lagoon Towers where we have a Premier Two-Bedroom Suite, which overlooks the Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon, the Ala Wai Yacht harbor, Ala Moana Beach, and the rest of the Pacific Ocean. Although the facilities are dated, it does not detract from our vacation. But the three elevators do present challenges as there are times where we waited for 20 minutes before we could get on an elevator and at other times, it was express all the way, both going up and down. Go figure! Anyway, we usually go for a week around July 4 because of the fireworks show sponsored by the Ala Moana Shopping Center. The show is above Magic Island at Ala Moana Beach Park - it is the largest Independence Day show in the State. We have attended the show at the beach but there is just too many people and too much traffic getting out of the park, took us two hours one year. So it is just great to watch the show from on high at the Lagoon Towers. We have eaten at many of the restaurants and like to have one dinner evening at Bali Steak and Seafood - service and staff are just great, and food always onolicious!

Prior to arrival, I had requested for a higher floor and quiet location away from the elevators. Guess what's? They stuck us on the 10th floor right across from the elevators. As Elite Premier members who own at this property, we were very unhappy. Our suite faced out to the lawn and had a full view of the parking lot where luau happened five nights a week, from 5 to well after 10 PM. I placed a call downstairs as soon as we got to our suite and realized we had a bad location. The front desk staff were oblivious, unapologetic and utterly useless. One lady I talked to told me that's the only location for this type of suite, which I think is a lie. But being that it was 11PM at night, I did not argue with her. A couple of nights during our stay, they had catering functions on the lawn and it was party full-on. Wednesday movie nights were also loud. We had two preschoolers with us on this trip, and luckily they were so tired every day they went to bed despite the racket outside. On the plus side, the location is pretty convenient. We walked to Ala Moana mall and to the main drag. Both ways about 15 minutes. The kids loved the lagoon. They were however disappointed when the pool police came and told us we could not use any floats in the pool. Don't eat at the restaurant by pool. They charge $11 for a California roll and $11 for a beer. I also got attacked by a pigeon while eating my food. We loved the other restaurants at the resorts. CJ's, Round Table Pizza, and the Japanises restaurant by the gigantic bird cage that offers half price sushi between 5-6PM. The beds were really comfortable. We only had housekeeping twice but they were very generous with the toiletries.The lagoon tower has three elevators, of which one of them was always broken. Plus they don't have a service elevator. From day two on, we had to press the elevators to go up first, then go down to the lobby. Otherwise there was no chance for the six of us all getting in. It's bit of a joke that some of their staff on the 3rd or 4th floor did not want to use the stairs and made the crowding situation worse. Anyways, that's Waikiki for you. Hot, crowded, touristy. But the kids loved it, and we had a great time inspite of these issues. Will go back next year but prob will make a very lengthy phone call to the hotel front desk first about the suite location.","Vancouver, B.C.",33,4.0

The resort is great for families with young children with the best pools, slides, lagoon pool and onsite activities in Waikiki. The down side is that the resort is enormous and has thousands of rooms and hosts conferences (for thousands of people!). When this occurs there are people everywhere and the activity is frenzied. Poolside chairs become a premium and there are queues everywhere.The resort is also getting tired and one of the 3 lifts breaks down at least every second day so there are queues just to get to your room. Coupled with the building not having a service lift the poor housekeeping staff & bell guys also try to squeeze in to 2 lifts that service a 24 floor building - this part is outrageous.Apart from that, the suite sizes are decent with decent size kitchen, dining, living and bedrooms. Updating is definitely required with beds & carpets showing age.I have listed a lot of negatives, but must stress that in previous years our stays were great. Our daughter enjoyed kids club in previous years (when she was 5-8) and we still love Tropics Bar, the private beach, lagoon and proximity to Ala Moana shops.

It felt a little older than the Lagoon Tower and the 1 bedroom PLUS just felt smaller - not by much, but it may just be the lay-out. I was not up-front (as far as the ocean and the view) but at the back of the HHV facility. I didn't spend as much time enjoying the entire facility as I had in April at Lagoon Tower. The staff seemed to be more friendly but that may be because Lagoon Tower was undergoing a lobby and elevator renovations then. Overall the 9-day stay was perfect and the only disappointment that I had was that my Wi-Fi went down one day but as soon as the tech worked on it the Wi-Fi just flew. The facility is always fun to be in and there is plenty to do without even leaving the premises. Even if you do leave there are plenty of restaurants, beaches and malls adjacent to the premises on both sides. To the west there is the Ala Moana Mall and the Ala Moana Beach Park with restaurants galore on Ala Moana Blvd. To the east there is Fort DeRussey museum beach and the Beachwalk with more restaurants and the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center plus the remainder of Waikiki.","Honolulu, Hawaii",66,4.0

You do however receive 2 complimentary bottles of H20 and 2000 bonus Hhonors points. Now about the Kalia tower. It is definitely the furthest tower from the beach but the closest tower to the parking structure. There is a Starbucks on the ground floor and has its own gym, pool & spa. The recently renovated accommodations were perfect for my family of 3. We reserved the 1 Bedroom Mountain View Suite (w/ sofa bed, full kitchen, 1 bathroom) and received exactly that. It was modern and had unworn furniture. Next time I would definitely pay the extra $$ to get an ocean view since we are in Hawaii. The gym was fairly small for the size of the tower but has all the cardio and weight equipment one would need. But if you're a runner, don't bother w/ the gym, there's a great running path on the strand. The pool seemed empty whenever I passed by it on my way to the gym but was open fairly early if you need to get towels. Housekeeping is daily and did a good job despite the fact that I forgot to tip them one day :(This is my 2nd trip to the HHV and my 1st was at the Ali'i Tower (see my review) which I prefer over the Kalia but obviously more $$. Also, by booking w/ HGVC you don't pay the $30 daily resort fee like you do w/ Ali'i. However, at the time I made the booking it was Kalia @ $389/night or Ali'i @ $750+$30 resort fee/night. Back in December the Ali'i was only $450+30/night.I found the beach area closest to the lagoon to be better since it tends to be more rocky once you go past the dock. Beware that when renting equipment at the lagoon, you can only use them @ the lagoon. So if you are looking to go in the ocean be sure to rent from the vendors near the park @ Hale Koa.Food @ HHV was just okay, definitely not gourmet. Although it will be expensive wherever you go, you have more options elsewhere literally w/in walking distance. Do venture out!!!I would still definitely return to the HHV.","Los Angeles, California",92,4.0

It's great for families that like to keep dining costs lower by buying groceries and eating in the room. Proximity to the beach and pools are key. The valet is much improved over the last few years and getting in and out of the hotel is much easier than the snarling traffic through the main part of the Hilton Hawaiian Village, where stretch limos block roads for no good reason other than they're too long.The elevators are slow and often so crowded that you may have to wait for another car or two during peak times. The building used to be residential years ago so it doesn't have a service elevator. Housekeeping and other staff use the same elevators, and oftentimes I wonder if their frustration with waiting for an elevator exceeds the guests. But...whatever...you're on vacation. Take a chill pill and roll with it. It is a little annoying that some guests are unaware of the etiquette of queuing for a lift. Some guests make a beeline for any open door even when there is an obvious line in the lobby. Those who do that seem to be older, so I suspect it's a cultural thing that they expect to go first based on seniority. Lagoon Tower is the best solution for my family when we travel to Honolulu. When staying here, it's like having one foot in and one out of Waikiki. You don't have to deal with much of the Waikiki traffic, but you're still central. ",,13,4.0

This was my second time staying in the Lagoon Tower and once again, it did not disappoint. I shared the room with five of my friends, and there was enough room to fit us all comfortably. Since I had been there a few years before, I requested the same room. One of the managers for Hilton Grand Vacations, Keiko Warner-Egami, who I was in contact with before the trip was so helpful in accommodating my requests. I couldn't be more grateful for the wonderful service she provided. I was visiting for my sister's wedding, so most of my family members stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, and compared to the other rooms I saw at the Rainbow Tower and Diamond Head Tower, the Lagoon Tower is far better, in my opinion. Yes, it is pricey, but I think it is worth every penny. From my room we could see the Lagoon, Friday night fireworks, and amazing views of the ocean. The full size kitchen is one of the best parts as we were able to cook, bring food/snacks and store them in the pantry and the fridge. The conveniency of checking in at the Grand Waikikian and not dealing with the main lobby at the HHV is another plus. The only downside I can think of are the elevators. There are only three elevators, and since the hotel is crowded it can take a few minutes for one to be available. One of the days our elevator stopped on every floor on our way down. Other than that, I have no complaints. I can't wait to see the Lagoon Tower again when it is fully renovated. Thank you Hilton Grand Vacations for another amazing trip.

They decorated the dinning table with the same.. leis all over.. some broken apart and spelling HAPPY BDAY again. 3.

We have been to Oahu a few times over the years prior to owning with HGVC, and this was our first stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I know the Lagoon Tower is supposed to one of the hardest locations to book within HGVC, I jumped online at exactly 9 months out and got the room and view I wanted. However our plans changed and I was worried about losing the ocean front view, but luckily I was able to change the reservation and got the same room and view.We had room 1467, which is right on the end with an unobstructed view of the Lagoon and ocean. I know some others have complained about maintenance issues, and the dated décor with the Lagoon Tower. However we were pleased with the décor, while maybe not super modern, I would call it classic. The furniture was comfortable enough. The master bedroom was good sized, but the second bedroom was rather cramped with two twin beds. It was just two of us traveling, so the small second bedroom was not really an issue.Being in the middle of Honolulu, we ate most of our meals out. I did however cook breakfast every morning, and enjoyed that on the Lanai reading and watching the waves. The lanai was too sunny for afternoon drinks, at least for me. But it was a great spot for watching the Friday Night Fireworks. We had one maintenance issue, with a shower valve not working right. I called guest services in the morning, and it had been fixed by the time we got back mid-afternoon.The entire Hilton Hawaiian Village complex is centrally located, it’s an easy walk to thee entire Waikiki area and beaches, which is great as renting a car and parking would be hassle in this area. My only complaint about the resort, and Waikiki in general is the crowds. Pretty much everywhere you go there are people. It was often challenging to find a chaise at the pool. I can’t fault the resort for that, but now realize that personally we prefer the less crowded islands. I would consider staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village again if I return to Waikiki,","San Jose, California",8,4.0

We are elite owners with Hilton and always choose Hilton for a reason. We have paid dearly for our ownership and expect it to be the best of the best (which it usually is!) This is a VERY large complex and you are not something special like most of the other clubs make you feel. Sure, the rooms are fabulous, which we always love! I have a bad knee so getting around is a bit difficult with the very long walks to get to the beaches, shopping and just about anything you want to do. Please do not get me wrong, it is very nice here but it is not your typical elite feeling that Hilton always provides to us. We are but a fish in the large ocean. No upgrade at checkin, no owners lounge, you need to give a card at the pool to get a towel....just very different from what we are used to. Note: parking here is very expensive !

The village is made up of lots of different shops and restaurants which are just off the beach in Waikiki. All the hotels are either Grand Vacation Club resorts or Hilton hotels.

From the bellhops and lobby greeters to front desk, we had great customer service. The rooms are in desperate need of renovation, although a display in the lobby says this is coming in Sept. 2015. Wifi was better than in most hotels. We were able to stream Netflix and connect our laptops to the TVs. We paid up for a 2BR premium unit which put us right on the lagoon overlooking the ocean and harbor. Unfortunately, we were on a lower floor (#6) and the noise from the pool and the public lagoon/beach was really loud. It was definitely worse on the weekend, including well into the night on Sunday. I would not choose to stay on this property again on a weekend. The pool was SUPER crowded, there were not enough chairs to accommodate guests. The main village pool wasn't any better. The weekdays were better, although the landscaping activity to groom the lagoon area each morning disturbed the peace of sitting on the lanai. Overall, until the Lagoon Tower upgrades its furnishings (my husband referred to the furniture as ""goodwill"" quality, as it was scratched, dented, had huge water stains, and the lamps were falling apart, etc.), I would choose a different property. We're HGVC owners, and we would not choose to stay at this location again. We had Room L666 in case management wants to do an inventory check on that unit.In hindsight, while the ocean view was beautiful, we spent so few daylight hours in our room, that we would have been fine away from the hub bub and noise of the beach.","Longmont, Colorado",82,3.0

Hilton Hawaiian Village is massive, with many different buildings. The flavor is extremely international, as Honolulu - and particularly HGVC - seemingly serving as a gateway to the Far East (Japan and Korea). This was our second stay in the Kalia Tower, although well maintained, our 1BR Unit was a little smaller than expected, and only one bathroom was disappointing. You have to ask for things like luggage racks and enough pillows/hangers/towels/toiletries for a family of 4. Having free laundry machines on the floor worked well, although having it in the room as some units have would have been better. Kalia tower is far from the ocean and pool, although we had a nice ocean view. The small pool on the 4th floor is underwhelming. Valet was awesome during the day, but not in the evening, when they are understaffed. Valet was expensive $33, but a receptionist removed one day's fee when we had to wait 20+ minutes for our car one evening. We like to walk into Waikiki and the surrounding area - which is a big reason for staying in Waikiki. Kalia Tower was good for that, although the Village is at the outskirts of the Waikiki strip and you have to walk through/around a park which is somewhat inadvisable in the evening (per locals). Ocean is very calm and protected and it is easy to find a spot. No problem getting chairs at pools, but pools are nothing special. Didn't use lagoon (man made). Be forewarned that hotel restaurants are very very expensive. You are better off going off site. Hawaii is expensive, but the hotel pretty much adds 50% to 100%. Walk off property or - better yet - rent a car and enjoy Oahu's beaches, snorkeling and local food stops, especially the food trucks on the North Shore.","Short Hills, New Jersey",2,5.0

Rooms of this size are rare in Waikiki so getting a large place to stay in a first class resort was a real treat. The staff were pretty amazing and very responsive.

Lagoon tower has ""cozy"" studios and 1-2-3 bedroom suites and is part of the Hilton Grand Vacations club. I was able to get a last minute deal for a ""studio"" on the penthouse level (room L2462). We are HGVC club members and our home resort is in Las Vegas and have stayed at this resort several times. On this trip there was no availability using our HGVC points plus and there is a 3-night min. stay on membership points. So I booked this from the Hilton HHonors website and this room literally popped up on my screen as I was looking for hotels. The room was small, ""cozy"", but functional with awesome views from lanai...this room is probably the 3rd bedroom from the suite next door since there is was an access door in our room (I believe the penthouse floor bedroom suites are 2 levels...living and dining areas on 1st level and bedrooms on second level). The bed was comfortable and big enough to sleep my 21 yr old son and myself. It has a microwave and refrigerator. Upon check-in (Lagoon and Grand Waikikian have separate check-in desk...less crowded) we just changed and headed to beach and ate at the Blue Water Shrimp at the resort (this replaced the ramen noodles place). My son and I met back up in the room to watch the fireworks and just chill on the lanai and planned our next day to Hanauma Bay and North Shore. Look for my review with room pics on the Hyatt Regency Waikiki resort and spa ONLY here at TripAdvisor coming shortly. For people who have never stayed at this resort and have read other reviews, negative or positive, all I can say is Waikiki Beach is a world renowned tourist destination so expect that there will be a lot of people...old, young, kids, etc. This is not a trendy hotel, it's a resort that has everything and you really don't need to leave other than to explore more of Oahu or find more shopping.

Elevators were usually very fast (except during check out time), which is a nice change from most other places. Rather pricey for dining (especially with the 3 boys) but lots of selections and safe to roam about on their own. Concierge (Julie) was extremely helpful in planning our activities/events for the week. Front desk staff very promptly addressed a couple of small issues that we had and went above and beyond to provide us with complimentary use of another room after we had checked out to clean up in before our flight home (didn't leave for the airport until the evening). Value of 2 bedroom suite was good, considering we would have paid at least the same for 2 separate hotel rooms anywhere else to accommodate our family with 4 separate beds.

Overall we had a wonderful time. We were fortunate to request and get one of the corner 2 bedroom units. These have 2 lanais (balconies), one by the kitchen/dining table and the other in the living room. They give the room a much more open and outdoorsy feel. The only downside was that we were on the 4th floor and were subject to a lot of noise from the traffic between the tower and parking structure and from staff tearing down tables, chairs, and stages from the many special events held on the 'garden lawn'. The cacophony would continue sometimes to 2-3:00am. If you plan on doing any kind of real cooking in the room I suggest you go to Wal-Mart and purchase a knife or two and a fry pan. The knives in the room were a joke. I was trying to make stir-fry and could not dice an onion without using the serrated knives like a saw. I requested another knife from housekeeping and the one they brought was worse than the ones already in the room. The 2 small fry pans were only big enough to fry a couple of eggs or 3 slices of SPAM at a time. Can you imagine trying to fry bacon for 6 people in a 6 inch fry pan? The HHV staff has always been fantastic. They go out of their way to make every guest feel special. Kudos to the Bell staff. Many times we would stop to drop off passengers and/or groceries.

The worst feature of the room is that it had a sofa bed, which was totally unnecessary, as the room was too small for it. The sofa blocked access to the only window that had a semi-decent view, and it blocked access to half of the (small) closet. Also, maid service is provided only twice a week.

She did not ask us if we had a relative who might want to get married at the Chapel. She was polite but missed an opportunity to sell us on the Chapel.

It is separated from the main HHV lobby and connected to the Grand Waikikian with the check-in, luggage check and bellmen on the 2nd floor about 1/8th of a mile from the main lobby. If you take a cab or van shuttle make sure that they know the difference or you'll have a long walk with your luggage. Securing a 1 Bedroom Plus for 9 nights required booking 9 months in advance (as soon as you can if you don't own there), due to the popularity. As an owner of a week of Hilton's time-share, the best utilization of your points is to book the weekdays in the beginning and ends of your stay and the weekend in the middle, due to the amount of points required per day. The 1 bed+ is a suite with a full kitchen and, my understanding is, the earlier you book the higher you are placed on floors. I was located on the 23rd floor with only the penthouse suites one floor above me. I was on the Diamond Head side of the Lagoon Towers - good if you and/or your kids want to see the fireworks on Fridays from your balcony and have the sun from morning until mid-afternoon. Of course, there are so many other locations on the property to see the fireworks from that you may not see your room from morning until night. There are free washers and dryers on the floors and detergent in the units under the sink with the sponges, dishwasher and dishwashing liquids, etc. There are flat-screen TVs in each room and the living room has a PlayStation with 2 controllers and you get a free DVD rental card good for your entire stay. If you're on the Diamond Head side you'll hear music at night from either functions on the Great Lawn between buildings or from the band at the Tapas Room until 9:00 or 10:00 - can't be sure, I was out late most nights. In September 2015, the Lagoon Tower rooms will be undergoing major renovations as they have just modified the desks in the Lagoon lobby and are in the process of doing each of the 3 elevators, 2 were done when I left and the 3rd was almost complete.","Honolulu, Hawaii",66,5.0

I can't recommend or suggest anything on the thin walls .. but avoid staying beside suites with young kids like mine ... :-)The biggest complaint I have, which irks me dearly, are the sharing of elevators with cleaning and maintenance staff. There are only 3 elevators and we found ourselves having to wait because they were occupied by cleaning and maintenance carts.

As much as the Grand Waikikian was a pleasant surprise, the Lagoon Tower has been a big disappointment.No other way to describe this property other than old and tired. The carpet is worn, the vents have grime in them the furniture is worn etc. No elegant bath here. You get the feel from the moment you walk into the lobby that this building has seen it's better days. Even the elevators are old and beaten up.When we checked in we asked for a higher floor and were told that the ""class"" of suite we were going to get only existed on floors two through five. My first reaction was to think why would one bedroom suites only exist on four of the many floors of this building. I have now come to believe that the ""class"" (or lack thereof) was meant to define the quality of the suite .. as in second class.Someone mentioned that some of the suites have been renovated. If so, I feel very slighted in that it I have started to feel that the Hilton Grand Vacation Management chooses to treat it's prospective members much better than their existing ones. We have now stayed in six of the HGVC properties and the Lagoon Tower has been the worst by far. If you want beauty, comfort and relaxation, stay at the Grand Waikikian or on the big island (Hawaii) HGVC properties (Kahola Suites and Kings Land).

Speedishuttle would have been $29 + tip but probably slower.For early arrivals/check out they have a lounge and lockers to have a shower and leave small bags.We had a one bedroom apartment in the Lagoon tower and whilst quite spacious was pretty dark, old and drab. There are newer towers which are probably more updated. We stayed on a point exchange, otherwise definitely would not have paid money to stay in this room.Because it's such a large complex, service is pretty poor. We called concierge and got an answering machine. The return message left on the answering machine was 3hrs later.

We had 2 double beds in a studio, and the kitchen was pretty cramped. The beds were fine in the middle but sagged a lot on the edges. They clean the rooms once per week, but you can always ask for more towels/supplies. The rest of our family was in a 1 BR which was very nice, like an 800 sq ft apartment.

We have always loved the location and the rooms and looked forward to spending two weeks. This year we arrived in mid May and found everything to our liking in the room we had except for a sticking front door that didn't always close securely. This was mentioned to Maintenance, but the problem was not taken care of. In the middle of our second week, our room was burgled while we were on the lanai and some beach items were stolen. Either the door did not lock securely due to the sticking problem or someone used a card key to get in the room. Luckily our ID, money and jewelry were in the room safe. We immediately called Hilton security and they called the Honolulu police to investigate. A report was taken, but no suspects were identified and since there are no surveillance cameras in the hallways, elevators or stairwells there was no way to determine who may have burgled our room and there was little chance of solving the case. This invasion of our privacy so upset us that we cut our trip short by 4 days and returned home even though we love the Islands. I strongly recommend that the Management of the Lagoon Tower consider installing some security surveillance cameras to help ID burglers in the future because I am sure that there will be future burglaries. Although the Lagoon Tower is our home resort and we have always considered it the place that we want to stay when we go to Hawaii, we are now not sure if, or when, we will return. The burglary has destroyed a cherished remembrance of ours of Hawaii. I considered not writing this review, but decided to do it, because there is a security problem at the Lagoon and it needs to be addressed.","Seattle, Washington",10,3.0

Rooms: lagoon tower was spacious however grand waikikian was considerably smaller and lacked the views the lagoon tower had. Although the grand waikian is a newer building with in room laundry we prefered lagoon tower for room size, view, and location in the resort. Amenities: pool area with slide was extremely crowded with not enough lounge chairs for guests and the pool itself was small considering that this is the pool that most families would be attracted to. When on vacation I dont mind paying a premium price for poolside lunches however most of the food (pronto pickle) was premade and not good. We are Marriott Vacation Club Owners and DVC Owners and we find that their poolside food is expensive but very good so we don't mind paying the extra. Most resort activities were extremely overpriced and if you just walked down the beach other resorts / beach services could be had for a considerably cheaper price. We did alot of sightseeing on this trip so several days were spent away from the resort and the one positive was coming home to a well appointed condo type room.

Loved that we could call guest services and they would reply to any and all needs. But tipping the delivery person each time we found something missing got annoying. I understand not stocking every kitchen with a cookie sheet, but a spatula? Housekeeping left us with only the toilet paper on the holders and didn't restock dishwashing detergent or paper towels. And what hotel these days doesn't have an ice machine? (Unfortunately, the ice maker in the freezer uses the same distasteful, unfiltered water that comes out of the tap.)

We stayed on the 21st floor on the resort side and our room was CLEAN, spacious and the bed was VERY comfortable. The linens were quite nice too. Even being in a ""resort view"" room, when standing on the lanai, you can see the ocean and Diamond Head. At night, with the light sparkling, the city was beautiful and we could sit on the lanai and watch the sunrise in paradise!!After reading a few other reviews regarding stays at the HHV in Aug. 2014, I'm surprised by the comments regarding the following: *Japanese overrunning the resort - while there WERE many Asians, I did not find that they were ""overtaking"" the resort as Pam S stated. Of course, I was in paradise and didn't mind sharing the experience with everyone!*Overcrowding in restaurants, pools and elevators - we never had to wait for an elevator for long and only once was the elevator so full we waited for a second one. Of course, we were in the Kalia Tower and not the Lagoon Tower so maybe that made a difference. We totally LOVED our experience with the Kalia Tower. I believe it had been remodeled recently and the Lagoon Tower is due for its facelift next year...Tapa Tower is going through theirs currently, I think. I could be wrong. Our pool, on the 4th floor, was not crowded, there were PLENTY of lounge chairs, and it was very clean. We ate at the Tropics 3 different days at different times and NEVER had to wait for a table. We ate outside next to the beach each time.*Check-in being slow - we arrived after 9pm and there wasn't much of a wait at all. We used their valet service and our bags were brought to our room within minutes. Our tower had its own check-in/check-out but we didn't know that until we checked in through the main lobby.We all agreed that we'd stay there again on a future visit and it was WELL worth the price paid. Having all those pools, the lagoon, the ocean, all the restaurants and 90+ stores to shop, all on the resort grounds, made for an amazing vacation. Additionally, all the places that are within a short walk...we went for breakfast at IHOP, Eggs & Things (twice) and one other place close by that was featured in Hawaii Five-0. We ate at the Tropics Bar & Grill 3 different times...I'm obsessed with their Kalua Pork Nachos...OMG they were so good. So good that we are planning on making them Labor Day weekend...we bought some Alaea sea salt, hickory liquid smoke and banana leaves. They'll never taste as good as they did while in Hawaii though.Friday night fireworks were a great way to start the weekend!

Unless you are a Japanese tourist, stay away! This property which was once a great place to stay with a family, has completely been overtaken by Japanese tour groups. The lobby, elevators, restaurants, pools, were way overcrowded which was not helped by the fact that there was loud construction during our stay, including the main lobby. The furnishings, decor and overall room conditions in the Lagoon tower were completely substandard. After staying at Grand Hyatt in Kauai, the Lagoon Tower was like staying at a Motel 6. The pool area (Paradise Pool) was a complete joke - there were absolutely no chairs available and the pool had way too many people in it to even enjoy oneself. Waikiki overall seems dirtier than what I recall and homeless issue clearly has created an unsafe tone. Tropics Restaurant was only brightspot, while expensive, it was good and good service. Honestly, we could not wait to leave to go home!! Go to Kauai or Maui instead and don't even bother with Oahu.","Toledo, Ohio",6,1.0

It is an oasis at the best location in Waikiki. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is comprised of multiple hotel towers and vacation suite towers that share several pools and spas. My kids like the salt water lagoon where they are able to SUP, kayak, or just lay in the sand. The rentals are a bit on the pricey side, but so is everything else in Hawaii. The hotel suites are comfortable for a family of four. We like having the two bedroom unit with two full bathrooms, a living room, and kitchen. It gives us the option of eating in for some meals. When we don't feel like cooking, there are multiple snack bars and restaurants right on property. A big plus for this hotel is that it is located walking distance to other Waikiki attractions and shopping. The two main drawbacks for this hotel is that it gets very crowded especially during holiday weeks and that the Lagoon tower elevators can be a bit slow accommodating the large crowds. For our family, that's a small price to pay for staying at such a great vacation club and location.","Reno, Nevada",5,5.0

Our two-bedroom unit was nice clean and comfortable. I have no issues with the property itself. It is located on the beach and has a salt water lagoon which our kids enjoyed. The equipment rentals are pricy though.This part of the beach is not that nice. There are construction pebbles/ stones right on the water. The food is average, but you get a lots of variety. We ended up buying the groceries from ABC store which is located in the Village itself, and cooking our meals for some days.The check-in staff was not friendly but worked efficiently to check us in. The Concierge staff is however very PUSHY on getting you to attend their timeshare presentation. Their one and only aim is to get you to attend their presentation. They are not helpful at all for any other questions you might have.I also found the salt water lagoon very marshy and stinky. Expected it to be very clean, but it is not. There are other better located property on the beach, such as Surfrider, which you should consider seriously as it is located in the much nicer part of the beach. I had heard bad feedback about their Luau, so we did see that, instead went to a show in Maui which was much nicer. Luau here is very loud and is on top of the parking lot. You hear cacophony during Luau show, so I recommend leaving hotel property around that time and find something worthwhile to do outside.I may probably stay here again as we got to make use of our timeshare.","Woodstock, Maryland",25,3.0

As HGVC members we were able to use points to book a Premium 2-Bedroom Suite in the Lagoon Tower. This was our second stay. We had done this previously as well on a trip to the Big Island with a break in Honolulu on the way back. The check-in experience was decent and we were able to get to our room pretty quick.We were not disappointed. The unit was overlooking to lagoon and had full ocean front view with two balconies. We were on the 10th floor, and being just a few days after July 4th, had the front seat views of the Friday Fireworks in the evening. When we arrived we ate outdoors at the Tropics Bar with nice views of Waikiki Beach. Our kids are in their late teens and had plenty to do exploring the Hilton Hawaiian Village properties. My wife and daughter had spa treatments at the Mandara Spa, while my son and I rented an Ocean Kayak and got out into the Waikiki waters. It was all good. The Tropics bar is my new favorite.There are many pools to choose from, and quite a few restaurants. We had breakfast out on our balconies. Since I had a car I decided to go get Pizza for our Fireworks Friday night balcony viewing from Papa Johns that was about a mile away. Foodland is not too far either and became a place to pickup ready-made sandwiches for our hike up the Diamond Head Crater that we did the next day. My wife and daughter spent a few hours shopping in the retail area and my son got a small dancing hula girl dashboard ornament.We did the obligatory HGVC timeshare viewing. It was good and informative. We found out that certain less than popular time slots were being given $150 Hilton Hawaiian Dollars to be spent onsite. We took one of those and got refreshed on all there is to know about timeshares.We had dinner at the Bali Steak and Seafood Restaurant. While the food was good, the seating and table location etc. was less than ideal. the manager was not willing at all to consider re-seating us.

Very nice and at the end of the busy section of Waikiki. If you have not been to Waikiki, expect a lot of crowds. Similar to Vegas, but without casinos and with a beach. The unit was very beautifully decorated and very modern, with granite counter tops on kitchen and bathroom. Nice balcony overlooking the lagoon and the beach with a table and four chairs. Beautiful furniture all around. The area outside the hotel is very busy as this is part of a 5 unit complex owned by Hilton and there is always a lot of traffic of folks trying to register at all hours of the day. The only two areas of improvement are the parking with a staggering $27/day and the other item is that there are only 3 elevators to service 28 floors.

We are not dirty people but with the sand and traveling with two children, things get dirty. If you're not able to clean, provide a vacuum cleaner in the room. I think with all the money they made selling all those units they could afford to offer cleaning every other day at least.

The pools really aren't THAT BIG and when they're full to the brim with other people you aren't that keen. The lagoon looks great in photos, and it was nice, but it's cold and kinda smells a bit weird. The ocean on Waikiki beach is AMAZINGGGGGG! Once we spent some time in the ocean, we didn't go back in the pool or lagoon again. The ocean is warmer than the pools or lagoon, and renting long boards etc down on Waikiki beach is cheaper than at the Hilton.

But there are caveats. What other people have said is accurate. It's a family resort. So, it's noisy. To be expected. Didn't bother us. Pools are busy. Hard to get pool chairs and no one is ""policing"" whether towels left on a chaise for 6 hours with no one in sight can really be reserved ???? All day? By the end we played the game the same way, and I'm sure, annoyed others. We did not eat at a hilton restaurant all week. Bought food from Foodland grocery and cooked. Also bought wine off-property. Groceries are expensive in oahu! What I experienced was a VIP package as a trial for full ownership. We were travelling with another family and wanted to be together as we have kids that can be left alone for awhile (girls have taken babysitting course) but not all night! And trying to reach a person beforehand to inquire about room selection: impossible. I understand why this is....to a point. But you know, if I am a paying guest at hilton, I know exactly what I'm getting and can request in advance certain things about room location. Not so with being an owner and to me, this seems backward. For holidays I want certain things guaranteed including type of room. Here you are only guaranteed the type of room if you buy this specific location, which is the most expensive. If a hgvc owner otherwise, it's dicey as to what you might get. That's the system so as long as this is not stressful, this might be a program to consider. But not for us at those prices! Would want to know I had my ocean view etc. this was a big reason that we did not buy after experiencing things, as we really felt that we could not deal with the lack of certainty. Anyhow many pluses to this kind of program and I can see how certain people may find this option appealing. And the property is well maintained, and kind of keeps you in, with all that there is to do. Friday night weekly fire works awesome. We did not do the hilton Luau..... Didn't feel we needed to as you can easily hear it all over the property! Great stay overall.","Kingston, Canada",66,4.0

Upon arrival, we were misdirected where to check in by several staff. Once we found the Lagoon Tower our request for a King bed in our Studio room was not honored which I had confirmed the day before. Mari was very nice and offered us an upgrade to a one bedroom in the Kalia Tower two days later. Once we saw our studio room which was more like a closet with a mini fridge and micro, I was extremely disappointed. No balcony, no dresser just a tv stand with 3 drawers and a very small closet. The room barely had room to put our two suitcases against a wall with space to walk around them. Every studio I've booked has had sitting area with kitchenette. This was a subpar standard room, NOT a studio. Needless to say it was a long two days waiting for the one bedroom to become available which was a vast improvement over the"" studio"". They nickel and dime you for items that are normally free at most resorts. $32 a day to rent an umbrella, $15 for a beach chair, $8 delivery fee for room service on top of the gratuity. No housekeeping unless you book for 7 days but can request fresh towels. The property is huge with extensive dining and shopping options, and a variety of swimming pools. The lagoon is a nice plus. Nightly live entertainment at the Tapa Lounge was pretty good with room for dancing. Fireworks show on Friday evening was a nice touch. Central location with easy city bus and shuttle access. Overall I would not stay here again or recommend to friends. I prefer a more intimate resort. Stayed here to meet with friends from the DC area and because it was available through our Fiesta Americana Vacation Club exchange. Our friends had a two bedroom suite with soiled questionable stains on a lot of the upholstered furnishing. Could really use some maintenace and deep cleaning. Wood funishings were dinged, scratched and stained. Really well worn and overdue for an update. Not up to Hilton standards compared to other Hilton properties I've stayed at.. Our friends were disappointed as well. One bedroom had twin beds which is not what they requested and shared a wall with the master. So much for romance. They will not be returning either. They have a rooftop luau daily that can be seen and heard from some of the rooms in the Lagoon Tower which got irritating after a day. One morning about 8am they had a group out on the lawn below our room with bullhorns and microphones conducting a team building/motivational excercise that lasted several hours. I felt locating them in that area was very inconsiderate to guests trying to sleep in.","San Diego, California",13,3.0

The beach was large enough that I didn't feel as crowded as I did at the pools - the super pool is the worst. The one in our tower was never busy and we usually ended out day at that pool. The gym in our tower was never crowded either which was nice.Fireworks were great, the Luau was a good show but I agree with the others the food is truly awful, which is amusing since they rave about the chef - pretty expensive for just the show; but I am still glad I saw it.

It appears to be under new management and it is absolutely falling apart. They seem to be trying to make a buck by holding it out as a conference/party center while still treating it as a family resort. As any fool knows, those two things cannot go together. There were, literally, three parties in one week hosted right on the lawn, that lasted until ten pm, followed by loud clanking clean-up until the wee hours. Then various, incessant construction projects would begin at 8 am. Try that with your jet lagged children! Sound relaxing? Maintenance issues are atrocious: There are broken slides, gates and chairs at the pools, the grass on the lawn has been destroyed and patched in spots, the lagoon was half drained most of the time we were there, and even many of the plants and flowers are gone (as are the macaws and most penguins). Much of this is due to the new overcrowding, I assume, including the fact that sunbathing conference nerds now race down to put towels and magazines on chaise lounges at 8 am to save them for the day. They may not show up for hours, but they've saved all the seats for later. No class. Furthermore, every door latch in our rooms was broken, as were some appliances. Service has gone downhill just as badly. Before arriving I called the concierge to ask for help with future dinner reservations - she offered to look on Open Table for me, but said I could just do it myself as well. Concierges at better resorts have bookings. We arrived at nearly 1 am to find one man at the check-in counter for the entire vacations resort, with no bellmen and no valets. We took our own bags up rather than waiting... and after waiting twenty minutes for a valet to show up I finally told him I was going to my room. He told me I could not leave, I had to be there to take my half of the ticket or they'd have a hard time finding my car in the morning, and asked me to keep waiting for a valet for who knows how long. I offered him plenty of solutions - put the ticket stub in an envelope with my name and room number, have it sent to my room when the valet finally arrives, leave it with the resort manager or concierge - I didn't care. It's just a ticket. He kept saying no, so I left anyway. Lo and behold they had my ticket in the morning, no sweat. I was the wrong tier room and was told there was nothing they could do to fix it. They attempted to charge me parking for days we weren't even there, etc. It's hard to imagine how this could be less relaxing. Honestly, just stay away...","Boston, United States",12,1.0

I had read a lot of reviews before booking our vacation destination and have to say I was not disappointed we certainly enjoyed our stay here. There were a lot of people but it was not bad like people say, your in Waikiki and there is plenty of sand an ocean for everyone. 1. Stayed in one bedroom in Kalia tower, all towers are short walk to beach and lagoon, was very clean and had full kitchen, stove, microwave, fridge, dining table, our girls slept on pull out sofa bed, not very comfy but adequate for a 3 and 5 year old but you would not want to sleep on it if your an adult. We slept in the king bed in bedroom so nice to have separate sleeping areas with kids! If you have family recommend staying in one or 2 bedroom suites, 1 bedroom suite was perfect for us as we need 2 separate rooms for sleeping plus there is more space/privacy.TVs and blu ray players (PS3) are in both rooms, so we brought some of our own mobile to watch, the tv in bedroom is a little small but we didn't really use it. TV in lounge is bigger and the free DVDs in the foyer is awesome, latest releases, no charge and loads to choose from.Loads of drawer space and hangers on closet as well as a good size safe. The laundry is not in room but in same floor so is close and good to be able to wash and dry clothes there so we were able to bring less luggage. The Kalia tower has its own fitness center, pool and hot tub on 4th floor, I believe all the towers do, so this is great. It also has a day spa that we did not use on this trip.2. Staff extremely friendly, helpful and even got an early check in, our room was well cleaned every day (they even put the girls soft toys in the beds for them) we were really treated like royalty and loved the amazing staff there and the beautiful clean rooms.3. Ala moana mall is close and has great shopping with all the major brands represented (girls love the Disney store) recommend stocking up with food form food land there as resort prices for food are pricey but there are plenty of great places to eat and there are also abc convenience stores everywhere, we had breakfast in our room and then ate lunch in resort and had dinner in room so was a great balance of some nice resort eating as well as dining in our own room making full use of kitchen etc...Parking is pricey, like $30 a day, recommend valet as is only a bit more, self parking I think is $27 a day. Valet is great and worth every penny, your in Waikiki so parking is premium and you just have to expect that and factor it in.4. Beach was great, crowded but still plenty of room to relax on the sand, everyone complaining about beach chairs and umbrellas, just buy them at abc for a few bucks and leave there, much easier and cheaper, we did that for the pool inflatables as well as sand buckets the girls loved playing with all these, when you leave pass them on to another family. the lagoon was great as well, not quite as warm as the beach which was quite warm and the best place to swim for that reason.5. This brings us to the pools, they are cold, and this is the only reason I did not give 5 stars, my girls were shivering in Hawaii! Pool temp is low 70s for sure, for me this is bad, it was the same last few times we were here as well, this is definitely an issue for us as it means the pools and water slides are not a lot of fun and only option for swimming is the beach. My 5 year old braved the water slides for about 6 rides but was shivering and lips were turning blue, I literally had to hug her in line to keep her warm, this should not be the case, the water slides are a great feature but who wants to land in cold water and then stand in line shivering? My 3 year old landed in cold water and it shocked her so she never wanted to go back in, was a shame as she was tall enough for slides so was excited until she landed I the cold water.Overall I might stay here again, we did visit the Disney resort and the pools were beautiful and warm so it is certainly factor in our future decision making, but it did not spoil our time as the girls love the beach so much so although was a shame not to spend more time in the pools we all did have a great time. Thank you for wonderful memories and great staff!",,83,4.0

We have been to Hawaii/Oahu multiple times and this is one of our favorite properties due to the amenities, proximity to beach walk, proximity to Ala Moana Shopping Center, and beach.

Once you check in free orchid lei and macadamia nut lei for guys, but you have to ask the lady to lei you. She is not attentive as to who are checking in so you have to physically go infront of her and ask her for a lei. It's one of those Hawaii vacation that you really want to experience, to get lei'd. So they need to have some kind of communication from the desk to alert the lady, so each and everyone that checks in get a lei. For me that's very important because it is a symbol of ""welcome to Hawai'i"" and your vacation starts now feel. There were 2 adults and 2 kids so we opted for 1 bedroom with a King size bed for me and my husband and a pullout sofa bed for the kids which they love becuase they can watch tv as late as they wanted. The rooms in the Lagoon is more spacious than the Grand Waikikian. Eventhough the decor and appliances are newer and the washing machine is in the room at the Grand Waikikian my whole family would rather stay in The Lagoon (19th floor). When you down on the first floor, few more steps and you are already at the Lagoon, the beach and the swimming pool. At The Grand Waikikian eventhough you walk inside the building it is still a walk. The Village has restaurants, shopping area, ABC store (a very convienient store that has almost everything you need) and a rent a car place (National) which the cars are parked at the Hilton parking building. We rented a car and drove around the Island and stopped by at Walmart to buy food to cook which saved us a lot of money. Both rooms are equiped with everything you need, including a rice cooker, sponge and a dishwashing soap and laundry detergent. We would eat at the balcony and watch the beautiful sunrise and sunset when we were at The Lagoon. The City View is not that appealing at all, so spend a little more for an ocean view. My kids love the gated pool with the slides and at night the pool is heated which is awesome. I don't suggest going to the main pool which is not gated, eventhough it is bigger it is crowded and I smell pee everywhere becuase that's where all the ""hotel guests"" are staying and anybody who wants to use the pool. They give you an orange card to exchange for beach towel. The only bad part is that they did not explain to us that when you are done with the beach towel to exchange it to get your card back for a new towel the next time you go back in the pool, and to return those orange card when you check out. Upon check in you also get a card to rent free movies (great selection) which is great at night.The check out time is 10am and check in is at 4pm, they have a family lounge at the 8th floor to wait for your room until it is available. When it was time for us to change building I thought we had to wait for our room but surprisingly they were already ready and we did not have to wait at all which is great.At night if we open our balcony we can watch the Luau from the top of the Hilton parking lot. The only bad part is I hated the pillow and the bed for some reason everytime I wake up my back hurts. The blanket at The Lagoon is so thick, its nice the first hour but when I woke up I was sweating. My husband and my kids did not have a problem so I ended up sleeping on the pullout sofa bed. Overall so much fun but if we go back we will definitely pick The Lagoon with Ocean View.","San Diego, California",15,4.0

Mostly a very good impression.On the 2nd morning, we had been attacked by an infestation of termites. They were literally crawling all over the guest bathroom - in the sink, the tub, over the light fixtures and the counter. They were crawling their nasty little bodies into our travel kits as they hoped for a journey back to the mainland. All together distasteful.Upon complaint, management came in and sprayed poison (while we were in occupancy!) into the bathroom. This helped for approximately 30 minutes, and then the insects reappeared. On further complaint, hotel management agreed to move us.The second unit, 2365, had no such infestation. Unfortunately, it had a totally outdated air conditioning system (the same as the first unit) that had to run constantly in order to cool down the bedrooms (while the main room was freezing cold). The thermostats are old and outdated and could not be regulated to shut the A/C off and on even if a proper temperature was reached. To maintain coolness, you had to run the A/C and fan 24/7.To add to this, we noted huge amounts of mold visible in the vents. One person in our party (me) became physically sick day in and day out.

In a higher-end resort like Breckenridge, I rent boots, skis and poles for my son for all day at about the same price as one hour on a paddle board. Although the room in the Lagoon Tower was spacious and adequately equipped and clean, it is years overdue for a renovation. The WiFi connection was slow at best and absent too often.

I also question the total number of people in the pool. To me the occupant load seemed neither safe nor sanitary. The rules against throwing down a towel or a pair of flip flops to reserve a chaise lounge were blatantly ignored at every pool I saw except for the one adjoining the spa. Above and beyond the rules problem, there is an absolute shortage of pools and/or pool deck space to accommodate the number of guests.

We stayed in a 1 br two full size beds on the 17th floor. Had a great time with no major glitches whatsoever. Since we live on Oahu, we brought food for breakfast and snacks. The small kitchen had everything we needed. Even a rice cooker. The only issue was the dishwasher; it was extremely noisy. Ate lunch and dinner both on and off site. Expect resort prices. Check in and check out was a breeze. Hung out pool side at the main pool, which was very crowded. The pool on the fourth floor of Kalia Tower was lightly used and nice for privacy. It seems that HHV has a new towel policy. Instead of wrist bands like before, they give you ""towel cards"" when you check in. Turn them in at the towel kiosk, collect your towel, return the towel, get a towel card back. Full size beds were very comfortable, with four pillows each. Be advised that the only bed covering you get is a large comforter, that's stuffed into a giant sized pillow case. A bit awkward at first but it worked. 17th floor mountain view was lovely, we had lanai's in both the living room and bedroom. Two flat screen TV's with DVD players. You could rent DVD's. Best entertainment was Jerry Santos and Olomana at the Tapas Bar, drinks a bit pricey but the music was excellent. We had a great time. ","Oahu, Hawaii",141,4.0

We rented a car for a day as all our other activities had transportation included - which I would definitely recommend taking advantage of that. Each bus driver also acted as a tour guide and provided alot of information about the island. We rented a car and drove to the other side of the island one day and enjoyed the beaches, scenery and Dole Planation. We also hiked Diamond Head, took a helicpoter ride around the island, toured Pearl Harbor and went to the Polynesian Cultural Center. All activities were awesome!

The real problem was the carpet and the dated AC system. The carpet needed to be cleaned big time. The AC is older and can only be turned on or off. You can't set it to a specific temperature, you can only move the lever warmer or colder. It doesn't click off when it reaches a specific temperature; it continually runs. For the bedroom to get cool, the living room is freezing. There is no exhaust van in the bathrooms and no ceiling fans in the unit.The 3 elevators are slow because they shared by housekeeping and maintenance. They have no service elevators. I am a Hilton Diamond member and stay in a hotel approximately 80+ nights per year. In terms of AC and carpet cleanliness, this was one of the worst I've stayed at in years. Hampton Inns are much nicer.That said, this is my third visit to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The first two times we stayed at The Grand Waikikian and The Rainbow Tower, and these visits were a positive experience. I would recommend either of these. The grounds at the entire complex are well kept and beautiful. The employees are polite but not friendly.

We were given a studio on the 19th Floor, which is very dated but clean, and that is important! It is literally right next to the elevators so the noise level can get pretty bad at times. The view is okay but because we wanted a king bed instead of two doubles, we look at the harbor instead of the lagoon/ocean.The bigger problem is the management of this property. We've been here since Saturday and had to request a light bulb be put in the bedside lamp 4 times before it finally was accomplished! They kept saying they would bring it right up, only to not follow through until my husband finally went down and made enough noise that a manager got involved and once he was made aware of the situation, even he agreed that we were right to expect better service than this. Hubby likes to read and all we asked for was one light bulb. 3 days to get one is unacceptable. We were also quite surprised to learn there are no ice machines in this building so if you want ice, you literally have to call housekeeping for it and guess what? They are the same folks who could not scare up a light bulb. So disappointing. In this day and age, no ice on each floor or at least every 5th floor or so?We realize renovations have been taking place for awhile but do not understand why no one seems to be checking on the state of the rooms before they get assigned. There are only 2 of us but we still think at least 2 towels each would be good. Instead, we each get one towel. We'd like to ask for more but when we call housekeeping, the phone rings endlessly. I just noticed that the tv remote has dead batteries but do not feel it is worth having to get a manager involved just to get them.Also, we valet parked the first day and the next morning, it seemed there was only one valet for the entire property and it took forever to get our car. And for this we pay $33. Seems wrong to us. So wrong.HGVC is definitely not staying on top of things here and it is disappointing to fly all this way and be made to feel like our business/ownership doesn't matter. It seems obvious that they are catering more to ""prospective"" buyers, which puts a damper on the whole ""vacation club"" feel. Instead it is more like we are simply stuck up here and forgotten and the staff simply wishes we'd leave them alone. As owners, we expected much more from the Hilton family and nobody should have to work so hard at having a vacation here. We are left with the impression that now that we have purchased, they no longer need to impress us. That is just inexcusable. When we were prospective buyers ourselves, we were treated much better than this.We are not demanding people. We simply would like the same treatment that others are gushing about on here. When you can't get a simple request accomplished without having to practically beg for what should have been taken care of before we ever arrived, it does not make for a ""grand""vacation. No one's vacation should be filled with having to worry that each little thing you might need will become a big. Housekeeping staff here seems to operate on their own and if they are in the mood to be helpful, you are lucky. What a shame. We will not be returning.","Baltimore, Maryland",112,2.0

I know I had some questions prior to going. This might be a long review. Originally I had booked my husband and I for 7 nights at the Lagoon tower in a studio using HGVC club points because that was all that was available. A few weeks prior to departure I was able to change to 5 nights in a 1 bedroom in the Kalia Tower Ocean view and the remaining 2 nights in the Lagoon tower studio due to vacancies coming open. The airfare I found at a good price had us arriving after 10:00PM, so I decided to fly in the day before our timeshare was to start and booked 1 night at the Hilton adjoining hotel for 50,000 points. We are Hilton Honors Diamond members and were able to get a free upgrade to Ocean View in the Rainbow Tower. Wow, what a score. I apologize that I did not take any photos. We were very tired when we arrived, but I can say the room was recently updated with very nice new furnishings a huge flat screen TV. I know, we are in Hawaii, why worry about that, but we do enjoy a nice TV, while in the room. We were able to get a 4:00PM check out, so we had the room until our timeshare was ready. This was nice to relax in after being out our first day, we were adjusted from Central Daylight Time.On Saturday, we checked into the Kalia 1 bedroom, I posted photos. It is wonderful as it faces straight out towards the ocean. You are further back in the resort and if you look straight down you see the roof of a large building, but just look beyond it to the sea and smile. It is a little noisy on the balcony due to the traffic from Ala Moana street during busy times of the day. There are 2 balconies, 1 off the living room and one off the bedroom. The bathroom is very large and has access from both the living room and the bedroom, which is extremely convenient if someone is using the sleeper sofa. We did not have guests with us, but it is great knowledge for the future. There was plenty of storage in the bedroom as well as in the living room for guests clothes, etc.We bought milk, coffee, eggs, wine and sourdough bread at the ABC store. They had a larger selection at the ABC by the Grand Waikikian Tower. I brought packaged ready to eat bacon from home, coffee filters, Crystal Light (both Pitcher and individual sizes) Microwave popcorn. These little things helped save some money on eating out. We did usually have leftovers from eating out and it was nice to have the facilities for warming and eating our leftovers.Our last 2 nights were at the Lagoon Tower Studio. Sorry I didn’t get photos, we checked in after Happy Hour and just need to crash a bit. It is spacious for a couple. The room we ended up receiving had 2 double beds, would have preferred a king, but it had a great view of Diamond Head, the Resort, Lagoon and Ocean. The furnishings are all new with a huge dresser with lots of drawer space, a huge flat screen TV, Large closet. There is a small table and chairs, a full size coffee maker (we are big coffee drinkers, so appreciate the large coffee maker instead of the normal small ones). There is a mini fridge, a large microwave and dishes and cutlery for 2. Our room 2162, was a lock off to a 1 bedroom and across from the elevators, but we never heard anything.To finalize everything, we loved the extra space in the Kalia 1 bedroom, so if one of the guests woke up early they could go in the living room and not wake the other . but to stay a few extra nights in Hawaii, the studio was good too. We love the Hilton Hawaiian village location. Both the beach and lagoon had plenty of space and great views. In 15 minutes walking you can be at the Ala Moana shopping center. In fifteen minutes the other direction, you pass through a very nice park at Ft De Russy on the way to Shorebird for $3.50 Mai Tais during Happy Hour and dinner at Dukes. A great trip can’t wait to come back.","Melbourne, Florida",16,5.0

They call it the Vacation Introductory Program, or VIP. Birth of granddaughter in late 2012 put April 15-22, 2013 as ideal timing. We would not have purchased it if deadline to use was 12 months or less. They put us in the 10th Floor, on the south end of the building, facing the ocean, for spectacular views!One friend accompanied my wife and I, so two bedroom, two full bath suite was ideal. Spacious living room, dining room, kitchen with pantry closet, and two lanais(balconies). We used the lanai with table and four chairs almost daily.This unit, probably rated for 800 sq ft or more, an end unit facing the ocean, was so nice, so comfortable! We had a great time and we really liked the unit!The Lagoon Tower was constructed in 2000, so it is between brand new and old. Other hotels in the Hawaiian Village, Hilton's largest complex worldwide, vary in age, up to the rather new Grand Wakaiian. The Lagoon Tower replaced kitchen appliances on one floor during our week. If this is part of program it will keep the hotel fresh, but we saw appliances removed were like ours and ours were in quite nice condition. I travel on business, and as much as I would like for the maintenance staff to check all working devices - lamps, faucets, other - reality is that hotel guests must check them and report deficiencies. The Lagoon Tower maintenance crew gets a 100% rating in promptness and effectiveness in dealing with light bulbs and a slow draining tub. (Another rater reported a dim bathroom; management would be well served to coach guests about reporting small and large deficiencies that result in internet-posted complaints solvable with a $1.00 bulb).I missed the instructions for lining up lanai doors with sensors at night, to enable the A/C to run. Maintenance explained it, the A/C was not broken. Lagoon Tower management may deal with this repeatedly; they would be well served to provide creative graphical instructions, maybe on a magnet on the fridge so everyone would see it.Some complaints by others seem out of place. Being bothered by housekeeping is just a clue the guests stayed in the room most of their housekeeping day(s). A distance to reach various features of the Village? The Village lies within an urban setting no doubt, and you need to be prepared to walk on paved surfaces to have an enjoyable visit. The International Market is a one mile walk, as is the Top of Waikiki restaurant. Walks to the ABC store on-site, the fitness center in the Ali'i Tower, and other on-site facilities are short in comparison. We did not want to split all of our vacation between the beach and stores, restaurants, and the Intl Market. We wanted to get away from the Lagoon Tower on most of our seven days. A comfy Dodge Charger from Dollar at $240 for a week ballooned to $337 with fees and taxes, but it allowed us to come and go as we pleased. Use the self-service parking in the garage and pay the high price of $27 per day. The garage is adjacent and really close to the Lagoon Tower, as in 150 steps from the elevator doors, and you can walk to it without getting wet during rainstorms. Passengers and belongings can be unloaded even closer to the elevators, then you can pull into in the garage to park.On our first morning we drove to Foodland grocery store, the first challenge for the iphone (or GPS), but well under 10 miles and feasible outside of rush hour. ABC Stores, open to 12:30 am, are a second choice. We bought breakfast and snack food, which made for a few pleasant breakfasts on the lanai. The kitchen was well equipped. Wailana Coffee House, one block away, also was excellent, but go before 730 am to beat crowds. Breakfast for three ranged from $19 to $25, reasonable in an otherwise high priced town.It helps to be comfortable driving and maneuvering about a city environment, but if you are, the Lagoon Tower is a great base to use to drive and see on your own schedule the Iolani Palace and nearby old churches, the WWII Memorial with the USS Arizona, the North Shore and Waimea Vally Park, the Flea Market, and several other attractions. The fitness center is not large enough to accommodate all interested guests in the morning, We hope management turns their attention to this, one additional fitness center is in order. But this is Hawaii, so when the treadmills were tied up at sunup, a long brisk walk on the beach, in nearly perfect air temperature, was a memorable alternative. Beautiful beach and water are adjacent to the hotel, for a break from driving and walking or hiking day trips. Rock jetties and south facing of Waikiki Beach mean waves are non-existent, so forget about using the whitewater surf (Boogie) boards. Go to the North Shore if you have to surf. Buy a tube from the ABC Store for $4.00, blow it up, slather on sunblock lotion as the sun is rather intense, bring some cash so you can buy ice cream at the DQ in the Rainbow Tower for lunch (75 ft from our beach towel), and enjoy. We will return.","Clifton, United States",22,5.0

I stayed at the Lagoon Tower for two weeks and was utterly disappointed and exhausted by the time I got home from vacation. There is a piece of land between the Lagoon Tower and the Rainbow Tower that was and is used daily for buffets, luaus, corporate parties, and private parties. The set up for these events begins at 4:30 a.m. when the staff is putting up tables, chairs, dishes, and meal buffet tables without consideration of the hotel guests just above them trying to sleep in their rooms. The staff talks, laughs, and works moving carts across the sidewalks to the grassy areas making a great deal of noise until the customers arrive around 7:00 a.m. The noise of these customers is additionally loud enough to awaken everyone in both Towers. The evening events set up begins around 4:00 p.m. and customers usually arrive around 6:30-7:30 p.m. The noise from the evening festivities lasts usually until 9:30 p.m. but one night it continued on until 10:30 p.m.If there is any kind of music during the evening events it is usually turned up so loudly that I could not hear the television in my room with the lanai door and windows closed! And the night the music continued until 10:30 p.m. was so loud that it shook my windows and lanai door! Had I known I would be enduring this kind of noise daily I would not have stayed at this hotel!There was a corporate private party for 3 or 4 days during my visit so there were daily morning buffets, nightly dinners, and one day in which the entire lagoon was closed down to all hotel guests so the corporate private party could use it for a “team building exercise”.The hotel itself is lovely; nicely appointed rooms, spacious lanais, beautiful landscapes surrounding the facilities, large enough rooms, comfortable furniture, and the condo-type rooms with kitchens are spacious and have full-sized appliances. The lighting particularly in the bathroom was very dim and there was no fan to exhaust the steam after showering. For those staying in the timeshare or condo facilities there are laundry appliances down the hall and they are free which is a nice bonus. The lagoon is an excellent place to swim, paddle board, snorkel (yes there are small fish in that lagoon!), and to lay out in the sun by--it's a great place especially for families with children since there aren't any waves and it is spacious enough for everyone. There are really nice places to swim—the “super pool” where they have three different slides (usually extremely crowded), a larger pool by the Rainbow Tower that was very nice, a smaller pool by the Tapa Tower, and the lagoon between the Rainbow and Lagoon Towers. If you're staying in the condo-type portion of the Lagoon Tower housekeeping is done only once a week. They will make your beds but not change the sheets and it appeared they never vacuumed.I stayed on the 6th floor facing the Rainbow Tower, the lagoon, and the ocean. The views were absolutely exceptional and if it weren't for the noise I would have absolutely LOVED this room!My impression was that the Hilton Hawaiian Village values the additional money received from the private parties more than they value providing rest, relaxation, comfort, and good customer service to their hotel guests! There was never any mention of compensation or appreciation for what the guests had to endure during these daily early morning wake ups or later evening disturbances of exceptional noise from the hotel management.One day when I inquired from the concierge what the price of the breakfast buffet and luau was for hotel guests I was told that those activities were just for private parties and that the hotel guests were not invited. I think (or hope!) the concierge was only addressing activities for that particular day as opposed to every activity done in that space daily! While I enjoy parties, good music, eating and drinking with friends I did not enjoy the early mornings and late evenings filled with tremendous noise when I was on a vacation. I would definitely NOT recommend a stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village if you’re looking for rest, relaxation, and comfort because that’s exactly what you will not get!","Bremerton, Washington",49,2.0

We were there from April 9 - 19th. We didn't know it was the end of the rainy season, but had two days where it rained all day. That didn't stop us from having a great vacation. I've been to the HHV several times, however this will be our last. The cost of flying is prohibitive. We used airline miles to fly and I no longer have enough points to do this again. I always enjoy HHV. This was our first stay in the Lagoon Tower. We stayed in a Studio for three of the days we were here and then moved over to the Grand Waikikian. We were on the 20th floor facing Diamond Head. The view was very nice but this particular room doesn't have a balcony. The room was pretty small. There is a sink, and microwave and a few dishes, but no stove or dishwasher. The room had two double beds which seemed small since we have a queen bed at home. The room is advertised for two people and that's probably all you would want to have. We hadn't made any specific requests and were surprised to have a room so high. However, we didn't spend a lot of time waiting for an elevator either. Since we were in a Studio, we knew this was actually a second or third bedroom of a two or three bedroom suite. That being the case, we did hear voices and sounds from the kitchen of the next room. However the folks didn't keep us awake and the level of sound wasn't that bad. We could hear voices but not understand what they were saying. Also, after we turned the lights out we could see light under the door to the next room if someone was there. The main drawback was the bathroom. There is only one sink which isn't surprising for a Studio, but the lighting was inadequate. Nothing fancy about the bathroom. But then again, you don't usually spend a lot of time there either. However my wife had a hard time fixing her hair since the lighting wasn't very bright. From the time we could make a reservation we tried to find a Studio at the Kailia Tower since I was told those Studio rooms were larger. However none ever opened up. Once at HHV we found out that there are very few Studio rooms in the Kalia Tower. If we had to stay at the Lagoon Tower in a Studio for our entire stay, we wouldn't have been very happy, but this was only for us to acclimate ourselves to the time change and then move over to the Grand Waikikian. I'll make a separate review of that part of the stay under that accommodation.Just a couple of points outside of the Kalia Tower review. Parking is very expensive for overnight parking. It's $27 a night. Also, you will find that the Hertz desk is only open from 6am to 1pm. But we also found that you can drop your key off on the 5th floor of the parking garage anytime and not be charged for an overnight parking stay if you only want to keep the car for 24 hours. In other words, when you are finished with the car, turn in your key at the drop box along with your parking stub and you shouldn't be charged for that day. When we wanted to keep the car for more than one day, we went to the front desk and informed them that we would be keeping a car overnight. They will give you a pass card for the parking garage. The pass card allows in and out privileges for the time you have the car in the parking garage. When you have turned in the car, return the card to the front desk so that they will not charge you any more nights. If you only keep the car for a day, you won't need the pass card. Just turn in your key to the drop box when you are done. Parking without the pass card is like $8 per hour. So you want to avoid keeping the car in the garage for very long. Something that might help is that there is parking at the Marina next to the property. Lot ""A"" will cost $6 per hour. However, a little know secret that is mainly known by the locals is on that same marina is parking at no cost. However, the sign says it's for people going to the beach and so forth. If you are only going to be there for a short period, it might be possible to find a parking space in that area if all you need is an hour or so. However, that parking is only open until 10pm in the evening. And it's very popular so it might be hard to find a parking space.

Our oceanview suite was immaculate and had all the comforts of home included unlimited internet access and a laundry facility a few doors down the hall. It was quite a bit of a walk to get to the lagoon pool, but we enjoyed the hotel grounds - penguins, koi, different shops. Although our children enjoyed the lagoon pool with all the slides, it was nice to bask near a quiet, uncrowded pool on the 4th floor of our tower.Honestly the only complaint I have is the coffee provided in our kitchen. It was not very tasty. The Starbucks in the lobby had to take care of my coffee fix - and it did not come cheap!The food is quite pricey if you're visiting from out of state, but we chose to cook our meals in our kitchen out of convenience anyway.

We wanted a condo, but also wanted to be close to the beach and this proved to be the best option-we were not disappointed. We are not ""timeshare"" owners so we booked as hotel guest through the Hilton Grand Vacations website (note this is different than regular HHV hotel website-I think I linked to it from the Tripadvisor site). We checked in at the lobby of the Grand Waikikian and everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, I requested and was given a bit of a later checkout. Our room was on the 11th floor on the Diamond Head side of the hotel and our ocean view from the lanai was fabulous, we sat out there every morning for coffee and ate several meals there. The 11th floor is not high enough to see down the beach and Diamond Head because of the Ali tower, but what you can see is fabulous. The unit was spacious and clean and the kitchen had everything we needed for our stay. The 2 kids had plenty of room on the sofa sleeper and our bedroom with the king was large. Housekeeping came everyday since we were ""hotel"" guest and not owners and did a fabulous job, even loading and running the dishwasher. It never felt crowded in the Lagoon Tower and the elevators were fast. You don't pay resort fees when you stay in the vacation suites but get all the same amenities, like free wifi, DVDS/games etc., but you still have to pay to park. We were very happy with our room and would stay again, I would probably go for a 2brm unit next time just for the extra beds, but a 1bdrm would work fine if you have kids that will sleep together on the sofabed.The resort itself is beautiful and every employee we encountered was friendly. Is it busy? Yes, but it's a large resort with lots of rooms, so it's what I expected. Was it overcrowded? No, Waikiki is a busy place and all the hotels and resorts are the same, as are the streets and sidewalks and restaurants. We had no trouble finding a spot on the sand or chairs by the pools. If people are not your thing, than I suggest maybe you consider one of the the other islands, or resorts on the other side of Oahu. As others have said, the HHV is pretty self-contained with shops and restaurants, so you really don't have to leave the property if you don't want to. I can't imagine not exploring the rest of Waikiki and Oahu and its great shopping and dining, but if you want to arrive at HHV and just hang-out you can. It's it nice short stroll up the beach to the heart of Waikiki and all she has to offer, but the HHV location lets you avoid the traffic noise and hustle and bustle that goes with that location while still being perfectly close.Check-out was quick and smooth and we were given lounge access to use between check-out time and when we left for the airport. My family really loved their first visit to Hawaii and HHV, I have been to Honolulu several times and have stayed at other locations. Based on that, I highly recommend the Lagoon Tower at HHV and would happily stay there again. Our stay could not have gone better.","Germantown, TN",43,4.0

We wanted a blender (yes, the ice and blender where used together) and that was brought as well. The rooms were nice and clean. We stayed in a studio, and had a view of the fireworks from our room on Friday night on the beach.Here's the issue...the noise level from the bar and luau below the towers will echo. When I say echo, I mean it was completely annoying and impossible to relax in your room at night with all the racket. We hit it hard all day and want to relax at night! We asked to be moved (sold out), but they were able to accommodate us the last couple of nights. What a difference! On the other side of the lagoon tower (garden side) no echo! Not quite the view (see the harbor, which is not that bad), but you can have a quiet evening. We brought a collapsible cooler and picked up fruit and sandwiches to take with us for lunch. We hit a Starbucks for breakfast. That really reduced the cost of eating. Since we had a studio, we couldn't cook like we would in a one bedroom.So, if you are thinking of staying at the HGVC in the lagoon tower, get a one bedroom and request the garden view side. We were in a studio and you get a room where they can fit you in. You have a much better chance of being on the other side (quieter) when requesting a one bedroom. I would have a limited view over peace and quiet. You can then go to a Costco (outside of Honolulu...the one in Honolulu is the busiest in the USA), and get food to take back for dinner.

(Please note, if you're considering staying here you probably want to also read reviews for the Hilton Grand Waikikian Suites and the Hilton Hawaiian Village Hotel since all of these are part of the same large resort complex (Hilton Hawaiian Village) and share restaurants, bars, and other amenities.) If not for the good package deal we likely would have selected another hotel, because big resorts like this tend to cater to families rather than couples looking for quiet time, and because we tend to spend more time out sightseeing than hanging around a resort using its amenities. With that in mind, our stay turned out nicer than I expected.Checking into Lagoon Tower was a bit of a hassle. Although HHV told us several times that Speedie Shuttle would drop us directly at the Lagoon Tower, Speedie Shuttle told us several times that they only pick up and drop off at the Grand Waikikian main lobby area a block away. Hotel and Speedie Shuttle need to communicate better on this, especially since check-in for Lagoon is at its own desk inside Lagoon Tower and not at the Grand main lobby area. We ended up having to schlep our bags a block from main lobby to Lagoon lobby and then schlep them up a very long ramp to another floor where the Lagoon check-in was (we couldn't find it on arrival since we weren't dropped at the Lagoon entryway by the shuttle), then back down the ramp to elevators to our room. Very confusing and tiring. (Note that the Tapas Tower bus area is on the opposite side of the large complex to the Lagoon Tower, so if you have luggage I do not recommend using any airport service that drops you there.) Our Lagoon Tower ""ocean view"" room was on the 10th floor overlooking a side street (Kahanamoku Dr.), but had a large balcony from which one could see ocean and mountains as well as a large local marina. No traffic noise as there isn't much traffic on that street, but we did get noise from (a) screaming kids all day at Paradise Pool which was almost directly under our bedroom (went away by about 7 pm when pool closed), (b) loud drumming, singing and announcements from the Hilton luau on top of one of the adjoining buildings in the evening (this was kind of atmospheric and went away by about 9 pm). We noted our room had a door that could be opened onto the next room, which usually means you can hear the person staying next door also, but the soundproofing seemed pretty good as we only heard them once the whole week. We had a living room with big balcony, full size kitchen with coffee maker and many cooking amenities, separate bedroom with very comfy king size bed, good size bathroom and two big closets - about the size of a one bedroom apartment. Lagoon Tower is an older building but is being renovated floor by floor and our room had reasonably new furniture, carpet and fixtures. Bathtub looked a little old but hand-held shower attachment worked great (high pressure) and considering that the tub probably sees tons of beach sand, I could understand its not being fancy. Biggest complaint was bathroom not having a window or a fan, just a passive ceiling vent which was not enough to remove odors, and also there was a musty old smell coming from either the bathroom sink plumbing or the drain all week. Hotel staff were all very nice and polite. As with most Hilton timeshares you only get housekeeping once all week, which I prefer because it cuts down on hall noise and people coming in your room, but the staff was very quick to bring towels or whatever else we needed in between. I was impressed that when our Wi-Fi modem connection quit, there was a dedicated help center to call and they sent a tech to our room to fix the problem. We rely on the Internet not only to stay in touch with work but also for booking the tours and activities we wanted to do (there's concierges to help if you want, but we like to choose our own) so a good connection was really important to us. There is a free penguin pool exhibit with a talk each morning by the keeper, which was cute and fun (we got to pet a penguin). We also tried out the HHV beach, Paradise Pool, Tropics bar/ restaurant and Bali Steak and Seafood restaurant. Beach - very clean, lots of room, and close to tower; daily fees for renting chairs and umbrella were steep (we flew so couldn't bring our own) but we only spent one day on the beach. No alcohol allowed on beach, but if you are discreet with your takeaway cup, no one is really policing it either. Paradise Pool - lots of kids, less than 5 feet deep, but still fun except that the water slide closes 2 hours before pool does and then you have kids jumping the gate to use it unattended while others try to crawl up it from pool end - a real safety hazard. We thought food and service were both good at the restaurants, although they were expensive and have a slower service pace than on the mainland. We did notice that Tropics, which doesn't take reservations, seems to have more customers than it can handle at dinner hours, and that Bali often seemed to be closed or only operating a limited number of tables (often not the beach view ones unfortunately). Lepperts coffee and Round Table Pizza are both very close to Lagoon tower and very good. The blocks surrounding the HHV complex are almost all large hotels, interspersed with a few ABC convenience stores, cheap diners and souvenir shops. So there's not much to walk around and see once you get ""off-campus"". The resort clearly would prefer you use the pricey shops and restaurants inside the resort. If you do not have a car and want to go out for kitchen groceries or other shopping, you need to walk a long way, or take the city bus (thebus dot org) or a ""shopping trolley"", either to the Ala Moana Mall (has a Foodland) or the other direction down Kalaukua (has Food Pantry and more convenience stores). The closest bus/ trolley stops to Lagoon Tower are the ones at Ala Moana/Opp. Kalia, and Ala Moana/ Hobron. Overall a nice time, but a bit crowded like Disney World. We understand Hilton is opening a new ""urban timeshare"" (Hokulani Hilton) with smaller, more modern suites located closer to the shops and restaurants in Waikiki, and that would probably be more our speed than this large family-oriented resort.","Baltimore, MD",90,4.0

The staff is excellent and the property is well maintained with a vibrant location in Waikiki. Now for the bad news : HGVC is a waste of your money ...don't bother ...our location in the Lagoon Tower is in the back of the Tower on a low floor overlooking the Illikai Parking lot and screeching kids in the Lagoon Pool. The beds are dreadful , I guess the sweet sleeper beds are reserved for Hotel Guests only at Hampton Inn and other Hilton Brands ..our mattresses must have been ""army surplus"" or second hand from the local prison. The room is good size for Hawaii and has a fully equipted kitchen ..If Hilton wants to retain loyalty they had better pay attention to the DETAILS of the amenities offered by HGVC because they are not up to the standards of the rest of their brand ...we contacted the management regarding the location and they said they were booked and could not make any changes ..they will call us if there is anything else that opens up ..the sad part is that the same thing happened last year in The Grand Waikikian Tower when we were given a room that the previous guest had smoked cigars ! Again there was nothing management could do EXCEPT assure me that the next time they would make sure our stay was exceptional ....so much for promises ... after 25 year career in management and marketing I have determined that the Hotel Timeshare Concept is fatally flawed, once captured the brand has no loyalty to the owners at least in this case .

Ocean front truly means ocean front, the two southern end units on each floor have balconies that front the ocean with no obstructions. The view was incredible. Condo was clean, nicely decorated and kitchen well stocked. Having a kitchen in Waikiki really helps - just being able to eat breakfast in your room can save big $$. Some other reviews mentioned music/noise from bars below - we heard them every night, even on the 19th floor. The music went late - bring ear plugs. They do the trick. Free laundry on each floor was great. I never waited for a machine. We had a car. A car in Waikiki is both a blessing and a curse. Parking at the Hilton Hawaiian Village is expensive - $25-$30 per night. We got a tip that you can park for free until 10:30pm in the lot directly across from the Lagoon tower, where all the locals park to surf. There is an overnight lot next to the free lot where you can park for 10 hours for $6. If you are willing to do a little work, you can save a lot on parking. Finding a spot in the free lot can be tricky during the day. Most visitors from the mainland are up early anyway so securing spot early in the AM is not so bad. I would recommend trying to get out of the complex at least a few times for a meal. Alan Wong's Pineapple Room is at Macy's at the Ala Moana shopping mall (walking distance)- even after reading questionable reviews, we thought the burger (at $15) and the Kailua Pig BLT were both incredible. Every burger in Waikiki is expensive - might as well get a good one. The Wailana Coffee house across from the Hilton had good breakfast food. Every breakfast place seems to do a good Coconut Macademia Nut pancake so use this trip as an excuse to eat something you would not normally. Restaurant Epic requires a car, but was probably turned out the best meal we had - roasted duck salad, cioppino, shrimp risotto, and short ribs with mac 'n cheese. Dessert was a french toast with nutella, macademia nuts and caramel. Also a car ride away was Cinnamon's - red velvet and guava chiffon pancakes. Ala Moana Mall had the biggest food court I have ever seen - lots of options, but definitely food court quality food. Fresh malasadas from Leonard's are worth the trip. We went to Costco and loaded up on basics - they had a fresh tuna poke bar which was really good. I still don't understand the appeal of the Loco Moco (hamburger over rice, topped with an egg and gravy). We ordered pizza from Roundtable in the Hilton complex the night of the fireworks - it was expensive and just OK. Still nice to have dinner on the balcony and watch the fireworks.The Hilton Hawaiian Village faces three well known surf breaks - Kaisers, Rock Pile, and Ala Moana Bowls. We watched the surfers go out every morning - some before dawn. Our son who regularly surfs in FL enjoyed Rock Pile. I think the other spots were more advanced. By Florida standards, the paddle out is long to all three breaks. Before I let him go out on his own, I made him take some lessons. We used Hans Hedemann in Waikiki and had a very good experience. They have a shuttle that can pick you up at the Hilton (pick up point can be a madhouse, many tours leave from the same spot in the Tapa Tower). Watch out for the reef - we don't have those where we live and it takes a while to get used to it. After lessons (Seth and Moses were both excellent instructors), we rented longboards from Hawaii Surfboard Rentals. They deliver and pick up - 2 day minimum, about $25 a day - much less expensive than the rental stands at the beach and you don't have to abide by the stand's hours. The Hilton has a special storage area for boards rented through third parties. My son was able to surf before 8:30am and after 4:30pm. We also tried stand up paddle boarding a couple of afternoons and really enjoyed that. The sea turtles swim right up to you if you paddle past the Hilton dock. Many reviewers have commented on how crowded the Hilton complex is. The days before Christmas were not so bad. In the days following Christmas, the crowds got considerably bigger and lines got much longer. The line to rent chairs/equipment and check out towels started well before 8:30am when the stand opened. With so many visitors coming from the mainland, the Hilton should really consider opening the stand earlier, especially during peak periods. There are over 3,000 rooms and maybe 3 stands throughout the property for rentals/towels. Fitness center was full every morning by 6am. Since we are from Florida, we don't do pools, hot tubs, or lie in the sun on vacation. However, every time we walked past the pool with the water slides, it was packed. Despite the crowds, I must note that we never waited very long for an elevator, even on check out day. Everyone was extremely friendly and we had an incredible trip.

At the Hilton Hawaiian Village , it is clearly a destination property, and at the Grand Vacation club with the rooms that have a kitchen and dining facilities, its worth the price (and savings over constantly eating out). We found the kitchen well stocked with more then basic cooking utensils and once we walked around a bit, found some great grocery shopping for what we needed for some great in-room meals. This allowed us to splurge on some great meals out at other fine restaurants which were the usual high price of the islands, but given we hadn't eaten out for a couple of days it was no problem. The hotel property is quite large, so make sure you know exactly what tower/property in the 'village' you are booked into, so your cab or the Wiki bus from the airport (best value) drops you as close as possible to your tower/property as there are multiple in the village and you don't want to end up hiking with your luggage. Make sure to walk the property to get used to everything it has to offer, it is mostly beach front, and has its own private lagoon, so wander the property and get familiar with it, the pools tend to fill up their chairs early so plan accordingly. If you want to take the beach front boats, walk about 1/2 a mile towards Diamond Head where most of them 'park' on the beach and take on passengers. Ask the front desk if they have any coupons or check the coupon books on the blvd. Also across the street from the property (east) is a great cafe and breakfast stop for that one time you don't want to cook (try the banana pancakes).

None of us could sleep, including my 1 year old son, until it was over. It really put a damper on our vacation.Another issue we have (which it sounds as though they've been dealing with for a while) was cockroaches in the kitchen. They were scurrying around every time we turned the lights on in the room. Very gross and made us uncomfortable to leave food around. To the resorts credit, they did come in one day to 'spray' the kitchen to try and get rid of them. Sadly it worked for maybe 24 hours before they were back.

The Hilton Hawaiian Village to begin a very large property which is shared by both the Hilton Grand Vacations and Hilton Hotels. It is quite a impressive complex of hotels, suites, restaurants, pools and shops. When we checked in at the shared Grand Waikikian and Lagoon Tower Lobby, we were given very poor directions to our tower that we ended up walking quite a distance away from the Lagoon Tower! It was not fun dragging our luggage around after a 8 1/2 hr. plane trip!When we finally got settled into our 2-BR suite and after a quick bite to eat, we realized very quickly that we located right next to the Starlight Luau which was held nightly a top the Parking Garage right next to us! Not only did we have to endure this nightly, but the walls in this tower are paper thin and again, unfortunately for us on our first night, the room above us (mostly teenagers from the sound of it) decided to party loudly until 3 am! We almost called Security but didn't. Fortunately the noise makers above left the next day! There were a number of other problems: the sink disposal did not work, the tub in the master's BR drained very slowly, the safe could not be locked because of low battery, the shower in the master BR was weak b/c the switch from faucet to shower was not working (was predominantly on faucet mode), had only 1 maid service for 10 days of stay (really?). When the maid service came that one time, did not restock kitchen and did not dust the unit! If you rented a car for your vacation, be ready to pay $30 per day for Valet Parking or $25 per day for Self Park. The lagoon and beach area was very nice but be prepared to spend $30 for all day umbrella and $15 all day for beach lounge chairs otherwise be content with just a towel! The property is nicely situated and close enough to get to all the sites that Honolulu has to offer (Diamond Head, Koko Crater, Hanauma Bay, Chinatown, North Shore, Pearl Harbor, etc.). We did a majority of our cooking in our unit. Groceries are very expensive but so is eating out. I would go back to this property but only if they placed me in a corner 2-BR facing the lagoon on a high floor away from the nightly luau!","Oregon, Wisconsin",42,4.0

I read many reviews on Lagoon Tower Studio. Almost all of them were negative, citing the bad view, noise from the pool, the location near the elevator etc. I was very nervous before I checked in . Here is the list of my very positive review of STUDIO accommodation here.#1. Our taxi driver knew ahead of time that we must check in at Lagoon Tower. Check in area was not crowded, a very nice lady greeted us with lei. Doorman and bellmen were courteous and quick. In the past,we had used the main lobby when we had stayed at regular room. Hotel check in line there was always like a Central Station platform. But not at the Lagoon Tower lobby. It is smaller and more private and upscale.#2. I was hesitant to open the door to our Studio here. We were pleasantly surprised: There were two windows with plantation shutters. We saw ocean from each window. Rainbow tower was located in between our windows, so the wall sort of hid the rainbow tower. All we could see from our window was Pacific Ocean View ! If we looked down, we saw Great Lawn where private parties take place at night. It was quiet and the room was beautifully decorated.#3. I hope my review will erase the previous negative Studio reviews. Studio did not have any balcony. It was OK with us.#4. Flat Screen TV has closed to 300 TV channels....I was tired when I checked in as we were on the Big Island prior to Waikiki. So I rested in this comfortable room for 3 full days. Bed was comtemporary and comfortable. Bathroom amneties were from PeterThomasRoth which is an expensive luxury line of skincare product company.#5.I took many photos of this room. I will try to attach some of the photos with this review.#6. Excellant and caring Housekeeping staff.",New Orleans,6,5.0

I was traveling for 10 days b/w 27 October - 7november 2012.I needed a kitchenette most importantly- if the children wanted to snack.On a friends recommendation I was advised the Hilton Grand Vacations would be befitting ....the girls would love the fireworks, the pools, the lagoon as advertised on their website and the fact they had a kitchen was inviting......I thought I would give them a go. Upon arrival the receptionist requested payment up front?? My first taste of Aloha from Hilton.I have never experienced this before...normally you would pay at the end of your stay.Whilst she took an imprint of my card... Normal practice .....she requested another form of payment for incidentals at $250.00 ... I was advised I had to use another card or cash...it was relayed to me that my card she just used was not able to be accepted...indicating it had declined....this annoyed me as I knew there were sufficient funds....in addition I asked what the incidental were for and she replied 'yes' to minibar...THERE WAS NO MINI BAR IN THE ROOM,!!! I still don't know what incidentals she referred to as the room was empty of everything. Not even brochures of the services the complex has to offer...the spa, the shops,Nothing. Not even a magazine.My card worked fine later that day at the ABC store and at Ala Moana shopping centre.The receptionist also failed to advise us of the events that are popular within the hotel. There was no welcoming to your room, no direction given of where you are and where everything is......there was no information about any breakfast options....there was literally NO INFORMATION. IT WAS FIND IT YOURSELF. A map was given to us by concierge the day after but still very vague as to what we could experience within the complex given it was so large with multiple buildings. We waited for our luggage and after an hour phoned, only to be advised that the receptionist had failed to collect our ticket from us. On day 4 .....typically the cleaning crew arrived after we had left out room at 9.30. On this day they arrived at 8.00 am and left a calling card stating they do not disturb patrons if the Sign is out..and in addition we missed our day and they would return tomorrow. I phoned ASAP and requested someone come back that day. By 2pm no one had serviced the room. I had to demand that this service be actioned immediately as we had no towels.On day 7 being Friday it was fireworks night. A very popular event and the little ones were devastate when we heard them and ran to watch them. We missed them as they are only on for 5-7 minutes. I then went to speak with the duty manager and vented my frustration from DAY 1 and the above incidents that had happened to date. I was disgusted that there was no advertising or information given when these events happen. It was on this night I discovered that the towers are ALL ...TIME SHARED OWNED AND THEY THOUGHT WE WERE TIME SHARE OWNERS. OMG ! Customer service is totally non existant with this Hotelier group. The duty manager was mostly concerned about what time she should book the cleaning staff to service the room....in addition I was advised that the cost was $75.00 per day......now this really stressed me to the maximum as I had never heard of this before......she then realized that this was a mistake made by her.......She was not interested in any other concerns or bad experiences I had with the hotel....Eg; the lack of information, NO WELCOME PACK UPON ARRIVAL GIVEN TO US apparently, the lagoon as advertised on their webpage is not owned by the hotel ....it is a publiclagoon area and the costs are associated with the rental of beach furniture.No pool service by the pool. No room service in your room. Children are not permitted to wear floaties around their waist in the pool which is deep for them. Because of the low fence gating the complex near the pool area, there were thieves that casually swam amongst with patrons, stole patrons belongings and pool towels so that they could blend in next time around. Security is non existant on these premises and staff are not interested. The doors accessing into the pool area do not work and you have to wait for some one to leave to gain entry....advising hotel staff of this was totally a waste of time. It appears this is a daily problem. Security is a high problem here and safety is of no of concern to this hotel. Given what I experienced when these thieves roamed amongst the patrons in the pool area as I was privy to the incident, I would never ever contemplate staying here.",Melbourne,7,1.0

We ended up dragging our luggage from one building to another trying to find the right place to check in, and then getting lost going from the check-in desk to our room in another tower. By the time we finally found our room my wife and I were at each other's throats from the stress, which is not how we wanted to start our Hawaiian vacation. My recommendation to management would be to print dozens of ""your are here"" flyers and put them all around the site so people can have some hope of finding their way from one place to another; I only saw two such maps after we'd been there for a day. On the plus side, staff we dealt with were friendly and the upgraded room we got in the Kalia tower was very nice - other than being far from the beach. My advice to most travelers would be to avoid this facility and stay somewhere better organized, either on the main stretch of Waikiki Beach if you want to be there or further out of town for more peace and quiet. Leave the Hilton Hawaiian Village to the big tour groups who come here with their own guides to walk them around the complex.","Sacramento, California",4,2.0

The icing on the cake was the outstanding accommodations and services at HGV! Our HVG included a rental car in our rate that the special VIP check in process at Dollar rental car was absolutely seamless and a warm welcome from other past experiences at other rental car places. Next, upon arrival for check-in at the Grand Waikikian front desk adjacent to the Lagoon Tower, the open air lobby was beautiful and everyone from the valet to front desk immediately made us feel welcome! To our surprise, our deluxe suite was two levels with open concept kitchen, dining and living areas which are nicely decorated and very clean. Both bedrooms and the living room had flat TV screens with Direct TV (or equivalent). The master suite was huge and comfy and both bedrooms had private bathrooms with an extra half bath on the first floor which was very convenient. The only very minor drawbacks were: 1) second bedroom had poor lighting and had two twin beds (but we could put the two beds together); 2) there was no real storage closet for golf clubs, coolers, beach chairs etc; and 3) we got charged for an entire week of valet parking even though we parked most nights at a nearby overnight lot (those charges were immediately reversed without question). As for the other amenities, we usually don’t care as we always leave Waikiki during the day on day trips and then return at night for the nightlife. However, our first day we stayed close to the hotel and I would just like to note my observations: the lagoon pool area is very noisy given the water slide area is designed for kids and the “super pool” is a little less noisy. Also, the beach area in front of the hotel is expansive compared to the rest of Waikiki Beach and is less rocky than other parts and the lagoon is a nice feature as well. Also, note well: the sit-down restaurants in the village are very expensive while the food is just average. Clearly, the restaurants at the HHV have a captive audience for those tourists who don’t branch outside of the HHV. In general, the village itself is huge and there are plenty of shops including the ubiquitous ABC store which has something for everyone including an amazing wine selection. We thank the entire HGV staff for their wonderful hospitality and seamless operation. From original booking, to Dollar rental car, to the accommodations, HGV really has all the details nailed down to make this an enjoyable and memorable vacation experience.","Chicago, Illinois",198,5.0

The Laundry room was great to have a few doors down, no charge to use machines and soap was also provided. The grounds of course are spectacular and family friendly, several pools to choose from and restaurants and bars on site.

It was a timeshare exchange and we could not have been happier with our accomodations. It was a large 2 bedroom on the 16th floor with an ocean view in the Lagoon Tower and it was beautiful. We could see the ocean and the private Lagoon on the property. From our room we could see the fire works displays they have on Friday nights and the entertainment on the roof of the adjacent building at the Luau. This is a very large facility and a little over crowded even in Oct. I do not swim but I noticed the pools were very full. As others have mentioned you have to get a towel card to get a beach towel and return the towel for the card , then turn the card in at check out or be billed for the towel. There is construction going on to build another pool on the property and to add more stores. This facility is almost a self contained little town. There are all kinds of shopping and restaurants and a small ABC store with groceries. Items are a little higher but the convenience is worth it. Although milk was $9.99 a gallon in there we were told it was about $7.00 a gallon average on the island.The room was clean and the beds and pillows were very comfortable. Master had a king bed and the other bedroom had 2 double beds. It had 2 full baths, living area, dining area and kitchen with all utensils. Only complaint I had was there was only a 1/2 gallon pitcher and I am from Texas and drink lots of iced tea.The beach is only a few steps from the outer edge of the facility and you can walk all the way down the beach side on a sidewalk. In addition to shopping there are several small clubs with free entertainment on property. It is an all non smoking facility with only a couple of designated areas for my bad habit. I did not find the large area with benches until the day I was leaving. We came in early from another hotel and they held our luggage for us and called as soon as the room was ready.There is a thermostat in the unit for Heat and A/C but it just says warm/ cool with different settings in between and a three speed fan. We found we had to shut off the vents in the living area to keep the bedrooms cool at night. And you can't leave the balcony door open or the unit shuts off.The balcony was furnished with a nice table and four chairs. Big flat screen TV's in living and each bedroom with a playstaion and dvd player in living room. You will get a card to use at the kiosk in the lobby for free dvd movies and playstaion games.Decent water pressure in the showers and I never ran out of hot water.Staying for a week we only got maid service once but, if you need anything, all you have to do is catch the maid in the hall and she will be happy to provide you with items from her cart. To get clean towels just take your dirty ones to her to count and get fresh ones.There are 2 free washers and dryers on each floor of the Lagoon Tower. You can buy detergent in the ABC store in the lobby. So pack light and wash. Save yourself baggage fees. We did not rent a car during our stay we used the Waikiki trolley but I heard that parking was $20.00 per night. Did not take my laptop as I read different stories about Wi-Fi availability and prices. All staff was friendly and helpful. I did notice that there wasn't much security. Only saw 2 guards driving a 4 wheeler through the property once and guards at the private events they had on the lawn by the Lagoon.If I was planning on going back to Waikiki I would definitly stay here.","Denison, Texas",42,4.0

It was a fun place with lots to do right on the property! We enjoyed Maui Zaui pizza at the Round Table - Yum! We went to the Hawaiian Luau on the property (HGVC owners get free upgrade to inner circle of tables - orchid leis - first in line for food) and enjoyed the singing, dancing, and traditional clothing. We shopped along the Rainbow Bazaar and were pleasantly surprised at the prices right there in the resort. For example, the shop downstairs in the Lagoon Tower had bottled water - 1.5 L for $0.99! Also there was an ABC store on the property that had different Hawaiian items to try: pineapple wine (YUM), local craft beers, Kona coffee, macadamia nuts, etc. By staying in our fabulous HGVC room in the Lagoon Tower (2 BR, 2 BA, full kitchen, dining room, living room, and 2 balconies overlooking the lagoon and the beach), we could also eat out on our balcony with food from the ABC - coffee in the morning was the greatest! Don't miss the Honolulu Cookie company, and the Pitake Jasmine lotions, candles, etc smell divine. We ventured out of the village for several excursions: On Sunday, we took a van to the Swap Meet at Aloha Stadium - not to be missed - can find all sorts of great Hawaiian items for reasonable prices: 7 Beefy T-shirts for $20, basket purse $20, watercolor paintings with woven matting and local wood frame $85, fabrics $3.75/yd, Tiki lamps $45, King's Hawaiian bread $7 for 3-4 loaves, shirred dress $30, etc. Loads of fun and you can munch of FRESH pineapple as you walk around.Next day, we hiked up Diamond Head (go for the very early morning tour - our 10 am one was HOT). Rana was our guide, and she was full of local information and how to get up Diamond Head the right way - hydrate often. Did you know that Diamond Head is not a crater??We also took a hike, kayak and snorkel tour to Chinaman's Hat island. Awesome - drove through rainforest to get to the other side of Oahu, short hike to a lookout point above a working ranch, kayaked out to Chinaman's Hat, ate lunch, snorkeled, kayaked back, and then drove back to Waikiki. It was our favorite outing.Rented a car from Enterprise just down the street from the property for about $50 for the day (kept it overnight so we did not have to be back to return it by the time they closed at 5 pm). We headed east to Hanauma Bay for snorkeling - it was like snorkeling in a fish tank - tons of fish right in front of your mask. You pay to park, pay to enter the park, and have to watch a video on protecting the wildlife. We freshened up there, and then headed on the road around the island - stopping for the photo ops at the blow hole and other well-marked areas. Had an early dinner at Giovani's Shimp Truck (shrimp scampi to die for) and then doubled back to see the Polynesian Cultural Center. After taking in some of those sights and shopping opportunities, we headed to Sunset Beach for.... sunset pictures! We saw lots of surfers off to the left in the Banzai Pipeline. Then used the GPS to find Ted's Bakery - just 0.4 mi down the road - for pineapple cheesecake, etc.From the Hilton, we took the catamaran tour to Turtle Canyon and snorkeled with lots of Green Sea Turtles. It was also fun to walk out to the main drag and see all the fancy shops - go to the Hard Rock for Happy Hour - but even more fun once we found the International Marketplace. Even met Wally Amos of Famous Amos cookies! He's still smiling.","Jacksonville, Florida",53,4.0

We were high enough for it to be quiet and to see surfers in the waves off the beach. The room was updated and clean with only minor annoyances (broken hair dryer and playstation connection) that were quickly remedied with a call downstairs. Concierge was always friendly without being too pushy. On site dining was a bit pricey and somewhat bland, but it's on-site and in Hawaii so we expected as much. I found the prices mostly comparable to other restaurants nearby. Landscaping is fantastic and I took several photos of the water features, birds, and fish. The village is very large and it might be useful if there were more maps posted around the site. We stayed during the off season and it was busy without being overly crowded. No problems getting choice seats at the pool or on the beach. Overall, I'd give it a 4.5, with the deduction only being because it wasn't absolute perfection.",Austin,2,4.0

Last year, we were a little concerned about the units showing a substantial amount of wear, but we are very pleased to see that things have been spiffed up! And someone took note to add a wine bottle opener (missing the last three visits) and a coffee pot with a gold screen filter... Hooray to whoever has been taking note! This trip, the dishes match! Yeah!!! Looks like the cabinetry has been updated! What a relief. I read some of the reviews before writing my own. We usually come in September so we can miss the crowds. This year, the entire area is busier than I have seen (only my 5th or 6th visit to Hawaii)... including the resort, beaches, and pools. We could not find two chairs together yesterday at the pool, and everytime I spotted two together, before I could get to them, they had been snagged! And the pool by Lagoon Tower was too busy to go in. If my husband did not have a recuperating knee, we would be in the ocean!!! I wish they had an adults only pool! I was also concerned about John L.s review about theft. We have seen more security this stay, which creates mixed emotions. The resort does not have lockers and my husband's swim shorts don't have a zipper pocket! Where to leave your room key and credit card while swimming??? Inquiring minds would like to know... I also am concerned about the plans to add another tower. Certainly the resort is busy enough as it is!!! More people means more traffic, more bodies, more waiting, less room at the beach, more bodies in the water... etc. We will see what happens. There is a reason we vacation as far away from L.A. as possible... there is also a reason we bought at ""the quiet end of Waikiki""... In short, HGVC Staff is great! The rooms are back to being beautiful... and someone has been paying attention to detail! I remembered to bring salt and pepper this year, but didn't need the wine bottle opener or coffee filters I packed! When you book try to get a room as high up as possible if you are near the pools. Since we are oceanfront owners, we are close to the pool as it is, and the noise can get a little grating... but we must accept the tradeoffs for such beauty... Noisewise, higher is better... now if the guy next door did not think he was a foghorn... Aloha!","Canyon Lake, Texas",35,5.0

Seriously Hilton, if your trying to sell someone into the club, this room is not the one to put them in. We were given a 2 room suite they call premium that they tell us rents for $700+ a night. We have an entirely different word for Lagoon 2067-Disgusting. It is an old, manky suite with disgusting carpet, dirty apolstery, moldy baseboards, a circa 1980 kitchen. Other than the view which is good and the reason I gave 2 stars instead of one, there is nothing redeeming about this suite. Honestly, we would never have paid more than $200 a night for this suite and that's pushing it. In no way was the $1700 weekly package worth it particularly when we had to spend 2 hours with Rick the OCD sales consultant pushing ownership down our throats. (A comment to all vacation clubs-no way are we spending 50K+ on the spot without going home and thinking about it as any intellegent prudent person would. If your product is that good, you would give us the time to mull it over and not try to strong arm your potential owners).We have stayed in resorts all over the world and we would not recommend this one. The pools are WAY too overcrowded being closed daily because someone defecates or vomits; the pools are old-you simply do not want to put uncovered feet on those tiles or stones; there are very poor dining choices other than Bali which was excellent-we do not care for fast food for every meal; you have to pay for absolutely EVERYTHING and I'm not kidding. We brought our little water mattress for our son and I asked the pool shop if they could blow it up with their compressor and they charged me $5.00. We will most likely never stay here again. If we had to do it all over, we would stay at the Royal Hawaiian down the beach. It is a lovely hotel that is charming, well kept and less crowded in the better part of Waikiki. It's more our style.","Toronto, Canada",36,2.0

Everything is at the doorstep; pools, beach, spa, gym, ABC Store, myriad of restaurants, activities, trolley, shuts, etc. I love it. However, it is true that it is crowded. The occupancy rate is high year-round. So, for that reason, if you are looking for a private, quiet secluded getaway, I wouldn't really recommend the HHV. Our family had a great time. The room was quiet and having a kitchen was very convenient. Negatives are that the hotel dining options are pretty pricey. Parking is also very expensive. We loved the new pool, which was always crowded with families because of the slides. Our kids did not want to leave the pool! The new towel system makes sense to me. It prevents guests from ""parking"" their towel on the chairs all day and then leaving them behind and preventing another guest from using the lounge chairs. Our kids never wanted to leave this pool! We also loved the kayak, paddle boat rentals in the lagoon. It is great for small kids. We also took the catamaran trip from the HHV dock. Very nice. We loved the firework show. Very impressive.

It could get a bit corwded at times, the pools ecspecially looked very crowded however we rarely used it as the beach was at our doorstep. We were out and about alot of the time, however even when we were at the hotel I didnt really mind it being crowded. There were a lot of families there with kids though so I probably wouldnt recomend it for a romantic gettaway.

We did purchase a time share at the Lagoon tower several years ago and we returned again this year. I did enjoy our stay as usual. The familiar setting always brings back memories and we always look forward to the new memories. Our room faced the ""great lawn"" and we benefited from watching wonderful free entertainment from several large meeting groups that were having functions on the great lawn. We had an incredible view of a firework display one evening from our balcony. I love the fact that there is so much to do within the village and it is away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. But it is walking distance to the main street in Waikiki so love the location. But I was disappointed in a few things. Our kids enjoyed the Paradise Pool and they enjoyed the water slides. But from my perspective it was much too crowded at the pool. To make matters worse, the beach chairs were packed so closely together that you can barely walk through the rows. My biggest complaint is they closed the bar restaurant at the Paradise pool. There is no food service! I still love the HHV but it is starting to lose its appeal to a certain degree. I just hope they stop building more towers - it is getting too crowded!","Los Angeles, California",61,3.0

However, HGVC didn't take any action to prevent theft i.e. they didn't place any warning sign about theft, they didnt' allocate more security to watch customer's belongings, they didn't install CC camera to watch and to give warning to potential thief. How can I enjoy with my family at those area without worrying theft?Worse than all, resort manager and staffs didn't apologize for what happened and took it granted.

Despite my reaction, I can’t point to many things that were done wrong, so I decided to be generous in my rating (I wish I could have given it 3 1/2 stars). Just beware that, if you think like I do, you may not like it much, either. To put this review in perspective: this was our third visit to Honolulu (for me and my spouse) and our 10th visit to Hawaii. We wanted a scenic location convenient to major attractions such as Pearl Harbor and ‘Iolani Palace. We paid $1700 for 7 nights; this review would be much harsher in tone if we had paid the rack rate of $599/night.Prior to our arrival at the Lagoon tower, we were contacted by our own “personal concierge,” who offered to make advance reservations for us. She set up an appointment for us to talk to her our first morning. This was a nice touch. We checked in at the Grand Waikikian/Lagoon Tower lobby, were greeted warmly, and quickly received our room keys and towel cards. Other reviewers are unhappy with the towel card system: you exchange a card for a towel, and if you don’t return the card upon check out you are charged for the towel. This system doesn’t bother me. They’ve got to encourage folks to avoid leaving towels on the beach; this seems to be as good a system as any and one I’ve seen in use at other resorts.We found our 11th floor, west-facing suite to be very spacious and well equipped. We had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a fully-applianced kitchen complete with pans, tableware, toaster, etc. There was a large dining room table, living room with flat-screen TV and DVD player, and a small balcony with table and chairs. The furnishings did not look dated to me, although the kitchen appliances and cabinets were a bit worn. We stocked our kitchen with groceries from Foodland at Ala Moana Shopping Center, a 15-minute walk (we returned via a trolley).You’re probably wondering: what’s the problem? Well, for one, the overwhelming impression upon walking into the suite was of…the Ilikai Hotel next door. Two of the Ilikai’s wings, with their approximately 500 balconies, looked right into our balcony and windows. From inside of our “ocean view” room, only if I sat on the right side of the sofa and looked along a narrow strip in between our building and the Ilikai, could I see the yacht harbor and the ocean beyond. So I thought, hey, I’ll ignore the Ilikai and sit on the balcony for a better view. Despite being on the 11th floor, the shrieks of happy children playing in the Paradise Pool immediately below carried up the concrete and glass canyon formed by the two towers so that the sounds of their mirth, combined with the roar of industrial-sized air conditioning units, made sitting on the balcony an almost deafening experience.OK, so I wasn’t at Waikiki just to sit on my balcony; maybe I should join those kids having a great time at the Paradise Pool. This beautiful pool, open only to guests of the Lagoon and Grand Waikikian towers, has several water slides, different levels, and a spa tub that limits its capacity to 9 bathers at a time. We looped through the pool deck multiple times before we saw a single chair being vacated. While my spouse went on the slides, I waited by the spa tub until there were only 8 people inside. (Just as I entered, two more people piled in; so much for trying to follow the rules.) Both the spa and pool were packed with people. And no wonder: counting the hotel and timeshare portions of this resort, there are 3627 rooms and suites with an average daily occupancy of something like 6000 people. For all of these people, the resort advertises five pools, except that one of them (the Tapa pool) was closed for renovation when I visited and I think this count includes the sea-water lagoon, which is more ocean than pool. So it’s unsurprising that the pools should be crowded every day, all the time.In fact, crowds are the norm at the Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV). The shopping village between the Grand Waikikian and the main lobby was filled with wall-to-wall people whenever we walked through. The main lobby was always hectic. As we walked past any restaurant after 6 p.m., we noted crowds of people waiting. We waited for one of the three elevators in the Lagoon tower every time we came and went. (This situation was worsened by the housekeepers, who attempted to move their carts by way of these same three guest elevators. Just imagine people moving groceries, strollers, inflated pool beds, and surfboards on top of the normal luggage loads and then think about adding housekeeping carts to the mix.) The check-out line at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday morning was at least 60 people deep.So the crowdedness is my main complaint about the hotel, with too few facilities (elevators, restaurants, shops, breathing space) for the number of accommodations. I’m not sure how much to blame the Hilton for this situation and how much to chalk this up to the fact that Waikiki is a crowded place. There are advantages to being at a huge hotel, however: the world comes to you. We used the Hertz desk in the Tapa Tower twice to rent a car for the day during our week-long stay. Why twice for one day, rather than once for two days? While it was a bit of a pain to go through the rental process multiple times, doing so meant that we did not have to pay for very expensive overnight parking. And when we did not have a car, we rode the Pink Line Trolley for $2 each way, took taxis downtown (approximately $15), and even used the city bus ($2.50). Plus, the Polynesian Cultural Center has coach pickups from the HHV to their park on the northeastern shore, and every tour bus on Oahu, seemingly, can arrange a pickup at the HHV.I did have some very good moments at the HHV. We arrived early enough to snag an outdoor table at Tropics Grill and enjoy appetizers and drinks while listening to live music and watching the dinner cruise ships sail back and forth just offshore. I liked seeing four penguins in a small pond along with many turtles in the middle of beautiful grounds. A five-minute fireworks program at 7:50 on Friday night was impressive, and easily viewed from the shores of the Lagoon.So would I stay at the HHV again? It’s doubtful, and certainly not during a $760M construction project that is planned to begin in 2013. According to Derek Paiva’s 2 April 2010 article in Hawaii.com magazine, the HHV will add two new vacation timeshare towers to its existing 7 hotel and timeshare towers, adding 550 more vacation condos and another 1000+ people on site per day--all without expanding its land area. If you are looking for a serene oceanfront experience, the HHV is not for you.","Nashua, New Hampshire",97,4.0

The beach is uncrowded but the sand is not soft. Parking and food are expensive, but cheaper eats are walkable. Ala Moana mall and the rest of Waikiki are walkable in under 20 min. The rooms are very nice and clean, and the beds are quite comfy. The soundproofing is fairly good unless there is a concert/wedding going on at the ground level. Laundry and kitchen areas are good and helpful. The pool is very nice but many kids splashing and yelling makes relaxation hard. Sometime it's hard to get a chaise lounge in the shade. The gym is quite good for a hotel. The property is very pretty with some shopping and animal exhibits around.

Fantastic view of the beach although set back a ways and enjoyed the balcony, it was clean & quiet..We were disappointed with all 3 pools.... at our hotel the pool was small and in shade much of the day. They had slides at another pool but they were crammed together in a small area and the kids had to wait in line to use them. Very little deck space and it was crammed with chairs. The last pool was larger and close to the beach but also crammed with chairs and we had to wait / watch to get chairs at either of these pools. Our daughter who is 11 lost interest quickly with all 3 & this was especially disappointing since we chose this place thinking she would have fun and meet kids. We did shop in some of the shops and although some were pretty expensive there were still deals. We also appreciated the complimentary DVD's/ movies they provided - more family selections would have been nice. I will end with that I felt the service was impersonal....check in was okay but honestly no warmth from our agent - a bit snobby? Also when my daughter used the phone to call my cell 3 times (after being told not to) we were charged a total of $25....I sincerely doubt we talked the 10 minutes each time it showed and the check out agent was not sympathetic in the least.

The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a fantastic place to stay. It's huge. There are many pools, shops and places to eat. There are pengiuns, flamingos, fireworks and awsome gardens. Best of all its right on the beach. We stayed for a week in July 2012 in a 2 bedroom/2 bath apartment on the 21st floor of the Lagoon Tower. The view was magic. The apartment itself was very nicely appointed and (mostly) well maintained. It had everything you needed. The kitchen was a full kitchen with a large fridge. The bathrooms were quite good (a bit outdated - shower head a bit problematic but honestly not a problem). The main bedroom was huge, with king bed, ensuite and awsome views. The second bedroom had only two single beds (which we were disappointed about as we expected double beds). The lounge was also large and had a large sofa bed. All bedrooms had flat screen TV's as did the lounge with PS3. The balcony (Lanai) was large with table an chairs and awsome view towards Diamond Head and of Village gardens and Lagoon. We also got to see the nightly Luau from there which was a nice unexpected surprise. There is no laundry in the apartment but one on every floor with free washing machines and dryers - which we found to be a real bonus. I rented it from Chris Morelli online and was a bit apprenhensive about paying a full six months in advance, but it all work out really well. The check-in process was not a problem at all . We arrived at 9:30 a.m. and were in our room by 1 p.m. The place if full of families - this is really a family oriented resort - and Japanese! Its not very far from Waikiki - about a 20 minute walk and really close to the Ala Moana Shopping centre - you can walk there is about 5 minutes.

You are also moments away from the beaches too. And yest the Hilton Hawaiian Village can get very crowded but if you do your homework, Oahu is full of great beaches & other places to spend your time. My husband and I like the fact that at night just strolling around the property, there are many spots that are very quite & private with little or no people around, heck you can even enjoy the lagoon all to yourself by moonlight! If you are on the property on a Friday night, head over to the Tapa Bar and check out singer Jerry Santos and the group Olomana.

We are vacation club owners so our room was booked through the vacation club using our yearly points. I called the resort one week before leaving to request a high floor with a view facing diamond head and the ocean. Both requests were met and we were extremely pleased. We had no problems at all with check in. Everything was perfect.I gave the resort 4 stars instead of 5 only because a few things that were disappointing about the room. My daughter slept on the sofa bed and it was horrible. She had to layer blankets to get comfortable. The bathroom was a nice size but the lighting was terrible. You literally could not see to do anything in the mirror. The master bed was very nice though as were the large tv's. My daughter wanted to take the one in the living room home. We also had a problem with the noise from the Tapa bar every night. They had live music which I am all for but it was extremely loud in our room. I don't know if it was the way the wind blows through the resort and that our room was on the 20th floor but it was like the music was right next door. We never got to sleep until after 11:00 when the entertainment was over. I would think that would really be a problem for parents with small children. I would like to say that housekeeping was wonderful! Both times we called for something they were there within 10 minutes. One time they brought us a whole bag of extra shampoo etc. Can't say enough good things about housekeeping. Also, our room and floor were very quiet. Never heard another person or a door slam like in most hotels. Slept like a baby!!Other than those few problems, we love, love this resort. We have looked at other hotels on the island and just can't find one that is as beautiful with as nice of a beach and as much to offer. This is our 4th trip to this HIlton so we were used to the layout and large crowds but I really don't have the same opinion as some on the problems with too many people. We never had a problem getting a chair by the pool, walked down the beachwalk almost every day with no congestion, ate at Topics outside with no wait and went to the lagoon one day with plenty of empty space.

We stayed in the Lagoon Tower in a 1 bedroom suite. Although this is one of the older buildings on the property, the room was nicely furnished and had a great bathroom, obviously recently refurbished. Full kitchen with nice new appliances, stop and buy some drinks and snacks on the way from the airport and use the full size fridge. New HDTV with a Sony PS3 where you can watch Blu Ray movies for free from the machines in the lobby. Our room faced Northwest toward the Ilikai hotel and marina, so we did have a pretty nice view, but not of the beach. Still it was quite nice to sit on the lanai with a glass of wine in the late afternoons.The grounds are clean and well manicured, but VERY crowded. The pool with the water slides by our tower was filled with kids so we used the one by the Ali'i tower which is close to the beach. Difficult to get lounge chairs by the pool unless you get out there at like 7:30AM. You've probably read about the towel cards in other reviews, but we really didn't mind that much although it is annoying to have to wait in line to return towels when you are wet and trying to get upstairs to shower for dinner! The walkway across the beachfront reminded me of a midtown sidewalk during lunch hour...wall to wall people. This place is not designed for moments of quiet luxury. We had a couple of meals at the Tropics Bar & Grill, also in Ali'i Tower. Seems to be a 30 minute wait for an outside table anytime you go. The pizza (Hawaiian, of course) was really good, actually better than California Pizza Kitchen's version, and about the same price. Try one! Service is non existent though, apart from taking the order and bringing the food, we didn't see our server either time we ate there. But you are on the beach with a great vibe and live music! The other food highlight was Lappert's ice cream parlor, where I got the Macadamia Caramel and my wife got the Kona Coffee ice cream. They make the waffle cones right in front of you and it was one of the best desserts ever;)EMERGENCY ALERT:::DO NOT GO TO THE LUAU!!! Well, at least not to eat. The entertainment is superb, great dancers! But I've had better food on airplanes:( Maybe the fact that this event is not on the beach (Where a luau is supposed to be) but on the roof of the parking garage should have been a tip off. It is a buffet so you have to stand and wait on line to get the substandard offering. It reminded me of cafeteria food in junior high school, especially the rock hard and obviously not-fresh (dare I say ""Stinks like the dumpster at the fishing pier""?) 'Mahi Mahi'. Inedible. The poi tasted like Elmer's glue. The hand carved beef was tough and flavorless. Only the Hawaiian chicken and pulled pork was remotely good. They should be ASHAMED of themselves for serving this slop much less calling it a Luau. But again, the dancers and band were really great, so go if you want to see a great hula show, just eat first!Nice little shopping area in the middle of the 'village'. Beni Hana on premises.

Last year I booked an ocean view room for 7 nights with points at the HHV and they tried to give me a 3rd floor room over the pool - I would have had to stand on my tiptoes to see the ocean. The front desk person felt that she was already doing me a favor by ""upgrading"" me to this ""ocean view"" room. When I told her I was already booked in an ocean view room she demanded that I show her my confirmation. Never in my hundreds of stays at Hiltons worldwide had I been asked to show a confirmation, and somehow here I found myself, on vacation, with my little toddler, struggling with the front desk, playing musical rooms in paradise. Well after that, I told myself that I wouldn't come back and decided that my loyalty to Hilton was over. Well fast forward a year and I found myself being offered 7 nights in a two bedroom at the GVC for $1700. I'm not going to say I totally reget taking it, because I don't. But it sure did solidify my feelings about the HHV and Hilton. We arrived at 2:30 and our room wasn't ready. What? Really? It's not like I tried to check in at 10AM or something, it is 2:30PM, I just got off a very long flight. My 2 year old is sleepy and my pregnant wife is hungry. They said that checkin is at 4PM and will call us when the room is ready. No choice but to go wait it out at the diner across the street, luckily we've been here before and know there is nothing worth eating on property. 4PM comes and still no call. Everyone is tired so we decide to wait a little longer before trying to check in. We check in (no call as promised) at 4:30 and of course it doesn't get any better. Our promised ocean view room is a view of the condo hotel next door. To obtain your sliver of an ocean view you must stand all the way on the right side of the room by the sliding glass door or be outside on the right hand side of the balcony. Did I mention I'm here on a timeshare promotion as a potential buyer? Well, at least it was an easy decision. The room itself was dated. the bath tub was one of the smallest tubs I've every showered in. The handle to turn on the water kept falling off. The mattresses were horrible, I thought I caught the flu the first night because I woke up so sore. The entire property needs to be renovated. To be fair the property has some good things going for it. The lagoon is great if you have little kids or for those who want to do water sports with pond calm conditions. The beach as tiny waves, perfect for little kids. A good stretch of it starting from the jetty is very rocky underwater, it gets better as you go towards Waikiki, but never rock free. One of the most annoying things about this property is the pool towel card system. You need to a card to get a towel (one card per towel), once you return your towel you get a card back. How annoying is that? I had two towels stolen while I was swimming and when I reported and tried to get new towels they said I had to go to the front desk!!! Are you kidding me?

We did not receive any discounts or packages, and we did not have to go to a timeshare sales presentation as a part of this room reservation. I mention this because the Lagoon Tower (and the Grand Waikikian Tower) are both HGVC properties, but for our visit it was booked / treated just like a normal hotel stay. We did have housekeeping service every day, and they did a thorough job cleaning the room, even cleaning up the kitchen and starting the dishwasher.We booked in November 2011 for our April 2012 stay, and received a 2 Bedroom 'Garden View' room in the Lagoon Tower. The rate, including taxes / fees, was about $475 USD per night.We were very happy with the size of the two bedroom unit. It has a very big master bedroom with a king sized bed, closet, dresser, large screen TV, and enough space for a large comfortable chair with an ottoman. The master had its own full bath. It would have been nice to have a seperate shower / bathtub, but instead it was a combined shower / bath. Double sinks would have been nice too, but there was only a single sink.What we really enjoyed, and where we spent most of our time, was the very large living room / dining / kitchen area. The kitchen was nice and big, pretty well laid out with full fridge, electric range, microwave, and dishwasher. Adequate counter space with a toaster and coffee maker. The kitchen was also well stocked with utensils, plates, kinves, cups, glasses, and cooking gear. There is a bar between the kitchen and dining area with two bar stools. Convenient place for the kids to sit and eat, or to serve food, or for a couple of people to sit while chatting with the people preparing food in the kitchen.The dining table was quite large, with four chairs. We had friends over for dinner multiple nights and fit 8 people around the dining table (we brought the four patio chairs in from the balcony). Living room area is good sized with a couch, coffee table, chair and ottoman. Comfortable space to sit and relax. Large screen TV with Playstation and DVD player in the living room, with free movie and game rentals down in the lobby. This was a nice touch which the kids enjoyed. May have been better if the Playstation was in the kids bedroom so we did not have to listen to them play...Balcony was not that large, but big enough for 4 to sit around the table out there for a drink and to watch the sunset. Balcony is overlooking the Paradise pool, the marina next door, and it had a gorgeous view of the sunset in the evening.The second bedroom is nice as well with 2 Queen (or maybe Full?) beds. Chair in the corner of the room, and another large flat screen TV in here. The second bathroom is also a full bath, it has two doors, one from the bedroom and one from the common / room entry area. Same bath / shower combo as the master bath, and also only one sink.Lagoon tower is nicely situated for the Paradise Pool, the lagoon itself, and then the mellow HHV beach. We wanted bigger waves so a couple of days walked about 25 - 30 minutes to the Duke surfing statue and set up camp in that part of Waikiki Beach. Not too bad a walk to central Waikiki, and the kids did enjoy the ocean / waves. It will be even nicer when they complete the beach restoration project up that way.Our kids really enjoyed the Paradise Pool with the slides. Lots and lots of kids... We had a couple of mellower swims in the older pool (Super Pool?) on the other side of the Rainbow tower.One complaint is the lack of hot tubs / whirlpools! There are 2 by the kids pool, but always filled with kids too young to even be in them. My wife did find a third one at the fourth floor pool area of the Kalia Tower. With 1300 rooms, I would think they would have a couple more hot tubs, and perhaps some kid free ones too...Between Costco and multiple ABC runs, we had plenty of food in our kitchen. With all the food we stocked up, we did not eat at any HHV restaurants so cannot comment on them. We did have Lapperts ice cream a couple of nights which was good.The room was somewhat dated in terms of decor and kitchen appliances, but this was more than made up for by the sheer size of the room. I understand they are beginning a renovation of the Lagoon Tower soon, which should bring the rooms up to more modern decor and standards.There are two shared washer / dryers on each floor, with laundry soap provided. These were very convenient to have closeby and we used them a couple of times during the week.Valet parking is extra per night, but in my opinion really worth the few bucks over self parking in that huge and very full garage.Service from everyone - front desk, valet, bell desk, concierge - was very friendly and nice. We appreciated the good service and good attitudes here.Overall though, a great stay which we all really enjoyed.","San Francisco, California",19,4.0

The suites at the HHV Lagoon tower are quite luxurious and spacious - particularly the 2BR lockout unit. Having the services of the Hilton was very convenient (e.g. room service). One day we sent our kids to Camp Penguin (which they loved) and got an adult day to ourselves. We also liked having the dining options of the village nearby for those days we just stayed at the hotel to enjoy the beach and pools.The location is great because you have Waikiki beach - warm and calm - outside your door. Ala Moana's shopping/dining is walkable in one direction while the Waikiki restaurants (e.g Keo's) are walkable in the other. And most of Oahu (Hanauma Bay, Portlock, Kaimuki, the Pali, downtown, etc) is a short drive away.-- New/different for this yearThey have a new system for ensuring the pools are used by HHV guests - cards instead of wristbands. It seems to be working - the pools were less crowded than in years past - and more convenient as well. They also seem to be doing a better job of removing towels from unoccupied chairs.They've stopped doing 'normal' resort valet service - instead of calling down for your car when you are ready to go they now expect you to present your ticket to the valet and then wait in the lobby. I assume they are hoping to phase out valet parking and just have everyone self park in the garage.Lastly, the village is now much less of a 'village' and more of a place to buy clothes and presents for folk at home. The toy store is closed, the book/music shop (with it's excellent Hawaiiana collection) is gone, and little 'useful' is left aside from the ABC store. Not that this is a deal breaker - Ala Moana is walkable and all of Honolulu is a short drive - but part of the charm of HHV was the feeling of being in a little self contained Hawaiian village.","NY, NY",278,5.0

We stayed in a studio in the Lagoon Tower from 18-23 March. The check-in experience, lobby, and hotel exteriors were very nice. However, once we found our room (immediately next to the elevators, so we kept passing it at first). Cons of the room/hotel ammenities: Just the doors and door frames looked worn down and old. Then we opened the hotel room and there was a bad smell, either cigarette smell or just stuffy. The studio was extremely small, the carpet seemed old, as did the bath tub. The bathroom could go without the door, it was always in the way. The air conditioning was loud. The mattress was uncomfortable, the sheets harsh. When we called housekeeping to replace the towels and sheets, they just dropped them off on top of the bed without taking the used ones, they also did not even pick up the trash, which we asked them to do. The DVD that we rented from the machine in the lobby did did not work in either the PlayStation or the regular DVD player. Yes there are washers and dryers one can use for free, and they give you small bags of laundry detergent, but the laundry rooms were dirty and not all the machines worked, and the ones that did took 2 hours, plus (so wasted time indoors waiting for laundry to finish).Pros of the room: dishes, microwave, coffee maker, refrigerator, free wifi (not very strong signal, password times out), DVD player, Play Station, iPod player in the alarm clock. Decent toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap bars, lotion, shower cap). About the hotel complex: conveniency store on site ""ABC Store"" is way overpriced, as are all the restaurants in the complex. There is a Walmart in the Ala Moana center that you can get to by taking the public bus $2.50. We enjoyed the Luau. Service at the Tropics restaurant was didn't match the price tags.The complex itself is beautiful but then you walk into your room and you feel like you could be anywhere else except Hawaii, and much less on a vacation since you have to do all the cleaning that you take for granted at any other hotel.weather tip: It gets a little chilly and it rained during our stay.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",13,3.0

Everything you would need is in the kitchen - microwave, pots and pans, blender, toaster. WIFI was on and off sometimes but worked 80% of the time. It's comp so who can complain. Request for a Lagoon view if possible for the nicer view. Maids come every few days. Washer and dryers are free as well and behind elevators. You can pack less clothing and do laundry mid week if you dont mind. Food: We went for groceries at Walmart or Foodland near Ala Moana mall (15 minute walk if you dont mind a stroll) for breakfasts and lunch. The liqour selection wasn't bad at Foodland and prices are decent - some even on sale! We didn't really eat on property, only at Round Table for decent priced sandwiches and the ice cream shop beside is delish! We went to Sensai which has 50% off sushi promo (see Menu brochure for more details), its definitely worth the wait and about 45 minute walk through Waikiki. Otherwise, there's a IHOP and Wailana Coffee House (24 hours) across the street from hotel.Parking: We parked at Hale Koa which is just a walk through the village and across the street in a multi level parking for $16 a day. You get your own card which you use to exit and enter at your own free will and there was always parking available at all hours. http://www.halekoa.com/about_us/list_services_and_amenities.cfm see parking pass ratesBeach: Very nice and the lagoon is enjoyable if you want a cleaner spot to swim. Just bought a beach mat for $3 to lie on the beach as you had to pay to rent chairs/umbrellas on beach. Lounge chairs by pool are at no cost. You cannot hold lounge chairs with towels longer then 45 minutes as resort has right to remove if unattended longer.

We drove and parking is included. Very nice spot with an excellent view of sunset and 2 drink tickets included.- Resort offers daily activities such as lei making, flower bracelets, hula dancing etc Service: Was great!

If you're old enough and been at the village in previous years, you know these use to be rentals and then were re-done many years ago. You would never know how old this tower really is by it's appearance. It looks brand new throughout. If you like a private pool with access to all pools then stay in Alii Tower; I read a previous view from someone who downgraded it in comparison to other Hilton Vacation Club properties. I can't compare to other such properties, so my review is only regarding the Hawaiian Village and the over dozen Oahu properties I've stayed. So continuing after Alii Tower, my next favorite would be Rainbow because of views and rooms and ease to pools/restaurants, however the elevators can take a while because of the number of people waiting to get on compared to number of elevators available. The negative reviewer above preferred Kaiia Tower, I personally don't care for Kalia. I consider it along with the Tapa Tower to be more of a businessman's Tower where you don't care about view or the feeling of Hawaii. Diamond Tower is my last choice after other hotels on the island. The Waikikian Vacation Club does not have the many rooms with a view (the one I had was supposed to be partial view, well the view was the top of boat masts in the harbor if I leaned way over the side of the balcony so be aware of ""partial"" go for the ""view"" or another tower..in my opinion.My only disappointment was the car valet because too many times there was only one valet working, so the wait was long. We were on 6th floor facing Diamond Head/Rainbow Tower which I preferred, which means sitting on our balcony we could face and hear the Luau and special events on the grass area below. Plus a great view of the Friday night fireworks (make sure you find out the time and stick around to watch...it is impressive. There were some palm trees that obstructed view so get 7th floor or higher. Our room was straight off elevator and that was no problem for noise. It was good having TV in both living room and bedroom - cuts down on spouse complaint about program I'm watching or her trying to sleep. Both are nice large flat screens. I am Hilton Diamond member and didn't get upgraded, but I got the room type I paid for and was fortunate because every tower and Hotel was full for at least half my stay (I couldn't get into Hyatt, Marriotts, Astons, etc. because of Presidents Day week-end. The Gold/Diamond members VIP breakfast is on first floor of Rainbow Tower and is a short, but nice walk. If you like to leave for work after that breakfast you might think using the main valet parking, always well staff and the morning guys run fast and the wait is not too long. There is self parking in garage and sometimes if there is a big event (like the Marine's Ball, etc.) it can be a challenge finding an open spot. The Lagoon/Waikikian is faster to drive into and out of if you're driving down Ala Moana from Airport/Ala Moana shopping center (just turn right after Iliki Hotel at stop light.).Check in/out desk was fast and well staffed. Bell Desk was fast and well staffed. I had free internet, but that may have been because of my Hilton status, ask when you make reservation, otherwise don't be surprised at $15 or more charge.","Shoreline, Washington",79,5.0

Not only were the apartments spacious and completely outfitted with all the kitchen supplies we needed, the location could not be beat. It is a 15 minute walk to the crowds and noise of Waikiki beach, so upon returning to the spacious beach, lagoon and landscaped grounds of the Hilton we always felt relaxed and calmed. We rented a car and hit Costco and Safeway to stock up on groceries for the week and the bellmen were most helpful getting all our shopping up to our apartments for a $5.00 flat fee. Obviously they have done this before. Half our group paid less for a Garden View apartment while we paid more for an Ocean View apartment and while our view was gorgeous out over Ala Moana Park and the Harbour, they had a perfect view of the pool for way less money! Same side of the building. The difference as explained by the front desk is that garden view puts you on the lower floors, but for the almost $1000.00 difference I would take that! The Paradise Pool is right beside Lagoon Tower and it is hands down the kids favourite pool, so if you are travelling with kids I would recommend this location, as we could lean over the balcony and tell each other when lunch was ready! The Friday night fireworks were impressive, and the ideal place to stand and watch is anywhere along the edge of the Lagoon. Before we left I read the reviews on Trip Advisor and was very nervous about cockroaches in the room. Happily, we never saw any in either apartment, where everything was spotless.One last thing - the Grand Waikikian might be newer and fancier, but it is set back farther from the Lagoon and pool compared to the Lagoon Tower, making it harder to keep track of your kids, and making it louder because of its proximity to the busy Ala Moana boulevard.","Halifax, Canada",54,5.0

It is family friendly and the staff is always welcoming and eager to assist.

Nicely furnished, nice thick walls that prevented sound from travelling. Worked great for our family of 5 and allowed us to entertain other family as we were there for a family reunion.

For the excessive amount of money charged for what is a Hilton Grand Vacation property, I walked into a tiny room comparative to a Days Inn, with no view, dark, dismal, with no balcony. I literally couldn't find enough floor space to open my suitcase. I immediately called to reception to express my concerns and at first they weren't going to do anything. But I insisted and got upgraded to a better room, a one bedroom. It was in the tower next door, the Grand Waikikian, a ""luxury"" property. The one bedroom suite was very nice. It had a full kitchen, two bedded bedroom, a big tub, walk-in shower, nice bathroom and a view of a busy intersection and other buildings from its balcony, which I never used, due to the view. Hey, it was an improvement over the studio. I had to switch four days in, and they were going to make me return to the studio. Even though the general manager of the hotel had promised this would not happen. I checked online and they were selling the very room I was staying in on several sites, yet they were telling me one was not available. I refused to return to the studio, and somehow, even though five minutes before I was told by the resort manager it was impossible, they found me a one-bedroom in the Lagoon Tower. After all of the promises and the demonstrations of concern, this made me feel very badly about the management and my treatment. Yes, I was upgraded, but at such a cost? The lagoon tower 1 BR was a big step down from the Grand Waikikian 1 BR, but had all the amenities and a balcony. But for the money, I could have stayed in a luxury resort in the center of Waikiki. The property itself is huge. There are five or six towers, a mix of Hilton Grand Vacations buildings and the Hilton hotel buildings. It was extremely crowded and not quiet or restful at all. We walked the entire property to find a quiet place away from the crowds and couldn't find a single nook or cranny to get away from it all. If you want quiet luxury, the Halekalani or the Westin would fit the bill, for about the same price or less, and in the center of Waikiki. The Hilton is a 15 minute walk to the center of the action, although there is a shopping mall right on property with restaurants, shops and a mini-mart. There are several restaurants nearby as well that are much less expensive than the onsite choices. Everything is a long walk away. I love to walk so it didn't bother me, but if you have trouble getting around, this is not the place for you. The gym was 10 minutes walk from the Lagoon tower. There was a largish sized gym mostly filled with aerobics equipment. at 7am, there was not a single machine available. There are about 20 machines for what is probably 2000+ guests. The steam room/sauna area costs $17 per day extra, but gym is free. There is a nice, quiet pool outside the spa. The only quiet pool on property, but with no view and not very lush or pretty. There are four other pools and a beautiful lagoon area with a beach and a big wading lagoon. Then the beach is right there. You couldn't ask for a better spot on the beach. If you want a chair or an umbrella, you'll have to pay $30 for the umbrella and $15 per chair. You can lay on the beach for free. The big pool has lots of available chairs, but there is no shade from the sun by mid-day. There are no umbrellas at any of the pools and escaping the sun became a problem. The lagoon pool is very shady, but small and packed with kids. The lagoon pool is very pretty. Get there early to snag a chair. To use the pools, you have to wear an armband and use cards to claim towels. Lose the cards and its $10 per card. When I got the towels the guy said he didn't care about the wristbands. He only cared about the cards, so I never wore my wristband again. There are two beach bar restaurants by the main pool and they are both very nice, not ridiculously priced and offer happy hours in the afternoon.The shopping area within the resort grounds is really nice and there are lots of good restaurant choices. But the main drag in Waikiki, a $6 cab ride, is awesome for all that. Amazing shopping, every high end brand you can think of, four Coach stores alone. Great restaurants, beautiful hotels and hotel bars. Lots of fun. Staying at the HIlton was not peaceful at all. It is a city unto itself with thousands of tourists roaming around, its own traffic, and nasty patrolmen. But if you like a place that is full of life, exciting in many ways, then you might like the Hilton.","Savannah, GA",112,2.0

Ohhhhh, Hilton. No goodsies. To preface: we booked this trip after being sold on a discounted vacation by Hilton if we'd just sit through a 2-hour timeshare presentation. We knew it was probably going to be at least mildly annoying, but hey, it's Hilton, how bad can it be? We were told very clearly that we would be staying in a suite large enough to hold at least two couples with a kitchen and a washer dryer. My fiance and I were both on the call, wrote down what we were told, and he emailed it to me to have a record of the conversation that same day. Keep that in mind as you read this review, y'all.So we arrive at Honolulu airport for our very badly needed vacation having heard just prior to leaving that the APEC summit was going on at the same time. We didn't hear this from Hilton, mind you, but from a snorkeling tour company. The lovely and helpful girls at the rental car place helpfully informed us that Obama was staying at Hilton. Again, the rental car girls - not Hilton. Look, I get it that Hilton doesn't control the APEC summit, isn't in charge of security for the POTUS, and that it's really a good economic thing for Hawaii. I understand, really. But don't you think that just maybe they could have warned us far enough in advance so we could change our plans if we didn't want to be in Waikiki at the same time and have our vacation severely compromised by all the security and general hullabaloo? Even if they couldn't say exactly who was going to stay there, they could have said something generic. ANYway...So we finally arrive at HHV (after having our car searched by Secret Service) only to be told that there were no rooms with king beds available. Um... what? My fiance and I are not sleeping in two double beds, but thanks. Call your supervisor. And lo! A wild king bed miraculously appears! I'm starting to get a funny feeling at this point, because weren't we supposed to be in a suite? Didn't the nice saleslady who sold us this vacation tell us we should totally bring another couple? So with great trepidation we head up to our room, only to find a gungy carpet, stained desk chair, and totally unremarkable teensy hotel room. Not okay. My honey calls down to the timeshare concierge to find out what the sam hill is going on, and after quite a bit of back and forth about what the package includes vis-a-vis what we were promised, she says she'll call her supervisor to find out what she can do. We head down to the bar to have an umbrella drink (you know, because we're on vacation in Hawaii and would like to enjoy ourselves at some point) and wait. And wait. And get glowered at by Secret Service. And wait some more. Then she calls back. Good news! She can upgrade us to something sort of vaguely approximating the type of room we were promised for the low low price of an additional 80 dollars a night! And because they're so very nice, they'll even waive the $100 fee they'd normally charge for changing the room type after check in! Yeeeeeeah no.So we go trundling over to her office (not actually having had our fruity beverages yet, mind you) to talk this out face-to-face. And she tells us that she's superduper sorry, but the saleslady was wrong, shouldn't have told us we'd be getting anything more than the most basic room, and basically that we need to suck it up and deal, the 80 buck upgrade is her best offer. We very calmly explain our position to her - this is not what we agreed to, not what we were promised, and not what we paid for. We're not paying extra because their people messed up. We're either going to get what we were promised or we're going to check out and go elsewhere (I've already called two other hotels) and dispute the charges from Hilton to our credit cards. She'll call her supervisor again. Okay, we'll go down to the beach and wait for her call. Oh, wait, we can't go to the beach. The beach is closed due to heightened security. Sigh. Okay, can she buy us a froofy tropical drink from the pool bar, then? WHAAAAAAT? In all her years she has NEVER had someone ask her such a thing! Sputter sputter well I never! She hands us $50 in ""Hilton Dollars"" to spend on the property. We head out the door. Wait, her colleague says! You know you can't use those for alcohol, right? Jesus mercy, people, I tell you what. So we finally have some relaxing libations in hand (the relaxing quality somewhat compromised by the beefy men with earpieces frowning at us from every angle) when she calls back. Fine, we can have the suite for no upcharge, but they're going to listen to the tape of our call with the saleslady and if they find out we're lying liars who lie, they're going to charge us an additional $60 dollars a night for the suite. Um, the suite you were trying to upgrade us to for EIGHTY bucks a night a few minutes ago? Before you wasted three hours of our vacation and then questioned our integrity? Yeah, that suite. Which did have a kitchen but only one bedroom - imagine if we actually HAD brought another couple! How embarrassing that would have been! The ONLY reason this is a 2-star review instead of one is because we did ultimately get (more or less) what we were promised and we cooked some delicious fish tacos in that kitchen out of a mahi-mahi I caught. I won't bore you with details of the timeshare presentation, but it, um, wasn't good. We didn't buy it. I know you're shocked. Also: it's been two weeks since they told us they were going to listen to the tape. We've heard nothing. Funny, that.","Berkeley, California",23,2.0

I could not book rooms this stay (later to find out because President Obama was staying in the Ali'i Tower during our stay)...so we were left to the other towers of the hotel. I booked the Lagoon Tower of the Hilton Hawaiian Grand Vacations Club. WOW!!! What a nice change! We have a 5 year old and this room was perfect for our family. We had a 1 bedroom which includes a separate living room with a pull out bed. It also has a FULL kitchen which is a blessing. Our one complaint in our past stays is that there are not many economical choices to eat in that area of Waikiki, with a full kitchen we were able to cook a little and warm up left overs. It saved a ton of money and time as were weren't waiting to be served at a restaurant. We just went up to our room and made food for ourselves. I think I will be booking this tower in the future instead of the Ali'i Tower. We still had access to all of the amenities of the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The other thing that was great is that it is near the new pool that has the water slides as well as the lagoon....which are both very popular with our son. The other thing that I really enjoyed is that they have free DVD's you can get from the lobby (which is not available at the Ali'i Tower) and free laundry services on each floor of the Lagoon Tower. Our room was on the 3rd floor facing the lagoon with a partial ocean view. Very great...felt part of the fun but also secluded in a good way. The only bad thing is that we did find a cockroach in the bathroom (which I killed) but we have stayed in the Ali'i Tower and my mother in law found the same thing there too! I did let the front desk know at the end of our stay and they did credit our hotel bill for the incident. This is the reason I rated the cleanliness of the hotel poor.

The cabinets in the kitchen and the bathrooms were painted MDF and looked like they came from a big box store. The wooden front door to the suite was scuffed and gouged which did not create a good first impression. Sheets and towels were basic grade (no Frette linens here!) and the bath amenities were unremarkable. The overall experience in the room was okay but nothing special. However, the staff members that we encountered on property were helpful and pleasant. What the Hilton Hawaiian Village has going for it is a fabulous location and gorgeous grounds.

Between the 3 the Lagoon Tower has the slightly better location but the other 2 maybe a bit nicer. I can't comment on the other 2. (The Waikikian is separate and seems much nicer than all of the other towers, including the hotel towers.)Very satisfied, good value (at about $250 for a one bedroom suite, which included internet) slightly more than the 4* hotels on Wakiki beach but you get a lot more for your money. If you can afford the Wakikian go there, otherwise, this is pretty good. Don't expect great ocean views, as the Dimondhead tower obstructs most ocean views, with the Dimonhead tower being a bit dated).The HHV seems to be only one of 2 (the other one is the Sheraton) properties with pools with slides for the kids, and in theory it's heated but I suspect they don't keep the pool temperature at little kid comfortable temperatures. They also allow non-guess, for a fee, to use the pool, which makes it very crowded at times. Parking is also a bit of a hassle, probably no more so than other Waikiki hotels, though.Location wise, arguably the best location on Waikiki is where the Royal Hawaiian and Duke's are, so the HHV is a bit far from that. However, it's not bad for families being a bit away from the really busy part of Waikiki.All in all, very satisfied.","Vancouver, Canada",22,5.0

We gave my wife's wedding dress to Hilton to steam on the day before our wedding to be ready for our special day. Instead of steaming it, they washed in in the washing machine, ruining it. They offered to get us a new dress and alter it to fit the same as the old. The seamstresses who were supposed to alter the dress were not familiar with wedding dresses and destroyed the new dress as well leaving us with a terribly fitting dress . Hilton agreed to compensate us for the dresses and fly us back to Hawaii to make up for the day they ruined and told us to enjoy the rest of our time on the Islands. Upon returning home, they denied ever making these promises. Do not stay at the property and patronize these people that have no integrity and do not make good on promises they make.

Excellent value staying in a 2 bedroom apartment rather than booking 2 rooms at a hotel. At 18 & 20 our children are too old to share a room with us!!! Having a living room and kitchen as well as bedrooms was fantastic!! There was a laundry on the same level as our room - not sure if they are on each level, but probably. The pool was very crowded, but you can use the other pools in the resort & the beach. There is also a lagoon. Easy walking distance to Ala Moana shopping centre. The GVS are on the edge of the Hilton complex, so the rooms on one side face the resort and the rooms on the other side (like ours) face the hotel across the road, but also the yacht club. The views are better than the Waikikian which is behind the GVS. Some rooms face the ocean - these of course would be more expensive. The Hilton Hawaiian Village has plenty of shops and restaurants but there are also more within walking distance. This is at the end of Waikiki beach, but only a 15 minute walk (along the beach path) to get the busy area of Wakiki shopping & nightlife. A quick tram or taxi ride if you don't want to walk. Would definitely stay here again if travelling with more than 2 people.","Perth, Australia",91,4.0

Everyone we interacted with were extremely friendly and helpful. The Bellman on check in and check out couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. The room: We had a 2 br suite, 17th floor, overlooking the marina and parking garage/luau. The room was much bigger than it looked in the pictures and we were very happy with it. There was plenty of space inside and out on the balconies. The kitchen had all the utensils we needed. The soft and chairs we comfortable. The bathrooms were nice. The carpets looked a bit dated, but considering how much sand and wet-feet they get on a regular basis, I thought they were fine. Amenities: We used the free laundry facilities and that worked well. The free wi-fi was great. We rented free DVDs from the machine in the lobby, which was nice. Activities: We visited the Paradise Pool at least once a day and my sons loved it. It is not heated, so it is cool at first, but we got used to it. Never had a problem finding a couple of loungers to drop our stuff. Saturday and Sunday it is definely much busier that during the week. We were excited about using the lagoon (as it was not useable the last time we were there) but it was cooler than the pool or beach, the sand is kind of hard and it seemed a little dirty (fish and birds use the lagoon too) for swimming. The beach was very easy and the sand was fun to play in. There is a band of jagged rocks about 5-10 yards out that are hard to walk on so we only visited the beach for swimming when the tide we up. The fitness center in the Kailea Tower was free for Lagoon guests and was nice.Restaurants and shops: The food is expensive in the restaurants and stores. We taxied to the Foodland at the Ala Moana Mall the first day and then mid-stay and stocked up on food for the kitchen. We ate in most meals, but did do Roundtable Pizza and CJ Deli. Both were good, but pricey. Something that might bother others, but we liked: the Luau on top of the roof of the parking garage happens Sun-Thur from 5:30 to 7:45pm. It is loud and can easily be heard from our room. We liked it, and used it as the soundtrack to our stay when it was going and watch from our balcony on many occasions. We had no desire to pay to see it, but it was fun watching from above. If you are looking for a quite Hawaiian get away...HHV is not the place for you.

Upon check-in, electricity was off in 3 of the rooms, and the smoke alarm was beeping (needed a battery). This was fixed within a couple hours. When getting ready for bed, we shut the drapes in the living room, opened the pull-out couch, and lo and behold, the room was literally swarming with flying insects, about 3/4 inch long, dropping their wings then falling everywhere. All surfaces were covered with insects! First call to front desk yielded a forward to housekeeping--we were told they were termites. Housekeeper arrived quickly and armed with vacuum and bug spray. Before she arrived, however, we had decided that we could not stay in this room! Even if it were fumigated, I didn't want my young children exposed to the spray. We're not talking a critter or two--they were hundreds, all over the room. We noticed pin-holes in the lampshades (which told us this wasn't new). The room needed serious attention. My call to the manager was blocked by a secretary (?) who wouldn't put me through.. Eventually after a few more calls, the Sunday night manager called back and agreed to come see the room and to look for another room for us. When she arrived and was shown all the dead bugs on the table (they had ceased flying by this time), she shrugged and said ""I'm sorry"". She got onto her computer at her desk, called us back, and offered us a couple options--none equal (or better) to our room. In fact, we were placed at a much lower level, which impeded our ""ocean view"" (that's a stretch even on the higher floor). We had to completely re-pack all our things, empty the fridge, and hike it all down--at bedtime for the kids (and in the middle of the Oscars, no less LOL). The second room had missing appliances (which we had in the first room), cracked mugs, a broken spring on the dishwasher. It was a mediocre condo (parallel to the first one)--only the barest essentials for one meal (needed to run dishwasher every meal--but not enough detergent), loose-handled skillets--no lids, cheap cooking utensils, etc. One of the 2 dryers on the floor was broken and not repaired the entire week.I suppose that it was certainly acceptable in a way, but we don't feel we got our value from our time-share ownership exchange. Our time-share is a ""#1"" rating--which means we usually get amazing condos wherever we go--usually the best available. And with a 8-month time-span, I wasn't expecting to get the ""last minute"" quality room (even the first room was a disappointment in that regard). And I was disappointed with the way management handled this--a shrugged ""I'm sorry"" was all that was offered. Maybe my disappointment would have been a little assuaged had we been given a token for our troubles--?meal coupons, ?fruit basket ?champagne ?whatever.

Bedroom: couldn't be smaller with only 2 drawers for clothing. Furniture doesn't fit, if you have allergies, beware. The system must be old and blows unhealthy & musty air. Opinion: Unit & Hallways shouts that the company has no money to renovate and update. If this represents Hilton vacation clubs, we will not be pursing anymore Hilton properties. Hallways: Dismal and very depressing. From the reviews I get a sense that there are towers that are modern with new appointments. Where?Service: After only being here one day, the service has been good but if how I feel when I enter the hallway and unit is any indication that your environment effects how you feel, this is a perfect example. Run the other way when booking or ask if it's been renovated.THE OPPOSITE OF elegant, cozy, romantic and charming. It's huge, not intimate and crazy with conventions.

The rooms are nicely decorated but lack the essential kitchen tools and hotel room amenities. When we arrived, our room smelled funny. The lamp next to the couch was broken, I called to report it and it was taken away but never returned to our room. The air conditioner sensor on the slider was broken off and no phone books...no biggie, just a pain to get taken care of. According to the ""sales person"" the people that purchase their program are given tons of fabulous extras...really? We never saw any of them; don't you think they would want to sell you by giving you the entire extent of what they have to offer?Tons of Asians were visiting while we were there so I can't say whether this is a standard, but according to the sales guy - this is the most popular property for the Japanese and they purchase for exclusive use and they are loyal patrons that pay top price.If you have kids and love to shop this is your place. But food options and restaurants are hard to find and be prepared to walk or take a taxi or bus to get to a ""normal"" grocery store; ABC Stores have most of the essentials but do not have good prices or good choices.Our room was facing the noisy, noisy city and no chance of changing to a partial or ocean view because that is a price upgrade and only if it is available, which it never is.

They didn't tell us the nature of the property or the fact we were booking a timeshare property. Our Diamond Honors status didn't gain us any sort of upgrades. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our stay in the Lagoon Tower, and it was roomy and nice with a kitchen, dining room, and living room. We had an ocean view room that faced the Rainbow Tower. The view was awesome. This property is huge! It looked like 5 floors od the adjacent Tapa Tower was under renovation, so you could hear construction starting around 9 AM. We shopped at ABC Store for food and convenience items. We also ate at Tropics a few times, and it is right on the beach. Expect to pay $16 for a hamburger or a chicken ceasar salad, and $10 for a cocktail. We grabbed takeout from the pizza place and the deli on the property. Both were really good.

The laundry facilities are not inside the condo but located near the elevators - but they are free.The front desk staff and concierge personnel were very helpful and friendly. We bought a 4 day bus pass (www.thebus.org) from ABC stores for $25 and we got our money's worth. There is a circle island bus (the 52 and 55 route) that will take you to all points on the north shore. We went to the Bonzai pipeline one day and watched a surf competition. It takes about 2 hours to get to the Sunset Beach area of north shore but we enjoyed seeing the countryside and not having to worry about driving. We could hop on and off the bus along Waikiki and didn't have to carry the correct change for the bus so I would recommend getting the 4 day pass if you plan to be there for 2 or more days. The hilton hawaiian village put on a free fireworks show on Tuesday night which was a nice surprise. People on this island are very friendly and willing to help out with advice and information. The main reason for our trip to Oahu was to visit Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial. We really enjoyed this part of our trip. We took the City bus to this location as well. It takes about an hour to get there from Hilton Hawaiian village and we arrived at 7 am in order to beat the crowds. Anyone who complains about the price of food or activities or the fact that there are alot of people here has obviously come here without doing their research.

There are 4 Towers in the ""village"". Grand Waikikan is the nicest and the newest. I recommend this Tower over the Coral, Kalia or Lagoon. If there is no availability at the Grand Waikikan then Lagoon Tower is my 2nd choice. Tip - you can watch the Hula show from your Lagoon Tower balcony.There are several pools and they are all small - kids galore so this isn't an intimate romantic property. The beach is public and it's fun to watch the surfers.IN the Kalia Tower As a Gold & higher level Hilton member you have free access to the 2nd level pool as well as the beautiful fitness center in the building. The Mandara spa on the 4th floor is a bit dated and it's a little odd to go to the steam and then have to jump in an elevator to have your service.

NOte: i don't recommend timeshares to anyone who only gets 2-3 weeks vacation/yr. But attend a sales presentation and get the perks - why not?A 20 minute cab ride from the airport was $35 in Oct. 2010. My favorite restaurant in the village is the ""Tropic Grill"" which is beachside with tiki torches and great tropical drinks.As a statesider, I don't vote this trip as a ""shopping trip"" but tons of Asians come just for that purpose and load up the elevators with their finds of the day. If you like Sushi, Waikiki has some wonderful little sushi places within walking distance. You probably don't need a car - there are shuttles, buses etc..

We were not familiar with the resort (it includes both a regular hotel as well as a timeshare - a total of 7 high rises) and as there was no one to ask, we followed the signs to check-in (quite a hike with all our luggage). Unfortunately the signs only pointed to the hotel checkin, not the timeshare component. As such we were directed to the timeshare checkin. After another long hike across the property with all our luggage we arrived at the timeshare, only to be told that we were at the wrong timshare building (each does its own checkin) and would need to go to our actual building to check in. After seeing the look on my face the lady behind the counter said that she would check us in and then called a bellhop with a golf cart to take us to our proper building. There should be explicit signs for the timeshare checkins!The first 3 days everything was fine - all up to Hilton standards. We were woken around 6 am on the 4th day by shouting / chanting / horns, etc and thought that it must be some college kids. When this did not stop we looked out the window (all our windows were shut but we could still hear the yelling through them) to see massive picket lines - all 1500 of the hotel emplyees were on strike for 5 days! Management tried to fill in for the striking employees with some success. Most of the activities / restaurants / bars etc were shut down as the hotel attempted to get outside staff to fill in. Guests had to make their own beds, change their own sheets and towels, etc. By the end of the 3rd day Hilton had managed to get outside housekeeing staff in though the hotel services including restaurant and bar services were still extremely liimited (there was no valet, room service, on-site luau etc). The most annoying thing was the 24 hour chanting / singing / bull horns, etc outside our building by the picketing strikers who obstructed all access to the resort by vehicle, letting in only a few vechicles at a time and then blocking the roadways again resutling in numerous delays. This chanting / shouting / horns kept waking us up throughout the nights as our unit faced right onto the road where the pickets were.Hilton knew that the employees were in a strike position but we were not made aware of it by any communication!

From our side of the building, we could not see the Friday night fireworks. You need to face the lagoon side if that’s important for you. The location is not right on Waikiki beach. You are just to the west of Fort DeRussy so it’s about 20 min walk to Waikiki or you would want to take the trolley.In our unit, we had a pull out sofa and a separate bedroom (relatively small). Only one bathroom to share. Full kitchen, but a bit small. Lanai was a good size and had a full ocean view. Since we were just above Paradise Pool, it is a bit noisy when the lanai door is open. We weren’t on the lanai too often so we didn’t mind this. The unit may have been updated in the past 5 years since it had nice décor. The bathroom fixtures (toilet, bathtub/shower) seem to be older. We had a leak in the toilet water tank which was fixed the next day for us. The room could have used more storage/closets as we could not store our 3 pieces of luggage into the closet. We had free wifi from our room and had no problems accessing it.Location was perfect for families. We are a family of 4 with 2 boys (aged 5 and 8).

NOTE: Kids must wear flotation device if they are shorter than a specific height (check the hotel website for the exact height). They sell cheap flotation vests or wings (at the pool/towel stand), but they seem pretty flimsy. I would recommend that you bring your own life vest if you have small kids. You can always use them on the beach and lagoon. We saw lots of kids line up for slides and then get turned away at the top because they did not have flotation devices. We felt very safe (ie. with our valuables and not having to watch our kids like a hawk) at Paradise pool as there are a number of security staff checking for room cards at the entrances as well as card operated gates. Towels were given out near the pool which you can keep and use at the beach, etc.We found that the pool got busier as the day went on. Due to the time change, we were up early anyways. We went down to the pool around 9am and were able to find lounge chairs. Since the Paradise pool is to the west of Lagoon tower, the pool and lots of chairs are in the shade in the morning. We would spend the morning at Paradise pool, go up to our unit for lunch, then went to the lagoon/beach in the afternoon. We found this really easy since our unit was just an elevator ride away. There are not any close restaurants to Lagoon pool (ie. no concession stands or sit down restaurants) unless you walk to the other side of the lagoon or go to the Rainbow Bazaar. Go to the hotel website for a full listing of restaurants.We also tried going to Super Pool. This pool is closer to food options, but it doesn’t have any slides/features. There are more chairs around this pool compared to Paradise Pool and this area gets more sun.NOTE: No pool toys are allowed in any of the pools. We noticed attendants enforcing this rigorously. Even throwing a small floating football is not allowed. You can do this at the beach or lagoon.The lagoon is nice if you want a calm place to swim and rent recreation items (very expensive). They even rent sand toys. I suggest you just buy your own at ABC or at any of the tower convenience stores and keep it for your trip. You might also want to buy a beach umbrella so you don’t have to rent one. There is no shade in the lagoon or beach areas. Beach is lovely, but has some rocks/coral in the water. The beach is quite calm. NOTE: Box jelly fish alerts may appear 8-10 days after full moon. You can check the Hawaii beach safety website to see the exact warnings each morning. They can’t really predict it, so if you can schedule your vacation around this time if you can. We noticed signs on the beach re: jelly fish even when the warning was no longer active on the website. Even when you can’t swim at the beach, there’s still the lagoon and pools. Lots of options… so no worries.For food, there are many restaurants within the village. Cheap options that we found include ABC (salads, sushi, cold noodles, sandwiches, Spam musubi, drinks), Japanese noodle restaurant in Rainbow Bazaar and CJ’s in Rainbow Bazaar had deli sandwiches, burgers, etc. These were pretty good. We went to one resort-owned restaurant, Tropics, for lunch. We were very disappointed by the food (burger was plain and dry) and was very expensive.Since the location is 10 min. walk to Ala Moana Centre, we went there twice for groceries and dinner. There is a Foodland in there for groceries and deli. We tried these cheap meal options at Ala Moana Centre: Shirokiya (mostly Japanese food); food fair; and an eating area outside of Sears auto centre that had Zippy’s Hawaiian food, Japanese food, bakery, donuts/muffins and Vietnamese noodles/sandwiches. Since it is a bit of a walk with groceries, we brought our backpack and carry-on bag on wheels to the centre. This was really helpful.Hilton is a great place as there is so much to do (or not do) and so many options. We didn’t end up enrolling our kids in Camp Penguin but this would be a good option if the adults wanted to do something on our own (eg. spa treatment or scuba diving). We really loved our week here. It was paradise. My 5-year old son said “I want to stay here forever!”","Vancouver, Canada",136,5.0

Also free Wi-Fi and gym usage for those staying in timeshare units. Worst: - expensive food/drinks in most restaurants onsite (although ABC Store is a reasonable option; -towel stands are only open 8-4:30 or 5pm so you have to save towels for evening swims.

We decieded to stay there because of the pictures that showed the Hilton as beautiful and the location with views. I was amazed at how beautiful everything was when we checked in....thought wow this will be a great vacation. Went up to our room 1614 in the Rainbow Tower :(.......and was very dissapointed at it. Now the view was beautiful and amazing. They had us in the Tapa Tower but, we wanted to up grade to a ocean view.....maybe we should of stayed in the Tapa.Room----needs some updating that is for sure. The bathroom has no fan, mold in ceiling, back of toilet had a crack in it, plug in the wall was not even screwed in the wall.....and couldnt adjust the shower head. The bathroom smelled for the entire week. There we stains on the wallpaper, the bottom drawer in the dresser had to be lifted up to be shut. I had to call down and ask for the cleaning lady to change our sheets on day 4......I mean you could clearly see that they needed to be changed but, I had to call.....did not vacuum the entire time either.The grounds were beautiful and there was alot to do. Between the pools, shops, beach...fish, birds, peguins and flamingos. We did have a view of the Luau for 5 nights which was nice. :)It was very pricey to eat there. We did eat at Noodles a Japanese little quick and cheap eatery. We had the pizza to it was very good. $10 for a mixed drink at the pool & had to wait for 30 min for my change....she didnt get a tip.The beach chairs were $15.71 to be exact.........it was worth it to me for one day of not getting sand blast on a beach towel. My husband rented a paddle board and used it in the Lagoon which was a very nice place to sit and swim.

The 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds , full kitchen was nice and clean. There was also a sofa sleeper in the living room. The odd numbers are ocean view rooms and the even numbers are mountain/city view rooms. I asked for an upgrade to an ocean view room but they couldn’t accommodate me. The mountain/city view is nice but nothing like waking up to an ocean view. We didn’t cook in the units but we made sandwiches. HHV units feel like hotel living with a full kitchen versus more of a condo living like we’ve been accustomed to with timeshare exchanges. We wish there was a BBQ grill area on the property. There are public grills at a little park next to the hotel. But we had everything needed in the room itself. A lot of people complain of this Tower being so far away from the beach and pools, but we didn’t find it to be a problem. It was perfectly located for us since we spent a lot of our time off property. There isn’t a washer/dryer in the units, but there is a laundry room down the hall that had 2 apartment size washers and dryers. Only one of the dryers ‘worked’ and after an hour of drying, I removed our clothes and let them air dry in the room because they were still very damp. The washers did not spin well and left the clothes very WET. I would have been willing to pay to use a full size properly working washer and dryer. I didn’t take my laptop because previous reviews said that we would be charged for internet access. But when I checked in, the receptionist was going to give me the code to get internet access. She also said that we were able to use the fitness center as well. So it looks like only timeshare visitors have free internet access and fitness center usage.This is a large resort, so you should view a map and try to familiarize yourself with the layout of the resort. There are plenty of small pools on the property and the pool in our tower was the least crowded pool. As big as this property is, there should be at least one ‘adult only’ pool or one pool that’s 6 feet. We only visited the Paradise pool and the pool in the Kalia Tower. We really couldn’t enjoy the Paradise pool because they were extremely crowded and this was NOT during their most busiest time. We tried to enjoy the hot tub, that had a sign posted ‘max 9 people’, it was easily 20 people in there at one time. Parents were letting their kids JUMP in with their floaters. I spent most of my time ‘sun bathing’ at the pool while the rest of the family was in the pool or hot tub. We didn’t have a big problem finding chairs there. The only activity we participated in was the Lei making that cost $10 each. It was a nice! We also rented the aqua cycles at the Lagoon for $21 for 30 minutes. That was fun!There are many high end stores (Louis Vuitton, etc) on the property and within walking distance. We often visited the ABC store on the property. From reading previous reviews, we were already prepared to eat off property but ate at one property restaurant on the day of the fireworks. It was perfect because we got on the waiting list at the Tropics Bar & Grill around 6:45p; our table became available right as the firework show started. We were seated on their outdoor patio and were able to see the fireworks! We had several meals at Wailana Coffee House that is directly across the street from HHV. Highly recommended, especially for their pineapple pancakes with coconut syrup!! We also tried Due Divino restaurant that is around the corner from Wailana. I would not recommend this place. There is a nice lady standing in front of HHV every day handing out menus with a 10% coupon. I don’t mind eating at ‘hole in the wall’ type of places if the food is good. But this place sucks! I think it is suppose to be an Italian restaurant, but we went for breakfast. The waitress couldn’t tell me what the ‘black swirls’ were in my scrambled eggs. The lady who was passing out the coupons on the corner came in the restaurant serving customers without ever washing her hands. Then she cupped the rim of my glass to refill my drink with her bare hands. I was ready to walk out at that point.We rented a car for a few days from the airport on the day we arrived and dropped it off at the Hyatt location, which is walking distance to HHV. Of course we did not use the highly priced parking facility at HHV but opt to park at the public parking lot between HHV and the Marina. It’s a 24 hour limit parking lot at .25 cents an hour!! That saved us quite a bit of money! We never had a problem finding a spot either. We used Star Taxi to return to the airport on the day of departure. It cost $28 for 3 people with luggage.We walked to Kalalkaua Ave , either the street path or beach path, just about every day that we didn’t have a car. There are MANY stores and restaurants along this strip. We also took a scenic ride on the ‘pink line’ Trolley which drop off at HHV. The ‘pink line’ took us through Waikiki and to Ala Moana shopping center. During the few days we rented a car, we visited Pearl Harbor, Dole Plantation and the North Shore (twice). We went to the North Shore both ways. We tried to go to Hanauma Bay beach to snorkel but by the time we got there (9:30a), it was full and they weren’t letting anyone in. So we headed up to the North Shore. Going to the North Shore from this way, you can really enjoy the beautiful ocean scenic route. We stopped along the way and took a lot of pictures. We did a little shopping in the Haleiwa Historic area and had lunch at Giovonni Shrimp truck.Overall, we had a great time and can’t wait to go back to Hawaii.","Ann Arbor, Michigan",40,4.0

The pool/slides right outside of Lagoon Tower, the lagoon, the superpool and the beach all sum up to be the most spacious of all hotels in Waikiki, and it's not even close. So even when it's busy, Hilton absorbs the crowd well.The food - only ate in the resort once for lunch at The Tropics Bar & Beach Café, Hilton is not known for it's food.The shopping - although there are plenty of shops within the resort, the main shopping is offered on the proper Waikiki strip or at Ala Moana mall.All in all, a very pleasant stay for the price with lots to do for my kids.Few recommendations: the beach umbrella and chairs are not free at beach, I believe Umbrella is $30 and chairs are $25 per day. I recommend going to Don Quijote and purchasing rather than renting if you are there for a week with family. If you have rental car, there might be better offerings than Don Quijote.If you are planning to venture out to other beaches within the island, get fresh beach towels the night before and take them on your trip, just make sure to bring them back.Some musts if you have kids: Hanauma Bay, the very best snorkeling spot for families, this place enlightened my kid in terms of snorkeling and variety of fish offered for viewing.Waimea Bay Beach, rent a boogie board at the local surf shop if you don't have one, relatively safe for kids to experience boogie boarding right on the shore. Don't think you know what Hawaiian waves are after spending a week at Waikiki.Laniakea Beach, check out the turtles sunbathing, not the easiest place to find with no signs but if you drive from Waimea Bay Beach toward the Haleiwa Proper, it will be on the way, look for cars parked on both sides of the road.Saturday Farmer's Market at Kapiolani Community College, place not only to pick up fresh local produce/fruits but also to try various local cruisine.Sunset Dinner - if you can afford it, Orchid's at Halekulani, book reservation with outside seating next to House without a Key where they have live music and hula dancing[check for schedule although they have on most nights], where else can you have fine dining, outdoor seating with sunset, live music and hula dancing? food is secondary.","Seattle, Wa",35,4.0

We also liked having the dining and shopping options of the village nearby for those days we just stayed at the hotel to enjoy the beach and pools.The location is great because you have Waikiki beach - warm and calm - outside your door. Ala Moana's shopping/dining is walkable in one direction while the Waikiki restaurants (e.g Keo's) are walkable in the other.

When we arrived we were told that there was no upgrades available even though I am a diamond member and was told earlier in the week that one would be available. A couple more things happened (which included a SWAT team, cockroaches and a horrible view) so we decided to check out of the DoubleTree and pay the $189 a night at the Hilton Grad Vacation Club. When we arrived I realized that the room I booked was a studio room in the Lagoon Tower. The room was basically the same (non-upgraded) room at the DoubleTree. The only difference was the overall atmosphere of this hotel. This hotel is right on the water and it has all the conveniences that we desired. The room had a kitchenette but we never used it since we found a cockroach on the counter when we walked in. The pool and lagoon at this hotel were great and the VIP lounge was nice for breakfast. I found out later that next door is the Ilikai (?) and it has full condos for less of a price than I paid at the Hilton.

The Ala Moana Shopping Center is only a 15-20 minute walk from the resort. There's a bunch of very nice shops and a huge food court, with some great eats. Duke's Lagoon was great for the little kids to snorkel and see some fish. It is a few degrees colder than the ocean, but not all that bad. The beach was fun. There are some areas where the beach is quite rocky but there is a place close to the Port Hilton pier where the sand is very nice. Snorkeling was alright. It's not Belize, but for Waikiki beach Hawaii, it was quite nice. A nice variety of fish were seen. Pools were great for the most part. Superpool was fun for the kids. The Paradise pool is heated, so the first several days it was very nice. Then the furnace broke. The water became quite chilly, but not unbearable. Overall, we had a great time. It was just a little too busy, being that it was Honolulu. We prefer the relaxing atmosphere of Hilton @ Waikoloa. But the HHV resort was lots of fun.","Portland, Oregon",6,4.0

We live here in Hawaii and both of our stays were because of a function that we attend yearly in one of the ballrooms. The first time we stayed, we were in the Rainbow Tower and it was fantastic! We had an ocean front/ Diamondhead view. The room was up-to-date and full of upgrades that you would expect at this price range. Downside - we could hear everyone leave their rooms in the morning because the doors slam extremely loudly. Otherwise, very happy. However, for our second stay, they put us in the Tapa Tower and it was not great. The room was out-dated and dark. Our view was all of the surrounding towers and the street below - I think this is considered 'resort view'. The only good thing about this room was the bed (so comfortable).

Our 1 bed suite was on the 7th floor of the lagoon tower-and it was lovely! We enjoyed the clean huge kitchen, dining area - well equipped with a bigger plasma than we have at home! The view was stunning over the lagoon and out to the Pacific and everything you expect from a 4star room was there-comfortable beds, good shower water pressure, good black-out curtains, good soundproof door onto the hall (or maybe the other guests were just quiet and thoughtful?) under-utilised laundry available night and day and obliging staff.There was somthing for everyone at the HHV, my daughter enjoyed the kids club-the activities and excursions were really fun, and the ratio of carers to children was good. The water canoes and paddleboats on the lagoon were fun(a little pricey though) the water slide pool was great (and heated too). We also did the submarine trip, fireworks and watched the various animal feedings! For adults, the 10 minute walk to the Ala Moana shopping centre was really convenient, and the trolley buses at the front of the resort made it great for touring further afield.

We refused to accept it and were transferred to another room with a view of the pool/marina/street. We were a group of five, including my parents and our 3 yr old son, and had the 2 bedroom unit. In two weeks we didn't leave the resort more than a dozen times, they have everything you need. The Lagoon tower pool with waterslides is great, pool staff were super, truly friendly and great with kids. The age group around the pool/slides was from 1-80, mostly families. We had no difficulties getting chairs around the pool no matter when we showed up, presumably as we were there during the pre-Christmas lull. The saltwater lagoon is beautiful but colder than the ocean so we didn't spend much time in it. Went to Wal-Mart & bought snorkeling gear and spent several mornings snorkeling around the pier. All in all a great experience. The single negative I would have is related to the pricing of everything inside the resort. Hilton must charge incredible rent for restaurants/shops as a meal for five often came to $300+. We ate at several restaurants and all of them were great except for Sergio's Italian Table. We waited ages in a half full restaurant for mediocre food, waited longer for drinks, only to be told to wait for approval to charge the meal to our room - all we did was wait - it didn't happen anywhere else so just steer clear of the joint. Otherwise you're in good hands. Especially at Benihana's, the ice cream parlor, CJ's for breakfast, and dinner/drinks at the Tropics Bar & Grill. The music at Tapa Bar is hit & miss.

Housekeeping did an excellent job each night and I felt really comfortable in my home-away-from-home for the five nights that I stayed. The animals on the property were really cool, and I loved seeing the flamingos on my daily walks around the grounds. On the day of my checkout, I was encouraged to take advantage of a complimentary courtesy room, as my flight was not scheduled until late that evening. I signed up at the front desk for a room at 6 p.m. At five of, I simply picked up a room key at the front desk and had access to a clean, stocked guest room for half an hour. It was so nice being able to take a quick shower and change clothes in a comfortable, private room before my departure.My only issue with the hotel was the quality and price of the food and beverage options. I had a grilled chicken salad and diet coke that cost $15 (plus tax and tip) at the poolside grill one afternoon. The salad had obviously been refrigerated for some time and the chicken was barely edible-- certainly not hot off the grill as I was expecting. The two other times I ate at the hotel were for breakfast. On both occasions, I had an egg white omelet with hash browns, toast and coffee, and each meal was easily over $30, including tax and tip. It's always expensive to eat out while traveling, but compared with prices at home, the markup was around 100%, which is not acceptable. I had far less expensive meals at the more glamorous, non-chain hotels further down the beach.

The room was lovely and so was the view; and, even more importantly, our king-sized bed was very comfy. Although we were only there one night, we arrived early that afternoon to enjoy some sun and relaxation by one of the 3 pools. Since we were located in the Tapa Tower and the Tapa pool was not as crowded as the Super Pool, we decided to lounge at the Tapa pool. It was a nice, quaint pool by the Tapa Bar. The only disappointment was the lack of drink and food service. Unlike other resorts, there were no servers servicing the pool for drinks or food. You needed to get your own drinks at the Tapa Bar and walk all the way to the Super Pool area to get food. It took me over 20 minutes to get 2 drinks at the Tapa Bar. Then, it took me another 30 minutes to walk to the Super Pool area, wait in line, and purchase a Caesar Salad. This took almost an hour out of my relaxation time by the pool. Perhaps, the lack of service by the pool is due to the Hilton Hawaiian Village being so vast with 6 towers and 3 pools, but when I go to a resort, I much prefer to pay tips to the serving staff and maximize my relaxation time.  Of course, the upside to the vastness of the Hilton Hawaiian Village is the choice it offers. It has a multitude of good restaurants and shops and is located on Waikiki beach.

The room was nicely decorated and we liked the floor plan with a counter and refrigerator across from the large closet. The only drawback was a fairly small bathroom, but it was functional and attractive. The grounds of the Hilton are spacious and attractive, with lots of nooks and crannies to sit in the shade or to watch the flamingos, penguins, other birds, and koi. Our first dinner was at the Tropics bar and grill right on the beach, and we fell in love with the location; the view was superb, the setting was casual, and the food was ggod (as were the lava flows!). We didn't eat at the expensive restaurant, but found plenty of less pricey but good restaurants at the Rainbow Bazaar across from the main lobby.

Check in was fast and we even got in our room early. The room was spacious, the view spectacular. Full kitchen came with a cheap dishwasher that was jammed with a chopstick. (So that's why it didn't clean very well) I didn't charge them for the repair. the rice cooker and blender were a nice touch. More options for cooking in because we spent soooo much more on this place than the other hotel that we stayed at in the area. Soaps for the kitchen along with laundry soap were provided. We didn't use the free laundry facilities because they had that musty smell that front loaders get when left closed. After smelling a couple of musty guests in the elevator, I didn't want to take a chance.The bathroom also had a musty odor. Maybe the shower curtain. But besides the slight smell (my husband didn't notice it but he's a man) the bathroom was clean with the exception of a bit of mold toward the top of the shower stall. We were promised daily housekeeping but they didn't show up after the first night. No problem though as there were plenty of towels and amenities.This is a great property if you are looking for a resort atmosphere. The lagoon was nice and the beach is the cleanest in Waikiki. Not as much riffraff as you sometimes find on tourist beaches.The grounds can be loud with the luau and all but things quiet down early and a nice romantic walk on the grounds by tiki light is recommemded. Pizza was expensive but good. Pair a small one with a salad to share to keep the cost down and the bikini fitting better. Primer drinks from ABC on the lanai will help keep the bar tab down.They make it so you never have to leave. But if you do, rent your car someplace other than the Hertz onsite. We decided on that rental for a bit more money because we thought that it would be more convenient than walking a couple of blocks. Wrong. The agent was hard to understand. The cars were hard to find.They offered no help in the parking facility. Had a heck of a time finding the secret entrance to the fifth floor for return. Had nobody to check us in. No clear directions to the drop box and they charged us more than agreed on.This would probably be my first choice for lodging in Waikiki if cost was not a factor.

Travelling from the UK to Hawaii is a long journey...but we stayed in the Hilton for 7 nights. My first impression of the hotel is that is was vast! There are lots of rooms and various towers. As we were honeymooners we did get an upgraded room (with a sea view) and champagne in the room.The hotel room itself was lovely, it was very spacious with a good size bed and a nice bathroom. The pool and the lagoon on the hotel site were great, food and drink are very expensive in the hotel so we tended to eat outside of the hotel for our meals.I do have to say that Oahu was not quite what I had expected, if you are expecting to stay on a secluded island then you will be disappointed! There are lots of high rise buildings in waikiki - mainly hotels. There has clearly been a lot of money spent on the resort with lots of high end designer shops and good choices of restaurants.One thing i would avoid if i travelled there again would be to steer clear of organised trips. We spent too much time on coaches and not enough time soaking up the sun and surf. We also took a trip to the 'Big Island', this would have been fine if we had been staying longer but it was a very long day. The tour was a bit boring to be honest, we had been sold the trip by the rep at the hotel as being able to see live volcanoes - which we did but it took us hours to get there and we could only see them from a distance!I would recommend a trip to the Luau party - this was great! Its a bit tacky but you really get a feel for some of the traditions of hawaii.Overall, this was a nice hotel but it was a long way to travel and we feel slightly disappointed with Hawaii as a destination as it is much more commerical than we had expected.",Lancs,3,4.0

Great for kids and families, tons to do, lazy river, water slides, great restaurants and activities. Our experience was not so great. The room was beautiful and the grounds impeccable but the staff and the service left a LOT to be desired. Room service food sat out in the halls for hours on end, the valets were no where to be found when you needed your car, the driveway was too crowded and you had to wait a long time to get in to a valet and there were not enough available to park the number of cars coming in and out, the front desk staff was slow to wait on you and did not smile, it required several calls to housekeeping to get laundry detergent for the room, the activities desk did not have schedules for the whole facility and could not arrange your participation you had to walk across the whole complex and sign up in a binder, the activities schedule was VERY limited and limited only to certain days of the week, the food at the restaurants was ridiculously over-priced, the ""lazy river"" and ""water slides"" were a joke - very small and uneventful and children under 12 (even proficient swimmers) were required to wear those blow up arm flotation devices which conveniently they sold there by the pool, and there were not nearly enough seats for around the pool - you had to wait hours to get an open chair.

We had a 3 bedroom on the Penthouse Floor (24). We were assigned to room 2465. This unit consists of 3 bedrooms and 3 ½ baths. The living, dinning and kitchen were located downstairs. There was a ½ bath located adjacent to the front door. Downstairs by the staircase is a master suite with a balcony facing the Rainbow Tower / Diamond Head. This master suite had a bathroom designed for a disabled person. Upstairs were another master suite along with a third bedroom and bathroom. There was plenty of room for four adults and one child. It should be noted that the third bedroom was kind of loud due to the fact that it had plantation shutters for “windows”, which allowed for downstairs noise to come in. Also the A/C was strong, but the fan noise was kind of loud. The unit was clean and nicely decorated. It had all the essentials. There were only a few quirky things such as in the third bedroom, the battery compartment lid on the TV remote was missing. Also, they only give you one tiny bottle of shampoo per bathroom. Granted there is midweek cleaning, however with being at the beach one would need at least two to three of the hotel sized bottles. The washer/dryer were not in the rooms. They are next to the elevators on the even floor rooms. No detergent or softeners were provided. (We brought our own) The directions were in Japanese. Kitchen appeared to be well stocked with cooking pots and pans. We didn’t cook. We ate out mostly and ate some leftovers in the room. Check in was smooth. They provided us with wrist bands to get towels and use the pools. One wrist band allows you to get two pool towels. They assessed us $9.23 a day for tax to stay at the HHV. The total for seven days was $64.61. Add $30 a day for valet parking. ($25 / day if you self park) The lagoon pool was great for the kids. They had a toddler water slide, two kids slide (which only one was working) and a larger slide for the big kids and adults. It was hard finding chairs to sit down or put our towels/ items down. It took about 5-10 minutes each time, scoping for a open chair or waiting for someone to leave. One more thing, if your child is under 48 inches, whether they swim or not, they need to have floaters on the arms. They won’t let you go down the mid/lg slide without them. Bring your own or you can pay $5 where you get the towels. The slides close at 5 PM each day. Valet Parking was hit and miss. Sometimes they were quick, other times they were slow. There didn’t appear to be any rhymn or reason. Most of the time when I returned to the HHV, there was no one to greet me. I had to walk up to the valet desk and tell them I’m returning the car. There was a more mature Asian male behind the valet desk most of the time. I think he’s the lead valet or supervisor. You’ll know him because he’s the bald guy. Customer service is not his forte. He never smiles or says anything. Overall, I’m very happy with our stay at the HHV. Most of the staff was cordial and professional. To be able to watch the Friday night fireworks show from the balcony was outstanding. Very rarely does it get any better than that.

Our stay was a result of a VIP package that was purchased after attending a time share presentation in Las Vegas. I thought since I wanted to come to Hawaii anyway why not do it thru this program. I probably could come up with a lot of cons to doing it this way if I thought about it but the ones that come to mind are just the frequent calls to offer you more stuff and ask you by more points, etc. And then I was still required to attend a 90 minutes presentation here in Hawaii which I really didn't want to do because I knew I would be wasting the rep's time in addition to my time since I knew I would not be purchasing the timeshare. The gentleman that I met with the 90 minute presentation was nice and I think he kind of sensed from the beginning that I was not going to purchase the timeshare. I don't understand the concept. I have stayed in very nice places when I've traveled and I never spend the money that they calculate that I will spend on vacations over a prescribed time period. For the people that timeshares works for I say great but for me I don't see the value. For my cons those would be the most significant two. Everything else was a positive. The Grand Wakikian was beautiful and well appointed. We stayed in a 2 bedroom/2 bath unit with a view of the ocean. We could see it well enough from the balacony of our condo on the 19th floor. Everything about the room was lovely. If I was to complain about anything it would be that the kitchen did not seem to be as well stocked as some of the other condo type places that I've stayed. Which was fine I guess since we did not plan on doing much cooking at all if any. The washer and dryer took a long time to both wash and dry a small load of clothes. I personally have never heard of the brand but I know I would never buy one based on my experience during this vacation. Otherwise things were very nice. Things are expensive in Honolulu period and they are certainly expensive around the Hilton Hawaiian Village. You are within walking distance of lots of things and places to eat. The bus stop is near by and you can take it almost anywhere on the island. We purchased some grocery items from Foodland which is a short walk or bus ride from the hotel. We walked there once and and caught the bus another time when went back to the mall the food store is located in. The Walmart is about 2-3 blocks from the mall and if we had known that before shopping at Foodland, we would gone there because most of the stuff we got from FoodLand we could have got from Walmart a little cheaper. I forgot my manual toothbrush and brought one at first from Foodland for $4.50, only to go to a drug store upstairs called Long Drug store and found Oral B twin packs for $1.99. I ended up with 4 toothbrushes for the price of one. We went on a few tours since it was our first time here in Honolulu. The tours were not that expensives but unless you have your own car or want to ride the bus it make sense to see most of the things by using the tours. Most of the things were pretty far out and while the bus did go to most of them it would have taken twice if not three times the time as most things were far out. We went to the Polynesian Culture Center it was nice but I don't know if I would do the meal there again, the food was not good. It was passable but I would have just as soon packed a sandwich in my bag. We went to a luau at Germaine's again the food was just passable. But the shows at both places were nice. We also went on a tour that included Pearl Harbor and what is called the Circle Island tour. The visit to Pearl Harbor was an informative and solemn experience. The circle island tour took you around the whole island, with stops at various points of interest. It was a great opportunity to see more of the island than we would have seen otherwise. Te cabs are very expensive for even a short ride. We did that once just because we did not know how close the bus stop was and we had the groceries to bring back and some things were perishable. We learned the bus route quick after that short ride for $10. The people we encountered were very nice. When I first arrived I was not impressed with what I saw starting with the airport and the ride from from the airport to the resort. The morning put a whole new shine on the picture. I could see the ocean....just beautiful. I think I will come again to enjoy the ocean and try some of the water activities that I really did not take advantage of this time around.","Bowie, MD",16,5.0

We are not owners here. We enjoyed the perks of being Elite travelers with HGVC, and we enjoyed the room and Oahu in general. We also enjoy the location of the hotel down the beach and away from the crazyness of the center of Waikiki. We found a way to exit the hotel by turning left and driving around the Ilikai past the marina and turning left onto Ala Moana Blvd. This is necessary until they turn on the light for the Grand Waikikian and the Lagoon towers.However, in the past we've stayed here at the Tapa Tower in a regular room and thought the facility was overcrowded and the pools (especially the super pool) unapproachable. We were encouraged by the news that the lagoon between the Lagoon and Rainbow towers was going to be renovated and a new pool called the Paradise Pool was being built. Back in 2006 when we heard this news, we were excited.After fully experiencing the Paradise Pool in all its ""glory"", we can say we are no longer thrilled. Our rooms were on the west side of the hotel and gave us a wonderful sunset view opportunity but most of our view was of the Ilikai next door. We could see McGarrett's balcony very clearly as we were on the 18th floor. We could also hear the pool noise as the sound travels up the side of the building very well, just like a sound barrier on the highway. Since we were hardly in the rooms during the day this was not a real problem. And on our last day we could sit on the balcony and take video of our teenagers in the pool.Our biggest complaint is the ""reservation"" situation that seems to happen as guest line up at 6am to reserve blocks of chairs when the pool officially opens at 8am, only to leave for the morning to sightsee and guaranteeing a seat when they return in the afternoon. Then when they tire of their sought after seats later in the afternoon, the towels are left there in a wet heap making it difficult for a late afternoon guest to know if the chairs are being used.The pool offers very little shade as well and my chief complaint is with the hotel management and their use of the lovely newly renovated lagoon. The lagoon area offers umbrella and chair rentals from 8am to 4:30pm. Most of our swimming happened after 3. The chair rental is $15/chair, the umbrella is $20 (I think). That's $45 for a comfortable chair and shade on a very very sunny and hot stretch of beach with no other shade for 90 minutes. And at 4:30, those chairs and umbrellas are politely yanked out from under and over you. So, traveler beware, if you have sensitive-to-the-sun skin like mine or just want a cool place to relax and enjoy the sounds and sights of Waikiki beach, bring your own chair and umbrella to the Lagoon at HHV. Other pool related complaints: On our last night (Friday night), the kids wanted to go over to the original super pool but when we walked over there for a quick swim it was already closed. This must have been after 4:30 because the lagoon chair and umbrella that we had was taken away and we wanted to see if we could find a bit of shade over at the super pool. However, since it was Friday the pool was closed to make way for the weekly festivities. So we walked back over to the Paradise pool, got lucky finding ONE chair and the kids slid themselves silly.The other sort of negative is only negative because we had no idea what time it was when it happened. We knew about the fireworks but we had no idea what it was going to be like from the hotel room. If we ever stay here on a Friday night again, we will be sure to be somewhere else and not in the hotel room. Since our hotel room faced away from the fireworks, we saw them reflected in the Ilikai next door.***** Here's what happened. We were just settling down after eating leftovers for dinner. We were all puttering around packing up and cleaning up. We heard this really LOUD BOOM and I thought a bomb had gone off. That was followed by more and more and we realized what it was so we went out onto the balcony to experience it in reflection off the Ilikai next door. But it was loud and the sound ricocheted off of all the buildings magnifying it. When the finale went off, the sound was so sudden and so loud that my 16 year old son jumped into the slider bumping his nose and forehead in the process of trying to get away from the noise. This was an instinctual fight or flight response. We figured since we were on the 18th floor we were probably pretty darn close to the reports of the exploding display. On a positive note, we were treated very well by all the staff. Requests were handled very promptly; from extra towels to the valet for the car. We were asked several times if we needed directions as we retrieved our car from the valet. The 2bdrm/2bath is extremely roomy reserving space for the bedrooms by not over-inflating the bathroom size which was standard hotel room sized and ample and nothing special unlike the bathrooms at Kings' Land and Kohala suites on the Big Island.On a final note, the Paradise Pool needs a pool bar and snack bar. This was my husbands biggest complaint. He couldn't get an overpriced drink while lounging at the pool and his dream vacation experience is not to have to walk across the street to get a takeout pizza. Seriously, we've been up to the Turtle Bay (which was a Hilton property and should never have been sold in my opinion, but I guess Hilton wanted to focus on Waikiki and the Big Island), and one of our fondest memories is spending a VERY relaxing 6 hours by the pool simply watching the kids play in the pool and slide on the waterslide and then come out, say their hungry and order some lunch to eat by the pool. And the view, OMG, what a place. But we can't use our Vacation Points there. Oh, Well.All in all, we enjoy the location of HHV but will know in the future not to expect much from the amenities. I have sent a review to HGVC because I believe in sharing my raves and rants with the hotel management instead of JUST raving and ranting here on TA.","Morris County, New Jersey",62,4.0

It's on the edge of the property, but that's a good thing, as it has its own valet entry away from the busier main entry to the village. So it's a decent walk to the beach frontage or shops, but it's closer to the shopping street and Marina parking. Parking rates recently increased to $24 self, or $30 valet--- steep! The self parking garage can be a dreadful zoo, especially on weekends. We valeted a few days, and parked at the adjacent Marina on other days. The Marina parking is a bargain at $6/day! The catch is that finding a space can be challenging on weekends (though it was pretty easy on weekdays). Also, it doesn't work well if you come and go every hour, or don't know when you'll be leaving (you have to choose the duration of your parking slip, and after you leave it becomes unusable), and I wouldn't want to park there very late at night (I think the cars are fine, and it's patrolled, but I wouldn't want to hang around there). We planned well and saved about $150 in parking fees. The pools are great at the village, and the newly built pool next to the Grand Waikikian and Lagoon Tower has several nice slides and waterfalls. But even though the resort was not packed all week, it seemed that the new pool was always crowded during the day. Getting a lounge chair meant arriving close to the 8am open time. Instead, we chose to swim at the lagoon and the private beach. The saltwater lagoon is great for kids. The water is calm, and you can rent pedal boats and kayaks (for about $34/hr, which is outrageously expensive, but most kids only need one hour). The lagoon sand is oddly gritty. Umbrellas are equally expensive, about $30+ per day plus tip, but a necessary luxury (the umbrellas are nice, heavy-duty, and they do all the work, digging a hole and planting it so it doesn't blow away). The beach has decent, soft sand and smallish waves (it's semi-protected from the harsh Hawaiian waves), again, perfect for kids. We didn't eat much on the property, mostly buying food at the ABC stores (we hit about five of the seemingly hundreds in Honolulu), and at the excellent Accents convenience mart downstairs in the Grand Waikikian. This store has a great variety of drinks and prepared food, including fruit and desserts, as well as coffee and sundry items. We usually stay at boutique hotels, but we really enjoyed our time at this mega-resort property. Having small kids makes convenience and comfort a priority, and this property delivers both, along with a beaches, pools, food, shopping, and so on...","South Pasadena, California",199,4.0

We reserved a 2 bedroom plus and also a Studio since we had friends traveling with us. We had just come from an absolutely fantastic 6 night stay at the Big Island's Waikoloa Beach Resort (also a HGVC property). At check-in we should have had a clue that this property doesn't do anything special for Elite Premiers like almost all of the other HGVC properties do, because the clerk told us the parking fee ($30 per night for valet, or $26 per night for self-park) would not be waived. We explained that it has been waived at all other properties since we became Elite Premiers and she said something about how they are trying to discourage guests from bringing cars since public transportation is available. Our studio room was right beside the elevators and we noticed the noise of the elevators right away. We also noticed the noise of the A/C unit which ran constantly or not at all. Our friend finally decided the A/C noise was preferable to the elevator noise, but said it sure wasn't ideal. The studio, other than the noise, was well appointed with a microwave, small refrigerator, coffee pot and a few dishes and sink. The bed was a king and there was a small table with a couple of chairs along with an easy chair. The pillows on the bed were foam. Towels were the small hotel variety. There was a tub/shower combo. There is a free laundry room (two washers an two dryers) on each floor and the machines appeared to be good ones. Our 2 Bedroom unit was on the 18th floor with a nice ocean view from the lanai. The unit was a decent size and looked good at the beginning. However, the foam pillows on the king bed in the master bedroom and on the beds in the 2nd bedroom were old and awful. The master bath was a tub/shower combo (having just come from an HGVC on the Big Island with a fantastic huge tub and a very large walk-in shower this was a real step down!). There was a single sink in the bathroom area along with TWO towel sets. If we'd been there for more than the two nights we stayed, extra towels would have been great. And, a newer, larger-size towel would have been nice. These are things we've gotten used to HGVC resorts. The full kitchen was well appointed and had everything we needed, except a dishwasher that worked. The soap dispenser was broken so you got a lot of soap at the start and then none later. It didn't quite do the job. The door to the lanai had a trigger thin area that the closed door needed to be in for the A/C to work. If you have the lanai doors open, the A/C goes off, which is a good thing. However it was a very tricky deal to get the door positioned just exactly in the right spot to get it to come back on. The location of the Lagoon Tower is excellent and is right in the middle of the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Pools are adequate and well kept. Pool chairs are another matter. Supposedly you can't reserve a chair before 8 AM and if you aren't there right at 8, you will not be in the race to place a towel or personal property on a chair. There's not requirement to ever be sitting in that chair and herein lies the problem. We saw so many people putting towels on chairs and then not returning for several hours. It would seem to be a good idea to have the towel guys make a round of the chairs every hour or so and keep an eye on unused, but reserved, chairs so they could be given to those waiting for a place to sit. We've seen this done elsewhere and it works very well.Bottom Line: This property needs to be remodeled. The General Manager did call us in answer to an email we wrote him and said that this would be happening next year. He said Housekeeping had just decided to go with the foam pillows instead of the feather pillows most Hilton properties use. We said this wasn't a good decision on their part. They are awful. The manager was apologetic about the noisy studio and the parking fees and did compensate us for the parking. We would really rather compliment a property than complain, but this one just wasn't up to par. We did appreciate the manager's attention to our concerns but still decided to check out a day early.","Highlands Ranch, Colorado",81,2.0

Upon arrival the check in line was pretty long, but the check in counter was fully staffed. The person checking us in took a lot of xtra time selecting our rooms which was pretty difficult becuase they were sold out. He managed to get us 2 connecting rms on one floor and 2 connecting rms on another. I was so impressed! We were all in the Tapa Tower which is in the center on the village, there is a band that plays every night at the bar in the tower which you can hear from your rm, but the music stopped by 11pm.The week we were there we kept seeing on tv that a hurricane was coming. HHV was featured as one of the hotels getting ready so that they could take care of their customers, but after talking to several employees there was no real plan and no info was given to us. Our flight was cancelled and the hotel couldn't accomodate us so we moved to the Outrigger Reef down the street. it was a much smaller hotel, but very nice and they did have a letter in each rm with helpful hints. I wish the HHV could've done something like to calm our nerves.The beach @ the HHV is not crowded at all, they offer all the beach amenities, but the lagoon was way too crowded to attempt to do anything. We also didn't use the main pool because we could never get a chair. We attended the Luau which had to be moved inside because of the weather and it was just okay. I don't know if they shortened it because it was moved inside, but the menu was more extensive than most, but still my kids wished we would've gone to the Paradise Cove luau which is our usual. They have much more to keep everyone busy.Our rooms were kept very clean and they are very spacious. You don't ever have to leave, but the restaurants are pricey and there many places to eat within walking distance. The grounds are gorgeous. No free internet in your rm. Check out was pretty bad. They only had 3 people and they were in the Hilton Honors line, so anytime an H Honors member came up they were seen first. We talked to the manager, but she didn't think it was an issue. I would return but I am bummed about the lack of help when we got stuck another night.",so cal,18,4.0

We had an amazing time and it was our first trip to Hawaii for any of us. My parents give my sister and me a stay at one of the Hilton Grand Vacations Club condominiums (they are owners of a unit in Las Vegas) for our birthdays (they are a week apart) every year and this year, we chose the Hilton Hawaiian Village's Lagoon Tower. We did not regret the decision at all. Upon our arrival, the check-in staff was kind and courteous. Since we had arrived early and could not get into our rooms yet, they pre-registered us and gave us bracelets to go to the pool on the side of tower. They also gave us kukui nut leis, and told us where we could go to a VIP arrival / departure lounge where we could relax, freshen up, and change to go to the beach, pool, or lagoon. They contacted us by phone when our room would be ready. We ended up exploring the premises and found out that the Grand Waikikian and the Lagoon Tower shared a carport and check-in area. The Grand Waikikian is behind the Lagoon Tower and is a beautiful tower as well.It is next to the famous Rainbow Tower, right behind the lagoon, making it one of the best-situated towers in the entire village. The beach is just a 5-minute walk away from the tower, the lagoon is right in front of it, and there is a large and newly remodeled pool area right next to the tower. It is not far (a 3-minute walk) from the main shopping and dining area in the village. The Lagoon Tower is a timeshare condominium tower at the Village. It is the oldest one of the three timeshare towers in the Village (Lagoon Tower, Kalia Tower, and Grand Waikikian), but they are renovating the rooms in the tower to update them. The unit we had was beautiful; it looked like it had been renovated within the last year or two. It was an end unit, meaning it was on the end of the floor, (for HGVC timeshare owners, the room we had was a 2 BR+ Premier Ocean View) had two balconies and windows in every room along the side wall that had a view of the pool. The balcony had a wonderful view of the lagoon, the beach, the pool, and downtown Honolulu. We had the best view in my opinion of the Friday night fireworks the Hilton puts on and the biggest Fourth of July fireworks show in Oahu, as well as several other ones in the Honolulu area. The room was spacious in the common areas, such as the family and dining rooms, but the bedrooms were small compared to other HGVC resorts. In the room my sister and I shared, we had two twin beds in the room, a closet, and a TV cabinet. The closet doors had not been dusted prior to our arrival, so that took the cleanliness review down a notch. The kitchen was beautiful and had all the necessary utensils and pots to cook meals in the unit if you desired. The refrigerator would constantly leak and the issue was beyond our control as it was condensation from the cooling fans of the fridge. The service people did not answer our call for the fridge so; I knocked off a notch on service for that. Other than that, it was a wonderful unit; the room number was 567 if anyone was curious about that for requests. The Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort is very nice. It has everything there that if you did not want to leave the resort at all, you could do that. However, the island of Oahu has a lot of beautiful attractions and sights that you should explore it. The resort has quite a few restaurants at different price points and different cuisines that are worth checking out. There are many shops throughout the towers and in the Japanese- themed shopping village area as well that sell all kinds of beach items, Hawaiian souvenirs, travel items, jewelry and clothing. It is beautiful to look at and explore during the day and the evening. The beach was very nice and swimmable, but the sand is rocky where you swim, so I would recommend water/swim shoes to swim at the beach, as my feet took a while to get used to the rocks while swimming. The view from the water was nice as you could see the entire beach and the hotels from it. The water was nice to swim in on a hot day, while the waves can get a little strong at times, so you need to watch out for the waves when swimming. The lagoon is nice, but the water was way too cold to swim in there for me, and the temperature outside was In the high 80’s, normally, cold water should be a relief from the heat in that situation, but it was not. I would recommend swimming in the lagoon on the hottest days, when the temperature is above 90 degrees. The pool next to the tower is wonderful, as it is multi-level and there are several water slides for the kids to enjoy. There are several Jacuzzis as well to enjoy throughout the day. The pool is resurfaced and is a nice grey color, which gives the pool a distinctive look, matching the rocks around ii. You do need to get to the pool early, because people will reserve chairs at seven or eight in the morning to return much later in the day to use them. Checkout was really easy and short, depending on what time you need to leave. The bell desk is really efficient and helpful with your luggage at both check-in and checkout. They are also friendly and willing to give you advice on checking out some of the local favorites if you ask them. I would recommend the Lagoon Tower to anyone considering staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village who wants more than just a simple hotel room. The condominium units are great for families and for couples who want to feel a little more at home in their accommodations. The location is ideal for all of the amenities the village has to offer. I am posting up some pictures to provide more of a visual to my review, to help those reading this review. I had a blast during my stay there and I plan to return there in the future.","Cerritos, California",19,5.0

My favorite part was the shops on the property. That's where we found ABC stores, and fell in love. The hotel pool was between towers and shaded early. The water at Waikiki was great, but the shore became rocky and un-walkable, even painful. The lagoon was nice to look at but freezing. We breakfasted in the VIP lounge with the most wonderful guava muffins!!! Otherwise we ate at Duke's and the Italian Table. Both scrumptious. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable.

We used Marriott points for our flights – a travel package including hotels at the Kauai Beach Club. We stayed at HGVC Kalia Tower in Oahu.Driving in Honolulu is extremely confusing. We drove and got slightly lost, but arrived at HGVC without a huge hitch. Check in was very easy at Kalia. We were very glad we weren’t checking into one of the other towers or hotels – it looked quite busy at the other check in area. Kalia has its own check-in area – turn right as soon as you turn into the resort – do not continue through the village. Be aware that parking is 24 dollars a day! Instead of spending that, my saintly husband parked at the Marina around the corner. This costs 25 cents (quarters ONLY – bring a LOT) per hour for a maximum of 24 hours. Be prepared to look for a spot – perhaps taking 10 minutes each time – but we always found a spot. We never ventured out in the car in the evening because we worried we wouldn’t find a spot at night. We had a one bedroom plus – meaning- ocean view (super view – though the Lagoon and Rainbow tower partially block the view – we still we were very pleased with our view and we’re hard to please in this area) Unit Features:Bedroom – Master bedroom has a king-size bed, a balcony, and a bathroom. There is one mid-sized closet in the room, along with adequate drawer space. There is a television, which we didn’t use. The bathroom a basic shower/bathtub/sink/toilet. There is a hairdryer – no need to lug your own. Toilet paper is provided.Closet – Small closet in the hall. Living/Kitchen Area – Pull out sofa, one chair, and a TV. There is a adequate sized kitchen table. The kitchen had everything a full kitchen should have.  Dishwashing liquid is provided. There is a deck with chairs off the living room.Laundry: Laundry room is down the hall – it is free and all the laundry detergent you’ll need is provided.Deck – There are 2 decks with a table and 2 chairs – 2 decks – one off the bathroom, one off the living room.. Tidy Service – One tidy service provided free of charge.Pool Area – There are 3 pools. The Kalia pool was not crowded. It is on the 4th floor – the pool was small and cold – plenty of chairs. The super pool was very nice, however you needed to reserve chairs (which I think is just an awful thing to do) by 6:30 AM for the best chairs, no later than 7:30 AM for a chair at all. I am absolutely not kidding. Then you are packed like a sardine next to the person beside you, and there is no way to move the chair to face the sun (if you’re a sun worshiper this will matter to you). The third pool was the GW pool with water slides and a small waterfall. Again, reserve chairs early – crowded. There is also the lagoon where you can put towels and lie out – but I really didn’t care for the smell of the area. The water was cold. However, there were little boats to rent, and many people seemed to be having a good time. There is a bar area by the super pool where you can order burgers and chicken fingers, along with expensive, but important on vacation, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. There is also a nice restaurant by the super pool (nice meaning pleasant – not fancy) where you can sit at a table and eat and drink.Beach Area – Crowded, but so big that it didn’t matter. We didn’t rent chairs or umbrellas, so I can’t give you a price. We preferred using our towels. We spent most of our time sightseeing – little time at the pools or beaches. Restaurants – There are so many – Bennihana’s (where they grill on the table – we didn’t eat there, but the prices were over 30 dollars), a sushi restaurant (mediocre), Tropics by the super pool (pleasant), pizza joints, ice cream (my kids LOVED the shaved ice) and others. The village is HUGE. I found it overwhelming and unappealing. But many people will disagree with me. I prefer a quainter (NOT less luxury – I am very into Marriott and Hilton quality), less crowded, less hustle and bustle. If you like having EVERYTHING and ANYTHING at your fingertips – you’ll love it. You can buy anything you need from bathing suits (I actually bought a nice one for a reasonable price) to food to …….. you name it! Property – Again – very, very busy. This is a village. It’s a “long” walk from Kalia Tower to the pools (long meaning it will take you 5 minutes at most). There is a gym, on the 4th floor which had ample treadmills, weights, and the like. We preferred jogging the beach, but did use it once. They asked us if we were Hilton Honors (we are) and they gave us a bracelet so it was free. I suspect if you aren’t Hilton Honors you would have to pay. The lobby is very pretty, and the staff was courteous. The concierge attempted to be helpful, but didn’t seem to really understand where we wanted to go. Her directions only got us lost.Sales/Staff – No one ever contacted us for a timeshare tour.Planned Activities – If there were any, we never saw them or saw anything about them. You can learn to surf for 90 dollars or you can walk down the beach to the left about ¼ of a mile and learn to surf for 45 dollars. We didn’t end up learning as the 45 dollar people won’t go out without 2 people – so we walked out at 9 am for nothing. There were paddle boats and kayaks for rent. Outings – We did everything on our own. I would strongly urge you to buy the book Oahu Revealed. Follow the book’s directions and you will see wonderful sights. See my picture trail below for some of the things we did and saw. We rented a car – a MUST in our opinion.Suitability: This resort is suitable for everyone. I would suggest that Kalia isn’t the best tower if you are disabled, as it’s “far” from the pool and beach. There are many kids, so if you’re looking for a quieter vacation, it may not be for you. If you’re looking for a home base with nice pools (albeit crowded) so you can sightsee – this was just fine!  Our Tours:Day One: North Shore – Follow Oahu Revealed. AMAZING beaches – fabulous sights!!! Have a ball! I strongly suggest snorkeling at Turtle Beach. We ate at Hale'iwa Joe's in the North Shore for lunch. YUM!Day Two: “Relax” at the hotel. I put quotes because we didn’t find it relaxing – too crowded. However, we got up VERY early and hiked Diamond Head. That was awesome, but not for the out of shape! July 4th fireworks with a tugger – Rick (ricoba).Day Three: East Oahu. Follow Oahu Revealed. We didn’t go to Hanauma Bay as the book suggests this day, nor did we do Diamond Head. We did these separately. We also drove out to KO olina – Marriott’s resort – to meet up with some tuggers. We much preferred this quieter resort.Day Four: Hanauma Bay – Cost 7.50 per adult. Kids 12 and under are free. Bring lots of sunscreen! You will have to wait in line and then watch a video. The snorkeling was not great at all. If you’re going there for the snorkeling, I’d skip it. It was very beautiful – and you can see it without standing in line or going down to the beach. There’s a huge hill to walk down (and then up). It was fine for us, but for those who are out of shape or disabled, there’s a very inexpensive van (75 cents down, one dollar up).Day 5: “Relax” at the hotel. We went out to dinner at Ocean House at the Outrigger which was very good. The kids loved having pictures taken with parrots. Day 6: Sailing tour. We went with Makani Catamaran (808-591-9000). You don’t see much more than the Waikki Beach, but it was very pleasant. It was only 35 dollars for 3 hours – and the kids were 2 for one. There was food (not great) and a free drink included. I do recommend this tour! Later we had dinner with a tugger (Jim – Boca Bum) at Duke’s. The food was very good!OFF TO KAUAI – Read my review of Marriott Beach Resort.See my Oahu pictures: http://www.picturetrail.com/sfx/album/view/22255025 and feel free to email me at zac495@gmail.com",philadelphia,125,4.0

We had a room on the 15th floor, with awesome views of the ocean, lagoon and city. We liked returning to our room every evening, and sitting on the balcony enjoying the weather and views. From the moment we arrived, the hotel staff was very accomodating. Check in was very quick. We had a kitchen, so we were able to eat breakfast and most lunches in the room. The large refigerator also allowed us to keep adult beverages in the room. The pools were sometimes crowded, however, we spent most beach days at the ocean or lagoon. The benihana on site was good, however, did not offer a kids menu, so it was kind of crazy paying 20.00 for a kids meal. We had a car the entire stay, and utilized valet, which was expensive - but very convenient. We opted against parking next door as it seemed we always had a handful of stuff upon our return to the hotel. Loved the fact that the hotel provided a complimentary room to change after checkout, so that we could enjoy our last day at the beach/pool - since our flight wasnt scheduled to leave until 8:00 p.m. Nice military hotel next door with drinks 1/2 the price of those at the Hilton.

But the staff at the Hilton Hawaiian were amazing and did everything they could to honour our booking and put us in the room we booked. As we left to settle in our room, they gave us complimentary vouchers for 4 dinners at their restaurant (which I will review on here).When we checked in, the room was stunning, HUGE, spacious, clean with beautiful flowers and fresh fruit. It was dark, so we couldn't see out. The next morning, we rushed to our balcony and got a view that just took our breathe away. From then on.. our holiday got better and better and I can honestly say that this was helped greatly by a stunning hotel with incredible facilities.Also, it is the other side of Waikiki which means that the beaches by the hotel are not anywhere near as packed.. and was still in walking distance - along the beach off course - to the main shopping and busy beach areas.

We had a two bedroom unit in the Lagoon Tower. The unit was great - neat and clean and in great condition. Beds were comfy, kitchen had everything we could want and our room was serviced daily. The resort itself was beautiful - beautiful gardens, great pools (our 5 year old loved the water slides at the lagoon tower pool). At the time of our stay there were no renovations being undertaken which was great. Towels were available at the pool area so we need not have brought our beach towels from home. The resort is right on the beach which is great. The only draw back about the resort is the distance from the main shopping /restaurant district of Waikiki but it really wasnt a problem as it is only a 15 minute walk along the beach which is beautiful or a quick trolley ride. The trolleys being $2 a person each way so with 6 of us it was costly but we chose a mixture of walking and trolley riding. Considering how good the resort was I would stay there again even considering that it is down the other end of the beach. We ate several times at Tropics bar and grill and found the food to be great quality although pricey and menu not overly extensive. I would like to mention that the Friday night show we thought was pretty average and there is no way I would pay $15 a person to see it. If you get there early you can sit for free to the side at the pool bar tables and see everything for free which is what I would recommend (and what we did). Staff were helpful and overall we had a super time. I would recommend the Grand Vacations Club at the Hilton Hawaiian Village to all. One last thing the resort is close to Ala Moana Shopping Centre which is great - 10 minute walk or short trolley ride. Convenience store is in the village which was great. Free wireless internet was included in room price which was also great.","Gold Coast, Australia",48,5.0

My husband, daughter and I upgraded to a 2 bedroom, 2 bath for $1600. for 6 days, 7 nights. What a fabulous resort and room. We were in room 1502, a corner unit on the ala moana side. We had a fabulous view of the ocean and city. From other reviews on this site we opted to park off site at the marina parking, just past the entry way to the Grand Waikikian. It is metered, but you can pay 72 hours at a time at it is only $6. per 24 hours, the attendant is great if you are a little late and will help you out. The Hilton is $24 a night for standard parking and $29 for valet, you can get the full week for the rate at the offsite vs. just one night at Waikikian. I was a little concerned as the meter asks you to put in a parking space #, but it doesn't matter where you are parked as long as your tag is valid still. We came back early on Friday, around 10 and our space was paid for till 1, we didnt' want to have to run back out, so talked to the attendant and he hand wrote us a ticket through Saturday morning, so we woulnt have to pay for more time than was necessary. We went to Maui and stayed at the Sheraton Black Rock right after the visti at the Grand Waikikian and really noticed what a difference the hotel and staff at the Grand Waikikian made. While the Sheraton was nice, the Hilton blew it away in accomodations. The restaurants are very expensive at the village, but the Foodland at the Ala Moana mall, by Sears, is a great way to go. We did spend a lot of money at the ABC store, but the mall was great to stock up on the weekly groceries. If you want to go to the fitness center we only found one on the entire property, the Kalia building. It was nice, but surprised this was the only fitness center. I have to say we loved the facilities and ended up buying at the lagoon tower as we love hilton and felt that the timeshare was a great value.",lake elsinore,10,5.0

The unit was very clean and well appointed. The kitchen was a nice size with an electric stove/oven, microwave, dishwasher, toaster, rice maker, and full size refrigerator. There were dishes, flatware, and glassware for a party of 4. They had the normal kitchen neccessities (spatulas, serving spoons, wine opener, etc.) and even a teflon frying pan (I think they knew I was coming). The living/dining area had a large dining table and a sofa bed that was the most comfortable sofa bed I had ever encountered. We also requested a rollaway which was in great shape and comfortable. The bedroom had a king bed that was also very, very comfortable. Our unit did not have a washer/dryer, but each floor has a laundry room to use free of charge. The tower seemed to be well built as we never heard much noise from other units. Everyone we encountered was very pleasant and helpful. We valet parked our car ($29/day) and our usual wait was around 7 minutes. One perk to valet parking the car was that there were free leis and black bead necklaces available. The property is huge with restaurants, shops, pools, beach, lagoon, penguins, and flamingos. The restaurants were a bit pricey, but the property is walking distance to many other dining options. Our main disappointment with two younger children was that the pools were freezing cold. Only one day did we find the paradise pool to be warm. Our first three days there were overcast and cool, so we didn't use much of a feature of a hotel that we enjoy most after a day of sightseeing. It was also hard to find an available chair near the paradise pool.","Livonia, Michigan",184,4.0

We chose the Lagoon Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for our stay. We reserved one two bedroom and one studio. This was our first use of vacation points and we did a great deal of research before reserving and arriving. In addition, all but one of us had been to Oahu several times.We were impressed with the Lagoon Tower. It is a great location, right on Waikiki Beach. The tower is clean and nicely decorated. Staff was pleasant and check-in was simple and expedient. Our room was lovely, not Four Seasons luxurious, but very nice with two bedrooms, two baths, a good-sized, well-stocked kitchen, flat-screen television with DVD player, dining area, televisions in both bedrooms and two spacious, full bathrooms. Our lanai was fantastic. We stayed on the 18th floor and had a lovely ocean view (which we had reserved). We looked over the lagoon and the beach/ocean beyond.I must address other comments as I have read many on this site. I understand construction can be quite bothersome. Luckily, the HHV seems to be done with this phase. The lagoon/swimming pool is complete, so should not be an issue anymore. I always suggest that this is something that people who are travelling should ask about. I am a world traveller and have lived overseas for almost eight years. These are questions that must be asked when you book! In addition, in a ""timeshare"" situation like the Lagoon Tower or other HGVC properties - maid service is not available every night. If you are staying at least seven days, they clean your room once. Just as if you were renting a home or condo, maid service is not every day. Having said that, all we had to do to have someone collect our trash or request extra towels was make a quick call to guest services and voila...trash collected and new towels within minutes.We truly enjoy the freedom that renting a superior ""condo"" allows us...we can prepare our own meals, saving money and frustration. We have somewhere to relax other than our hotel beds. It was nice and refreshing. The property is huge with access to all Village shopping, swimming pools, and acitivites. We made use of a couple of the pools and were not disappointed. If one was busy we went to the next, or just enjoyed the beach. If it is too busy, head to the Northshore - beautiful area!In addition, people should realize that it is not the fault of Hilton that Oahu and specifically Waikiki Beach is busy - this is what it is. If you are looking for a tropical paradise, you should do more research and stay on one of the other islands like Maui or Kauai. Oahu is busy and crowded on the Waikiki Beach/Honolulu side. It is commercial and noisy, although there are still beautiful parts on the Windward and Northshore parts of the Island.","The Woodlands, Texas",7,5.0

On our 1st trip, our family of 5 enjoyed a 10 day stay in the Lagoon Tower. This time we traveled with extended family ( a total of 10, ages 11-70yr.) We chose this location because there is something for everyone. You never have to leave with all the shops, restaurants, pools & beautiful beach. Like others have said, if your looking for quiet and seclusion this is not the place for you. This time, we stayed in the new Grand Waikikian tower. We had 3 units between the 10 of us, each with a full kitchen & washer/dryer(nice feature). The units are brand new and beautifully decorated but are smaller than the Lagoon Tower & it is further away from the beach. The new Lagoon area is beautiful & great for families with small children. There is also a new heated pool with waterslides that the kids enjoyed. The only problem with that pool is that it receives very little sunlight (blocked by Lagoon Tower). We new the expense of chairs/umbrellas, so for the extra $25 dollars(to check an extra bag) we brought our own chairs, sand toys, beach tubes and snorkel gear in a golf bag. Towels are provided free of charge at many different locations in the resort. Our cars were always ready, bellmen always available and requests for blankets, etc met quickly. We only went to breakfast a few times, since we had a full kitchen and the buffet is around $29/person. We never ate dinner in the village, it is also quite expensive and there are more affordable options within walking distance, by trolley($2) or a short cab ride away. We enjoy this place because it is also great for our children, ages 11, 14 & 17 and safe. They can walk together to get an ice cream, a shaved ice, hotdog, sandwich, pizza, cold drink, etc. without leaving the resort. The 2 oldest were able to walk to a Subway & McDonald's across the street. We even walked back(at night) from further down Waikiki after a night of shopping (3-4 blocks of high end stores). If you have teenagers, bring lots of money!! Our parents enjoyed the many beautiful outside areas to sit, the shops, well- maintained grounds and the beach. Every Friday night is a great free show at the Superpool ending with fireworks(get there early to get a good spot). Our only complaint was at check in. We arrived on a Tuesday(after a 12 hour flight) & when we checked in, they had put us in different towers. We had members of our family with significant medical issues & one who became very ill on the flight. It took over an hour to get us all in one tower but on different floors. We were also to have a ""garden view"", it was a noisy ""city view"" on the 6th floor. The next morning, I left my cell number for a manager to call me. At noon, I went back down & with polite persistence was able to speak with one. Due to the unexpected illness of a family member I needed to be closer to them. I also mentioned my disappointment with our ""garden view"". Around 4pm, I received a call that we could move to the same floor as my family & we had been upgraded to an oceanfront room on the 32nd floor with spectacular views. We would definitely stay here again-a great family resort! We have been on cruises to the Caribbean, Disney, Arizona and other beach vacations & this is our 3rd trip back to Hawaii as a family & our favorite!(last year we stayed in Maui-beautiful but quiet). We walked along the beach to see the other hotels(some don't even have a beach area) & were quite happy with our choice. Also take the time to enjoy the rest of this beautiful island.",Massachusetts,2,4.0

The other towers (Rainbow, Alii, Tapa, Diamond, etc), are traditional hotel rooms. This review is about our stay in the Lagoon Tower. I read a lot of the reviews before booking this hotel, and am SOOOOOO glad that we were able to get into the Lagoon Tower. We were able to book a 1BR condo thru the hilton.com website, for the same price as many of the regular hotel rooms at HHV.Pros of staying in Lagoon Tower that differed from what I read about staying in the non-""vacation club"" towers:1- each floor has free laundry facilities and they provide detergent2 - in room internet and wireless are free3 - no charge for coffee4 - no charge for safe5 - we were here for a week; having a full kitchen, seperate bedroom (so we could stay up while our 3yr old slept), and large LR/DR area was very comfortable.6 - service was excellent: we requested a rollaway bed at check-in, and it was delivered within 5 min of us walking in our door. We requested extra blankets later in the stay - again delivered fast. 7 - free DVD rentals and a ""book exchange"" available through the concierge 8 - tower is closest to Ala Moana mall (easy walk even for my 3yr old), where there is a Foodland supermarket for mainland priced groceries, and plenty of shopping. Since we had a full kitchen we saved tons by having breakfast on our own balcony and picnic lunches by the lagoon or beach, and could spend more on dinners. If it's too far for you to walk there are ABCs all over or you can take the trolley or bus.9 - We never got grief about pool/beach towels: just walked up and asked for as many as we needed.10 - 42"" LCD tv in the living room! it's bigger than ours at home! DVD player too.11 - No line-up at check-in, complimentary macadamia nut chocolates, and fresh flower leis.Cons: none that I can mention specific to the Lagoon Tower. Some comments in general about the hotel property:- it's HUGE. If you want private quiet seclusion, go somewhere else. - restaurants are pricey, but we only ate on property once (the Rainbow Sat night buffet) and it was worth it. $29 ocean front dinner buffet (with coupon they give you at check-in), with lots of seafood, fresh fruits and local cuisine, desserts, even a chocolate fountain for making your own smores or choc dipped strawberries. Plus our 3yr old ate for free :) That's a pretty good deal for anywhere in Hawaii where dining is always pricey.- grounds are beautiful and have lots of nature to entertain the kids: penguin/turtle feeding every morning, flamingos, koi ponds, ibis, maccaws.- Lagoon is excellent for younger kids as the water is wave-free. If you prefer the ocean it's just past the lagoon. Plenty of pools if you prefer that.- beach chairs and umbrellas are rent/day: $15 and $30 each per day! Just go to Walmart (across from Ala Moana mall), and buy your own for the week at $10 and $9 each.- Free fireworks every Friday night - excellent display - made even better by how close you are to the actual launch site.- Wed/Sun luaus on property: based on guide recces we bussed out to Germaine's luau (well worth it), but we did picnic take-out dinners on the lagoon beach to enjoy the music and show of the hotel luau. Much better than sharing a table with 10 strangers and paying $90/head to do so (plus we heard the hotel luau food was mediocre).-parking is expensive, $24/nt. We cabbed from the airport ($35 for a limo), and rented a car for a couple days thru National (used Costco discount and car class upgrades) for $28/day. The National lot is less than 1/4 mile walk from the lagoon tower and open 7am-8pm, so we just returned the car to them at the end of the day instead of paying for Hilton's parking lot.We were here for a conference combined with family vacation. We'd stay here again while we have young kids and could get in to one of the condo units.",Washington state,31,5.0

Back then it seemed well run with the occasional long wait, but it was always clean, courteous, and well maintained. We are HGVC owners and we we return every year at Christmas week. it seems this year something has gone wrong. Even though there are way fewer guests than in previous years, the staff seems very sparse and overworked (with the exception of the HGVC sales personnel, who are on overdrive trying to sell more units). Yes, the new refurbished lagoon is now open and most of the construction seems to be done, but when it comes down to it, the difference between an aggravating and pleasant experience often rests on the shoulders of competent and adequate staffing.To be specific, when we arrived to check in at Kalia tower, there was no valet parker, no bell hop to help us with our 3 suitcases and 3 backbacks and baby gear, and a line of 8-9 cars just sitting in the driveway with a bunch short-tempered people trying to get in and out. We had to circle around a couple times because there was simply no way to sit there double-parked and unload our car without blocking people in. When we checked-in we were told there was no luggage rack either, so we had to drag all our stuff (with small children) ourselves. It's not that we minded the work, but it is a very different experience than in previous years when we only had to wait 5-10 minutes until a bell-hop came by. We had to leave our car keys with front-desk until someone could come by and park our car.The Mandara Spa facilities, which usually are clean and well-run, also seemed to be suffering. The shower drains were so clogged, I was ankle deep (wearing spa sandals) after about a 6 minute shower. With other people's hair floating around my ankles! The wet-sauna was unusable (broken) and some of the post-shower amenities (hairspray, brushes, etc. were either missing or unreplenished. But the masseuse and facialist both were as excellent as before.Our room had a terrible stink of mildew coming from the bathroom and the hardwood floors had a gritty, dirty residue (the bottoms of our bare feet would turn dark grey after walking around the room). I had liked that these rooms were usually perfectly clean, so this was disappointing. In past years when encountering workers at Lagoon and Kalia HGVC buildings or on the grounds, they would usually greet us and let us pass. This year they pretend they don't see us or other guests and amble along at their tired pace dragging their cart or equipment, ignoring the crowd of people building up behind them. I don't blame them if they do more then their usual share and are tired, but I have to say that this isn't the 'luxury' or even solidly competent resort service I have grown accustomed to at this property.It is still a great location, but if you come in the next couple of months, don't have very high hopes. For whatever reason, this is not the place it used to be.Addendum: my brother is an owner in the Grand Waikikian and he was sorely disappointed by how slip-shod the quality control was. The washer-dryer malfunctioned, the dishwasher needed to be repaired. He and his wife had to spend hours of their vacation getting people to come fix these things again and again (they didn't fix it the first or second time).",New Jersey,13,3.0

So after 22 hours we arrived in OAHU and we had booked Charlies CAbs online to pick us up , again perfect , they were there waiting for us and whisked us to the Lagoon Tower . WOW , what a place . As mentioned in other reviews they are the business , we had a 2 bedroom overlooking the Lagoon and the Ocean and it had everything , all free as well apart from the coffee which had to be purchased each day . Washing machine and dryer on the landing was free as well . Rooms were breathtaking with the view , as we overlooked the party area we were treated to many shows whilst sitting on our balcony sipping a beer or two which we bought from the ABC shop . The Hilton charge approx $8 a beer plus tip whilst they sell it on site for $12 for 12 cans , pop in your fridge and away you go . Food is samey and dear , our party regulary spent $150 + for a burger meal each with a beer and 1 afters , eating at the Hilton was out unless we ate sandwiches so we walked to the Outrigger ( next hotel down ) and had many meals there , spectacular views and nice prices and nice walk . The Hilton is right at one end of Waikiki but the walk into town is brill , nice places to eat and drink there ( Planet Hollywood etc ) and top shops . We jumped the bus to the Aloa Moana centre ( $2 each and 4 stops down the road ) where we shopped a lot and drank a lot , top place . Waikiki itself is a place of contrasts , the beach is Ok , no powder white sand but good enough and the water is Ok , not blue but green , in some places it is fab in others not so . Can't take beer onto beach , must have ID on you to buy it even if you look 78 years old , can't smoke hardly anywhere even outside, unfriendly staff with no sense of humour who cant speak English , it felt sometimes like a police state gone mad . Weather in Oct was a nice high 80's if the sun was out and 70's at night , we stayed for 12 days and had 8 good ones for sitting on the beach . $15 a chair or $30 an umbrella a day take your fancy ? thought not , get along to Wallmart and buy them for $7 each . There are lots of nice places to snorkle and swim and dive etc , Waikiki is not one of them by a long shot . Surfing looked OK if you liked being anti-social , not one of them spoke to us as they walked past with their boards , they were always on there own and not one of them ever smiled , I don't know what it is about surfing but it must be better than it looks . There is no coral to snorkle over and the tides are really strong so there is nothing to see off Waikiki apart from grey sludge. It is ok to walk along and it is nice and romantic but if you are after South Pacific beaches then be prepared to travel or try another island, but be warned that , as with LA , there are people begging on the beach as it is public and they will ask you for spare $'s or cigs as they sleep rough every night due to the warm weather , they are not threatening or pushy , just a nice enquiry every now and then but the problem does exist and is off-putting . Other hotels looked nice but their beaches were tiny , it was a hop skip and a jump into reception from the water's edge , at the Hilton they have a large beach area and a gorgeous Lagoon which is fresh waterish and man made with fish etc to swim on and is safe for kids . As the holiday wore on we noticed that the island is set up for the large influx of Japanese visitors and all the main shops are staffed by Japenese staff , they do not like it if you browse and ask to look at something but don't end up buying , it was a little cheap being hassled in the hotel shops because I wanted to know a price of an item but was not interested in buying when I was told the hugely inflated price , the contempt in the guy's face was quite something . It was the same all over the island , if you look and dont buy be prepared to kick the door down to get out of the shop. This gets annoying after about 1 day . We tripped out to Pearl Harbour , got there at 8.30am and stayed for 3 hours , it wasn't too busy and was a nice way to see the Harbour and the Arizona Memorial which was moving . We booked at the Hotel and no doubt payed a little more than we should have but we felt safer doing so . So to sum up , Expedia were magic , AA were great , Hotel was fab but really expensive , beach and water was not as advertised in the brochures and the vagrants and beach bums were a shock , Honolulu is mainly Japanese orientated an was extremely up-market and the food was burgers or starve and as long as you followed the 1001 rules and regs of the Island then all was OK , so all in all I would rate this as a 6/10 holiday , wouldn't go again but glad I did to see it for myself .",Liverpool,40,3.0

Food was outrageously expensive ($14 burger) at the grill by the pool, and the bfast buffet was nothing to write home about. The noodle shop in the village was tasty and cheap.

View was awesome of the newly renovated Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon. Full kitchen, comfy bed, large sofa bed, upscale tropical furnishings, free washer/dryers on each floor. These are like the apartment you wish you could have in Hawaii! Staff is super nice and helpful. Concierge desk in lobby as well as complimentary juice in the mornings. Super pool is very refreshing and there was always a chair. Beach fronting the hotel is great. Now you will find better beaches around the island but this is the perfect Waikiki Beach. Not too crowded but not isolated. Couple of different stands for beach rentals that were actually reasonably priced! ABC store on property as well as luxury shopping like Louis Vuitton, Prada and Dior. It is a busy resort but we never felt like part of a herd or anything. The only issue I had was the parking. The $$$ was outrageous. Now we vacation in Hawaii several times a year and I know that every single resort/hotel charges for parking as it is outsourced but the HHV was almost double what we normally pay.

First let me just say that you never need to even leave the hotel area - everything is right there on the grounds. From great food to shopping at Dior! It's all right in the complex. There are 4 towers in the hotel. Our hotel, the Lagoon Tower was a bit back from the beach and was behind a small man made lagoon that you could swim in. There were baby baby fish in the water but they didn't bother you. There are several outside bars to have a drink at with live entertainment! The grounds are beautiful with coy ponds and flamingos. The beach was a short walk away and they were always nice and clean. In the hotel there is a mini store that is stocked with anything you could need. Every morning there were pitchers of ice cold lemon water or a fruity guava drink (boy I miss that) waiting in the lobby. Each floor also has its own washers and dryers. I loved that because I hate to go home with a suitcase of dirty clothes. The balcony was very spacious with a table and chairs. The condo had a kitchen, a livingroom, two bedrooms and 2 baths. The master had a queen size bed and the guest room had 2 twin beds. All very clean. Diamond Head is visible from the Rainbow Tower and from the beach.The grounds had lots of sitting areas, bars, an ice cream palor, a pizzeria, a small diner like restaurant with alcohol and many many many shops. The street that the hotel is on looks like Rodeo Drive if you go down 1/4 mile. Everything from Gucci to Ferragamo. Planet Hollywood to Cheeseburgers in Paradise. They had it all. There were also cheaper stores for souveniers.We had breakfast and dinner at the Rainbow Lanai restaurant. We sat right next to the coy pond that runs along side of the place. True relaxing paradise! OK now for the things I didn't like. The place is so expensive it is really ridiculous! I paid $15 each DAY for a chair and $30 a DAY for an umbrella to sit by the lagoon! The reason why they said is because the state owns the small part by the lagoon and that it is a public piece of property. I liked the lagoona area better than the pool or the beach because it was quiet and not many people were there so I paid. I also didn't like the fact that their pools are so so small! That place is huge - you think they would have more pool space. (Slightly larger than a person's in ground backyard pool). The pool didn't seem that clean to me either..kind of slimy. However the chairs were free there but too crowded for me. At the end of the stay they charged $280 for parking and room taxes. For 6 days of parking I thought that was a bit much. Also while we were there construction was going on and it woke us up at 6:30am every morning and the view from the room in the back was all construction! Things I think you should see while staying in Oahu.Waikiki BeachHave breakfast at the Outrigger Hotel (short drive away and only $10 a head)Visit the aquarium -the zoo was a waste of timeGo to Diamond HeadEat at the Top of Waikiki Restaurant (it is a revolving restaurant) the food is awesome and well priced.Drive to the North shore where they surfWe rented a car and drove all the way up the coast & around-(beautiful)Go on the Cattamaran at the Outrigger HotelWould I reccommend this place- YES!

Our last three stay have been at the Lagoon Tower, and as usual, it was a great escape, check in a breeze, staff alway friendly, Norman the valet always greeted us by name and with a smile each time we arrived and departed. Ted and Kacey at the Tropics and Hua Tree bar, I consider aloha embasadors of the Hilton Hawaiian Village, they are always upbeat, friendly and they always ensured our needs were met. Though the construction for the Grand Waikikian and the adjacent pool is on going, it was not an issue. Our room was listed as a garden view, but it over looked the great lawn, lagoon and the ocean beyond. Matter of fact it was only one lanai over from our room last year that was listed as ocean view. The room contained everything we requred, it was well kept and clean. Since we were there for ten nights we received two room cleanings instead of one, which is what you get when you stay for a week. The grounds were beautiful as usual, the recently renovated lagoon turned out great, last year it was just a big construction pit, and the years prior to that it was a mucky body of water no one would dare swim in. Now the lagoon is great place to lay out, and a nice place for the little ones, warm, calm, clean water. Even though the Hilton beach is not crowded compared to the rest of the Waikiki beaches, the lagoon is also a nice place if you want to be a little more isolated from the number of folks on the beach. Yes, the food, drink and parking are expensive at the village, we utilized the ABC stores and Sam's Club to stock our room for our stay. To me parking is the extremly over priced, but we know this ahead of time and include it in our budget. There are plenty of options out side of the village for food, drink and parking. A car rental is a must, even if for just one day. A drive around the island, over to the north shore, have lunch at one of the numerous shrimp trucks, stop at Hanauma Bay, Waimea, Haleiwa and numerous other places. It is a nice relaxing change to get away from city for a day. We're already making our plans for next year, can't wait to go back!","Roseville, CA",3,5.0

My favorite part was waking up (early...we were still on EST) and seeing the surfers at dawn on Waikiki Beach from the balcony of our room(s). One word of caution is that many of the ""extras"" at the HHV are pretty expensive. In addition to the $25 (or more?) daily parking fee...it costs $40 for a beach chair (per day, but no partial day rates available) ($200 total per day for beach chairs for five!); $20 per 1/2 hour for a kayak on the lagoon; $90 pp (plus tip) for a 2 hour surfing lesson; $20 pp for a lei-making lesson. We realized when we went off-property that the prices were lower elsewhere on Waikiki Beach (even at other hotels) and much lower elsewhere on Oahu.To be fair, we also enjoyed the free extras. The kids really enjoyed the penguins and the penguin and turtle feedings. We were disappointed to find that the Bishop Museum no longer has a small site on the property of the HHV.","Coral Gables, FL",28,4.0

I must say, after reading some of the reviews on this resort, I was extremely anxious to arrive to either confirm or deny the comments of other travelers. I am happy to report that our stay at the resort was met with pure optimism and an amazing experience.We arrived at the Hilton late in the evening on a Saturday after a long flight from New Jersey. My parents are Hilton Grand Vacation Club members, and were gracious enough to give us their timeshare for our honeymoon as a wedding present. Therefore, we stayed in the Lagoon Tower. When we got off the shuttle, our bags were taken immediately to our hotel room without hesitation nor pressure to be tipped. We were guided to our tower and immediately checked in without any problems. I had heard on this site that the resort was currently under construction in certain areas, which is true. We were lucky to be placed in a room on the 14th floor facing the lagoon and the ocean instead of that. We had a fantastic view from our room, where we were able to see almost the entire resort as well as the water. The room was very clean, as well as the balcony. My only complaint concerning the room was the bathroom, where I was expecting a separate tub and shower after staying in other 1 bedroom condos through Hilton in the past. However, this is not a necessity.The places to eat in the resort can be very expensive. However, with the location of the Hilton being in the midst of Waikiki, dining options are endless outside of the resort. I would recommend dining at Bali at the Sea in the Hilton, due to the quality of both the service as well as the food. It isn't cheap, but if you go at 6pm Monday through Thursday, ask for the Sunset Dinner Special, where you receive a special menu with dining entrees at a reduced price. As for the resort itself, it has absolute character and appeal. I found it to be absolutely beautiful, whether you were at the beach or on the sidewalk on Kalia Ave. The service was fantastic. We were always greeted whether we were arriving or leaving our tower in the resort. Questions were always addressed on the spot and handled accordingly. I would definitely recommend this resort for couples despite past reviews saying it is more family oriented. Vacations are what you make out of them. Yes, there were families with small children at the resort during our stay, but in no way did it hinder our awesome experience.I must say that I'd been monitoring the progress of the construction around the Lagoon Tower since reading reviews about this in the summer, but for the most part the construction has pretty much passed. The lagoon itself is completed and gorgeous. The Grand Waikikian, which is the new tower in the resort, is diagonal and behind the Lagoon Tower, so it does not create an eye soar. If you book the timeshare for a week in Hawaii, do yourself a favor and request for a room with a lagoon view. Mention that your vacation is a special occasion of some sort (i.e. honeymoon, anniversary, significant birthday celebration...anything), and this will increase your chance of having a room with a view.  If you're looking for an active honeymoon full of activity as well as relaxation, the Hilton Hawaiian Village and Lagoon Tower will provide just that! Enjoy!","West Chester, Pennsylvania",23,5.0

With tax, the nightly charge was $360. We had a one bedroom condo promoted as having an ocean view. Coming in from the curb late in the evening involved walking up a few steps with many suitcases. There is no convenient ramp to bring the wheeled cases up. Check-in was reasonably quick. Our room was on the side of the hotel, so there was indeed an ocean view...if you walked out onto the balcony and turned to the right. There was not an ocean view out the window of the unit.The tower faces the rainbow tower on one side, but the rainbow tower has an outdoor bar with fairly loud music until 10 or so each night. So you get to hear loud music instead of calm ocean breezes. The alternative, on the other side, faces a construction area and parking lot. For the week we were there, there was little construction work going on, and therefore little construction noise. The room itself is perfectly comfortable and well stocked with kitchen appliances and accessories. It isn't luxurious, but is perfectly comfortable. There is a pullout couch in the living room and a queen bed in the single bedroom. The bath is accessible to either room without anyone having to go through the other bedroom area.

This was our first HGVC vacation. Being new to the whole reservation bit we dilly dallied until March to make our reservation. At that late date we were not able to get 7 consecutive nights in the Lagoon Tower. We could only get 4 nights in the HGVC Lagoon Tower and converted our remaining HGVC points into Hilton Honors points and reserved the other 3 nights in the Hilton Hawaiian Village (Tapa Tower). We reserved a 2 bedroom ocean front premier suite in the HGVC Lagoon Tower which according to my reservation confirmation go for $900+ per night. After a long day at the beach on day 2 we returned to the HGVC suite to find we had received no housekeeping. My husband contacted the front desk and was told that you have to stay a minimum of 7 nights in the HGVC in order to get housekeeping! WHAT!!!! So, each afternoon we had to stop at the front desk for towels and shampoo for the 4 of us (my husband, myself and our 2 teenagers). By the end of day 3 the garbage was stinking and overflowing and we had a pile of smelly wet towels the size of Diamond Head on the floor. We did meet up with housekeeping in the hallway every morning and they seemed very nice and very hardworking. The staff at HGVC made no effort to make us feel special. As a matter fact, I found them to be somewhat distant and aloof. Already we’re wondering if we made a mistake buying with Hilton. We plan on contacting the rep that sold us the week and ask why he didn’t tell us about the lack of service. We have been looking to buy a second timeshare but we’re sure not going to by more HGVC. We asked for a room on a high floor when we made our original reservation and on one other occasion and we got a room on the 6th floor – gee thanks! (IF ANYONEOUT THERE KNOWS THE TRICK TO GETTING A GREAT ROOM, PLEASE CONTACT ME!) The construction went on 7 am to 5 pm every day but Sunday. It didn't bother us too much because we didn't spend much time in the room. However, it was very loud so it made spending time on the lanai a bit unpleasant. We watched the fireworks on Friday night from our lanai which was nice but short (about 5 – 10 minutes).A couple other comments:-The Outrigger Catamaran was worth every penny. We showed up for the 3 pm trip and we had the whole boat to ourselves and the crew was wonderful. Played great tunes for us, drank champagne, sat on the net and got splashed and best of all we had several dolphins swimming and jumping right along side of us. WOW!! We couldn’t tip the captain and first mate enough . . . it was absolutely fantastic!!!-The Sunset Dinner Cruise was just average (food wasn’t that great).-Our two teenagers took surfing lessons with Pacific Soul and loved it. Had to pay $50 to get the pictures though (all of them on CD) but they were great pictures!- There is NO authentic luau on Oahu, sorry!- The book Oahu Revealed was “spot on” when they called the PCC “cheesy”. Way too much participation and we spent way too much time there. Ever heard of a Luau-cafeteria style? Not what I had envisioned at all. I recommend you do the self tour and see the “Horizons” show at night. The fire dancers made the show worthwhile. -Rent your snorkel gear and boogie boards from Snorkel Bob’s. We got it all for the whole week real cheap. Spent a lot of time at the HHV beach which was crowded but nice. We also hit the North Shore beaches which were unbelievable. Just kept the snorkel gear in the car and we were ready to go! In spite of the HGVC we did enjoy our vacation by just being together and having fun as a family.","Mount Shasta, California",26,1.0

The lifts were VERY slow, with 15min waits the norm. Resort has too many buildings, rooms and people, hence everyone is packed into a very small pool area, with access to beds limited. Everything on-site is expensive, including parking, food, drink and beach sunbeds.Positive - Right on a fantastic beach. ABC store on site. Easy walk to main shops (every designer brand available) and places to eat. Free internet access.

We did the O'ahu Nature tours. They have about 12 to choose from, but we choose to do only 3. They take you to the best places in O'ahu and give you a lot of information about the island. We visited the most beautiful beaches, waterfalls, gardens and views there is to see. Since we had an idea of what the island consisted of we used our free days to do our own sight seeing. we rented a car and revisited Lanikai Beach, the best beach in O'ahu. Very private and the sun rises in between two tiny islands. Upon our arrival we went straight to walmart and bought plenty of snacks, drinks, wine, beer, etc. Since the room had all the essentials needed to cook, we had dinner at our patio that overlooked the beach. We watched the sun set every night. There is a great place to have breakfast called Eggs and Things. It is about a block away from the Hilton and the portions are Large.

Yes the lagoon pool is closed for a serious rebuild and yes they are doing construction in the area, however your have access to three other pools in the entire village.Overall, looking out of your windows and balony and seeing the sunset and ocean makes you forget the construction. It was kind of fun to look over your balcony and see some workers having a two hour breakfast.Being a HGVC owner has its advantages and this village is one of them. Seeing the ocean and the docks, the shops. Check out the TAPA Bar. This is part of the orignal hotel from back in the day.

Now a little jet lagged and reflecting on our week there, I feel a little melancholly as I type this. I feel it necessary to let everyone know who may be going to the Lanai Tower at the Hilton Hawaiin Village, you need to be prepared to hike to the beach. Despite the information given to us as we booked our stay as ""Beachfront"" with an oceanview, we were given a room overlooking the parking deck on the backside of the complex. So instead of waking every morning to enjoy our coffee on the balcony overlooking the beach as we were told , we were less infatuated with the view of a busy city street cluttered with noisy traffic and a parking garage for a nearby hotel. And yes, we did try to change our room within minutes of seeing the accomodations only to be told there were no oceanviews available. If you are a family with small children, lugging sandtoys, boogie boards etc to the beach, be aware. By the time you finally make it to the sand, despite the fact you have wondered thru a host of upscale shopping and eating establishments, you pray no one has forgotten anything or your time in the sun will be diminished by at least another 20 minutes as you make the return trek back to the hotel. For me to say the complex was beautiful would be an understatement. Everything there was immaculate. Over the top one might say. The pool was tropical, with a Hawaiin presentation of some sort most every night, the beach was clean, and overall the room accomodations were wonderful. It is just extremely dissappointing to be told one thing and receive another. My best advice for anyone staying in the Lanai Tower is to get everything is writing, triple check accomodations before you leave if you want to be able to see the ocean and pack your hiking shoes. If you want to be close to the beach, ask for a different building.",Sugar Land Texas,21,3.0

Only needed car for few days everything else can be seen by foot ,bus, taxi or tour from hotel. Being from florida and living on the beach at first yes waikiki may not seem so grand to some in the other views but once you see the north shore or beaches by bellows airforce base which is open to public on weekends it truly reminds you of why you went there in the first place, even though I loved waikiki beach the sunset and night time life of the beach are the best. Also something not much responce on is the audobon gardens and waterfall worth the look.

We booked a 1 bedroom condo through the hotel and it was perfect for the family, 2 young children (3 & 6) and 2 adults. The kids enjoyed sleeping on the sofa bed and we had a separate room with a King size bed. We were on the 5th floor facing the Lagoon and the view was amazing. We could even see the fireworks from our room on Friday night. We are not timeshare members so we received maid service daily as well as use of the free laundry facilities, including soap. The kitchen was well equipped with a kettle, toaster, rice cooker, pots, pans, microwave and all the dishes and cutlery you need. The only two negative things I can say is that sometimes the elevators did take a while to come, but you are on vacation so what's the rush. The other thing was that the maid forgot to clean our room once, but we contacted them and they came right away to clean.This is a wonderful place to take kids, they loved the pool which is fairly shallow deepest is about 4 1/2 feet. The beach area is great for them to play, large beach area and calm water. As for the restaurants they are very expensive, but if you purchase an Entertainment Book there are several coupons in it for the resort restaurants as well as other activities.We bought groceries and ate breakfast on our lani (patio) everyday and for lunch on several occasions we went next door to the military hotel, it was much cheaper and good food, except the fish burger! If you need to buy groceries go to Foodland in the Ala Moana Shopping Centre it is cheaper that some of the other stores. If you ask for a membership card it is even cheaper, anyone can get one.If you have small children and they are not great swimmers the Atlantis Submarine excursion is perfect for them, our youngest son is 3 and not comfortable in the water, so he was not able to snorkel. We took him on the submarine and he loved it, we saw tons of fish and well as green sea turtles. It is not cheap to go, but again if you have an Entertainment Book there is a coupon for it. Children must be 3 feet tall to go on.One of the most enjoyable nights we had was going to see the Magic of Polynesia with illusionist John Hirokawa. The kids thought it was amazing as did we.

We are timeshare owners but still like to put in our two cents. The first four nights we stayed in a 2 BR corner unit facing the Rainbow tower. We were on the 6th floor and the lanai had wonderful palm trees that were at our level - very cool. Also because it was a corner unit, we had another lanai off the dining room. The unit was very spacious and living room quite a distance from the bedrooms. Nice kitchen area with pantry. Last three nights were supposedly upgraded but was far from it. Room needed some definite upgrading, faced the harbor but also seemed really too close the other hotel property next door. The living room was a lot smaller, dirty carpet, smaller bathroom and tattered furniture in master bedroom. We did get a couple great sunsets from our lanai but even the lanai was smaller -- what upgrade? But, all in all a lovely stay, nice to get away to the lagoon pool also ask about the hospitality room to shower before flying out (it's at the hotel)Also if more than 4 people, ask about the stretch limo to airport, in coupon book, for $29 pick you up right at Lagoon tower.(otherwise shuttle is $8 per person and you have to lug your suitcases around to Tapa tower.)

At ground level there is a maze of shops selling designer goods. First impressions is like staying in Manhattan with a few more trees. This is the second impression as well. Expect a pitch to sell you a Hilton time-share at the welcome meeting. Everything in the Hilton can be found outside the Hilton at half the price but if you are the sort of person who want to stay in a complex for everything then I suppose you deserve to pay over the odds.  The beach is swept daily and the hotel is located right on the beach front, however it does matter which block you are in for views. The room we were in was large by European standards with two double beds and a small bar area. Filter coffee is provided, but you have to pay for the coffee. Internet is provided, but you have to pay for the internet. You can park overnight (for a fee). Get the idea? Everything is $5, hence the staff motto 'The only thing free is the Aloha and the morning newspaper'. There is a pretty sterile attempt to soften the concrete by importing in a (very) few penguins and flamingoes. It is well-situated for bus routes and all buses on O'ahu cost $2 and are air conditioned but are very infrequent (it is not unusual to have to wait more than 30 minutes for a bus even in rush hour). To get to the Arizona Memorial (Pearl Harbour) walk out of the hotel to the right and catch bus 20 or 42, this takes about an hour with frequent stops. Rather than book trips, I would advise you to rent a car on the Internet from Dollar and pick it up at Hale Koa Hotel (which is the next-door hotel to the right). This costs $60 a day instead of $60 per person per trip. The service at the Wailana Coffee House (out of the complex and turn left) is excellent and the prices are very reasonable and the food is always hot and filling but can be let down by the presentation.

Room was very clean and well maintained.As a transient guest (not a timeshare owner) in the Lagoon Tower, we received daily maid service, in addition to free wireless internet service and as much coffee as we needed. Suite kitchen facilities were well equiped and the appliances looked brand new. Also, never had to wait for the free laundry machines located on the floor either. Service was absolutely wonderful in the Lagoon Tower. Staff was very friendly and there was NO timeshare sales pressure. It was far less hectic than in the main (regular) hotel towers. Lagoon Tower pool was also very nice and much less crowded than the main pool. Only downside is that there are only 3 guest elevators for this 23 story building and no staff service elevators, thus during peak use times, the waits can be quite long.Grounds of the whole Hilton are beatuiful.

We had a room on the 11th floor with a balcony which had 4 chairs and a table. It overlooked the Rainbow Tower, but also had a beautiful ocean view. The king size bed was very comfortable. The maid only comes once during a 7 day stay, unless you pay extra, but they provided us with fresh towels when we asked. There is a small pool and a sauna tub just for the use of the Lagoon Tower people. The best pool is the Super Pool and of course there is the wonderful sandy ocean beach. Towels are provided for swimming in all areas. There are many shops on the property, the best priced one is the ABC store, which has just about anything you would need. There is a Coffee Shop across the street with reasonable prices and good food. The restaurants on the property are pricey, but two are recommended by most travel books. The military resort next door lets you use their snack bar to buy hamburgers, salads, ice cream, etc. which are very reasonably priced.The attractions desk in the lobby was very helpful and booked us a circle tour of the island with a stop at Pearl Harbor and lunch on the North Shore, which lasted about 9 hours. It was very good. They also booked a trip to the Polynesian Cultural Center, with a luau which lasted 11 hours. The luau food was just okay, but the 7 islands were both educational and fun to visit if you like learning about the culture of the people. There wasn't enough time to do all the areas as completely as I would have liked. We did not use a car at all as we spent time enjoying the water, and walking into the city, maybe a 10-15 minute walk. The only drawback to this resort is the long wait for the elevators on check out day, everything else was wonderful.

Let me just say that this is one of the best hotel properties I've been to in a long time. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower. We had a 1 bedroom suite and an adjoining studio room for 4 adults. The bedrooms, main room, bathrooms, furnishings, kitchen were wonderful. Maid service doesn't come each day, but whenever we needed towels or more coffee they brought it up immediately. Our room faced the Rainbow Tower and the view was fabulous, and each room has a lanai which we spent the majority of time when in the room hanging out on. One complaint we had was the noise of taxis & garbage trucks around 7am. One thing they did not do a good job of planning the resort to have these service vehicles away from guests. However, it did not detract from our stay in any significant way. Another downfall on the Lagoon Tower is the elevators which you will end up waiting for during peak times. The super pool was great. Chairs were hard to come by if you got there between 11am - 2pm, but we always ended up finding room to sit as a group. We did not bother using any of the other pools, as this one had a much better atmosphere. The beach is amazing, and I highly recommend getting up (when you hear the noise at 7am) and going for a walk on the beach at sunrise. The restaurants and bars are overpriced as any hotel will be. For lunch, consider walking next door to the Koa Hauna hotel pool. They have great prices on burgers and you can bring them back to the Hilton pool! For dinner, we always went elsewhere in Waikiki or into Honolulu by taxi.The hotel has a Hertz office on site, which we used for renting a car to go to the North Shore for the day.

The standard rooms are all on the back side of the building. They have just broken ground on a new HGVC tower that will be alarmingly close to these buildings. I suspect that there will be a lot of noise for the next couple of years and then neigbors that can look into your windows pretty easily. The ""ocean view"" rooms are on the opposite side. They more appropriately have an ocean peak, but do not have the problems associated with the other side.

The water was a bit cold and it got really deep really fast, Waikiki is not the best beach in the world.If renting a car, order online at thrifty and pick it up at the Radison on Al Lamona avenue behind the hotel, this way you will save a bundle compared to any other rental agency. I also did not like having to pay for parking at the resort, but was told that all hotels will charge in Waikiki.Check out the International marketplace (flea market) across from the cheesecake factory on the main strip for great deals.

We were married in Maui and stayed in the Alii tower for two nights on our way back home. One thing you must remember when booking here is that there are several towers all part of the same property. This may cause some discrepancies among reviews. We can only speak for the grounds and the Alii Tower. One of the major advantages of staying in the Alii tower is the check-in desk and private pool and hot tub exclusive to the Alii Tower. You still have the use of the other pools on the property as an added bonus. We also had a Manager's reception each evening between 5 and 7pm where they served finger foods (hot and cold) for free. The staff was very friendly and courteous and they were kind enough to upgrade us to a King Ocean Front Suite because it was our honeymoon. The room was incredible, complete with two lanais overlooking the ocean on different sides, a plasma flat screen tv, and even a tv in the washroom. We were given all the bottled water we could drink at no extra cost and welcomed with fruit and chocolates upon our arrival. The grounds are spectacular, showing off incredible gardens and some of the most beautiful exotic birds you will ever see including pink flamingos and penguins believe it or not. We went in June so I'm sure it wasn't their peak season, thus the beaches were not crowded at all. The water was great but the sand was a little coarse. After walking down Waikiki beach it became very evident that the beach at the Hilton is the widest and best for swimming along the stretch. They are in the middle of construction of a wedding chapel on the property so be forwarned if you are thinking of booking in the near future. It didn't bother us much, just took away from some of the gardens. All in all a tremendous stay!!!","Toronto, Canada",27,5.0

The condo was beautiful, we had an ocean view, & the Kalia Pool on the 4th floor was directly below our balconies. It was great just sitting out on our balconies enjoying the view of Waikiki Beach, the Rainbow Tower & the lagoon. The free washers & dryers happened to be across the hall, just outside the door of our condo. We enjoyed the shopping available on the Hilton property. We stopped at the Mandara Spa Store in the shopping area & even got 10 minute back & neck massages there, without an appointment! There is an ABC Store in the shopping area, where you can pickup convenience food, souveniers, etc. Our family loved the penquins, fish ponds, flamingos & the waterfalls in the resort. We really enjoyed our days spent on Waikiki Beach. We took our own beach mats, chairs & umbrella, to avoid paying the resort rentals. The Amercian Express desk was very helpful in booking our luau (Paradise Cove). We had a rental van, it cost $13 per day to keep it in the parking garage.Went snorkeling at Haunama Bay, beach hopping around the island, visited Ala Moana Mall & Pearl Harbor.

We originally booked that time because we heard the weather was great that time of year. Also, because it wasn't during the high tourist season. We all had a memorable vacation. We arrived about 10am and was told our room wouldn't be ready till about 2pm, so we left the luggage with the bellhop in the lobby. They have a huge area roped off and everyone's luggage is tagged so we felt safe leaving it there. When our room was ready it was great ! It was a one bedroom/one bath condo. The kitchen was stocked with enough dishes for 4. A very nice sized refrigerator. Bathroom was ok size-nothing huge, but fine. And the master bedroom was good-sized too. Every day, the maid would leave coffee packets and laundry detergent (both free).I had heard that coffee in Hawaii is very expensive so I didn't use the coffe packets the first day-thinking we would be charged for them, but we never were. They come with the condo.There's 2 washers and 2 dryers on each floor (free). Our lanai faced the next hotel-the Renaissance Ilia-but not too close that you could see into someone else's room. It was EXTREMELY quiet and private. Even though we were on the 17th floor, taking the elevators was no problem. The shops at the Hilton Hawaiian Village were great too. Did lots of shopping for souvenirs and essentials at the ABC store (closes 1am). Good place to get milk and bread and sodas for the kids. Maybe cuz we went during the ""off"" season it was never too crowded in the Village. Also ate at the Rainbow Tower Restaurant for their dinner buffet. With Pleasant Holidays thru AAA you get buy-one get-one free coupons otherwise it would have been very expensive ($30-adults;$25-kids). The only thing I could say that was bad about the hotel was the security. You didn't need a room key to access the elevators like in a lot of other hotels--anyone could access any floor. Also, the parking was good. We paid the extra $12 a day for parking at the hotel. It turned out to be a good thing. If you want the entire trip's parking charged to your room, they will give you a card-key to enter and exit the parking structure, so you don't have to deal with parking stubs-you come and go as you please and they bill you at the end. The parking structure is right next to the hotel. You just have to park on the upper floors cuz the first 2 floors are for valet parking only. But they have walkways leading from the upper parking floors right into the hotel lobby so it was very convenient. We were VERY lucky we didn't stay in one of the hotels closer to the heart of Waikiki--near where the Outriggers are and the Beachcomber Hotels. That was way way too noisy and crowded. I would have hated to have had a room either facing the streets or the beach as both are extremely noisy all day and all night. I guess that would be ok if you were young and just wanted to party all night long-but we have little kids and needed some quiet time. That's what I liked best about the Lagoon Tower--it was the last tower on the property and very quiet, yet you only had to walk a few hundred yards to get all the action at the beach. It was a great place to stay--you're staying in a timeshare without having to buy one. And there was never really any pressure to listen to their timeshare lectures. At the conceirge desk they ask if you're a renter or a buyer, then ask if you'd like to go to a lecture-but that's it. We walked through one of the Outrigger Hotels (with Dukes in it) and were totally put off by their sales lady. Every single time we walked past her booth she tried to grab us. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially with kids. Enough room for everyone and 2 tv's. Also there's a great coffee shop right across the main entrance to the hotel. All you can eat pancakes that come with egg/toast/coffee for about $3.99 a person. Open 24-hrs a day. Late mornings there's a line outside but it moves quickly.

The unit was new - granite countertops, new appliances, etc. One bedroom had a king - the other had 2 twin beds & the sofa pulled out to a bed. Bathrooms were both nice as well. Plenty of space for 4 adults and most important to me, it was clean. They do have washer & dryers but not in the actual units. They are down the hall and they are free so feel free to use them. If you call housekeeping, they will provide you with extra boxes of Tide.For those of you who have never been to HI before and imagine isolated beaches, the Waikiki area is not for you. Try visiting the Big Island or Maui or the North Shore of Oahu. For those of you who like ""city life"" near the beach, Wakiki is great. I have stayed at Hilton Hawaiian Village 2x before (1980 & 1993) and briefly lived in Honolulu in 1995. I can say that Hilton does have a great location in Waikiki - most other hotels do not have the amount of beach front or amenities. Yes, it is a very big hotel and almost like a little city by itself. My husband had never been to HI before and liked this the best (we visited the Big Island & Maui as well during this trip) He loved being able to learn to surf right there yet having all kinds of amenities around. It really depends on your likes/dislikes.2 definite must sees while in Oahu: Pearl Harbor & Hanauma Bay. If you go to Hanauma Bay, go EARLY (be there by 7:30am) and you will beat all the crowds and see SO much sea life. We swam around w/a sea turtle for good hour. It was wonderful.We ate at many of the restaurants at the Hilton and ventured to some other properties. I know someone commented about cost but actually Honolulu was much cheaper than the Big Island or Maui. But HI is expensive in general so be prepared for that.We had a late flight - 10pm but had to check out of our room by 10am. However, if you go over to the main lobby of the hotel to the ""Mail & Key"" desk you can sign up for a hospitality suite and get 20 min per person in a room to shower, etc. We did just that and it worked out great. Went to Hanauma Bay that morning, had lunch, beached it and then showered around 5pm, went to dinner and went to the airport. Great service.Overall, I think the HGVC at Hilton Hawaiian Village was very nice. Again, depends on your wants/needs in a vacation. I would not hesitate to stay there again.","Tampa, Florida",255,4.0

We stay in condos most of the time and own several timeshares. We had a week at the Marriott Ko Olina Timeshare but decided to do 3 extra nights at the Hilton Village Condos since this place has a reputation like it is THE place to stay in Waikiki. We had a 1 bedroom. The unit was nice, but primarily because it is very new. There's no washer/dryer (at least in the 1 bedroom). I'd say it was average to slightly below average size for a one bedroom. The tower the condos are in is the one furthest from the beachfront in the back of the complex - the village is huge with several towers as big as hotels in themselves. The Lagoon tower pool was a standard pool. The main pool was fancier but nothing compared to what you find at most the hotels in Las Vegas. The food and service was good, but not exceptional. The prices were too high, even for Honolulu. The room price was a rip-off. This place caters to the Japanese who aren't as price conscious as most Americans I think. Compared to the timeshare condos at the Marriott Ko Olina (and elsewhere), Hilton can't hold a candle to Marriott. The furnishings and size of the Marriott units are much better. If you want to stay in a new condo on Waikiki and aren't price sensitive, this may be your place, especially if you want a resort that has everything so you don't have to venture out of the resort (There's a little shopping/restaurant complex within the resort - the restaurants are nothing to write home about though.)
