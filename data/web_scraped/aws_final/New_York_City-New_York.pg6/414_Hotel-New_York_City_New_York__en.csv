We chose Hotel 414 and can’t imagine having picked a better place. We have been coming to New York City for more than 35 years. Hotel 414 is a small, boutique – style, beautifully appointed, cozy venue. The staff truly care that their guests have the best New York experience ever. A thoughtful continental breakfast greets you in the morning, and in the early evening a delightful wine and cheese, all set in a charming communal area by a fire.

We managed to score an amazing deal on our room for a long weekend, and now I don't ever want to stay anywhere else in the City. The location in Hell's Kitchen is spectacular--literally across 9th from ""Restaurant Row"", and within a very short walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and so many other places. The hotel is a traditional walk-up--so not suited for everyone, but the extra exercise is probably not a bad thing after the included (!) wine/cheese ""social hour"" (or more like a couple of hours)...and sitting by the fireplace, chatting with other guests, was also delightful. Breakfast is included, too...and a great cappuccino machine always at the ready. The rooms are huge (per NYC standards), clean, and surprisingly quiet. They even provide a mini fridge with a few sodas/water, plus a small selection of snacks, replenished daily--for only $1 each (which is practically free, especially by hotel norms)! All of those amenities are wonderful, but the real pleasure of staying at the 414 is the staff! Everyone we met was beyond friendly and helpful--they obviously care about ensuring their guests have an excellent stay, and they're quite knowledgeable about the area.

The hotel hosted many from the UK and France in addition to the US, which made for lively conversation. The staff was very nice and helpful. It was probably as close to having the experience of living in NYC as you can without actually paying rent. For those in the US used to chain hotels off freeway exits, just a few caveats that shouldn’t dissuade you from picking this hotel, but that you should know. Some rooms are slightly smaller than your average Holiday Inn Express. We had three in our room and things where just a little tight. Also - no elevator.

We made our reservations 9 months in advance, based on the location, perceived value and reviews on TripAdvisor. We were in touch with the staff a few times before our visit as they were extremely responsive to our questions, offered suggestions and even made our reservations for a car to pick us up from the airport, and get us back after our stay. From the moment we walked into the lobby, the staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. The cozy feel of the lobby and courtyard created an inviting atmosphere to get to know the other Guests while enjoying the breakfast or wine and cheese in the evening. While neither of these offerings are meant to replace a meal, we found them to be a great option that allowed us to better budget our other activities throughout the week, as we didn't need huge meals (which get expensive). The proximity to Restaurant Row, the Theatre District, Times Square and the Hudson put us right in the middle of almost everything we wanted to do. Traveling to other areas, such as Battery Park and the 9/11 Memorial was a quick ride via Lyft/Uber/Juno/etc... or a subway ride. Central Park is within walking distance as well, which also put us close enough to walk to the Lincoln Center and The Met.We stayed for 8 nights, but by the 2nd day we were already texting family and friends to recommend they book their next visit at the 414 Hotel.

The free continental breakfast offered a good variety of food and there was honest-to-God good free hotel coffee (a true rarity).

This is not a new hotel, and not modern. But the earnest and welcoming nature of the staff was exceptional and set the tone for a great stay. They were helpful, accommodated a variety of requests we had, and gave us great recommendations for new things to explore. We had arrived before check-in and went out for lunch, and upon our return we were touched to find our luggage and previously-shipped formal dress waiting for us in our room. A small gesture but above and beyond your typical experience.The standard rooms are bigger than most NYC hotels I've enjoyed in this price range. Being able to put luggage in one part of the room and still have a clear path to walk around cannot be understated. Didn't feel like a hotel room. Bed was too firm for me, but your mileage may vary. Quiet and cold A/C, nice TV and cable channels, large bathroom. Complementary sparkling wine and SNACKS FOR $1. Yes, a mini-can of Pringles for one dollar in a New York City hotel. Breakfast was modest but sufficient, the free happy hour had nice booze and great snacks. For comparison, we stayed at a newer hotel later that week for a similar price.

I knew I wouldn’t get the best room because of the special, but I got a nice room, except for the location, which was by the front desk, which made it rather noisy. Our room abutted the adorable little I courtyard, which was only a problem when the really loud people decided to sit out there and yack after 11 pm. The front desk asked them to quiet down. I thought there should be signs asking people to keep it down out there after a certain time. I don’t mind noise till 10 or so usually, but I was tired from traveling.

It was more reasonably priced than some of the other hotels in the theater district and had positive reviews, so decided to give it a try. I liked the fact that it was a more intimate accommodation than a big chain hotel (more like a B&B), and yet was in a perfect spot to hit the theater district and area restaurants. All staff members we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The front door is locked at night for security, but the lobby is manned 24 hours/day and someone is always available to buzz you in. Our room was clean and comfortable, but had a couple of drawbacks. It was located on the ground floor across the courtyard (which, by the way, would be a nice spot to sit on a pleasant day, but it was too cool, cloudy, wet during our visit to do so) and upon entering, we noted a strong damp, musty smell in the room (this might not be an issue on the upper floors, or perhaps the wet weather contributed). We could also hear the people upstairs walking around, but on the upside, there was no street traffic noise. It was a good sized room with a very comfortable, firm, king-sized bed outfitted with crisp white linens and plenty of pillows. While the furnishings were basic, it had everything we needed--plenty of closest and drawer space, a roomy bathroom with tub/shower combo (the sink/vanity was outside the bathroom--also convenient), good lighting, easily controllable heating/cooling, mini-fridge, ironing board/iron, and a safe. They include breakfast in the rate, and there's a selection of baked goods (scones were very tasty), cereal, yogurt, fruit, etc., offered. They also have a cheese and wine available in the early evening. Coffee and tea are available throughout the day. You can park on the next block over and get a $10 discount off the rate when the hotel stamps your parking ticket. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay and wouldn't hesitate to return to this property, although I'd probably choose a different room for the reasons stated above.","Poughkeepsie, New York",11,4.0

The hotel is located in a converted 4 story rowhouse on a residential part of 46th Street between 9th and 10th Ave, half a block away from the heart of the Hell’s Kitchen district of Mid-Town Manhattan. Great location about a 5-7 minute walk from Time Square 42nd street subway station or Port Authority Bus Terminal if arriving by public transportation. Check in was smooth and painless, and the room was a generous size for NYC standards. The room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was functional. Queen size bed was above average if not the best I’ve slept in. Strong wifi signal in the room and in the lobby was free of charge. Continental breakfast was included in the room rate and consisted of unlimited coffee/tea/espresso, orange juice, toasted bread/bagels with butter/cream cheese/jelly, a good selection of yogurts, scones, cereals, and assorted fruits. A basic but nonetheless satisfying way to start the day. The staff was extremely friendly and engaging, and was instrumental in assisting hotel guests with useful suggestions, trip planning, booking tours and reservations. I have been to coming to NY for the majority of my life, in fact growing up, I used to spend all my summers at my grandparents’ house in Queens, so I consider myself well versed on what to see and do and how to get around the City, but Jaqui was able to give us some useful tidbits that even I did not know about. Don’t hesitate to ask the staff of you need any advice or assistance to maximize the enjoyment of your stay. The only negative I feel I should point out is that there can be quite a bit of street noise that can be somewhat of a nuisance, especially in the middle of the night, from people (homeless or drunk) talking loudly, sirens, garbage trucks, etc. We stayed in room 404, which faces the street, but I imagine if you get one of the inside facing rooms, this may not be a major concern. This is not the hotels’s fault, and I don’t hold them responsible for what happens outside of their building, but I only bring this up in full disclosure. All in all, a great hotel in the best part of Manhattan, and at a very reasonable rate. Without equivocation, I give 414 Hotel my highest recommendation to anyone in search of a great hotel in the enchanting metropolis of New York.Dr. Kingstone Shih and Laura MenesesLos Altos, California USA","Los Altos, California",30,5.0

Some one is at the desk 24 hours a day and while the front door is locked, you will never have to wait to be buzzed in. While the hotel is far from modern and certain conveniences not evident, it still is a great place to stay. The only issues I found is that the courtyard had scaffolding that is in place for a reno next door that has been on hold and the staff office needs to be cleaned up since that is open to the lobby and eating area. They need to really give their staff clean carpeting and make it look like ownership cares about the staff. Such a wonderful staff and the access to them is key to the needs of the guests.

The rooms, while not big or luxurious are comfy, with nice amenities and, at least in the back, are very quiet. But it's the staff who make the place sing. You are treated like family and the congenitally that they (and especially Rachel) create in the combination reception /breakfast-happy hour area is almost magical. Complete strangers open up to each other in the blink of an eye. As someone who has literally traveled all over the world I've never experienced such instantaneous camaraderie as the 414 creates. The staff also bends over backwards to make your stay great. We found a wallet outside the hotel on the way back fron dinner one night and while it had the owner's driver's license and credit cards there was no address or telephone number. What to do? The staff took over and went on Facebook to track him down and by the next morning reunited him with his property. Try getting that kind of service at a Hilton. Also, had the best coffee I've ever had at a hotel. Did I forget to mention that the rates are incredibly good for such a well situated place and your room rate includes free breakfasts and wifi. You're right on Restaurant Row and a stone's throw from all the Broadway theaters and lights. One caution, there's no elevator in this three story hotel, spread over three repurposed tenements, so that could be an issue for some.",,71,5.0

The rooms are smallish, comfortable and reasonably appointed. Not luxury but perfectly adequate, clean and everything worked well. The real secret of this place though are the little “extras” that are not always typical in NYC. There’s a daily continental breakfast included that’s a good start. The room has beverages and snacks, all priced at $1! (Yep, $1, not a typo). There’s a fun happy hour each day from 5:30-7 with beer, wine some liquor and cheese. We had fun mingling.

She does not give praise lightly.From the moment we booked over the phone from the UK, Jacqui and her staff were friendly and helpful - we knew this place was going to be different. A daily newsletter every morning with the weather report and suggestions for sightseeing opportunities helped with our daily planning once we were in New York. When we had to cut our visit short and fly cross country to attend a funeral, the 414 team held onto our luggage and welcomed us back like family when we returned to catch our homeward flight back to the UK. Whether we were trying to get to the airport or to a location across town, there was always a detailed set of instructions ready to be printed out; the hotel 'where-to-eat' guide is a must-read for its wit and scope. The daily social hour was a delight; billed as a wine and cheese tasting, there was a broad selection of refreshments on offer. An international clientele ensured stimulating conversation and made for entertaining evenings. We felt that every member of staff was interested in making our stay pleasant. During our week-long stay, we witnessed on countless occasions how the 414 team responded to the needs and requests of their guests with imagination, care and humour.

The positive: The employees, 5 star all the way. All were kind and helpful and totally sincere in their efforts. We felt welcome at all times. There is not enough good that can be said about everyone we met who worked at the 414 Hotel. The building is lovely and historic. An old late 19th to early 20th century tenement from the working class days of Hells Kitchen. So much nicer to stay at a building with character vice another same old, same old Marriott. The location is so convenient, just a short walk to Times Square, shopping, theaters and restaurants. Subway is near by for trips up or down town. I read a few reviews where a guest said they felt unsafe in the neighborhood, not so. Not once did I feel unsafe walking day time or night. I am a 60 year old woman and was with my 15 year old granddaughter, no fear. Certainly one must remain cognizant of their surroundings and walk with confidence, but that is the best advice anywhere, not just in NYC. Our room was very quiet. We were in a garden room (partially below grade) in the back building and it is a very quiet location. Though the courtyard is right out the door for other guests to sit and enjoy, we never heard anyone being loud. Our bed was very comfortable, sleep was easy. Breakfast was continental, and satisfying. An assortment of bagels, breads, scones and english muffins with various jams and butter, cereals, juice and fruit, coffee and tea. All good. Now, to the negative: The room smelled of mildew. Not overwhelming but noticeable at all times. Now, I think this was because NYC had just received days of heavy rain, way above normal, and with this being a below grade room, it would take time to resolve. The in room ductless air system temperature was turned very low when we entered, to 62 degrees, and I think this was in an effort to try to dry out the dampness as fast as possible, but to no avail. The room was small, but this was expected and perfectly fine. We had enough space. It has seen better days and is in need of a in depth cleaning and update. Surface cleaning was being done, meaning, the tub, toilet and sink were clean, and the linens, but every where you looked you noted dirt. Baseboards, not wiped in months, heavy dust. Even the tops of each wall and outlet plate, never wiped, evident dirt. You could feel it, you could see it. The I assume granite counter tops were beyond help. Possibly because they were never resealed, but ring marks and high wear evident. An overall dog eared appearance. It would seem that for not a very great cost, management could reinvest some money to update (and deep clean!!!) and have a true gen in the heart of midtown. It is very reminiscent of bed and breakfasts that I stayed at in Europe, small and intimate, and if only given a bit of TLC (and again, cleaning) well it could be a WOW! Thanks to the staff for making our stay a welcoming one, you were all so hospitable and gracious.","Leonardtown, MD",126,3.0

I had to walk up to the fourth floor, which was tiring enough after a long day of walking, and it was just so warm.

The bathroom had no fan, and in a tiny hotel room this is something that should definitely be in place. The hotel provided Q-tips, but after the four days they were gone, but never refilled. One morning, housekeeping left two conditions instead of a shampoo and conditioner. The patio could have been an inviting place to sit and relax, but no plants were growing in the numerous pots around the patio. The scaffolding on the patio was in place because of construction next door, but it would have gone a long way to making the patio inviting by simply putting some shade loving plants in the pots. I had a couple of questions for the staff, but on two different occasions they never got back to me when they said they would. We did love the social hour every evening from 5:30-7:00 where they provide wine and cheese for the guests. In addition, most of the staff were nice and polite. ","San Diego, California",1,2.0

My wife and I stayed here in April on our honeymoon to the United States, and were drawn to 414 by its location within the city (Hell's Kitchen - well placed for getting around), and for the excellent feedback that it had drawn in its guest experience.We were not disappointed in the slightest - a warm welcome from Emmy and the team was followed by the delightful surprise of a bottle of sparkling wine and some chocolates in our room - not only had the hotel been able to fulfil our request for a top floor room, but they'd also marked our anniversary date and we were touched by their generosity.The room itself was pleasant and more than adequate in size, we found ourselves able to sleep comfortably there, with little disturbance whatsoever by any noise from the city, or from other guests. As a top floor room, it might be troublesome for those with reduced mobility or lots of luggage (no lift in this townhouse building), but we managed well enough.Before we ventured out into NYC, the hotel was able to give us advice, information, a transport map, and even respond to our queries about different experiences or ideas that we'd seen or considered prior to arrival. They even pointed out a serviced laundrette about 5 doors away (after a week of travelling this was welcome), and the same day service offered there was both affordable and convenient.Breakfast is also a real treat at 414, and whilst not a 'hot' offering, it is substantially provided for with cereals, breads, bagels, preserves, yoghurts, and fruit - accompanied by tea, coffee, juice and water. All included in the room rate, of excellent quality and much appreciated - only advice would be to avoid 8-8:30 as limited seating makes it a squeeze! Another little touch, and enjoyed by ourselves on our return from forays into the city), was the ability to make a coffee in the hotel foyer - no facility in the room, but I think I actually prefer this option, as you end up with a better drink, and a chance to socialise.On departure, we were concerned on getting to our airport hotel at JFK, and didn't fancy trying public transport for this, as we weren't too sure how easy it would be for the last leg at least. 414 did us the courtesy of approaching a private hire firm (sadly I've forgotten their name), and booking a car to come and pick us up - with an indicative price offered there and then, so no taking a chance with NYC taxi cab meters in traffic (a good job, as there was a lot of traffic!). Just another example of what the team at 414 are willing to do to make your stay stand out - they really did go the extra mile for us, and we won't forget them.

I called 414 Hotel to tell them and was impressed to be speak with such a warm and personable response; they made me feel like they were family anxiously waiting our arrival the next day. The storms delayed our arrival until late the following evening at 414 Hotel, but we found it well worth the trip! There was a welcoming, cozy fire going in a welcoming lobby highlighted with bright red accents. The front desk staff remembered we were the ones who didn't make it the day before and made us feel special as they asked about our trip. I was thrilled to then be shown to a wonderful, clean room that was cozy and had all the amenities I needed. The staff was knowledgeable about the area, and listed wonderful restaurants nearby which were still open and where we subsequently had a wonderful meal. They helped us plan how to efficiently get to our early morning destination the next day. I would highly recommend staying at 414 Hotel with a great location, super friendly and helpful staff, very clean and comfortable rooms.

I have never been able to stay in New York City longer than 24 hours until this trip. You see, I have difficulty sleeping with a lot of ambient noise. On my one other previous trip to the City, I was on the 23rd floor of a prominent hotel on Times Square and it was a horrible experience with traffic noises and sirens all night. Also surprising to me, I found it very claustrophobic among the skyscrapers with only a thin strip of sky visible overhead. It ruined the City for me......... until now.414 Hotel is another rare example that goes into my “gets it right” column. First off, you should not expect the usual large lobby and big crowds usually found in big city hotels. This is a great example of a small, quaint European hotel translated into a rather suppisingly quiet area of Hell’s Kitchen in Manhattan. You CAN see the sky, in that the surrounding buildings are lower- not skyscrapers.At recept, you are warmly greeted by Jacque, he general manager and also will get to meet Ashley, the affable evening manager. They both exude a genuine concern for the comfort and enjoyability of your stay. The hotel was rendered from a tennament built in 1925. In there hotel information, they are upfront about the fact they have no elevator, but knowing this ahead of time they were able to accommodate me with a first floor roomThe rooms are neat and clean . Some thought has been put into the features of the room— for example, I have to use CPAP for sleeping and they have a plug-in station on the bedside table with multiple ports available. This avoids the usual moving of furniture and even the bed, I have had to undergo at some of the more expensive luxury hotels in which I have stayed in th past. Also, they have a modern bedside phone that incorporates an alarm clock and multiple charging extensions for most recent versions of electronics. Other amenities include flatscreen TV, fridge, a selection of snacks (for only a dollar each!), a small closet cabinet and tiled bath with complimentary toiletries which is CLEAN. A small selection of pastries, juices are available for a continental breakfast in the mornings and a wine and cheese social hour in the evenings compliments of the establishment.By the way, did I mention it was QUIET— I was able to take several naps and sleep at night with NO sirens, horns or traffic noises. Ah, what a refreshing change from my last visit! This hotel has opened up my ability to explore and enjoy this vibrant city.There are a few drawbacks— the room when I arrived was really hot, but this was remedied by cracking open the window which opens onto a small, enclosed rear courtyard. Also, the room was small, but what do you expect from a 1925 tenement.Overall, an A+ for attitude, environmental noise avoidance and a feeling of “at home” comfort. A really nice haven in the big city!","Hickory, North Carolina",24,5.0

I don't think so, unless hotel standards in NYC are much lower than in European or Asian cities. A hotel should first and foremost provide a good night's sleep, which was difficult due to the noisy neighbourhood(front room), uncomfortable bed and worst of all the inability to regulate room temperature efficiently.

This was our first trip to the city in over 10 years and our very first time experiencing the city together so I was looking for a nice central location that would allow us to do the typical touristy things as well as experience great food and get a bit of a feel for what it was like to live like a New Yorker. I spend a lot of time researching where to stay so the positive reviews on Trip Advisor were a big part of why I selected this hotel and I can now say from first hand experience, all the accolades are well deserved. From the moment we walked through the welcoming red door, this hotel exceeded all my expectations. We felt like all the staff genuinely cared about all the guests and sincerely wanted them to have the best experience possible. Here are some of the highlights for us.HOTEL: The building is a cute NYC walkup, the typical tenement style building you see in the movies that makes you feel more like you are staying at a friend's apartment than a typical hotel. If you are looking for your typical Marriott or Hilton feel, this is not the place for you. Our room was on the 3rd floor of the main building and required a climb up 3 flights of stairs but that just added to the experience for me. The cheery red and white awnings and benches in the small entry courtyard are a welcome sight after a day of exploring the city. The main floor has a large table and a few small ones to take your breakfast or enjoy the evening happy hour. There is also a nice courtyard between the 2 buildings. The small kitchen off the lobby is accessible all day with a coffee machine that makes fantastic drinks as well as a microwave to heat up an occasional leftover. ROOM: Our room was a premium queen facing the courtyard on the 3rd floor. It was clean and quiet, nothing fancy. I appreciated having a small refrigerator in the room and dual nightstands at the bed with plenty of outlets for charging phones, etc. There was a large wall mounted television which we did not use and a wall mounted air conditioner which was working hard as it was an extremely warm week in NYC. Our bathroom had bath/ sink/ toilet all in one, not with the sink outside as I've seen mentioned in a few reviews. An additional shelf/ counter space in the bathroom would have been helpful but we appreciated the nice thick towels and eco friendly toiletries. AMMENITIES: As mentioned, there is a breakfast put out each morning. There are bagels, pastries, yogurt as well as cereal and fruit. In the evening, there is wine and brandy as well as an assortment of cheese and crackers set out to encourage more gathering. These joint social hours, combined with the friendliness of the staff, seem to set the tone for an open, family like environment between everyone. We met many fellow guests and enjoyed hearing about where they were from and what they were up to in the city. In addition to these perks, there is a daily newsletter put out for guests with weather forecasts and helpful ideas for how to spend the day. We took advantage of the free library tour and the free Friday night at MOMA, both of these suggestions were featured in our daily letter. We also made use of the complimentary umbrellas on a rainy morning. There is a selection of travel books and brochures in the lobby to help plan your day as well as a two page printout handed out at checkin with local dining recommendations. I found this to be very helpful as the number of dining choices in the area are almost overwhelming. Our favorite from the list was Pio Pio. We also tried a Brazilian restaurant, Samba, just around the corner from the hotel that wasn't featured on the hotel's list but was excellent. STAFF: This is where the hotel truly shines. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the warm and friendly Drew, who checked us in. We were tired from a day of travel and a little frazzled from a lost luggage problem and he wisely suggested a close by and delicious Thai restaurant for a quick bite that night. He always had a big smile and a friendly greeting for us each day and we looked forward to seeing him in between running off to our New York adventures. I also appreciated that upon entering our room that evening, we were welcomed with chocolates, champagne and a handwritten card from Susan, the hotel manager, wishing us 'Happy Anniversary'. Jacqui and Susan were there to welcome everyone in the morning and were both so hands on with all their guests. On our first morning, we opted to eat our breakfast outside on the bench overlooking the street and Susan promptly had a table brought out for us to eat over. Jacqui graciously provided me with some coupons for shopping as I needed to get a few things while waiting on my lost suitcase as well as some tips on where to get some basics in the area. As another example of their personal touch, my husband and I got caught in a rainstorm during a run in Central Park one morning. The hotel called our room upon our return, offering their dryer for our wet clothes.Finally I should mention how helpful Rachel was upon leaving. She arranged a car service for us to JFK and even made me a cappucinno in a 'to go' cup to take on the drive. I have never felt so cared for by the staff of a hotel. Customer service sometimes seems like a lost art but this hotel gets it and it never feels forced or insincere. Just great people who excel in their industry and seem to love what they do. LOCATION: This hotel is in a fantastic location for sightseeing but it's also ideal if you are a runner! It is less than a mile to the Hudson River greenway or Central Park, both places offer some of the best running in the city without having to dodge traffic. We were also pleasantly surprised by how much walking we did to get around as SO many things were around a mile or so from the hotel that it was just easier to walk there. We walked to Broadway shows, Grand Central, Bryant Park, New York Public Library, High Line, Central Park, Lincoln Center, MOMA and Empire State Building. At no time, either on the subways or walking back to the hotel late at night, did we ever feel unsafe. The area definitely has a more quiet, residential feel then Times Square but that is exactly what we enjoyed the most. I really fell in love with the city this trip and I think where we chose to stay was a big reason for that. Thank you so much, Susan and staff for making our 20th anniversary so memorable.Sincerely,Nicole and Jon in AZ","Tucson, Arizona",6,5.0

The hotel has the most welcoming and friendly staff that my wife and I have ever encountered in our travels. Jacqui, Susan (the manager) and Drew were all very friendly and welcoming every time we came back ""home"" from sightseeing or seeing a play. Jacqui and Susan were particularly helpful and knowledgeable and gave us numerous suggestions of restaurants and other things to do both before we arrived and once we were guests at the hotel. They even give their clients a daily bulletin detailing things to do and places to go, including money saving tips for many of the suggestions. Each afternoon at 5 or so, the staff puts out wine and cheese (and some very fine single-malt Scotches and single-barrel Bourbons, I might add) for their guests. Many of the guests are from other countries, and the wine and cheese party gives everyone the opportunity to get to know each other better. There is also a small courtyard, which is a very pleasant place to have the hotel-provided continental breakfast, to savor your wine and cheese, and to just chat with the other very interesting travelers. The rooms are simple and small (as one would expect in a European-style hotel in NYC), and the beds are queen-sized, but the room and the bathroom were very clean and surprisingly quiet.

I don't have anything overly negative to say, but I honestly am not sure why this hotel is rated this high on TA. But here are my thoughts.....Good- 1)Hotel is conveniently located near broadway, so that was a plus for sure. 2)The staff is very personable. I think this may one of the main reasons why this hotel is rated so highly. All the staff were helpful and there to do anything for you. They always had a smile when you walked in the door. The staff was outstanding.3)No street noise. We stayed in the back building and never heard any street noise. We could hear footsteps above us but luckily for us it wasn't bad at all. 4) room is fairly plain, but functional and clean.The rest:1) I guess my expectations were higher as the hotel was so highly rated on TA. We have been to NY on 4 other occasions and I wouldn't by any means rate this as the #1 hotel we stayed at in NY, and as I mentioned thats only comparing it to the 4 other establishments we stayed at. So not sure how its rated #1 or #2 in the whole city. Not the hotels fault at all, but I suggest you temper your expectations.2) The room was clean, but it was in no way the least bit luxurious. Just a basic room with some areas that looked like they could use some minor repairs or paint. Nothing that didn't work etc, just cosmetic items, but again not really what I expected.3) Although close to times square, I didn't care for this area of town. I was expecting the neighbourhood to maybe be a bit quieter, but the streets were very hectic and it was not a quiet area at all. We stayed in the mid town east area on a previous stay and found that area of manhattan to be very quiet in comparison. ( but not as accessible to times square)Thats about it. Again, I would in no way say not too stay here, but I am very surprised its rated this high on TA. I would say perhaps I could see it being rated highly for value perhaps? Maybe? but overall one of the top 2 or 3 hotels in NY, my opinion is no.","Chilliwack, Canada",105,4.0

The staff has extensive knowledge regarding site seeing attractions, things not to miss, transportation, restaurants, festivals and if they don't know they will try to find out in a timely manner. Jacqui was able to find me hairspray in a matter of minutes in a semi emergency situation. The hotel location is perfect for walking access to Broadway shows. Just a couple of blocks walk to the Hudson River where we were able to see some Fleet Week festivities. We enjoyed interacting with our fellow travelers (international clientele) at breakfast in the morning and wine, bourbon and cheese in the evenings.

Susan and her team have created an environment within this 22 room hotel, which works perfectly for any visitor looking for the antidote to the typical big, brash skyscraper option. You're on first name terms with the staff and many of the guests by day two, mainly as everyone feels relaxed and happy to share a story or an idea over breakfast or the late afternoon 'happy hour', which are both included in the price.Not everything was perfect and our room at the front of the property was noisier than expected. However, Susan listened sympathetically and managed to resolve the issue with an alternate room, with the minimum of fuss.She and team will happily offer advice and ideas, but equally take a note of places their guests have found, which weren't on their already encyclopaedic list. They even provide a welcome postal service, for those of us who still send postcards. So if you've read this far, bet you'll be contacting the 414 very soon.","Nottingham, United Kingdom",15,5.0

No, instead you will be a part of a small 22 room hotel that will feel like a community thanks to the staff and the hotel guests you will meet during the free breakfasts and happy hour. It will start to feel like home. Throughout the trip, I would say things like ""When we get back home"" when I meant to say ""When we get back to the hotel.""During breakfast, Susan and her crew will ask you how your prior day was. They will ask you what you have planned for the day, and if you tell them what you plan on doing, they will offer general tips and guidance on how to get there. For example, we told Susan we were planning on going to Central Park, and she told us she recommended taking the blue line to 72nd Street and then gave us her recommended route through Central Park. It was fantastic!You'll have a daily newsletter at your door giving you details on the weather, as well as tips on what to do on that day. For example, Friday's newsletter said the Museum of Modern Art is free on Friday evenings. On a sunny day it recommended walking the Brooklyn Bridge and on a rainy day, the newsletter had museum recommendations.A few weeks before arriving I asked Susan for Broadway recommendations and she recommended a musical called Come From Away, which my wife and I both loved. Susan was also aware that my wife and I were traveling to celebrate our wedding anniversary and they provided us with a free bottle of champagne and chocolates. On our last day at the hotel, another couple celebrating an anniversary was there and the couple's children brought out a similar gift provided by the hotel and the entire room of people having breakfast sang them a happy anniversary version of the happy birthday song. Another time, Susan asked one of her employees to make 7 more eggs as the eggs were running out and a different employee said that it should be doubled to 14 as multiple guests had still not come down for breakfast. It's the attention to small details like this that make the hotel such an awesome place to stay.You're not going to get a luxurious hotel room, but the room we stayed in was clean,quiet, had a comfortable bed, nice tv with multiple cable channels, and functioning AC. What it won't have are outrageous prices for daring to take a bottle or water or candy from the in-room refrigerator. Just $1 for whatever you take.My one gripe with the hotel? The door to our room was tough to close. Maybe it's because we didn't want to leave.",,4,5.0

We were in NYC to sightsee as well as to see several Broadway shows so this location near the theater district was ideal for us. We had easy walk to the various theaters as well as short walks to the Subway stations. We also loved being in more of a neighborhood setting.The staff at the hotel were amazing! Each of them made an effort to talk with us and get to know us. They were more than happy to help plan our days and give advice for getting around. They also took care of arranging our airport transportation.We enjoyed having the included breakfast with bagels, toast, etc. available in the mornings and the happy hour every evening is a bonus! Nice to sit and relax after a long day of sightseeing.We were on the 4th floor in a Premium Queen bed room. The room was very spacious, especially for NYC. The room has a nice sized TV, a room safe, dresser with drawers, mini-fridge, closet, free wifi, and a window AC unit with a very handy remote for changing temps. Our only real drawback was we found the mattress to be overly soft, at least for our tastes. Just a heads up, the hotel does not have an elevator in the event someone is physically unable to navigate stairs. The staff was more than happy to carry luggage for people though!Overall, a great location with a really terrific staff. We look forward to our next NYC stay here.","Saint Louis, Missouri",52,5.0

This was our third time in New York, having previously stayed at the more corporate hotels. The 414, as it clearly states, is not your typical hotel. It's not high rise, it's not corporate, it's not even that hotel-like in many respects.What makes this place is the hospitality. During our stay we were looked after by Susan, Jackie, John and Drew at different times and all were fabulously friendly and welcoming.It was like having our own personal trip advisors on hand to tell s the out of the way places to visit and eat at.Each morning, a news letter was popped through the door with little tips on where to visit that day - and we took a few of them up.Don't expect luxury in the sense of what the big hotels offer. The rooms are quite basic in many respects and not what you'd call modern or polished.IN fact, when we were first shown to our room, a premium suite on the courtyard, we were both a little underwhelmed. There was a musty smell that was very noticeable when first entering, but which wasn't after a few moments. The bed was large and comfortable. There was air conditioning and a heater, an iron and ironing board, plus a TV and fridge.The bathroom comprised a shower over the bath tub, plus a WC. The sink was outside the bathroom, in the bedroom, which is a little difficult if you need a little privacy (even after 28 years of marriage).But all of that said, it didn't in any way detract from the experience.We've stayed in the big hotels in New York - 56 floors up, but never have we felt like it was returning home each night. It's hard to explain how they achieve this, but i think it's just that everyone takes an interest in you.A continental breakfast is served in the lobby each morning and this is where it gets interesting. You find yourself talking to people - not only the staff, but the other guests. You share experiences, get to learn more about the places to visit.Not once did anyone say to us, go to the top of the Rock, or the Empire State Building. Instead, we took a less travelled path and visited the High Line - a park made from the old raised train line that ran through the meat packing district.We went to the Tenement Museum and ate at places we'd never have dreamed of going if we hadn't shared our experiences in this way.I emailed the hotel on the morning before we arrived and asked if they could arrange some flowers for my wife for the following morning.Not only did they do this, but they also played along with the moans and groans of the other guests when my wife jokingly complained that I hadn't got her an anniversary card. Then they produced the flowers and made the moment all the more special.The 414 Hotel won't be for everybody. It's clean, it's central to everything, but it lacks the bells and whistles that might be expected by some (including me usually). But I think it's all the better for it.It's the people that make this place special, so thanks Susan & Jackie in particular for all of your assistance and care during our stay.","Wythall, United Kingdom",129,5.0

You can't get better service for twice this price in Manhattan. Susan and her team help you feel like it's your home away from home.

The continental breakfasts are good and the evening happy hours are great. Also appreciate coffee, espresso and tea all day long. In good weather, the small courtyard is lovely. Just as important, the location is fantastic - 2 short blocks to Broadway, 15 min walk to Columbus Circle, 30 minute walk to Chelsea Market, as well as easy subway or cab accessibility to most of NY. We even walked to the upper east side on a nice day.Note that there are only 2 rooms on the ground floor and all other rooms are walk-ups and noise can be an issue on the first floor.

We will have long-lasting happy memories of our stay. Mostly because of you and your staff’s hospitality and your unique way of making people feel relaxed and able to socialise with each other. In fact we would often pass a large hotel where we could look in and see the guests neatly placed on individual tables for breakfast, and notice how unfriendly and austere it all looked and were very grateful we were going back to 414. We were also very grateful for the morning newsletter, not only advising us of what was going on, but also the weather, which was a great help when deciding on what to wear for the day!With regard to the room, it suited all our needs and most importantly, the bed was extremely comfortable. This was a real plus for me as I have a chronic back problem. Mind you, the amount of walking we did each day, I think I could have slept propped up in the corner somewhere. Happy hour(s)!! What a very special time that was. After a hard day of sight-seeing, it was such a lovely welcome to come into a friendly atmosphere where you could relax with a drink and recount the day’s events with other guests and gain ideas for the following day. Also, the fact that it was free just blew us away, New York is rather expensive, so it was nice just to think we didn’t have to worry about paying and tipping as soon as we came back. It was like coming back home! It was at this time that our friendship with an Australian couple began and hopefully it hasn’t ended as we have already exchanged emails and have invited them over to us next year when they have finished their travels. Thank you again for thinking of us re the theatre tickets for 'Oslo' and sorting out the discounts for Come From Away which was extremely well executed with amazingly talented actors! We would love to come back to New York as we didn’t do everything, although I’m not sure when that will be possible. I really wanted to visit the jazz bar you mentioned but unfortunately we had to leave. I was very envious of Tracey and Brad as they were staying longer, and later they emailed us to tell us they had visited Harlem where they found beer at $3 a bottle! Not that alcohol is a major concern, but it would have been nice to celebrate the fact together!So hopefully, we will return to the amazing 414 hotel in NYC where the vibe is great, the staff are super-friendly and the Happy Hour is awesome! (to coin an American phrase).Lots of love to you and all your staff who made our stay one of the best we have ever encountered.","Alberobello, Italy",100,5.0

Breakfast in the morning was what you expected----pleasant and nothing over the top. But the conversations with other travelers, learning about their experiences, was what we were there for! This cozy spot was our home for the week!The room was plenty spacious for the 3 of us (we had a rollaway/cot/bed for our daughter). We were only there for sleeping and bathing. Susan was able to get us a discount code for what ended up being our favorite show of the week, Come From Away.The hotel is within easy walking distance of practically everything. And we weren't shy about using the subway either---felt fine/safe all week! If you don't get enough walking in, the stairs to the top of the 4th floor finished our cardio workout for the day.

The room was immaculately presented and very clean which is important to me. The bed was amazing and cable TV on large flatscreen made everything very comfortable. Breakfast is like being at a relatives house as everyone is chatting to each other and Susan the manager is the loveliest person who you can tell genuinely cares for her guests like they are family. Having stayed at 5 star international hotels all over the world this was certainly a different experience and one which I really loved. Also apart from the location being perfect and walking distance to Times Square etc it was very reasonably priced. 3 nights was around $1000 USD total which represents excellent value in my opinion.

From my initial enquiry a year ago to booking airport transfers the week before arrival Susan provided the most efficient and professional service but with the most lovely human touch.Hotel 414 is in the most perfect location .... in the thick of everything but with the benefit of being in a quiet residential street. The rooms were clean and spacious with a large bathroom and complimentary toiletries. The continental breakfast was generous and the coffee delicious whilst the wine and cheese happy hour was a lovely gesture from a small hotel which made guests feel that they were enjoying a glass of wine in their own home.What was fabulous for NYC newbies like ourselves was the brilliant advice, tips and help Susan and all her staff offered. Restaurant recommendations, help with navigating routes and public transport as well as suggestions which were invaluable in making our 5 days so special. Susan went beyond the call of duty when she discovered we had been disappointed with one of our sight seeing trips and arranged for tickets to be reissued for us to go again.

We don't usually take the time to write a review but our experience at this hotel on both occasions is second to none and we travel a lot. Susan (the hotel manager) is a warm and welcoming hostess, as are her lovely staff, and they all work hard to run a home away from home for all of the hotel guests. The hotel is centrally located for a walk home from the theatre but on a quiet, tree lined street outside of the noise and frenetic energy of midtown. The Hell's Kitchen neighborhood is full of great food options and there is more of a neighborhood feel than central midtown could provide. The free breakfast is excellent and the happy hour with a wide variety of alcoholic drinks and cheeses/crackers is an added bonus that you just don't see at chain hotels. The rooms are spacious and very clean and on both visits we never had any issues whatsoever; although I feel confident that if we did, the staff would have addressed it promptly. Because of the small size of the hotel, you have an opportunity to connect with like minded travellers from all over the world during breakfast and happy hour and Susan and her staff take the time to produce a daily newsletter which you will find at your doorstep each day with helpful insights into the city's tourist hotspots. We are somewhat reluctant to spread the word about this hotel because we are afraid in future that we won't be able to get a room!

I went and told Wes, who was working that night, and he noticed two light bulbs were out. He went to look for new bulbs. When he went to change the bulbs, something happened, and the overhead light and the lights in the bathroom didn't work at all. After checking the bulbs and the circuit breaker and calling Susan, the owner/manager, she offered to put me up at her other location because the hotel was completely full that night. It was already late, and my daughter and I were tired, so we decided to stay, and Susan voided the charge for the room for the night. The bed was really comfortable, and my daughter and I both slept great. The next morning, the super was there and fixed it immediately. At breakfast, Susan was so lovely and again so apologetic. That all being said, I wouldn't hold the unfortunate event against staying in the hotel again. Everyone on staff was so lovely and willing to bend over backwards. They were so knowledgeable about everything in NY, as I heard them telling other guests where to go, what to do, where to get free wi-fi, etc. This was a lovely little boutique hotel that really allows you to feel that you're a part of a NYC neighborhood rather than staying in a big corporate hotel in Times Square, which is only a few blocks away. I would highly recommend this hotel not only because it includes a lovely continental breakfast, and there's wine and cheese for happy hour every night, but it is really cute and homey and it's nice to be a bit off the beaten path in NYC.

We'd lived in NY over 20 years ago, and had been back for an occasional night on business, and many times as day tourists, but had never come to the city and spent multiple nights during a vacation. We have traveled extensively, and typically select 5 star hotels, choosing 414 because of the excellent rating on TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed. The accommodations are simple and clean, and the location is excellent. The continental breakfast is plentiful (bagels, muffins, cold cereal, hot cereal packets, fruit, coffee and tea), and they never came close to running out, even though we lingered once breakfast was over. It was wonderful to be able to interact with other guests, both during breakfast and during the evening wine and cheese, where guests were so friendly that they shared the cheese that they'd purchased during an outing that day. The true highlight was the staff. Emmy, Jacqui, John, and Drew were friendly and helpful, attending to our every need. They were truly interested in our plans for the day, and often had recommendations regarding a more efficient way to get where we were going, what to see on our way, or how to stay dry on a cold and rainy day. They were equally attentive to each guest, making us all feel that we were right at home. We had a minor glitch with our room, and the way that both the staff, and Susan the manager responded was absolutely amazing. Highlights of our trip included a recommendation that we see the new Broadway Play, ""Come from Away"", which was excellent, as well as watching the taping of a scene from Blue Bloods, two doors down from the hotel, late that night on our way home. The icing on the cake was Susan's kindness in walking with us to Port Authority, as she was leaving on our last day, helping us to get our luggage to the bus.

Overall we had a wonderful trip and were very happy with our choice but I will just note down a few pros and cons for other visitors:Pros: LOCATION: Hell's Kitchen is ideally located for many of the keys NYC sights and particularly for those interested in visiting a Broadway show. The hotel is 5 mins walk from two subway stops and there is a frankly ridiculous choice of restaurants with cuisine from all around the world within a couple of blocks. Anyone slightly apprehensive about the area based on its former reputation needn't be worried as its heavily gentrified and we felt perfectly safe throughout our trip.SERVICE: Coming from London, it was refreshing to see how much better the Americans are at service generally but the staff at 414 really go the extra mile. Susan the owner is extremely friendly and personable and both Emmy and Wes were fantastically helpful and chatty (as were the other staff who's names I didn't catch!). As the hotel is relatively small, the staff do get to know you (and vice versa) and were great when it came to moving restaurant bookings, arranging cars and recommending place to eat and sights to see. ROOM: By NYC standards our room was very large, comfortable and equipped with useful extras such as a universal charging point for our phones and ipad. PRICE: New York is very expensive, especially for the British right now but compared to other hotels we looked at, 414 presents very good value for money. Cons:NOISE: Its not really the hotel's fault given the location and no one comes to NYC expecting a restful vacation but we did struggle to sleep on each of our nights there. We had a room at the front looking down on to West 46th St and although they have double glazing and secondary internal glazing, it was still very noisy with the usual sounds of NYC throughout the night. Suppose that's just the price to pay for being in the middle of the action but it would be something to consider if you are a light sleeper. BREAKFAST: Difficult to put this as a ""con"" really but the breakfast is fairly basic. No hot food but does the job if you're grabbing a quick bite before heading out. Overall we had a wonderful trip to NYC and would like to thank all at 414 for their work. Noise would be the only reason I didn't give the hotel 5 stars and would be happy to recommend to anyone.","London, United Kingdom",26,4.0

From the moment we arrived, Susan and her staff made us feel as if they had waited their entire lives for us to walk through the door. Not just the usual hotel welcoming smiles, but true sincerity of their intent to make us feel comfortable in their home. The property consists of two 4 floor walk-ups between 9th and 10th on W 46th...22 (or 23?) rooms tops. The 2 buildings are separated by a courtyard that was in sleep mode (we stayed for an overnight this past weekend--a wildly warm couple of days in February) but we can see from the photos that it is just beautiful during the warmer seasons. We had a room in the second building with a queen size bed overlooking the courtyard. It was clean and perfect for our needs. The continental breakfast was perfect for our needs. We didn't take advantage of the evening happy hour as we had a bit of a walk to the restaurant for dinner that night, but what a terrific perk to this incredible hotel! Walking back from the broadway show later that evening took 10 min tops, and it was so nice to know we didn't have to drive back to the Island (Long Island)!

All were friendly, helpful, and just really nice people.When we checked in, there was a sweet surprise in our room - a mug full of chocolates and a sweet birthday card. We got in around lunch time and asked Susan for a recommendation for Thai food. She sent us to the cutest Thai place that we would not have found on our own. It was wonderful. Do get suggestions from Susan and the staff while you're there!Our room was clean and large (especially for NYC), and very comfortable. There is a happy hour in the evenings, and a nice breakfast in the mornings. The other people who were staying at the hotel were obviously taken by the friendly vibe - breakfast was like sitting around with friends, enjoying each others' travel stories. When I go back, I'll have to be sure to plan around happy hour! This is definitely not your run-of-the-mill, faceless, huge hotel. The hotel is perfectly located. There are a ton of great restaurants on 46th (restaurant row), it is a very short walk to the theatre district and Times Square, and about a mile walk to Central Park.

I have traveled to NYC many times and have stayed at a variety of properties throughout Manhattan. Now that I have found the 414 Hotel, I am not even close to being slightly tempted to try some of the other top rated TripAdvisor hotels. I dare you to find another hotel with a staff that will greet you with as much courtesy and hospitality throughout your entire stay. The staff was friendly, engaging and helpful with any requests from suggestions on nearby restaurants, which subway or bus to catch and the staff even suggested a running route (that took me to the High Line which is not to be missed). The 414 Hotel is the PERFECT mid-town location. My girlfriend and I walked from Penn Station to the 414 Hotel so as to familiarize ourselves with the neighborhood. During our three night stay, we found the 414 Hotel very convenient to walk to Times Square, the Javits Center, a Broadway show and a NY Rangers game at Madison Square Garden. A short walk to the nearby subway took us directly to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. Of course, the 414 Hotel is located is the super trendy Hell's Kitchen neighborhood and is chocked full of great restaurants and bars. Central Park is an easy jog from the 414 Hotel and I had a great second run there during our stay. The 414 Hotel has the BEST complimentary happy hour of any hotel I have ever stayed at. Don't expect to see a large bottle of inexpensive wine. Of course, the happy hour and the complimentary breakfast were both great times to meet other guests many of which were international travelers. Our room was very clean, very comfortable and the bathroom amenities were very nice. The free wifi worked great throughout our stay. I will note there is no elevator in the hotel but the staff was very kind to offer to help us with our bags. Given the great food I had in the restaurants in Hell's Kitchen, I was thankful for the extra stairs to work off a few calories.Needless to say, although I do not know when my next trip to NYC will be, I know exactly where I will be staying.

We were greeted at the door by Ike, the weekend night manager, who was clearly more awake than the four of us. Ike promptly checked us in, carried the bags to our rooms, and then served us a night cap while filling us in on the 414 and current events. Our first morning started with a community breakfast in the lobby featuring a self-serve espresso machine you will want to take home. Every afternoon around 5:30, the 414 sets out a generous assortment of wine, scotch, bourbon, and liquors. It becomes a focal point of the day. Guests gather in the lobby to enjoy the assortment, discuss the day’s events, and plan for the night. Every evening, after returning from touring the city, we were greeted by Drew, another of the 414 night managers. Drew was always willing to share in our experiences and offer us another night cap. The hotel is a short walk to mid-town and the theater district. Rooms are spacious, cozy, clean, and inviting. What more can you ask for. The 414 is everything they claim to be and more.

The knowledge of the staff led by Susan Yates is extremely helpful for their guests. We have been to NYC a few times over the years and we were looking for new places to eat and visit. Suggestions were aplenty for both local restaurants and sightseeing options. It is really helpful that Susan has provided a 3 page listing of local restaurants and then assists guest to refine the list further. With respect to sightseeing, they recommended some of the usual sites, but really helped get us to the right ones at the right time. In addition, they provided directions for both bus and subway (including maps) directions to and from the hotel. As it turned out we used the bus (get the 7 day unlimited pass for the metro at $31) more than the subway as it was at time more convenient and required less steps up and down stairs (knee issues).Our room was at the back of the courtyard and included a king size bed, dresser, etc. It was comfortable and warm for the cold days and nights. I would recommend the addition of Directv HD service given the money spent on large screen tv's as the cable quality was poor and several channels flickered and sound buzzed, but I have to say we only used the tv for late evening news.Perhaps the best part of the stay at the hotel was getting to know the hosts and the other guests at the hotel. We met couples and single travelers from the UK, Australia, Baltimore, Boston, Wisconsin, Orange County California and Indonesia. The conversation at the morning continental breakfast and evening happy hour (cheese, wine and spirits) was very engaging.

Drew, Marie and Emmy at the desk were congenial and conversational. The BEST part is the big friendly table in the lobby for sharing coffee and the continental breakfast, and the wine and cheese in the evening. Good conversation and congeniality. The hotel is on 46th street which means restaurant row. There must be 100 or more good to great restaurants within a 10 minute walk. We walked to the theater for the show we went to see. AND the cost is substantially less than for almost any ""real"" hotel. Courtyard doesn't have room service and how many times do you use the valet laundry at a big hotel.

Our room was an adequate size and clean and tidy with windows onto an internal courtyard and an en suite bathroom. Slight niggle that there was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, but there were always hot drinks available at reception. But there was free WiFi.The staff were very friendly and helpful, with lots of tips of places to see and eat, and things to do. The breakfast which was included in the price was a cold buffet with cereals, toast, bagels(assorted types), and hot drinks. Breakfast is served in the hotel reception which has one large table and several smaller ones, it could get a little busy but it works.The unique selling point which sets the 414 hotel apart from the more typical offering is the ""happy hour"", actually longer than an hour when a selection of wines and spirits together with cheese and biscuits are set out in the reception area for the guests to help themselves and to sit and socialise with the other guests. A really good source of useful information both about things to do in New York City, and a great chance to meet people from around the world and other parts of USA.All in all a really homely place to stay whilst exploring New York, and good value for the location, inclusive breakfast and WiFi, and of course the ""happy hour"", we just need to think of an excuse to come back.","Stafford, United Kingdom",3,5.0

We recently had 5 nights at 414Hotel and I cannot praise Susan and her 414Hotel Family enough. I am a Travel Agent in Australia and I chose this hotel for my first visit to NYC. It was the smartest thing I could have done for us. The hotel is in an advantageous position - so close to many great eateries, the theater district, Times Square and the subway. We chose to walk (we are walkers!!) and found most ""to do's"" able to be reached by foot which really made us feel like New Yorkers. We used the subway from JFK to the hotel - I had contacted Susan prior to our arrival to seek transport options this option is highly recommended! Ike greeted us around midnight like it was 9.30am and could not have been more helpful. Yes the hotel is all stairs (no elevator) and we were on the 4th floor (courtyard facing) and Ike carried our luggage to our room. It's really no issue. Our room was really comfy, quiet and welcoming. We immediately felt right at home. The next morning we had the absolute pleasure of meeting Susan - she is hospitality personified. I could write a whole paragraph just about her! We loved seeing her each morning as we discussed our options for the day and relived the day before with Susan and other hotel guests. What a treat - so many like minded people to share stories with! A ""newsletter"" was left under our door on a daily basis with hints and did you knows - such a great idea. Drew greeted us late every evening with his beaming smile as we returned from our adventures, never too busy to hear what we had achieved - he was genuinely interested.

The staff were all terrific -- friendly, informative and kind. Some of them were there long before the current owners but I know they wouldn't still be around if they weren't the absolute best!Owner Susan is relatively new to the business but she was definitely born to be a hotelier. It's not possible to say enough good things about her so I'll demonstrate.My stay didn't start out well. Though I had read on their website that they don't have an elevator I was under the impression that their buildings were two-stories tall. They are four-stories and I was originally booked on the top floor. I explained that there was no way I could possibly negotiate four flights of stairs because of an acute exacerbation of a back condition and because of really bad knees! The desk clerk was able to move me to the second floor, which was fine. Unfortunately I had an awful first night because of noise from a business in the building immediately adjacent to that room. I called the front desk to ask what was going on. It was about 2am and the woman who answered the phone was as chipper as if it were 10am! The noise abated for awhile but then came back. By that time I really too exhausted to talk so I just waited it out. Normally I would have demanded a refund for the remaining nights of the stay and moved to another place. But before I could do anything, Susan came over to see me the moment I dragged myself to the lobby for coffee. Her apologies were profuse and accompanied by an action plan: she would comp my room and have me moved to a quieter part of the hotel. As much as it pains me that she has had to bear the brunt of the thoughtless landlord and even more thoughtless tenant, both of whom cause her so much grief, I accepted her plan with gratitude.The breakfast was good though I would have liked more options that didn't contain sugar. For example, at the time of my visit they had lots of yogurts but they were all fruit flavored. On the plus side I had forgotten how much I love cottage cheese! In the evenings they offer not just wine but a variety of spirits as well. While I did appreciate the quieter second room, I have to be honest and say that I was a bit stunned to find that it didn't have a chair, while the first room had two. That was remedied when I purloined a side chair from the front house. It wasn't as comfortable as the nice upholstered wing-back but it was fine for my needs.I've stayed all over NYC in all sorts of places but for as long as I am able, this will be my home each time I visit.","West Hollywood, California",48,5.0

Everything about the hotel is perfect. The 414 is a lovely, late Victorian, red brick building, converted from a pair of town houses, incorporating an attractive inner courtyard. The bedrooms/bathrooms are large by New York standards. Breakfast is traditional New York fare (bagels, muffins and the like), and the hotel has a ""happy hour"" in the late afternoon/early evening with complementary wine & cheese.The hotel is situated on 46th St. just off 9th Avenue, in what was traditionally referred to as the ""Hell's Kitchen"" area of Manhattan, (but which has more recently been called Clinton). The hotel is thus within easy walking distance of the attractions of Mid-town, such as Times Square, yet because it's in a residential area, it's quiet in the evening. The nearest subway is 5 minutes walk on 44th St.The Manager Susan, and her staff are wonderfully helpful with practical advice on how to get the best out of your time in New York - everything from how to negotiate the subway system, to getting discounts when booking theaters and museums. One very useful feature was a guide to the restaurants near the hotel. Many of these restaurants weren't traditional tourist traps, often being frequented by local New York people. We went in several - the food was always excellent, and prices very competitive.Quite apart from being the perfect base from which to explore the great city of New York, you will not find a hotel more welcoming and helpful than the 414.

Having lived in Hells Kitchen back then, I was curious to see how it had changed, so I chose this location for that reason and great reviews on TA. So this hotel is quaint, small, and friendly; a welcome alternative to the chaotic NYC scene. So it was nice to return to this relative island of peace and tranquility every evening. The good things:Very clean and comfortable travelers style hotel, with very friendly helpful staff.Rooms are up at least one flight of stairs, are very comfortable and adequate, quiet and clean.Tiny lobby provides breakfast, complimentary drinks and cheese/cracker apps.You can meet people in this quaint environment from all over the world, as well as local folks who traverse the bridges primarily to atttend the theatre.Walking distance to Theatres and midtown a big plus if this is one of your requirements.The not so good.Hells Kitchen, at least this part well north of the many developments going on around the High Line, remains a rather bleak and dense part of NYC. Streets are still laden with trash (trash bags piled on side streets almost nightly) and proximity to Times Square makes it a rather bleak neighborhood compared to others where density and proclivity of tourism is less. Although some newer and good restaurants are nearby, certainly the restaurant row restaurants cater to those who for the most part, dont know any better or defer to options near shows they are attending. Bottomn lineIf you want to be close to theatre district and like a small scale and friendly place where you can meet others and get help from friendly staff, then by all means check out Hotel 414. However, if you want a place with more amenities, care less about being in this part of Manhattan and getting to know fellow occupants, there are many other options out there that would be better option for the money.

Truth be told, it took me about two weeks to review all the options and finally opt for 414. It was an excellent choice. Starting from organizing us a transfer from airport, swift check-in, everything was perfect. Room is excellent size, spacious for NY standards, super tide, great bathroom with all amenities you could actually need. We took a top floor standard room facing the 46th street, it is so peaceful - we slept with open windows! Residential area, safe, close to major sights, great metro connections, all around perfect choice.

The accommodation is clean, comfortable & nicely decorated. Breakfast (which is included in the tariff) is a continental buffet style & quite nice. The staff are friendly & helpful with great advice on how to get around the city. An added bonus is being able to obtain the 'Big Bus Hop on/off' tickets at reception & a cost price. One suggestion I'd make when staying here & returning to the hotel after a day sight-seeing via the sub-way, is when you come out onto street level, you are usually on 7th or 8th Avenue. So if you're not keen to run the gauntlet of the congestion of crowds at Time Square, which is 24/7, try walking up to 9th Ave & to E46th Street & the hotel is just around the corner. Also, on the corner of 46th & 9th is a diner, serving excellent meals (highly recommend the pot roast) & on the opposite side of the road is a laundromat, where you can leave your laundry for collection later. They offer both machine dried & hung dried, the cost is very reasonable & worth the connivence. So when in NYC do what a lot of Aussies do & stay at 414 Hotel.","Hunter Valley, Australia",12,5.0

A very unexpected and appreciated surprise, but just the beginning of outstanding service in a city where such treatment is not the ""norm"". More on the service in a bit.Our room was very nice and VERY roomy by NYC standards. The bed was very comfortable and the room included a wall mounted TV and refrigerator. Was perfect for our needs.There was a continental breakfast each morning with a wide selection of very good breakfast food and drinks. Each evening, wine and cheese were served and was a great opportunity to meet some of the other hotel guests. The hotel does not look like a hotel from the street. It's in a very quiet neighborhood with brownstone apartment buildings, yet not a long walk to subways or Time Square. We had multiple people walking by ask us if this was really a hotel. We told them it was an amazing hotel, and highly recommended it.During our stay we met a half dozen of the staff and were extremely impressed with each and every one of them. They were VERY helpful with restaurant suggestions and advice on things to do and transportation, including maps and brochures. The level of customer care was a highlight of our trip. My wife is a big Dr. Pepper fan, but had gone a few days without one as the restaurants we went to didn't carry it. The 414 didn't either but, when one of the girls overheard my wife wishing she had one, she walked down to a store and bought one for her!! My wife and I were so impressed by this thoughtful, caring act.We were able to meet the owner, Susan, the day we left. Had a delightful conversation with her and found her to be very warm and friendly. We told her.

The special coffee machine was available in the lobby day and night along with a few snacks (yes, complimentary). Being in New York, security was important to us. This property has staff at the desk 24 hours a day to buzz you in. Awesome! Best of all Susan and the staff were so helpful and gave us lots of tips to make our visit better. For example we planned on walking the Brooklyn Bridge and they suggested we walk back instead. Why? Because of the better view! When we checked in the hotel provided us with a list of restaurants nearby. They only recommend restaurants they have tried themselves. We tried a couple of them and they were excellent!

I would recommend this hotel to anybody coming to New York. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is central location to mostly everything. Only a few blocks away is Times Square and the subway station. It is just steps away from restaurant row and Hell's Kitchen, so there are plenty of great places to eat nearby. If you are catching a show, it is a very close walk to all the theatres. The rooms are just what you need. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are spacious. It comes with a mini fridge, which is always a plus! What I love most about staying here is the hospitality and the kindness of all of the staff. It truly feels like staying with family. Susan and her staff are wonderful! They really help you out with anything you need: restaurants to try, Broadway tickets, places to visit, any kind of advice you need they will help you with. They give you breakfast to get your day started, with things like muffins, bagels, hard boiled eggs, etc. Then, in the evening they have a 'happy hour' where you get wine and cheese. You get to meet lots of great people who are also staying in the hotel.

We were laughing as soon as we walked in the door, and included in an ongoing information/welcome chat from the staff member on duty. There's a kind of camaraderie at this hotel which is unusual - the staff and guests chat, encouraged by the details in the daily newssheet that tells you the weather outlook, ideas for sightseeing each day (e.g. what museums are free or what tours are going on) and even what nationalities the hotel is accommodating that day. They let you borrow stuff you forgot/couldn't bring (umbrellas, bikes and picnic blankets) that means you save a bit of money too.The hotel is small and on a quiet street in the middle of Manhattan, close to many sights and walkable to the nearest subway (about 3 or 4 blocks). We stayed in two rooms (we stayed on different occasions during our trip) and found each to be spacious (come on, how big a room do you expect for an urban megaville?) with a comfortable bed, aircon, fridge with snacks etc etc. If you need total quiet to sleep you might need to switch the aircon off at night. There's a good choice of continental breakfast options and a small kitchen you feel free to use if you need a drink etc. It's not fancy or luxurious (if that's what you're after you might want a more expensive option) but if you want friendly, clean, informative and not going to break the bank, consider this place.The staff were all well-trained, really friendly and helpful to guests - no weak links! Staff are on duty all night so you don't feel like you have to sneak in if you are out late :) There's no elevator but staff were always quick to offer to help with luggage so don't let that put you off. The most exceptional thing about the 414 Hotel was the way in which the staff are willing to help you plan any kind of excursion/trip during your stay. They don't just thrust a map at you like many other hotels, they ask what you are hoping to do, and suggest the best ways of getting there, what public transport to take, options for discounted tickets and even if the weather might affect your plans. It's judged well; they aren't nosey or too inquisitive, but offer genuinely helpful insider knowledge that improves your own plans. You have to watch yourself not to hog them all morning with your questions!Go! You will have a great time!","Playa de Jandia, Spain",9,5.0

We often go up for day trips, but this was the first time we stayed the night and I was looking for an interesting place to stay, close to Midtown, rather than a large impersonal hotel (even though some of those can be nice, too). After much research and checking out reviews, my top two choices came down to the French Quarter Apartments and 414 Hotel. They were both in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, so close to Midtown but a bit off the beaten path, in a more residential, slightly worn area. 414 turned out to be a perfect fit for us - we didn't even mind the 3rd floor walk-up room we had, which was comfortable and clean, and the area is quieter at night than other parts of the city. The staff were wonderful and friendly, allowing us to drop our bags off in the morning before check-in, and keep them there the next day until we left for home later that afternoon. The breakfast was just right and it felt homey and comfy w/o feeling crowded. The owner showed my daughter some picture books about NYC and another staff member helped me figure out how to get down to the Lower East Side via subway. The night staff person was lovely and recommended a great take-out pizza place a few blocks away (Two Boots) because my daughter was too tired to go out for dinner. If you like interesting, intimate, and down-to-earth, then this is the place for you. If you prefer an elevator and a Midtown location, I'd suggest the Archer Hotel.

My fiancé and I were planning a visit to get married at City Hall and couldn’t get a phone or email response from the marriage bureau regarding the fact that we would need a witness as we were traveling alone. I contacted Susan at 414 to see if she had any info on this topic and without skipping a beat she offered to act as our witness in the event we could not access one at the marriage bureau. Seriously!? Have you ever been to a hotel where the owner/manager would offer to take part in your event or activity to ensure that it came off perfectly? Turns out we finally heard from the city that a witness could not be provided, and Susan did take time out of her busy schedule to travel to the Manhattan marriage bureau and act as our witness. She waited patiently as we worked our way through the process, provided her documentation, witnessed the ceremony, shed a tear of joy with us, took pictures, and hugged us both with the warmth and caring of the dearest of family members. She worked with me upfront on the planning, placing a beautiful flower bouquet in the room for our arrival, and surprised us with champagne when we returned after the ceremony. We watched each day as Susan and her staff took care of each and every guest as though they were a valued treasure. Susan gives each guest unrushed personal time, taking interest in them and their day’s events to ensure that anything she can do to improve their visit, is offered. Show reservations, recommendations on getting around the city, restaurants, sights, unique destinations, tours, coupons, you name it. Outstanding personal and professional services beyond anything we’ve experienced before. With the hotel being on a side street just off the busy areas it was warm and welcoming, feeling like we were coming home each day. Our room was perfect also. Quite large by NYC standards and toward the back of the hotel overlooking the courtyard. It was extremely quiet. We never heard another voice, door slam, truck, car, siren, absolutely nothing the entire stay. We love the hotel and will stay there whenever we visit.

As for the rooms - well very appointed, spacious, great amenities, mini-bar treats for only $1 (!) and extremely comfortable. Susan and her staff dote on their guests - ask her something in passing or tell her something about your trip and she'll remember.

I use the word hospitality because I heard someone make this distinction between service and hospitality. ""Service is black and white and hospitality is color"". Susan and the staff at 414 have mastered the art of hospitality, which is quite different than routine customer service. 414 is a unique property with loads of charm in a fabulous location. We were seeing a show and it was about a 10 minute walk to the theater. There are lots of great restaurants near by too. Once inside the hotel, it's easy to forget you're in a busy metropolitan area. It has a homey feel that is immediately soothing. Our room was quiet, clean and cozy. Breakfast was delightful with fresh fruit, bagels and cappuccino. And when was the last time the GM of a hotel sent you a personal email thanking you for staying with them? For the record, I have never taken the time to write a review, but was compelled to do one for 414. I am certain that if any problem were to arise, Susan and her staff would make things right.

From the minute we walked in to 414Hotel (actually, even before that, when we called ahead), we could tell we were staying at a very unusual hotel, where the owners/management had set a genuinely welcoming, down-to-earth, gracious, just-say-yes tone that was so consistent throughout all of the people there (even the other guests…a self-selecting audience of likemindedness, I guess!). Many details had obviously been thought out and well attended to—the large, comfortable room with $1 water and snacks, the breakfast buffet (with good coffee), the generous wine time (w/bourbons, single malts, cheeses, etc). We also liked the block, which was a quiet oasis in midtown, our room, and our fire escape view of the church across the street very much.So thank you, Susan, Andrew, and staff for your hospitality.

The breakfast was great and we loved the happy hour of wine and cheese in the evenings. Our room was facing the street but still was able to sleep fine.

The hotel host also recommended the perfect place to get some yummy NY pizza, and gave me perfect directions to the restaurant, Two Boots Hell's Kitchen, and also my after dinner coffee at Starbucks. They were also incredibly accommodating about storing the luggage for me and my friend that came in the next day before we could get into the other place we stayed in the city. My only suggestion is that if you don't work out several times a week like I do, definitely ask for a second floor room. The stairs to the rooms are steep and narrow, and there is no elevators in these beautiful older buildings. Not a huge deal, but it was work carrying my bag up and down to my 4th floor room.","Studio City, California, United States",13,4.0

Each morning we were greeted by name with coffee and a lovely breakfast spread. Each evening we would come back to the hotel to wine and cheese happy hour!!!! The only down fall to this was the weather that we could not really enjoy the courtyard. We did brave the cold and rain one evening and people watched from the front stoop. The GM Susan was giving me advice via TEXT while we were out sightseeing - tell me if you would get one on one service like that from the big chains? On our last day it was raining but we were on a mission to find one last item for a family member... Susan called a local store to make sure they had it so we didn't have to walk down there in the rain with no luck. She even stood in the rain to hail us a cab.

The room had a musty smell that we noticed immediately every time we entered the room (but sort of disappeared when we had been in the room for a while, I assume we got used to it...). The room had good size, and was of OK standard. The bathroom had no heating, and it was very cold to step in the shower in the morning. It was very quiet, we experienced no traffic noise except the occasional sirenes from emergency vehicles.The TV could need some tuning, we ended up not watching it as it was really hopeless to use. The room had a safe of good size, and also a mini fridge with some drinks and snacks ( each item from were only USD 1, great!!!).Breakfast was included and served in the lobby. It was simple, but quit adequate; bagels, oatmeal, fruit, pastry, juice, egg etc. In the afternoon they had a complimentary wine and cheese serving, we did unfortunately not have the chance to try this.One day they did not finish the room until after 4 pm which was kind of a drag as we had been out walking for 7-8 hours and wanted to take a nap before going out to dinner, so coming back to an unmade room was a disappointment.The staff was very friendly and nice, except from one woman who never said hi, she just gave us a hostile look every time we tried to greet her, she was the direct opposite of the two lovely ladies who we met during breakfast.

Susan and her exceptional staff will do EVERYTHING to accommodate your individual needs.

Kudos all around for providing such a welcoming, comforting environment.The hotel provides a free continental breakfast each morning - the coffee is exceptional! They also provide an early evening 'happy hour' with wine & cheese and other spirits if the mood strikes. The hotel is located in the Hell's Kitchen area of NYC and is in easy walking distance to Times Square (but far enough away not to be bothered by the crowds!), the theatre district, and several excellent restaurants.

We had read amazing reviews of this hotel in TripAdvisor so we were both excited about our stay and cautious too, wondering if all the good things written about the 414 Hotel could possibly be true. First, let’s get by the basics – (1) Cleanliness: The 414 Hotel is very clean--both the guestroom itself and the common areas where guests meet for breakfast or the wine and cheese get-together in the early evening (2) Comfortability: Our room at the 414 Hotel was a comfortable size. We slept well in the queen size bed and were very pleased with the large bathroom. Also, there were lots of drawer space in our room which is something we don’t usually find when we stay at hotels. (3) Security: As noted, this is a small boutique hotel away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square. The entrance to the hotel is locked at all times. You can only get in when a hotel employee buzzes you in. Now for the fun part. The most distinguishing factor about the 414 Hotel is the friendliness, courtesy and kindness of the hotel staff and owner. They all go out of their way to make you feel welcomed. I told my husband a number of times during our stay that I felt as if were staying at a friend’s home which was a compliment about how very relaxed and welcomed we felt at the 414 Hotel. We would definitely stay again and have already told friends about it.","Boston, Ma",2,5.0

We returned last week from a 6-night stay, this time celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. When we arrived there was a bottle of Prosecco in our room's fridge, along with two champagne glasses and chocolates. What a way to start our visit! We were delighted to see staff members Jacquie, Drew, and Mary, whom we remembered from last year. It says a lot about owner/managers Susan and Andrew that they are able to retain excellent staff from year to year. New amenities this year included redecorated rooms (some bright, cheery colors), a comfy chair in the room, good for quiet time/reading (I believe the addition of the chair came about after my suggestion for such to Susan--how's that for responsive management!), and a fancy coffee machine (which makes excellent coffee, espresso, latte, cappuccino, etc.) available to guests at all times, not just at breakfast. One of this year's treats was that Susan is offering occasional walking tours (free to her guests) of Central Park. Susan is a native New Yorker and grew up with Central Park as her back yard. As many times as my husband and I have walked through Central Park, we got so many new insights and discoveries on Susan's tour. Thank you, Susan! On one chilly morning, we returned to the 414 after a walk, and I asked Jacquie whether they had hot chocolate. No problem she said...and proceeded to make us cups of steamy, foamy hot chocolate using the coffee machine milk steamer. Yum! (A couple days later, when we came back after a show, Jacquie asked if we'd like a hot chocolate. Good memory! Good service!). Oh, and then there's happy hour--wines, whiskeys, and snacks each evening, a great time to chat with other guests (on this visit, we met people from Australia, Viet Nam, Canada, as well as the US). The Hotel 414 is in a perfect location for anyone planning to see Broadway shows; it's just 3 blocks from the TKTS booth and nearby to all the midtown theaters.

There is no lift, true but the staff are more than willing to take bags up etc. I guess though if you have mobility problems, it may not be the place for you. Rooms are spotlessly clean and large for New York - we were in a superior room. Remember most New York rooms are on the small side though. Mini Bar with really cheap items is in the room and there is also a fridge plus a safe. Hairdryer is also provided and it's a good one ladies so no need to pack one.Downstairs near their front desk is where breakfast is served in the mornings. I didn't have any but it looked fine. It's continental in style so expect pastries etc. You can do toast and take your coffee out as well. My mum and sister had the breakfast and said it was all good. Has a lovely fire roaring away too and from 5:30pm ish, they do a great happy hour of wine, spirits, cheese and crackers.

We had chosen to stay there partly because of its central location, and partly because of the many top reviews on Trip Advisor, and it proved to be an excellent choice.As many other reviews have already said, Susan, Andrew and the team are exceptionally hospitable, friendly and helpful hosts, and the welcome we received was second to none. Whilst 414 Hotel may not be the ideal choice for those seeking modern, five star facilities, for guests who value the personal touch in a small, traditional hotel, it is a great choice. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean and the breakfast choice was varied and perfect for our needs. Other touches, such as the evening ‘happy hour’ of complimentary cheese, wine and spirits, and the daily newsletters with tips for guests, were very welcome. When we were there, I also mentioned that it had been my wife’s birthday a few days before we arrived, and Susan very kindly presented her with a surprise birthday gift before we left – a lovely touch.There are plenty of restaurants and bars within a five minute stroll of the hotel, and Times Square is also little more than five minutes away. We walked to the southern end of Central Park in about twenty minutes from the hotel. We flew into Newark Airport and found the transfer into NYC by train fairly straightforward. It then took us about 25 minutes to walk to the hotel from Penn Station. However, for the return journey, we decided to book a car via the hotel reception to take us directly to the airport – the service was punctual and the driver polite.We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend 414 Hotel to others, and we hope to be able to return in the not too distant future.

After pouring over hundreds of property listings, we kept coming back to the 414 Hotel. From the moment we contacted the hotel to get additional details, we were treated as long-lost friends. Manager Susan Yates, and her delightful son Zach, answered every question we had and even some that we didn't know enough to ask! Impressed with the personal touch, we immediately made our reservation.We fell in love with the hotel as soon as we arrived. It was just as we'd imagined, but even better. Located just a couple of blocks from Times Square, restaurants, theaters, bars and shops were just steps away. We were close to the action, yet situated in a neighborhood-like setting. Our room was in the lower part of the courtyard area and was BIG and very, very quiet. We didn't hear a sound or any street noise whatsoever.Susan and her staff, especially Jackie and Drew, couldn't have been more attentive. They were available to provide directions, tour suggestions, show information and great conversation.

There are tons of restaurants, bars and shops nearby. The subway is not too far away, Time Square is only two avenues across walk away. We took a quick subway ride to the lower Manhattan, East Village area. It’s a short walk to the Central Park, Columbus Circle, Lincoln Center area. We also walked over to 5th Ave., Rockefeller Center and a lot more. To avoid the hassle of driving and traffic in Manhattan, we drove down the west side (Henry Hudson Pkwy, I believe). It was easy to get to the hotel, but it was clear that going any deeper into the city the traffic was heating up. We parked in the garage close by that was listed in the information we receive with our hotel confirmation. First they said the garage was full, but when I said we were staying at the 414, they were happy to park our car in the garage!

My adventure started with my friend finding the 414 Hotel by accident and it was the best accident I ever had, from the moment we arrived they could not do enough for us. We arrived at 10:40AM on a Thurs and couldn't check in but they were happy to hold our bags as we were asking about where to park (yes we drove into the city) Andrew explained that on Thursday that it is street cleaning day and everyone on the street must move there car so we may be able to get a spot on the street. Andrew offered to walk down to where we had doubled park down the street, so he walked down with my friend Jen while I waited at the hotel as I was waiting someone right in front of the hotel pulled out of there spot so Pop (hotel employee) went out with me to hold the spot while my friend moved the car into the spot, so here we are parked in front of the hotel waiting for the street cleaner to come down, Andrew also told us that we would need to stay in the car until 12:30pm or the police would have you towed, Andrew kept coming out to the car and checking on us if we wanted coffee or a snack and when the street cleaner came down the street Andrew came out and showed us what to do and how to move out into the street and back into our parking space, lets just say we experience the New York driving experience first hand but in the end we had a spot right in front of the hotel and Andrew saved us about $100.00 in parking fees so we could stay there until we checked out on Sunday. When we were able to get out of the car we went into the hotel and they had fire in the fireplace going and left over bagels from breakfast and offered us something to drink and snacks while they explained how things work in the city. Jackie who was at the front desk use to be a personnel shopper and she is a wealth for information about shopping and getting around the city, she had explained about the Big Bus (tour bus that takes you around) that was the best advised because we learned many things about the city that were would not have know walking around. If you do the Big Bus tour we did the 2 day tour and got a 3rd day free, it takes you on the downtown loop, uptown loop, night tour, boat tour all while you can get on and off at different stops (except the night tour they don't let you off because of the traffic). Jackie gave us a voucher for the Big Bus that saved us $20.00 on the tickets, she also gave us a gift card to Century City 21 (excellent shopping mall in financial district) every gift card has an amount but you don't know until you use it at the mall my was $5.00 but it could be up to $500.00. Andrew and Jackie told us about the restaurants near by as we were in Hells kitchen. We then decided to walk down to Time Square and get our feet wet with the City, when we got back they were having the wine, cheese, and bourdon something they do every night. We loved this about the hotel you sit around and share stories of your day get tips from other guests and meet a lot of great people, we meet people from Israel, California, North Carolina, West Virginia, Canada, Scotland, London and everyone was so friendly that you feel like you are at someones house party not the hotel lobby. Drew was another employee who works the night shift and he was so much fun to get to know and loves to meet new people and get there life story. We stayed for 3 days and had a great time, the next morning we meet Susan who I had heard was the owner of the hotel she was also great and I had to tell her how we had only been there one day and already felt at home, Susan told us she was giving a free walking tour of Central Park and we were welcome to join her and other hotel guests but we had other plans. Everyday at the hotel they would put on your door a newsletter about things happening in the city that day, what the temp. was and other fun facts from this newsletter we found out that on Fridays at the Museum Modern Art has free Fridays at 4pm to 8pm so again they saved us more money so in all they saved us about $150.00 in our different activities. You may notice on the hotel website that they don't have elevators in the hotel but don't let that keep you from this gem of a hotel because they have some rooms that only have a few small steps to go down and they helped us with bring our luggage upstairs. We never met the housekeepers so I am sorry to say I don't know there names but they were great and our rooms was always so clean and fresh. The hotel is immaculate and they have coffee, tea or hot coco all the time. There was a great coffee machine in the kitchen that makes Cappuccino, latte macchiato, or Espresso which was just what we needed when we got back in the afternoons. We ate at the Galaxy Dinner and the Bare Burger both about 1 to 2 blocks from the hotel every good meals, we ate at the Bare Burger twice because we liked it so much. Pros Everything Cons None in my experience. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, one more thing that I liked was that this hotel is close to everything but far enough away from the chaos of Time Square.","Virginia Beach, Virginia",11,5.0

I will say right off the bat, that I much prefer small hotels. Why? Because service is almost always far better. But most importantly, you meet people, you have conversations, and usually make new friends. The 414 is not the place for you if you prefer to remain anonymous, and only deal with the front desk. However, if you enjoy a great (and included) breakfast while conversing with travelers from England, France, Germany, or Australia, maybe this is your place. And if you enjoy a happy hour discussing the day's events with your new friends, then you'll love it. By the way, the happy hour is more than an hour, includes Bourbon, Irish Whiskey, wine and cheese. The owners, Susan and Andrew, will be your new friends. They could not be more accommodating. And the staff; wow! Every one of them - Mary, Will, Drew, Jacqui, are beyond accommodating. The entire staff really desire that you have a wonderful time while you are in New York. As if this isn't enough, they are located just a block down from ""restaurant row"" and only a few blocks from Times Square, Broadway theaters, and the Subway.

Normally one of the owners, Susan and Drew, were around each breakfast time and during the day to see what people were planning and to offer suggestions. They and the rest of the staff were always happy to book cars, reserve restaurant tables, provide directions etc We normally find we keep to ourselves a little on holidays, but on this trip we get to know several other guests with whom we shared tips on what we had done or planned to do, this made our stay feel like we were part of a community.A couple of things to watch out for. (1) no lifts in the hotel so if you have heavy bags they will have to go up and down stairs (2) I thought the bathroom needed a freshen up - including a more powerful shower.

Don't expect any assistance with luggage up and down them. A front facing room will, rather than offering ""quaint, tree-lined views"" as mentioned on the website, instead offer box seats to the loud and weed-smelling turkish bar next door as well as the church directly across the street, where sadly but noisily a long line of homeless will appear regularly seeking a meal. The street is their living room and their loud conversations are regularly present at all hours of the day and night, non-stop on weekends.. The street the hotel is on is raucous and tumultuous day and night, so insist on a courtyard room or bring earplugs. I never saw anyone to mention this to other than housekeeping until the morning of our third day at the property; when i did speak to the manager she was condescending and sent me a letter suggesting it was my error in not booking a quieter room and holding her responsible for ""regular street noise"". I guess she didn't realize i was born and raised here,return often and have stayed in numerous hotels throughout the city and locally, know when i'm being shined on, and found her arguments ridiculous. Anyone spending a single day here would be well aware of a noise level way beyond ""regular"", and the website suggestion of a calming, refined location is misleading at best. My firm and resolute insistence that I be given an adjustment on my bill was granted, but not without the manager leaving me a sharp note stating that I was ""crass"" in requesting same.There are numerous small boutique hotels nearby that are what they say they are and are better.","Tampa, Florida",14,2.0

The best part about the Hotel is the warmth and kindness as the staff mingle with the guests at breakfast time, find out the plans for the day and offer suggestions about transport, things to do and the easiest way to get around. This was invaluable to me on my first trip to NYC, in which I even found some of the procedures and routines quite different to the way things are done in Australia. The other lovely thing was Happy Hour at night, when Susie and her team got our a range of spirits and wines, along with high quality cheeses, fruits and crackers, and welcomed the guests home from their busy days on the town with welcome drinks and an ear for the stories of the day. Fantastic and something I have not encountered before. It also encouraged the guests to mingle and I found I had made some nice friends, even after a day or two.

Long story short, it filled up quickly (I now know why!) and I was so bummed. Contacted Susan in the middle of the night via email and immediately received a response. She went out of her way to accommodate me in the event of a cancellation. Woohoo! I had a room!When we arrived, Drew was most kind and helpful! Very pleasant. We felt at home right away. My friend (who won't mind me saying she is very hard to please) could not stop talking about how great everyone was and the room was perfect! We had just experienced a not-so-good taxi ride from the airport, but the hotel staff was able to make us feel better instantly.There's so much I could say, but I will run out of space, so all I can do is just hope you consider them for your stay. I am a firm believer in rewarding hard work and that tips should not be mandatory but should reward exceptional service. I could never repay them, so this is my version of a tip... and if you've stayed here and enjoyed your stay, please consider doing the same! The staff went above and beyond and they deserve all of the recognition they can get! Loved the happy hour every night (wine, cheese, etc.), loved that they include breakfast, loved that they had a private patio, GREAT location to everything, very nice-sized room and most of all, great employees.

Susan, the owner, was so personable & welcoming, which just added to the warmth of the place. My stay overlapped with winter storm juno & although there weren't any problems, the hotel had left instructions in case of any storm shenanigans. I wanted a room overlooking the street & the neighborhood view was perfect. The building itself is a beautiful red brick. The room was clean & tasteful. I loved the windows…they were the old-style paned push-up type, so they opened to get a bit of fresh air…plus a fire escape (!) which, for me, added to the ambience.

We had tickets for a show one Saturday night in June and needed a place that was convenient to the theatre as we were running in from an event in Westchester and had to leave early the next morning. I found the 414 Hotel and we made a reservation. When I made the reservation, I also asked if they could recommend a restaurant near the theater, as it was Saturday night. Mary who took the reservation, sent us a list of nearby restaurants. One day later, Susan, the General Manager, contacted us noting that the play we were seeing was a little further away and asked what sort of cuisine we liked. She found us a lovely French restaurant, made the reservation, and confirmed it. It made our very short trip into NYC quite a treat. As others have noted, the hotel is in a great location especially if you have theatre tickets. We had a room off the patio which was slightly below grade, so quiet, and cool.

We were in New York for the first part of our honeymoon and upon arrival (feeling slightly worn out from a long journey) we were greeted with not only a lovely room on the top floor, but a bottle of sparkly, chocolates and a personal card congratulating us on our wedding. The whole theme of the hotel is personal. The staff are super friendly and keen to help you have the best time in New York. They offered recommendations for experiences and bars and restaurants all of which were fantastic, especially the roof top bar they advised us to visit with a view of the empire state. Susan (the manager) was fantastic and really made us feel at home. She also helped us with booking a restaurant and has even emailed us since our stay thanking us for our visit. Our room was spacious, with modern décor, a great sized bathroom and excellent air con. The room was serviced whenever we wanted it. Another bonus of this hotel was that a great brekkie was included. Coffee, tea, juices, water, bagels, bread, cakes, croissant, eggs etc. which was a tasty way to save money in the pricey city. Also the free cheese and drinks around 5pm was a brilliant thing to offer and gave us chance to mingle with staff and other guests. If you want your stay in New York to have a good location and a very personal feel then we would 100% recommend this hotel. Thank you to Susan and all the staff for making our honeymoon so special.

She emailed me promptly, communicated well and made us excited for our visit by telling us she couldn't wait to meet us. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is within walking distance to subway stations and tourist attractions such as Times Square and Top of the Rock. It is also close to a wide range of places to eat and shops. However the hotel is far enough away to feel like you can relax from the craziness of New York. The hotel is quiet and once inside the pretty garden feels like you aren’t in New York at all!The room was clean and simply decorated. It had everything you need. Very good air conditioning, a comfortable bed, toiletries. We also appreciated the New York guides left for guests. The room also had a mini fridge which contained cans of pop and water which could be used then added to the room bill at a reasonable price, not your usual mini bar. Our room was on the bottom floor and although we did hear people walking in the room above it wasn’t loud enough to stop us sleeping and you couldn’t hear any other noise. Facilities such as free Wi-Fi are also available. The thing that really sets this hotel apart from others is the staff. They are kind, helpful and would do anything for their guests. They take the time to get to know you and make you feel comfortable. A couple of examples are that Susan had left us a very lovely message in a card with a bottle of sparkling wine telling us to enjoy our honeymoon. On our first day in New York there was a lot of rain firstly we appreciated the hotel provided umbrellas and secondly the staff at the hotel were keen to help with organising sightseeing that could be done in the rain, they are very knowledgeable on the local area. Another member of staff who made us feel very welcome was Drew. He told us that the 414 hotel was ‘home’ and he really made us feel like it was. A nice surprise for us was the free breakfast, we didn’t realise this was available. The breakfast included teas, coffee and juices, pastries and breads, yogurt and cereal. All of a high quality. Although it didn’t affect us another guest asked for Gluten Free items for breakfast and this was provided. Between 5:30 and 7 wines, spirits and cheese are laid out for guests to enjoy. Most evenings we missed, or would have missed this as we were still out but Drew on a few evenings was kind enough to keep them out as he knew not all the guests had returned yet. I would highly recommend that anyone stay here. It was an amazing find and if we ever return to New York it will be our definite choice for a welcoming, friendly and high quality hotel.

To our surprise, Strawberry at the desk said they had a room ready and took us up to it. I never did ask whether her parents were Mets fans. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. There were plenty of outlets for chargers and such, something I like to see.When we had coffee in the morning (breakfast was included, but we were going to brunch with our daughter), we met the owners, Susan and Andrew. They were a joy, and we must have chatted for 45 minutes. It felt like staying with old friends. After returning from our one-night stay, Susan sent us an email thanking us for our stay.

We were taking a break in the middle of planning a wedding in February (why it has taken so long to write this!) and decided to head up to New York to see a show. We found this hotel and weren't sure what to expect. I will never stay at a big hotel in New York again!In fact, I seek out boutique experiences and this experience rivaled some of my stays at other boutique hotels in the city. The experience can be as intimate or anonymous as you would like. The amenities are amazing. At the Marriott you can barely get a coffee. At hotel 414 there is a fully stocked breakfast (bagels, hard boiled eggs, cream cheese fruit etc...) and snacks throughout the day, including an amazing wine and cheese hour...whiskey if you are feeling it. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and meeting different groups at the table for the breakfast and wine hours. We became fast friends with other travelers staying at the hotel. We even got great tips from a fascinating and inspiring couple on the speakeasies and advice for a late year trip to Austria. It was fun to share stories before going separate ways for the night and then to see the same smiling faces at breakfast. The room was a very good size for the city...we were lucky enough to get upgraded to a room off the patio.The owner was a pleasure to talk to as well. The proximity to times square is perfect. In a few blocks you are right in the mix and in a few blocks your are back to your cozy respite in the city. We loved the experience!!! Thank you Hotel 414.

Mary gave us some wonderful restaurant suggestions - when we checked in she actually gave us a list of restaurants in the area and she went through the list with us highlighting some of her favorite ones. Susan is probably one of the sweetest ladies we have ever met. She made such a special effort to make us feel welcome and to see if there was anything she could do to make our visit even better. She was actually able to get us really great discounted tickets for 39 Steps (which is such a fun, high-energy play if you happen to be looking to see a show in the city for a non-outrageous price).We loved our stay at the 414 hotel and we would recommend it to anyone who is visiting in the city!","Anaheim, California",0,5.0

From the moment we booked the hotel, we were graced with incredible customer service. I'd actually received an email shortly after booking thanking me for booking and inquiring if we had any special requests. I had mentioned in the comments that we were celebrating our 1st year anniversary and that, while we booked a queen bedroom, we would love to stay in a king bedroom if one became available. I received a response shortly after stating that they would definitely try to do what they could to try to move us to a king bedroom, but that at that time they didn't have a king bed for our entire stay so the worst case would be that we would have to move rooms for our last night. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were excited to hear that they were able to upgrade us to the king bedroom! When we opened the door to our room (which was surprisingly large for New York), we found a bottle of champagne, chocolates and a hand written note from the 414 staff. The champagne and chocolates were very generous, but honestly it was the note that really impressed us. The fact that they took the time to wish us a pleasant stay and a happy 1st anniversary just meant so much to us. I just can't say enough kind words about the staff at the 414 hotel. We mainly interacted with Mary and Susan, but everyone that we interacted with was so kind and helpful. Mary helped us to get checked in and she was so patient with us in giving us suggestions on her favorite places to eat within the area. We were really hungry the night we checked in and it was fairly late so she recommended that we try Five Napkin Burgers because she said that it was close, tasty and quick. She was absolutely right! If you are looking for a fun place to grab tasty food, I would totally recommend that you check it out! Susan is probably one of the sweetest people you will ever meet. She was so fun to chat with and she takes such good care of the guests that visit 414. At breakfast, she was always asking us about what our plans were for the day and she would offer suggestions on how to get discounts or the quickest way to get places. My husband and I were considering seeing 39 Steps and when we mentioned this to her, she was able to help us get super cheap tickets for the show!

Although they recommended that I reserve a room for the night before, they also had an available room ready for me when I checked in at 7am. Also the wifi is pretty good and overall the service was good. My safe was broken and they replaced it for me quickly. Other feedback: It seems that they were renovating two rooms just below my room and they started work at around 10am - 6pm most days. So, the first morning I wanted to sleep for a while but was awakened by heavy hammering.

Jackie was especially knowledgeable. She could tell you about the different neighborhoods, which subways to take, and reviews of all the current Broadway shows.

We were looking for a different place to stay and Ellen found a reference to the 414 Hotel on line. The price was very good; the location was very good for us since it is quite close to the Port Authority Bus Term and within easy walking distance to one of our increasingly favorite little restaurants on 51st St. and not far from Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center.Others describe 414 as a European style hotel and it is so! It feels like some small Parisian hotels we know and it is even friendlier by some. The owner, Susan, and the staff were uniformly open, friendly, helpful, both while making reservations and during our two day stay. There was coffee and some sweets available all the time, a very nice breakfast in the morning, and snacks and wine and other cordials in the evening before supper time.More than half of the people we met were from Europe, Mexico or South America and all seemed happy to be there. I did not hear one complaint. We had very good conversations with quite a few of the other residents.Our room was on the third floor - there is no elevator but it was not a problem for us, an easy walk up - in the back overlooking the courtyard and so street noise was blocked. We had en suite bath with nice amenities, a good bed also with good quality linens and blankets, plenty of room, easy to use TV and radio, safe in the closet.

They were always quick to strike up a conversation and went out of their way to make us feel welcome.It has many elements of a B&B - morning breakfast and evening cocktails with wine & cheese.

It's my first experience with a hotel independently owned and operated and I loved it. The lobby is small but comfortable and warm (fireplace charm). The owner, Susan, works the hotel herself and is so accessible and friendly. She was knowledgeable about how to get around the city and offered us excellent tips and advice that really saved us time and trouble. It was also conveniently located, so it made it easy to get to the subway to get around when we chose not to take a taxi. There was plenty to do close by as well. We ate locally and enjoyed some of the nightlife right across the street at a great piano bar, Don't Tell Mama. Birdland is right around the corner. There is a pretty little courtyard out back of the main building for sitting and relaxing during warm weather too. The room was attractive, comfortable and very clean. We had pretty white linens, the bathroom was original and real porcelain. No tub surround here. There was a stocked refrigerator in the room. We didn't use it, but did keep our yogurt cold. And we had a very nice breakfast every day before we set out. Honestly, it was one of the nicest hotel stays I've stayed in and I've done the full complement from bad motels to the upscale chain. Frankly, it will be the first place I look to stay for my trips to NY from now on as long as Susan is in charge. This is a great place for the intelligent traveler.

Our room was clean, comfortable and quiet. Most mornings we slept until 10:00 or 11:00 a.m., so our nights were very restful. The continental breakfast was much more than we expected. There was a selection of three different cold cereals, a variety of different flavored oatmeal, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, hot coco, muffins, bread, jams, peanut butter, and juice... I'm probably missing something, but that's all I remember. It was a particularly accommodating for the staff to keep the array of food out past 10:00 a.m., which NEVER would have happened at a big chain hotel.The evening wine and cheese offering was a big hit with the guests, ourselves included. We planned each evening around not missing this event. The hotel had a nice selection of cheeses and some excellent wines.We found the cleaning staff to be attentive, thorough and not loud or intrusive in the morning.The hotel owners, Andrew and Susan were outstanding hoteliers. Andrew missed dinner with his family one night just to stay and talk with us one evening. It was delightful listening to how he started his career and came to own the 414 Hotel. It was a pleasure talking with Susan in the morning. Prior to our checkout, she provided us with information about the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade which was very helpful.At checkout Jacque stood out in the rain to hail us a cab, then helped us with our luggage...

The highest floor rooms are on the fourth floor, and the sporadic trucks, horns, sirens, and people loudly conversing in the street on a night mid-week made sleep impossible. The windows do not block the sound from the street at all. Many hotels throughout the city have soundproof windows, and reasonably so. Based on other reviews I was surprised at our experience. I would not expect a guest to stay in one of the rooms facing 46th street without supplying earplugs and some sort of white noise machine- and even those measures might not work.The hotel is very clean, the bathrooms large, the staff friendly.The breakfast is unexceptional; you'll get better at one of Manhattan's many Marriotts.The location is very convenient to the theatre district without the Times Square crowds.I really wanted to like this hotel and we wanted to patronize a small non-chain hotel.

Just book the 414 Hotel. We stayed in a Queen Size room on the 3rd floor overlooking the inner courtyard and slept very well for the whole week. The 414 in general is peaceful and relaxing, but our room in particular was a delightful escape from the hustle and bustle of New York. I'm a light sleeper and slept like a dream throughout my stay! The room itself was incredibly spacious, very clean and the bed was comfortable. A safe was provided free of charge (always a bonus) and after a long day treading the streets of NYC, we would come back and relax for an hour or so, watch the indulgent flat screen TV (a great guilty pleasure) before having some cheese and wine with the other guests. Yes, the 414 provides free cheese and wine in the evenings! Such a lovely way to meet other guests.Each morning we'd look forward to heading downstairs and having breakfast. My partner is a coeliac and Susan went above and beyond to provide a gluten-free breakfast for him each morning (gluten free bread and granola, in addition to the yogurts and fruit that were available). This was such a thoughtful touch and we both very much appreciated it! I would indulge in a tasty, freshly baked bagel and the best cream cheese I've tasted. And the coffee is probably the best you'll find locally (I got a few takeaway coffees from delis in the are and the 414's coffee wins hands down).A couple of people have mentioned that the subway is not as conveniently located as it could have been however we did not find this to be the case - as mentioned below by Susan, we would daily use the subway and would walk approximately 5-7 minutes to the 44st entrance. To me, that is a close subway entrance! So please don't be put off by other reviews, the subway is close once you've found the best entrance/exit.Last, but definitely not least, are the people who work in the 414 Hotel. Everyone was friendly and welcoming, but a special mention has to go to Susan and Drew, Each morning Susan would greet us with a big smile and would go out of her way to ensure that everyone had what they needed. She would share her expert knowledge of the city to make sure we could make the most of our time in NYC and over breakfast she would listen to everyone's stories from the previous day. And Drew is one of the most welcoming and cheerful people I've met! Such a great person to welcome you into the hotel at the end of your day.So to sum up, we loved the 414 Hotel. It's in a good location, the rooms are spacious and clean, it's quiet and peaceful and the people are warm and friendly. The breakfast is a perfect start to the day and the cheese and wine each evening is a lovely touch. Just book it!Rach and Nick.","London, United Kingdom",3,5.0

I can't imagine anyone staying any place BUT in 414 Hotel, I mean if you are going to New York, then what you are looking for is 414 Hotel, may you be so lucky to find a room.

The location, and warm staff reception upon arrival gave us a sense of ease after the cab ride from the airport. We looked forward to each day's morning breakfast (cereal, muffins, juice, coffee), and tried to make it home for evening's gathering (even better: wine, cheese, whiskey).Susan, the generous proprietor, offered us additional entertainment ideas (our list was already long), and so we were able to take in another play, and found a different classy world at Birdland Jazz (in the neighborhood) that we would have missed. The hotel provided a list of nearby restaurants that helped in our plan to eat in a different country every night. Mary and Drew were welcoming audiences when we chattered our way home at night, full of the day's story.The location and access to sites and subways were perfect. We walked the streets of NY, and could easily reconnoiter back to 414 at night (past midnight a few times). We went in for dinner at one of the many nearby restaurants at 10:30p, and had a snack run to a nearby deli after 11p (the guy behind the counter looked up and said ""Oh, Hello!""). We found a nearby bar we thought of as our own by the end of our stay.Susan, Jacqui, Mary, Drew - they are so good at what they do. And the best part is they seem to enjoy it.

I stayed there recently for four nights and found it to be a welcoming, friendly oasis in one of the busiest cities in the world. Tucked in a quiet tree lined street just off the madness of the theatre district and right beside restaurant row, it somehow seems to be convenient no matter where you are. The rooms are sizeable, clean and attractive, the staff are charming, engaging, likeable and seemed genuinely interested in their guests- It's a wonderful combination. 414 makes every other hotel seem impersonal, like you're just a room number at breakfast, anonymous and unimportant. It's like staying at the house of a friend or relative you really like. Every night coming back from seeing the sights, it just felt like home.","Belfast, United Kingdom",7,5.0

Thanks must go to Susan, Jacqui, Mary and Drew who helped us with anything we needed and made us feel so welcome. Loved the courtesy happy hour cheese and wine time, and the cosy breakfast room that enabled us to meet up with many travellers from Canada, England, Australia and Norway! Our stay was for 7 nights, and we found the location ideal for all our experiences from visiting MOMA, walking the highline, Top of the Rock, Central Park, Shopping on 5th Ave and eating in the Hell's Kitchen area. We used the affordable week pass on the subway to get to places further afield Umbrellas were provided for guests....we needed them one day! The only negative was due to the noise from road construction when heavy steel plates were laid over the road at night, so ear plugs were necessary. Would certainly return though, but would ask for a room at the back. Our room was always clean and serviced well. It's a pretty hotel with high standards, in a pretty street with pretty awesome staff! Well done Susan and your team. ","Napier, New Zealand",14,5.0

We had a room at the front , which as other people have said, could be a bit noisy, but the street is quiet. There was some construction going on during our stay and you could here cars driving over metal plates all night. Every night, there was a wine and cheese reception which was a great way to meet other travellers, and every morning there was a nice breakfast; a great way to start the day. Many restaurants are close by, and the hotel will recommend the better places. Convenient location to do almost anything. Susan was a gracious host and her staff are incredible.

Each evening at 5, they also offer a selection of cheese, wines and liqueurs-a nice respite between day and evening activities.

It was a last minute business trip that we decided to extend into the weekend for a mini vacation. It was our first visit to the city, and to be fair, we were looking for the typical tourist hotel in Times Square - high rise, big city view, in the heart of the hustle & bustle. To get that effect, we had booked 3 nights in the Intercontinental. However, their Wed night rate was ridiculously high so we were forced to find an alternative for that first night. Well, I'm glad it turned out that way - as we stumbled across the 414 Hotel during our search on Trip Advisor.While just a few blocks apart, what a contrast between the two hotels! It seems like the 414 gives you the personal, more intimate experience of what it might be like to be “a local” New Yorker. Sitting on quiet, tree-lined west 46th St., it’s a block over from Restaurant Row, and right at the convergence of Hell’s Kitchen and the Theatre District – very walkable to many popular locations. For check in, we arrived a little late for the nightly ‘happy hour’ social gathering – but no matter! Susan welcomed us to come back down to the courtyard for complimentary cocktails and snacks once we settled into our room. We did just that – joining her and another couple visiting from South Carolina. It was a thoroughly pleasant evening, allowing us to shake off the day’s travels, and get a good primer on things to do from our fine company. Afterwards, the staff recommended we try Becco just a block down Restaurant Row for dinner. We took them up on the recommendation and it was a great dinner. Our room faced 46th street (other rooms face the courtyard), but it was so quiet that we enjoyed a great night’s sleep in an extremely comfortable king bed. The rooms are characteristically cozy for a historic building, but comfortable. There is a mini fridge/mini bar in the room, as well as a flat screen TV, both of which were an unexpected surprise in a boutique style hotel. The complimentary breakfast was more than adequate, with yogurt, cereals, fruit, muffins, juice and great, strong coffee. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful - from stowing our bags for the day, to hailing a cab, to restaurant suggestions, to just making everything easy and pleasant! Bottom line? We would stay here again in a heartbeat. The folks are friendly and real – you’ll get no blank stares here - but you will bet genuine customer service, good room value and a great location.

The addition of a ""happy Hour"" between 5.30 - 7:00pm each evening, when wine, whiskey and cheese and biscuits are available, is also a welcome touch. This offered the chance to meet other guests (and catch up over breakfast!) a great addition for the solo traveller.414 is family-owned and the hosts were very welcoming and hospitable throughout the duration of my stay. The hotel consists of two buildings, linked by a terrace courtyard which provides an oasis of tranquility to sit out on a nice day. If you are a light sleeper, I would suggest that when booking, you ask, if possible, to book a room which doesn't look out onto the main road - West 46th Street - NY is a 24hr city - and the tranquility of the terrace courtyard was not matched, in my experience, in the early hours of the morning!

We especially liked the location, which is great for central midtown but in a quiet street (our room in the rear block was serenely quiet), the informal and welcoming atmosphere, including use of a little kitchen off the lobby, and the comfort of the room - plenty of storage space and an amazingly comfortable mattress, though the shower pressure was on the low side. I agree with earlier reviews about the slightly scruffy decor of the rear block, but this wasn't a major problem for us. As another recent review says, this hotel will suit travellers looking for a small, quiet, unfussy place. It's not suitable for anyone wanting a wide range of facilities, or high-spec amenities. For UK travellers the price seemed high for what was provided: we would probably pay a lot less for a similar standard in most European cities. Buts we said: perfect for us.

The hotel owners -- Susan and Andrew -- are incredibly hospitable. They are willing to do whatever their guests need to have a enjoyable experience. And their staff, Maria and Drew were also wonderful. So helpful and friendly and pleasant. The morning breakfast, while simple, is served elegantly. Fantastic New York bagels with wonderful cream cheese, croissants, fresh fruit and an assortment of teas along with coffee and orange juice. The happy hour is delightful not just for the wonderful selection of wines and fine cheeses but also because Andrew and Susan personally host it and introduce the different guests to one another in order to share tips of sightseeing. The rooms are elegantly remodeled with comfortable beds, pillows and giant flat screen televisions. The bathroom was very clean and the amenities were nice also. The towels also were very plush. Though their is no elevator, it's not bad walking up a couple flights of stairs. We had a room facing the courtyard and it was very quiet and peaceful.

We have traveled world wide, yet this is by far the best accomodation we have been to. Not only were the rooms very nice, spacious and clean, but the staff was out of this world. The owners make it a point to get to know you by name and are always very pleasant to chat with. They offer a fabulous and fresh continental breakfast (always with fresh orange juice, coffee, bagels, toast, cereal, fresh fruit, croissants, etc.) and are very helpful with planning activities in the city! They also offer a quaint wine & cheese every night for guests. Located in the heart of Restaurant Row, the hotel is surrounded by a large variety of cuisines. The hotel also has a list of ones they particularly like within walking distnace (and they tell you why they like them!). The personal touch that this hotel offers is unlike any we have every received, and for that reason, we will definitely return. You could not ask for a better situated hotel - even with its close proximity to major attractions, the hotel is situated in a quiet residential area only a few minutes from Times Square (despite being very pregnant at the time of our visit, my husband and I walked to Times Square within 5-8 minutes, and to Grand Central Station within 10-15. The Subway was only a few minutes walk away as well). Excellent hotel - highly recommended!","Fredericton, Canada",4,5.0

At that price, any room in NYC would be a bargain, even the most run down. But although this place had its charms, you can't come looking for the typical hotel experience and if a Marriott is what you are looking for, you will be disappointed. We tend to like small, quirky places and stay in Europe at apartment rentals so this was just the type of place we enjoy. Our room was old (apparently this wing is yet to be upgraded) although very clean. It was like staying in the guest suite of a friend with a NY apartment. There was ample room (almost roomy by NYC standards) and it had everything you needed plus a few extras: a bathtub with ample hot water, nice toiletries, a Continental breakfast (free), wi-fi, and a wine (and scotch) and cheese happy hour. The mattress was more comfortable than the 4 star Boston hotel I stayed at a couple of weeks ago and the bed was made up with comfy white sheets and a nice duvet. The manager was delightful and I am sure she would have been helpful had we been first time visitors. We spent most of our time in Brooklyn with family and in the Chelsea/Soho area so the location was not great for us. But for those wanting to go to the theater and experience some of Manhattan's mid-town excitement, the location is perfect. Just a short walk to Times Square. Parking is on the next block and is discounted with a stamp from the hotel. In short, if you don't mind a small, Euro-type hotel with a bed and breakfast feel, this will seem like heaven to you. It is not luxurious, by any means, but clean, comfortable and welcoming. Our only regret was that the cold weather prevented us from enjoying the charming ""pocket"" garden between buildings. It reminded us of similar urban oases that one finds in Europe.",Boston,60,4.0

We picked the 414 Hotel for these reasons: it had a good score on TripAdvisor, it was within our price range, it looked very European (I'll come back to what I mean by that), and they responded quickly and very nice to questions I sent in an email prior to booking. Still, it could back fire, right? Well, it didn't. From the moment we walked through the doors of 414, it felt like home. The staff was so welcoming, even though we were dead tired from the long trip, and surely had a lot of silly questions.The hotel is two apartment buildings remodeled into a 22-room hotel, connected by a nice back yard. (Would love to sit here having breakfast on a warm summer day).The interior and design reminds me of Paris hotels, the building is old and a bit quirky here and there, but we found it charming. It's located on 46th street, right off 9th ave. A five (or less) minute walk from pulsating Times Square, in the middle of Hell's Kitchen, in the heart of the city. The owners, Susan and Andrew, are so nice people! They made us feel so welcome, like visiting old friends. They are very service minded and professional, but it still feels heart felt when they offer directions, help to book tickets or just make plain conversation.  Our room was up stairs facing the back yard. I swear, we woke up to birds singing the next morning. Who would have guessed Manhattan cloud be that quiet? The hotel offers breakfast in the lobby for free. Fresh pastry, jam, cheese, orange juice, good strong coffee++. Great! And on afternoons they open up a bottle of wine (or Prosecco!) and offer you to join them for cheese and crackers. Other guests brought cake etc. to these early evening get togethers, and we got to meet so many nice people. From literally all over the world. The rooms were spacious, well decorated, clean, no bed bugs (and they take this matter impressively serious with inspections, bug-sniffing dogs and thorough precautions) and if you needed something - you just asked. We stayed five nights this time, and will definitely come back if we come to NYC again. I'm sure I've forgotten something I meant to put in this review, but I'll wrap up by saying this: we've stayed in many hotels in our days, but never felt this relaxed anywhere in the world. Never thought that would be the case in the city that never sleep. Recommended! Thank you, all at 414 Hotel! ","Alesund, Norway",2,5.0

Susan, Andrea (sp?), and Jacqueline (?) greeted us warmly, offered refreshments (coffee, tea, wine, cheese/crackers, etc), helped us with restaurant recommendations, and generally made us feel most welcome. Our room (205) was just fine, and we particularly liked the fact that it had windows that opened (not always the case in NYC) and that we had cross ventilation (we like to sleep in a cool room). My only wish would have been for a chair in the room, as reading in bed is not always comfortable. (I solved that problem by taking my book to the lobby.) I also like that our room was in the back, beyond the small courtyard, so street noise was minimal. February weather doesn't encourage sitting outside (!), but I'm sure spring or summer breakfast in the courtyard would be just delightful.

The free breakfast is very nice (pastries, fruit, cereal). And if you want something healthier there is a nice juice bar around the corner. The room is large (by NYC standards). Free wifi. There are 22 rooms. Some in the first brownstone type building. Then there is a courtyard in between (for guests to enjoy) then a second building with a few more rooms. I was in Room 402 which is very quiet. Friends were in Room 404 which they said was loud as it was on the street side. Note: there are no elevators if stairs are an issue for you. I thought this was a welcome change for the typical large chain hotels I have stayed at in NYC. Loved it.If you drive, be careful of parking. My friend had her car towed from in front of the hotel since she read the signs wrong. The hotel offers a discount at the garage on 45th street.

The 414 is reasonably priced (for Manhattan), our room was not just clean, but SPOTLESS, fresh fluffy towels and linen each day, breakfast each morning (which consisted of FRESH... ordered in each morning... croissants, pastries, cereal, muffins, juices, coffee, and tea). First hotel we have ever stayed in where we actually ate breakfast AT the hotel (due to the freshness and quality of the pastries!!) The kitchen was open each day until 7 PM with coffee or tea available and a microwave. I loved being able to come in from the cold, grab a cup of coffee and take it to our room. The hotel is only 2.5 blocks from Time Square so you can rest in your room a while before heading back out into the city. The subway is within walking distance, too, and NYC people are the best! The staff at the 414 is unbelievably helpful. They not only advised of attractions, etc. but got out a map and drew out subway routes and walking routes to direct us. This hotel is located in Hell's Kitchen. Eateries everywhere... ALL kinds. I worried about the noise and being able to sleep (and not being able to take my own pillow on a plane!) but I had TWO wonderful pillows (so did my husband) and about 11PM total quiet! We were in the front building by the street, 4th floor, and it was totally quiet at night. (The 414 is on a side street that appeared mostly residential). We both slept very well every night. The sheets are of a higher quality and thread count (and not scratchy) and we felt like we were in our own bed at home. (I have been known to take my own sheets... but on a plane with only carry on luggage, I skipped that this trip and I am so glad I did!) We had a cold day (room was was comfortable) and several warm days where we used the air conditioner... very cool and quiet. The carpet looked new (very clean).The bathroom was large in our room (403) and the water was hot. I say this because I read another review before I left that said it was not. The first night I agreed with the reviewer and remarked to my husband that I wished the water was hotter... he showed me how to set the lever (two separate levers.. one for water pressure, a smaller one for temperature) and voila!... All the hot water I wanted!! I think perhaps that reviewer did not discover that smaller lever... The water IS hot. The tub was large, shampoo, conditioner and lotion provided and even a shower cap which I appreciated (a lot of hotels now skip that!) A hair dryer was in the room, also. (I read another review that said there were no hair dryers but we had one IN our room). In the closet we found extra blankets (though with our fluffy comforter we didn't need any!), an ironing board and iron.There are two buildings... a front and back building with a charming courtyard in between. It was too chilly to use the courtyard while we were there but they had a lovely fire going each morning and tables to eat in the lobby... cozy and intimate. I have heard good about both buildings, and also about upstairs or downstairs. We were on the top floor (only 4 floors) but the staff took our luggage up for us the first day while we were out enjoying the city. They will store your luggage as soon as you arrive (labeling it and stowing it in a back room, which seemed VERY safe). They will also store it for you on the day of check out until you need to pick it up to head for the airport. VERY helpful. We were able to enjoy a whole extra day in the city and return late that night to pick up our luggage and head for the airport. They told us they would also carry our luggage back down... to let them know when we needed them but we carried it back down ourselves. (It is 4 flights, no elevator because of the older ""brownstone"" type building, but not bad at all). I am 58 and my husband is 62 and we managed without any difficulty. The steps are narrow and carpeted so be sure to hold the guardrail!They have nice red mugs with the 414 logo on the front for coffee and tea all day that they sell for 8.00 if you are interested in a memento of your stay. I fell in love with this hotel and would love to stay again, so I brought that cup home with me and I am enjoying drinking my morning coffee in it each day. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. We left a large tip for the maid which we have NEVR done, or felt led to do, if that tells you anything.... :) Thank you 414 for a wonderful, comfortable stay!","Charlotte, North Carolina",20,5.0

Travelling solo, it was a safe area just 2.5 blocks from Times Square. It is in the restaurant area, so even walking at midnight I felt safe. There is a front building and a back building. I stayed in the back and it was really quiet. There are no elevators, so I carried my bag up three short flights of stairs - which is really no big deal as they'll help if you need it.Breakfast is a simple offering, but if you're like me you want to try the local foods or grab a Starbucks, so I often took an apple to start my day as I walked to my destinations. When you check out they'll hold your luggage if you want to do last minute sight seeing before leaving to the airport. I used Super Shuttle to an from the airports which dropped me directly to the hotel and picked me up - that was also a great and cheap option.Staff are friendly, althopugh I didn't have much to do with them and I chose not to get my room cleaned everyday so that I could keep everything out. But the rooms are generously sized from what I expected after reading reviews on the small rooms in NYC hotels. Seemed comparable to Australian hotel sized rooms.

Having travelled upright for almost 30 hours we were very grateful for the immediate opportunity to lay down!Both rooms were located on the first floor. The children's room overlooked the street, they were aware of the street noise throughout the night but it didn't seem to keep them awake. Our room was literally at the top of the first flight of stairs. At times it was noisy, but again it wash't too disruptive to our sleep. The rooms were small and basic (especially for the amount of luggage we had) but clean and functional. Breakfast was simple. We didn't have anything more than coffee, although the children did have cereal, juice and toast each morning.

We were looking for a quiet place near Times Square. This is a quiet place indeed. But it is also a little rundown, it is clean however and we had reasonable good size room, it is NYC after all. The people are welcoming and friendly. Breakfast is complementary. The service however, could be better, on a regular things like calling a Taxi for their guests.  And by writing this I am referring to a simple thing like organizing a taxi to a concert Hall in the evening. ( Lincon Center) The receptionist told us they could not order a regular yellow cab, but only a private car. We had tickets for a concert of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and did not want to miss this, we decided to go for the private car option, the receptionist suggested. A ""stretched Limo' appeared, and we were off. The price of the whole thing was not the problem, we knew this beforehand. But it was more the fact that a hotel like this one, was not able to book a simple normal taxi ride. I think any Hotel should be able to do this without a problem.This was certainly NOT our first time in NYC. We know NYC is full off transportation possibilities, but that is beside the point.

So, I looked for a hotel in the area and found this chic hotel tucked in the quiet street just walking distance from the Broadway Theatre District.. The minute we walked in this beautiful hotel, we felt extremely welcomed. The small lobby offering fireplace along with bistro tables and potted fresh flowers was extremely warm and inviting. We had room 501 - Wow, what a charming spacious room wiht modern modern decor. The room has a nice view of high rise buildngs. The minute my wife laid on the bed, she was in heavan. The bed was felt rich/expensive, extremely comfortable with down pillows/duvet, felt as if we were staying in a 5-star hotel. We didn't plan to spend a night in the city, so we didn't have anything with us, but rest assured, the room offered an i-phone deck to charge our phones, the bathroom has all of our toiletry needs.The hotel, the room, the bed, the view, the decor felt so nice, so perfect that we decided to just stay in and romance the night away. We slept so well - It was the best night we had in a long long time. It didn't end there; the morning massage shower was a wonderful experience, the complimentary breakfast was so fresh, offering pasteries, bagels, variety of coffee and tea. It was nice to see other guests had packed up the lobby having breakfast by the fireplace. We ended having herbal tea, crossants and begals in the hotel's charming courtyard, situated just between the front building and the back.We truly had a better time than we have had at some of the 5-star hotels & without spending a fortune. It was an amazing one night - that we will never forget. The personal touch by the staff and management was so evident; it showed that they take pride in offering clean, comfortable, warm accommodations to the guests.

It was so cute tucked away in the middle of the street between houses and restaurants etc. We arrived late at night around 11pm and the lady on reception was really friendly check in was easy and it was nice and warm from the log fire burning compared to the freezing temperatures outside! Our room was in the building at the back so you had to walk through the small cute courtyard garden area to get to it, it was nice to not be on the street though and we had a view of this outside of our bedroom window. We had a room on the first floor next to the main door into the building so I though the noise of this would be annoying however crazy, long days in New York tire you out so think I could have slept though anything! The room was small however had everything you would need along with a very comfy bed and a flat screen tv which we would always use for the music channel. The bathroom too was small however was clean and had everything you would need in it. The breakfast in the hotel was served from 7.30 til 10am and was in the reception area of the hotel, it was a help yourself buffet but had everything you would need including cereals, pastries, bagels and bread, with plenty of spreads, juice, hot drinks etc. This had a nice cosy feel about it and you also got to chat to your fellow guests and see what people recommended etc. The kitchen area was also open from 7am til 7pm daily for you to help yourself to hot drinks and even had take away cups so you could make a hot drink for your walk into the main city perfect on cold winter mornings and a lovely perk of the hotel. The hotel was in a very good location called 'Hells Kitchen' so had a good range of restaurants to choose from, it was also only a 5 min walk from Broadway/Times Square and if I'm honest we walked to pretty much everywhere as I think its the easiest way to get around. We went to The Empire State Building, The Rockefeller Centre, Central Park by walking to them. The only day we did get a taxi was to the MET Museum only because the weather was so bad to walk in, but still this was quick and cheap and we also got the subway to Ground Zero, cheap and easy. We went just after the recent storms/hurricanes so unfortunately the Statue of Liberty and Zoo's weren't open and a few of the subways were still closed due to flooding which was sad to know. But we still loved our time there and there is so much to do, on a positive note we were there for the lighting of the Rockefeller tree and if any of you go at this time I really recommend watching this, the queues are crazy and we ended up standing in the freezing cold for about 4 hours but it was so worth it, the tree is so magical and you get a free music concert which included Mariah Carey, Cee Lo Green, Rod Stewart and Tony Bennett to name a few singing Christmas songs, loved it and it definitely got you into the Christmas Spirit!

The only thing wrong with our room, was we could have used more pillows, and extra hangers since we stayed for almost a week, and they did not have either. It was a boutique hotel for sure. The staff was wonderful also. I loved the exercise of the steps since we ate so much in the city. I loved being in the back facing the courtyard also. The blinds were wonderful at keeping the morning sun out of our face. I agree about the price being a bit high, but everything in the city is pricey. I can't wait to stay here again.

This is a lovely boutique hotel on a tree-lined street just a couple of blocks away from the hustle and bustle of Broadway and Times Square. It really is a hidden gem, but may not stay that way if these reviews are any indication.I had a Queen Room, which was spacious and clean. Amenities included a large flat-screen TV, a clock radio with an iPod dock (setting the alarm was a bit tricky though, so providing a nightstand card with directions might be a good idea), a mini fridge, and an in-room safe. Also worth noting is the generous sized 6-drawer bureau, which is handy for guests staying longer than a couple of nights. The air conditioning kept the room very cool on a weekend of 90+ degree temperatures. My room (304) faced the street, which had its share of noise from traffic (cars and horse-drawn carriages) and late night revelers. I was okay with it but if you are a light sleeper you’re better off getting a courtyard facing room. The small nitpicks on the room I have are the walls are full of scuff marks and could use a fresh coat of paint; and the tile surround in the tub/shower needs some regrouting – but these should not be considered dealbreakers by any stretch.The hotel has free wi-fi as well as a computer station in the lobby if you want to leave the laptop at home. There are no elevators, just stairs for the upper floors, so be sure to get a room on the 1st floor if accessibility is an issue.Outside the front entrance are a couple of benches where you can have a front seat to indulge in people watching. In the back, separating the 2 brownstones that make up Hotel 414, is a courtyard with several tables ideal for chilling out with a book or having breakfast. Speaking of breakfast, it is served every morning from 7-10 a.m. free of charge. It is the typical continental breakfast with bread, pastries, cereal, yogurt, fruit, juices, and coffee/tea. If you’re looking for something more substantial, the Galaxy Diner is down the street at 46th & 9th.The location really cannot be beat. The famous “Restaurant Row” is just one block away (but there are tons of restaurants in the surrounding blocks), with Times Square just a couple of blocks further. The Intrepid Museum and Circle Line Cruises are a 10 minute walk at best.If you’re looking for a clean, comfortable room in the heart of downtown that won’t break the bank then go to Hotel 414. I can’t recommend it enough.","Williamstown, New Jersey",10,4.0

On a night of huge rain, the water was entering the room from below the door (not too much, but it was). Considering it all, it is a little too expensive for the level of arrangement.

Rooms at the front of the hotel are also very noisy, but the area isperfect if you want to be near lots of restaurtants and have Times Square and the theatredistrict on your doorstep.

We always felt safe walking home, even quite late at night.The room was very well equipped, with iPod docking, a huge tele, big bed and clean en-suite.

The continental breakfast was included each morning and was excellent. The location was amazing because it was easy walking distance to the theaters and Times Square. We discovered some fabulous restaurants just around the corner. The hotel is located in the historic Hells Kitchen area but has been renovated and we felt safe at all times. We met people from several different countries and enjoyed sharing some time with them. There is a lovely courtyard to enjoy if you stay there during nice weather. Our room overlooked it and it was a very quiet location. We felt lucky to find such a great place to stay by using Trip Advisor.,"Wailea, Hawaii",17,5.0

This has definitely become the hotel I will always stay in when I visit the city. Location is great with dozens of restaurant choices within walking distance. Short walk to Times Square/subway/Rockefeller Center/and other sights. They held our bags for us in the lobby after our checkout so that we could explore the city too. They accommodated us for a very late check-in the first night as well.I could hear doors closing and people walking overhead but it wasn't bad. Normal hotel noise. Ask for a room on a high floor if that bothers you, just remember that there is no elevator so you have to walk steep stairs to upper floors. No bed bug issues at this hotel either.One thing I noticed this time is that the free high speed wireless internet ran a little slow. It was faster for me to use the 3G on my phone instead of the internet. They may want to boost the speed in the future.Overall, another great stay. At less than $300 a night, I definitely recommend staying here.","Orlando, Florida",56,5.0

Located near to many eateries, attractions, Port Authority Bus Station - to and from Newark Liberty airport - and 42nd St subway station, our room was large by NYC standards with a good sized bathroom and a large flatscreen TV.  This is not a new build hotel and so doesn't have many of the features that are associated with modern chain hotels. But it does have charm. The lobby is well lit and an open fire greeted us on return at night. The staff are courteous but not intrusive (I was always greeted politely as I set out on my wanderings at half-past six each morning).Many rooms overlook the small but quiet courtyard and it wasn't the street noise but the sound of whistling staff at 4am (New York Time!) that woke me. Still it is reassuring to know that the hotel is really manned at night.There is no restaurant but there is a complimentary self-service continental breakfast that is taken in the lobby. Plenty of hot alternatives on can be found on 9th Avenue and in the general area. Evening meals can be had - well anywhere back along 46th Street, up and down 9th Avenue, with every taste and price range catered for.Tip: Be aware that there is no lift/elevator in this hotel so pack light!Tip: Complimentary internet service is available either from the terminal in the lobby or own computer. But like all hotels this can be slow and problematic. A charge is made for printing. Tip: No laundry service but plenty of wash and fold places in the area - including one a couple of doors away.Tip: Although the hotel and the area is safe, visitors should always take the normal safety precautions that they would in any city location - particularly if they venture towards 10th, 11th or 12th avenues in the hours of darkness.Stop Press: Having just read my review to my traveling partner she summed it up with 'I'd go back and stay there again!'

The 414 Hotel is close to all the amazing action on Time Square and the very reasonably priced and easy to comprehend New York subway system. 414 Hotel is on an attractive, relatively quiet, tree-lined street that contains well maintained tenement houses and small, intimate, quality but not overly pricey restaurants.

Our bedroom and bathroom is of a good size and is modern in its decor and, very importantly, the bed is very comfortable. There is also free internet in the lobby and wifi access throughout the hotel. There is a bit of a climb to our third floor but it is worth every step. I am almost hesitant to tell others about this lovely place but it was Tripadvisor that made me aware of it in the first place so it is only right that I now let others know about how nice and 'worth every cent' it is. I would definitely stay here again and am already telling my friends that their stay in New York must include this hotel. Our friends just finished their 3-night stay at a big New York hotel on 7th Avenue, directly across from Madison Square Gardens, paid far more than us and are VERY disappointed (TripAdvisor reviews on this run-down over-priced hotel are not wrong.)

The bed was definitely comfortable but it was hard to sleep with all the noise and the anxiety about being in Hell's Kitchen, right off the lobby, when anybody could just walk in.Our room was small (from talking to others there, I am guessing the other rooms on other floors were larger, but then you have to drag your luggage up those floors by yourself, so it's kind of a lose/lose proposition) and didn't seem very clean or well kept-up.

That being said, the 414 qualifies these tests. Manhattan, being the size it is, has many different areas; the 414 is central to Times Square and the theater district. It is at the end of ""Restaurant Row"" on 46th Street close to 9th. You can walk to almost every theater in minutes and after the performance walk back to the 414. Our cost for a double with minimal continelntal breakfast of coffee, juice, cereal, rolls was $189.00 a night for a double. The rooms are not large nor are they tiny and the 40 inch LCD tv on the wall is a nice touch. The bed is comfortable and the lines crisp and clean. The bathroom is good size. A brownstone type of facade is appealing and 22 rooms is much more acceptable than the 200-400 concrete and metal structures in and around Times Square. The negatives: no elevator and that means you carry your luggage to the 2nd, 3rd or 4th floor; also, this time we noticed a small amount of mold on a shower wall--small is still too much.

The stairs are skinny and you should watch your step, and the breakfast wasn't interesting, and there were certainly funky things about the room, but what I appreciated was how huge this room was. Certainly big enough to share with a friend and it was close to everything and relatively (for NYC) quiet. You can spend twice the price for something that looks better from the outside, but if you can handle a little funk, this is a great place. There are also some rooms across a courtyard that are newer and may have fewer access problems. Next time I'm there I'll ask about these rooms.

Hundreds of Ethnic restaurants on the doorstep & an easy 10 minute walk to Times Square. Hotel staff are friendly, helpful & knowledgeable, gave good tips to help us get around town. We had a room on the top floor.... up 3 flights of VERY steep stairs! Luckily a staff member carried our suitcases up & down for us. The room was nicely decorated, looked out over the courtyard (which we had specifically requested), the air-co was a bit noisy but efficient & there was a great added bonus of a refrigerator in the room. The bathroom was done up nice in black & white tiling, overheard a complete converstion from our neighbours though....probably via the ventilation system!! The lobby area doubles up as breakfast room & has free internet access but if you want to print anything you have to e-mail it the hotel as an attachment which they will then print for you at a cost of $2 a page. Breakfast was a nice selection of bagels/croissants/cereals/fruit juice/apples/oranges. Just enough to get you on your way. We ate at the Galaxy restaurant on the corner a couple of times. Open 24 hours, all day breakfasts & super fast service. Enjoyed our stay here for 3 nights, felt we got good value for money.

Clean, affordable, and just what you need for sightseeing. The place is literally nestled in Restaurant Row (Check out Becco and their fresh pasta symphony...delish!) with dozens of meal options right outside your door. I paid just over 200 bucks for one night and that is a complete STEAL compared to what is out there. Plus, the small continental breakfast was just enough to get you started.The inn will not have all the amenities to be expected from a large hotel. It is an inn; hence it is smaller and more intimate. We had a room facing the courtyard which was remarkably quiet.

There is a motif of historic photos of NYC throughout the hotel, which was lovely.Breakfast was served from 7-10am and included coffee, tea, croissants and small bagels.

Amenities included crisp, white sheets, lightweight down comforter, a mini-fridge and window unit air conditioner. Service was prompt and good. The bathrooms had old-school small hexagonal tile in black-and-white, a white modern pedestal sink and standard shower. There was no closet, but there was a modern rack that easily held clothes that needed to be hung up. There was also a dresser for folded clothes, and two bedside tables. We were on the first floor, but I understand that there are third-floor rooms and no elevator.

The 414 was close to the #1 subway train that travel to and from that area, but I also chose the hotel based on its excellent location in Midtown Manhattan near great restaurants, theaters, and Times Square. I arrived around 12 PM, and although I wasn't able to secure an early check-in, the friendly front desk staff assured me that I could leave my suitcase and someone would take it to my room for me. This was actually a great service, as my suitcase was large and heavy, the stairwell was narrow, and it was three flights up to my room on the fourth floor.When I returned a few hours later, my suitcase was indeed in my room as promised. The room itself looked as if it was recently renovated, with a nice large bed, flat screen TV on the wall, and photographs of NY around the room. There were some small issues with the room. There was a little water damage on the ceiling of the room, and some of the grout around the tile above the bathtub was dark. I also found the bathroom sink puzzling, as the water turned on regardless of whether you turned the knobs left or right. Since you needed to manipulate both knobs to avoid very hot or cold water, it made getting the water to stop completely a bit of a trick.To me, these were all very minor inconveniences. I loved my room, especially the comfortable bed. The room felt large enough, and I didn't mind the three flights of stairs one bit even after walking around the city every day. It was also convenient to have WiFi in the hotel, and a computer in the lobby to check email.While this property is listed as a hotel, it could also be considered a bed and breakfast (the awning of the property actually says bed and breakfast). The breakfast is pretty modest, with croissants, muffins, bagels, cereal, coffee, and juices, and usually one type of fruit, such as bananas. But since it was included in the room price, I was happy with what was provided.I think where this hotel excels is the quality of its service. I was particularly impressed with Jessica. She was always very friendly and helpful. She called a car for me on my last day that was as cheap as a cab, but was essentially a limo sedan. I was told it would be $33 with tax and tip, but when I arrived at the airport, the driver informed me it was $33 without tip and without a $5 toll. The ride was fast and comfortable, so I didn't mind paying a bit more.Jessica also helped me print my boarding pass from the hotel, as I was attending a late Broadway performance and had little time to get to the airport once it was over. I felt like she really went above and beyond, especially given the horror stories you hear about rude staff at other hotels.I really recommend this hotel. My colleagues at my conference discussed a variety of other hotels where they were staying, and I think I had the cheapest rate and the best experience. If you can get by without the elevator, I think its a fantastic place to stay and I'll definitely return to the 414 when I'm back in NY.Joe SalvatoreSouth Lyon, MI","South Lyon, Michigan",34,5.0

So 414 was a very lucky find. It is small (22 bedrooms) and well maintained. It has been refurbished in the last couple of years. Don't be put off by the dark brown paint on the walls of the stairs and hallway, the rooms are bright, light and larger than the average New York hotel room.Unusually for New York a continental breakfast is provided with an excellent choice of croissants, bagels and muffins, fruit or cereals. There is also coffee, tea and juice. It is self-service, mugs are provided for the coffee and teas, and disposable plates / bowls etc for the food. The tea and coffee is available all day as it is not provided in the bedrooms. Breakfast is eaten in the small foyer area in front of a cheery, warming fire.The bedrooms as stated are large, bright and airy, with double glazed windows, and air conditioning units. I stayed in room 402 which was well decorated and had a small fridge, plenty of storage space, an iron, a safe and a very large wall-mounted TV. The bathroom was also quite large and modern with a shower and small bath. Everything was kept spotlessly clean during my stay and the staff were pleasant and very helpful.There is wireless internet access throughout the hotel and a computer guests can use to check e-mails in the lobby. There are also daily newspapers and magazines in the lobby. As it was winter I did not make use of the courtyard garden however I expect this is a wonderful place to breakfast in the summer.All in all I had a wonderful stay. I recommend phoning the hotel direct for a booking as I tried to book through websites but got a better deal for a week long stay by phoning directly. One negative point is possibly the lack of a lift. My room was on the 4th floor which was also the top floor, but remember in the USA the 1st floor = the UK ground floor. I think this lack of a lift might explain why the hotel has not got better 'star' ratings, but if you are OK with stairs then I highly recommend this little hotel which is very handy for Times Square and all the restaurants along 46th Street between 8th and 9th.","Cardiff, United Kingdom",165,4.0

We stayed in the apartment at the back which was quieter, although did hear the main door closing as guests came and went in the night, but with earplugs I wasn't disturbed! Lots of places to eat on the doorstep as the 414 is on ""restaurant row"". I would recommend The Joshua Tree just along in the next block on the way to Times Square; very friendly staff and food is good (especially the fish and chips!). The only problem we had was one night when the heating wasn't working but that was all fine the next day. The rooms were clean but nothing fancy so don't expect anything too luxurious. Breakfast was provided every morning which consisted of huge croissants, muffins, rolls and spreads, and cereals, which set us up for most of the day.

Greg has left a lasting impression on us and although we have only been back home 2 days we miss him and our conversations already.We stayed in room 102 and it was very clean and everything worked. The maid service was fantastic and the room was cleaned to a high standard everyday.The location of the hotel was fantastic only being a couple of blocksfrom time square.There was no safe in the room but we were able to store our private documents etc in the hotel safe which was signed in and out each timewe needed them.This is one of the very few hotels that offer a breakfast of any sorts. Alright, it's not a big breakfast being continental but it's enough to get you started for the day and there is always coffee and teas available in the little kitchenette area.We have been to new york now 4 times and have stayed in 4 different hotels and have found the 414 to be the best so far.

Also, the morning coffee in styrofoam cups made me feel like I was camping. What would it cost to buy 45 mugs (only 22 rooms afterall!). The big one though is we were awaiting a very important call regarding a meeting time and place. We asked constantly if there were any messages for us and were told time and time again 'no'.

We had a ground floor room # 101- which was tiny- even by NYC standards, but it was very clean and the large flat screen tv on the wall was a fun touch. It was very noisy, we heard people walking through the hallway all night- the hotel needs to do something to deaden the sounds in the lobby. Carpet or rugs- or something on the walls maybe??? The location is great to take in dinner and a show all within walking distance. The price was great- $ 160 per night- and it included continental breakfast, coffee all night, cereal, mini bagels, and juices. Not a bad place for a night but I would be claustrophic in the room if I had to stay much longer. There wasn't even room for a chair to sit on instead on on the bed. I probably wouldn't go there again, but it was fun for a night.","Long Beach, New York",53,3.0

I live in London but I am an American and a New Yorker so I decided to treat myself to a stay in Manhattan to do some shopping and see friends. Before going I new this was a B&B style hotel and was a walkup which normally is no problem but the week prior to going I twisted my knee so I called and asked to be moved to a lower floor possible the first floor. I was told since I paid a bargain price through a discount site I was not allowed to move below the 3rd floor (out of 4) unless I wanted to pay an extra ~£30 a night. On top of that the woman who answered the phone also pointed out that if I had a bad knee I shouldn't have reserved a room in a hotel with no lift. If I had planned to twist my knee I would have taken that advice believe me! Since Hotels.com charges your card right away and this call was a few days prior to my going I really didn't have a choice but to stay in this hotel.Upon arrival I checked in and no one offered to help me carry my bags to the third floor when I returned to the desk to ask no one was there. Finally I got my bags up the 2 very steep flights of stairs I walked into the room to be pleasantly surprised by a clean if not sparse room with a beautiful bath and down comforter and pillows. A rather large flat screen TV was on the wall which was nice but there was no dresser into which I could un pack my clothing. There was a bed, 2 nightstands, a desk and chair but no dresser. After finding a luggage rack in the closet I put my bag on that realizing that I would be living out of it for 3 days. The location of this hotel is great for the theatres and restaurants. It is an easy walk to Times Square and any subway.The breakfasts were adequate and there is free internet access on one computer in the lobby.

It has a killer location, only a few blocks from Times Square, Midtown, but in a quiet leafy street, and minutes from major subway links.For NY it has a nice concept: boutique hotel, and unsually for USA provides a breakfast, albeit a modest one with Kellogs mini cereal packets, large croissants and muffins, and mini bagels; fruit juices, coffee and tea (if you are Brit, you'd better take your own PG Tips because the US Lipton tea is insipid at best, and also some of the economy priced US bakery foods do taste like sawdust).The rooms were of good, size and appointed with a flat screen 37-in TV; a nice gesture. The so called legendary staff were okay I suppose when we were there. Free internet access and Wifi is available in public areas. Rooms have iron, hair-dryer and thankfully, safes.Certainly the hotel's website projects a ""boutique"" image, but during our visit, the hotel seemed the worse for wear, particularly as we had to fork out $220 per night per room. Okay, it has a great location, but so do many other hotels, and the owner needs to to re-invest some of his profits and sort out the following before it comes just another dire establishment for which NY is infamous:1) During our entire stay one of the busted lightbulbs in the bathroom wasn't replaced; the bathroom floor may have been wiped daily but it sure didn't look it; the bathroom door never closed as it stuck to the door frame. The bathroom was nice and spacious and apart from the floor was otherwise, quite clean and generously stocked with quality toiletries. The bath/shower was clean and there was very good water pressure in the shower. Toilet was clean as well. 2) The air-conditioning's coolant was not topped-up so it never really cooled the room; and it was a noisy unit3) The window blinds were tatty and need replacing. One of the 2 windows would not stay open for access to the fire-escape, which is a total no-no in terms of NY Fire Department regulations (one did stay open)4) I don't know how often they vacuum the carpets in the public areas and in the rooms, but they looked really dusty and desperately need shampooing or replacing with tiles or wood or laminate floors.5) The old cabinet where they kept the old fashioned rrom TV was still there with the doors hanging off the hinges, so quite unsafe if you have small children in the room (which we didn't)I would recommend the hotel if they sorted this all out; otherwise they need to reduce the rates to reflect the lack of re-investment in comfort, cleanliness and safetyAnd by the way, if you are on the 4th floor, you'd better prepare to struggle taking your luggage all the way up; there's no lift!Hope this helps,Ken","London, England",11,3.0

First impression based on the outside of the building was that this was going to be a great place but I was wrong. The gentleman who checked us in was very nice and I will say all the staff was friendly and helpful. We were given room 204 which was in the front building right above the reception area and facing the street. The halls in the building are depressing. Dark gray or black carpet and the walls were painted a very, very dark purple if I had to guess. I was so dark it was hard to tell. The room at first glance though seemed nice. It was a pale yellow with 2 twin beds since this was a mother daughter trip! Upon looking closer though the room was in desperate need of updating. Scuff marks on the walls, chippy paint on the window sills, carpets could use a deep clean. In the bathroom on the ceiling there was a huge place where there had been a leak that was patched but it was brown and nasty looking and could stand to be painted over. Also there was a place on walls near the ceiling where paint was bubbling off the wall. It almost looked like masking tape had been put on there and painted over and now it was peeling off. Towels I could tell were clean but they sometimes had stains on them. Aside from those issues the bathroom was clean. bathtub, sink, and toilet were cleaned good daily. We had a window air conditioner which ran nonstop but never fully cooled the room down. It blew right into a piece of furniture that the old tv's used to be in but haven't been removed from the rooms yet. We tried to move it a bit to get some air going but due to the size of the room there was nowhere to move it to so we had to make due. We had nice fluffy comforters but only slept with a sheet since the room was so hot. And you couldn't open the windows and try sleeping since the street noise was horrible. I expected some noise but this was rediculous. I finally bought some ear plugs so I could sleep. Also with being right above reception area we heard the front door SLAM shut any time someone came in. Not only did it make the loud noise it also vibrated the beds we were in. also we could feel the people next door stomping around and hear other people from their rooms through the vents in the bathroom. If you kept the bathroom door shut that seemed to help. The beds were nice, clean, and very comfortable. Just all the noise and bumps in the night made it sometimes very hard to sleep. Breakfast served downstairs was always fresh but I warn people to stay away from the coffee. It was SO strong. I had to try and dilute it with water but I finally ended up going to starbucks for my coffee every morning. Several times they didn't even have any coffee. Once it ran out they took their time making more. I will say that the 414 is in a great location near restaurant row and times square and I never felt unsafe in the nighborhood. Also they had nice clean beds. Those are the only good comments I can write. From what I've heard the front building will undergo renovations soon and if I had stayed in the back building which has been redone things might have been different. I picked this place because of the reviews and because I wanted to stay somewhere small and cozy, but in the future when I go back to NYC I am going back to the big, well known, crowded hotels not the 414.","Dublin, Indiana",26,2.0

I found it pleasant, ideally situated and comfortable enough, once I climbed the 3 flights of stairs to my room (getting exercise on your vacation is a good thing). And apparently $150 per night is a steal in New York. I'm guessing that the building was one of the residential brownstones on the block that got converted to hotel/bed and breakfast status (the sign outside the place said ""bed and breakfast"").I particularly appreciate hotels that are in quieter, more residential areas near the center of town. Hotel 414 fit this perfectly, being sited on a quiet residential street a couple of blocks west of the Theatre District and a few more minutes' walk to Times Square. 9th Avenue, the commercial street around the corner, has lots of moderately priced restaurants and bakeries, and a bus line (the nearest subway station is on 8th).The bed was comfortable, the room had enough lighting but was dark enough at night, there was that huge TV (there was also the armoire for the previous TV, which nobody had yet bothered to remove!) The air conditioning worked and wasn't excessively noisy. The room was kept clean and I was too busy huffing and puffling on the (narrow) stairway to notice its condition. As someone who likes baths, the bathtub was awfully shallow. The breakfast looked pretty lame to me--stale pastries in a city full of wonderful bakeries, so I skipped it. The lobby was minimal but it did have a free internet connected computer, a helpful amenity for those of us who don't travel with laptops.","Berkeley, Ca.",167,4.0

We did not stay for breakfast, but the baked goodies were delivered in from a local bakery just as we were checking out around 7 to catch a train. The lobby/dining area is a little bizarrely furnished and was vaguely reminiscent of a dorm room filled with cubes and tables and chairs that would have seemed ultramodern about 15 years ago. The reception was about what one would expect for NY...a little brusque, but not at all unfriendly (there is a difference). The only caveat I would give is that the rooms lie primarily in a building separated from the reception area by a small courtyard, and, to reach the rooms, one must climb a very narrow stairway. This is not a not a problem if one doesn't have much luggage (and we had very little), but I was reminded of the flat in Barefoot in the Park to which most people arrive winded from the climb. Not for the infirm or disabled!The courtyard would be a lovely spot to have a glass of wine or your morning nosh. The room was so quiet that I had trouble sleeping from the LACK of noise :-)Located steps from the Theater District, we had dinner at a great Italian spot Southwest 44 (on, you guessed it, the SW corner of 9th Ave and 44th St., about 2 short blocks from the Inn). It's a real neighborhood place with very reasonably priced food that is served in portions enough to satisfy even the most ravenous appetite. My mother had a lobster ravioli that was simply out of this world, and I had bowtie pasta with cavetelli, spinch, garlic and scallops. Delicious. The original proprietor who is probably in his 80s still greets customers. The first time we went here was with a theater friend who introduced us to Jeff Goldblum and other regulars who were sitting next to us right up front.","Savannah, Georgia",27,4.0

Mike extended himself so beautifully for the hotel guests, and did so much to enhance my visit. For instance, in January my plane got in late to JFK and the freezing rain was slowing the train into the city. I had an 8:00 curtain to see my dear mother's friend in her closing theater performance. I called Mike from the depot, and he arranged a car to pick me up just in time to get to the theatre. At the Champagne reception for the closing show, the stage director gave me a set piece (""painting"") to take home, and Mike helped me find a place close by to wrap it carefully and mail it home. Mike helped me find good restaurants and gave me directions to so many places. One late night I came back to the hotel and Mike was there looking very sad. He'd had news that his father was very ill. I talked and prayed with him and he shared his stories with me. I was so saddened to hear recently that Mike passed away in May of this year. I know that many of your patrons will find this a great loss, but I know that Jorje and the rest will keep up his great tradition of service. Next time I stay at 414, I hope to see a photo orsomething of him in the lobby or above the desk. In fact, I'd like to contribute to a plaque in his honor.Thanks, 414, for having Mike at your hotel.

We did extensive research online and readmany, many different reviews. We found that the 414 Hotel had everything we were looking for, including a fantastic price of 159/weekday, 169/weekend. The rooms were very clean and modern. The large flat screen TV mounted to the wall, the refrigerator in the room, modern furnishings, free internet access in lobby, friendly staff, free continental breakfast that kept us full till noon every day, and the serene courtyard are just a few reasons why we will return to this hotel. We felt very safe as two women in our thirtys walking around the neighborhood. We went to see ""Three Days of Rain"" during our stay and we walked about 5 minutes to get to this theater, although cabs are readily available from the hotel entrance. NYC is such an energetic, vibrant city to visit, and the 414 met all of our needs. I would recommend booking early, (21 rooms go quickly) and I would request a room in the back building on the lower floor. (the building closer to the street may be noisier). The hotel has 4 floors and no elevator, this was a minor inconvenience and we preferred the lower room rate to carrying our luggage up a few stairs.

Not so the 414, the street was not too busy, and when you sat in the courtyard you could have been a million miles from the city.

The hotel is in a great location, 2 blocks from Time square and just off restaurant row where it was easy to jump in a cab to go up or downtown. The subway at time square is pretty close too! The hotel also provided a nice breakfast of coffee, juice, bagels, croissants etc which was lovely and there were also some great diners to go for breakfast close by as well as some great restaurants. Becco was our favourite.

The room was good sized for 2 people, with a large bathroom. The furnishings were clean, modern, and tasteful. The worst thing was our air conditioner, which was loud and with controls which were hard to adjust. This is really two buildings separated by a courtyard. Our room was in the back half: so we had to walk outside through the courtyard to get to our room, which might be a problem in rain or snow, but we had no problems with noise. It is a small hotel, so the staff has a personal feel and they were friendly and attentive. The continental breakfast was ordinary but sufficient: good croissants, bagels, orange juice, cereal. There is an Internet connected computer in the lobby for guests use to check e-mail or look up reviews, etc. The best feature is the location so close to the theater district. We went to 3 Broadway shows in 4 nights and they were all within easy walking distance. There are so many restaurants nearby that you get tired of the sidewalk hucksters trying to get you to stop at their restaurant. There is a comedy club practically across the street, a dry cleaners a half-block away, etc. The subway is not too close, about 6 blocks.

My wife and I were visiting New York for hospital visits, and I booked 2 nights in this hotel via Expedia in order that my wife should have a more homely feel and be more relaxed before some medical tests and procedures. We arrived at about 9.45 pm on August 9, 2005 and elected to check in before finding a restaurant to eat at. We had called the hotel to advise that we would be arriving at about that time. I will start with complaints that will disgust all future occupants before dealing with the hotel’s dreadful behaviour.The following is based upon notes that I took at various times during the ordeal that we suffered, and is not exhaustive of the complaints that we have.I note a limited sample of the problems that of this hotel.·The bathroom had a revoltingly rusty radiator, which looked like it was falling apart. ·The bed sheets were stained and filthy. We had to request replacement sheets which were left for us to put on the bed ourselves.·The so called king size bed is simply 2 single beds pushed together.·The headboard affixed to the wall was filthy and did not appear to have been dusted in months.·There were holes in the wall of the room. ·There is a large step before descending into the room, which is dangerous and caused me to trip several times.·Neither the bathroom light nor the fan were working upon our arrival in the room. Only 2 of the 3 bulbs in the external area were working as well, so there was little light going into the bathroom, and the door therefore had to remain open. It is quite disgusting that my wife and I had to use the toilet facilities with the door open to the main room because of the lack of light. They repaired it some time during the day of August 10 whilst we were at the hospital, together with the non working bulb in the external sink area.·There is no working fan in the bathroom.·The safe in the room did not work due to a low battery and some of our valuables had to be left at risk. This was also repaired some time during the next day.Then our suffering started. I unloaded the car, and then parked it at the advertised parking, which is actually that of another hotel, and 4 blocks North and 1 block West. It has nothing to do with the 414 Hotel and can hardly be described as convenient.I mentioned the bathroom light problem to the receptionist who came to have a look. She claimed that she could not fix the light until a handyman would arrive sometime after midnight. As we had to rise at 6.30 am to get to the medical appointment, we said that we could not stay up until after midnight. In passing, she then mentioned that we should not unpack because we would have to move rooms the next day. We were surprised to hear this, and she said that we could have all our stuff packed up and the hotel staff would move it for us. We advised that this was outrageous. We had just traveled 10 hours, had to be up early and were to be in a hospital all of the next day, and that we were not going to spend any of time unpacking and then packing up again before the noon check out for the hotel’s convenience. This was the first we had heard of this, and would not have agreed to come to the hotel if we had been told. We were only going to be there for 2 nights. We asked her to call her manager and tell her this whilst we waited in our room.The receptionist called us back from the front desk and told us that she had spoken to the manager and that we had to move. She advised that we could check out now if we were not happy. At 10.30 p.m. we were not inclined to go looking for another hotel in Manhattan, especially when the car was parked some distance away, and she said she could not promise any refund since Expedia had received payment in full and they had no access to such monies. I then demanded that the manager actually speak to us, as we had originally requested. I called Expedia at the same time and their call desk said they would call the hotel to find out what was going on and call me back. A few minutes later, Expedia called my mobile telephone, whilst the manager (Sakima Karima) contemporaneously called the room. The manager advised us that we would have to move, that Expedia was a discount hotel provider and therefore those who paid more had precedence over us. She again advised us that if we did not like it, we could check out. She would even help us find another hotel on the next day. This again missed the point that as we were at the hospital all day, we would be unable to change hotels or rooms to accommodate their whim. I advised that I was not aware that Expedia was a discount provider, and the price paid was irrelevant to the level of service to be provided. A decent level of service should be provided to all. I was absolutely furious, and this conversation went backwards and forwards for 10 minutes, when she advised me that she ran a wonderful hotel and they had just received another star. She threatened that if we did not pack our belongings before heading for the hospital, then she would arrange for our belongings to be packed up by the hotel staff. It was only when I advised that I would be making our views known as to the level of service to the Expedia site, the tourism ministry and warn anyone else to stay away that she claimed that she had wanted to tell me that she would do her best to keep us in the room and that I should leave my mobile number with the front desk in the morning. She also claimed that she had told Expedia representatives a few weeks ago that she had the right to move guests around and blamed Expedia for the situation. She claimed to have the same problems with a website called hotels.com.I then picked up the call on my mobile telephone from Expedia who said that she had found out that the hotel could legally move us from the room because the hotel had apparently upgraded our room. I must admit, this was not something of which we were aware of until this point, and we had not requested an upgrade. The logic was that the hotel had a duty only to provide a room at the level booked, and if they upgraded, then they could reduce the grade thereafter at their discretion. The upgrade appeared to solely relate to a king size bed in the room. The “king size” bed was actually 2 single beds pushed together! Expedia advised that all they could do was to request that a case manager open a file and that they would be in touch. This did not happen and I had to call them several times and spend several hours on hold whilst it went to 6 different Expediaites. I also mentioned that I felt a full refund would be appropriate to Expedia..We had to forego dinner that evening whilst dealing with this nonsense because it was too late to go out after these calls. Not exactly the stress reducing and restful evening that we had planned and wanted after a whole day traveling.The next day, we left for the hospital at 6.55 am and whilst my wife was in a medical appointment at about 9 a.m., I received a call from the manager advising that we would not have our belongings packed up and moved, and she would allow us to stay in the room. Due to the threats against our belongings my wife had not felt comfortable enough to unpack. The medical situation was stressful enough without this behaviour by the hotel, and made my wife unable to relax, and she slept only fitfully in spite of being exhausted. The manager also advised me during this call at approximately 9 a.m. that she had faxed a letter to Expedia prior to our stay advising you to tell us that we would be moved. This has not be proven to be true to this date, and several managers have continually lied to Expedia representatives in the past 6 weeks.This attitude alone and the extra stress and upset for my wife would have been bad enough by itself yet this hotel's facilities are also a disgrace.","Toronto, Ontario",24,1.0

Since it was a Sunday I got to pay USD 99 for the night (from hotels.com). Customer service is okay. I arrived at the hotel in the afternoon and since the check-in time is 3 PM I was asked to keep my bags with the staff. When I came back at 11 PM I saw that my room was ready (with the A/C on at full blast, imp in July) and my bags were in my room. The lady at the frontdesk in the afternoon was a little on the ""unwelcoming"" side, i.e., she didn't receive me with the kind of attitude you usually see in hotel receptionists (though not rude). However, when I checked in at night a different person was there and he was good. He even told me that I could have free continental breakfast tomorrow morning from 7-10 AM. Regarding the hotel itself, it is a townhouse sort of building converted to a hotel. You could see apartments all around the streets. The hotel is located in the hell's kitchen area of Midtown West. This is an older part of the town. The hotel is very close to Times Square and other prime locations (Broadway, Empire State, Macy's). For the location I would give this hotel 5 stars. You can walk from the hotel to most of the major attractions in couple of minutes. The hotel room was nice; it had all amenities except a fridge and coffee maker. I guess you don't need a coffee maker since you get free cofee in the morning with your breakfast. The bathroom was huge!! I liked that a lot. The only thing I didn't like was the bed. Also, one of the windows near the fire escape didn't lock.I would highly recommend this hotel for its location, however, if you have some time you can get a 4*/3* hotel in Midtown West and Midtown East for USD 120-140 from priceline. If you get a good deal on this hotel and are expected to spend most of your time out of your room then go for it. A caution the street leading to the hotel appears deserted at late night. If you want to stay in the ""richer"" part of midtown stay on the east side.",Somewhere in Canada,70,3.0

However the room was clean and the staff was friendly. If all you want is a room with no frills this is the place for you. The tv had like 6 working channels, next time we will pay more for ammenities like room service, elevators and cable.","Boston, Massachusetts",2,3.0

They made numerous faxes on my behalf, phone calls, let me use their msn instant messenger and internet to get information from another country immediately to meet the application deadline.Despite what seemed an insurmountable problem, everything was resolved due to the courteous , helpful, caring service of the management and staff of 414 Hotel.The rooms are also very nice with all the amenities. There is a lovely patio, too. The location is ideal woth good good restaurants in the area, food store nearby, close to madison square Gardens (I walked from there to the hotel) .If you stay at 414 Hotel, you have a friend in New York City, if something goes wrong, which is worth more that money can buy.","Ardmore, PA",0,5.0

Considering the ludicrous prices of Manhattan hotels, this is a real find .... on a quiet street (my room looked out onto the even quieter courtyard), smart, small, with good sized bathroom. Pleasant simple help-yourself breakfasts in the morning, free (one computer) internet in lobby, very easy to get everywhere - walking distance to theatres and restaurants, and close to 42nd and 50th street subway stops. A real haven to come back to at the end of the sight-seeing day. Discreet and helpful service. Only tiny fault was that the reading lights in the room were weak. But overall highly recommended.",Ireland,268,5.0

We arrived a number of hours prior to check in and were told we could leave our luggage in the lobby while we explored the city for a few hours. Mike was a real pleasure to deal with at the front desk. He gave us maps of the area, explained the subway system, and told us of a number of great places to dine in the area. The location of the hotel is terrific. Plenty of restaurants and shops nearby and only a short walk to the center of Times Square and Broadway theaters. The rooms are nice sized for NYC. They are nothing very special, but they are clean, have comfortable beds, and are very quiet. One negative is the lack of an elevator. We were on the 3rd floor and it was a job to drag our luggage up and down the narrow stairway. The breakfast that is included in the price is a nice extra. Each morning there was a table set up near the lobby with croissants, mini bagels, muffins, cereal, juice, and coffee. For the location, price, and friendliness of the staff the 414 Inn is a great bargain. Don't expect anything luxurious though.","Miami, Florida",36,4.0

Room was immaculate -- ""spotless"" would not be an overstatement! Much more spacious than I expected. Lobby was being prepared for remodelling -- so it didn't offer a very good first impression, but I'm certain it will be better than adequate when remodelling is complete. Staff was friendly, accommodating and very patient with my multiple requests for directions. Excellent location! Only a couple-minute stroll to Times Square, Theater District and Restaurant Row. Fair priced for such a quality, mid-town hotel. Will definitely stay here again -- and would highly recommend it based on location (convenient!), price and cleanliness.",Altoona,33,4.0

The location is perfect, because it is in a quiet nieghborhood but also one or two blocks from all the excitement of the theatre district and Times Square. The staff was very pleasant, and the people at the front desk are very friendly and helpful. I plan to stay there everytime I visit New York City. Highly recommended.","Miami, FL",41,5.0

There was nothing about the 414 that didn't please me. The location is great - close to theatres and Restaurant Row. (Walk to the Market Cafe near 9th & 37th - had a TERRIFIC meal there! Although, many talk about surly waitstaff - we had no problems.) The room was clean and stylishly modern overlooking a garden courtyard - situated between two ""front"" and ""back"" buildings. My room was in the ""back"" building, was quiet and I had no trouble with noise at all - and I am a light sleeper! Each morning there was a very nice breakfast available - cereal, juice, fresh pastries - a great start to the day! The staff were really great and it felt like a home away from home. Mike is REALLY terrific! He was helpful in every respect and gave me some great restaurant recommendations!
