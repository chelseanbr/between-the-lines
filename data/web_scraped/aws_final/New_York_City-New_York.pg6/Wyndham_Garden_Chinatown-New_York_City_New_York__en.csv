The front desk upgraded us to a room with an amazing skyline view and couldn't be more accomodating. We were so happy, in fact, that we extended our stay for an additional night. Kudos to the front desk staff who were extremely helpful and asking if we needed anything any time we were in the lobby. Much gratitude to the cleaning staff and housekeeping staff who kept the building immaculate and also provided extra towels and pillows. If you find yourself in NYC, this hotel is a real treat. The view from our room (1604) is nothing short of amazing. NYC is going through some trying times and Chinatown has been hit especially hard. If you have a chance to visit the city, this Wyndham property is a gem you won't want to miss...the location is fantastic for getting around the city and the staff makes this place a real standout.",,0,5.0

He is disabled so I was looking for a hotel close to Little Italy and Chinatown.

Enjoy a stay in our plush accommodations with an upgrade to Deluxe Queen Empire View room (when available), a $15 credit to Grab and Go, and complimentary valet parking right here at our downtown Manhattan hotel. What could be easier? Package is based on availability, and black out dates may apply. Standard hotel cancellation and deposit policy apply."" My husband decided we should take the train instead. When we got to the hotel I asked them to honor the day's prevailing room rate of $284.00 because we did not drive and I was not going to use their parking. They said they did not see the parking on the room and they could not accommodate my request. They DID NOT give me the $15 credit to ""Grab and Go."" All they gave me the manager's business card so I could try to contact him after the stay. They were not ""helpful"" at all. The room was not what I would consider a ""Deluxe Empire Queen Room;"" there was barely enough room to turn around in it. My final charge for just the room was $427.56 for one night; $369.55 was the room fee plus tax. I don't think I will be going to New York City again any time soon.

Within a few hours of our first night on this trip, our smoke alarm went off. I called the front desk multiple times with no luck. A 'Hotel Engineer' came up, peeked his head in, and said hold on. Another 10 minutes past with the blaring, ear deafening alarm. Another hotel service person came up, and tried to radio it off remotely with someone at a panel on another floor. The panel was ""too far"" away someone yelled on the walkie talkie. Another 10 minutes of the ear piercing alarm went off, the man returned, pried the alarm off the wall (not a typical battery smoke alarm, but one of the large dome shaped official city alarms), and did something with a screw driver to turn it off. We were told taking a hot shower caused it to go off as the bathroom fan relies on a natural roof exhaust (not a motor fan). We were instructed to shower with low heat showers and to keep our hotel door open when we showered going forward? I can't think of a more vulnerable way and place to shower. The front desk never followed up, apologized or offered any form of a coherent explanation as to why the deafening loud alarm went off for 20 minutes. It may have even been a fire alarm or carbon monoxide detector, but we didn't die so I guess it was neither. The service here is poor. It has been sort of average in the past and I was always willing to overlook that for the price and room cleanliness, but when we are talking about emergency indicators and consistently grumpy personnel, I had to speak up. Additionally, because of the Beer Garden and Ramen Bar on the first floor, there is now an ottoman sized cologne diffuser in the lobby which is bordering on intoxicating in how strongly perfumed and repulsive the scent it fills the lobby with. I imagine this diffuser is to the mask the smells of the two eateries, which it does successfully, but with the price of wanting to pinch your nose in the lobby.We also saw an old lady struggle to pass through the main glass revolving lobby door with her rolling luggage as the side doors instruct you to always use the revolving door. She kept getting stuck, waved for help to the woman at the front desk and who responded by rolling her eyes, remaining at her station and yelling ""Thats why I told you to use the door!"".

Shinka, the ramen restaurant downstairs and the rooftop bar are both worth a visit. Shinka is a great spot even for us locals. The location is excellent, close to many great restaurants and neighborhoods in Lower Manhattan.Cons: We checked in at 9:30pm or so and went into our room. We couldn’t find the lights. Went back downstairs on the super slow elevators and the front desk member told us how to turn them on. Not intuitive at all. Why would you put a dark brown light switch plate on a brown wall that allows you to then turn on the switch to the lights that are in the middle of the room? The tiny hallway light barely lit up the entrance way, let alone the sleeping quarters where this secret switch is located. It wasn’t even a master switch because turning the switch off did not turn off all the other lights in the room when we were ready for bed.While unpacking, I stepped on a mystery liquid in my socks on the dark brown carpet that turned my white socks yellow. The carpet between the two double beds had a big wet spot that clearly did not dry out even though we had the windows open for several hours while we went out. The smell permeating from the spot smelled like moss or mold or something growing underneath the carpet. We laid a towel over it just so we could get into bed since we wanted to take a shower and sleep after a long day.The shower control was difficult to use. We are frequent world travelers and have stayed in hundreds of hotels, and we have never had to call someone up to show us how to work the shower. Not even in the Amazon rainforest! The front desk member I called agreed the showers are tricky in this hotel. There’s always a first for every traveler, I suppose.The glass door of the shower is useless at keeping the water from getting all over the bathroom. Everything ends up wet after you shower. Again, the moldy smell emanated from the shower drain. Coincidentally, the shower wall abuts the beds...My husband, usually with a high tolerance for this kind of stuff, suggested that we Uber home after our showers. He did not want to deal with any more issues for a room that we paid a pretty penny for. We checked in at around 9:30pm and he wanted to leave at midnight. That’s how bad it was.We left the windows open all night even though the garbage trucks and police cars were loud on the street. However, the smell did not abate. We left in a hurry around 8am, informed the front desk of the problem, was promised that the manager would contact us when he or she arrived for work today, and it’s now almost midnight. I held this review in draft mode until the end of the day to give management a chance to rectify the situation before I posted. We will not be back and will not be recommending this hotel to families or friends in the near future.","New York City, New York",5,1.0

Room is light most of the night and of course worse first thing in the morning as the currents are not thick enough. The bathroom door is frosted glass, so since there is a window in the bathroom, that also lets in a ridiculous amount of light. The bathroom shower has only half glass, so the bathroom gets flooded.I asked the front desk to have someone check the A/C as the temperature only went up from the time I first got into the room til about 3 hours later. I was told someone would fix it. Went out for a couple of hours. Upon return, front desk said it was fixed. She never actually confirmed it was fixed as no one had been in my room.

We didn’t stay too much in the hotel as we were exploring NYC for which the location is absolutely perfect. It’s on the edge of the Chinatown one block from Little Italy and less than 5 mins walk to the nearest subway (Grand Street Station). We pretty much walked everywhere in the Lower Manhattan from here. It’s also in a great proximity to Brooklyn Bridge so you can simply walk straight from the hotel.The rooms was clean with enough space. Even though it is on a corner of a very busy street and they were doing some reconstruction on the hotel building it was very quiet in the room. The service was excellent, really can’t complain about anything.There is a great rooftop bar with nice views up to Empire State Building. Definitely recommend to come and check even if you don’t stay in this hotel. There is also some bar downstairs and if you are after a great food then there is Little Italy with many Italian restaurants or walk up to NOHO for other options (Tip for Australians if you are after a great coffee - there is an Australian cafe Two Hands on 164 Mott St).How to get from and to airports:We arrived at the Newark International Airport and with a shuttle bus (we were the last one the dropped off) it took 1,5 hours. That’s not great but it was a morning busy traffic so I assume that’s fairly normal. When we were leaving NYC we took subway to Jamaica Station and then AirTrain to the JFK Airport which took over an hour but it was much cheaper then the shuttle bus and no extra discomfort (no need to walk little bit from the Jamaica subway station to the AirTrain station, I would say around 5 mins walk.) We simply wanted to avoid the unpredictable traffic when using shuttle, cab or Uber so that’s mainly why we decided to use this option.SummaryI would definitely recommend staying in this hotel for anyone who comes to visit and explore NYC. It’s in a great location, rooms are clean and service was great. Rooftop bar is an extra benefit.",,1,5.0

Never had a bad experience here and hope we never do. Some of the comments may be seem overly detailed but may help you get a better picture of the property:Shower – plenty of hot water, great water pressure, tile area clean, at least 3 towels. Perfect. (No shower door so the floor gets wet...go figure.)Room – average size for NYC although some (corner rooms) may be a bit bigger, always clean and modern décor. Small fridge without the pay-as-you go minibar. Heard nothing from other rooms.WiFi - works well although you do have to keep entering the password when you leave the area and return. No biggie.Entrance – quite busty and it’s hard to pull up out front, especially if you are coming south on Bowery or coming off of Canal Street. My advice is to park at T&K parking ($40) on Chrystie just around the corner and walk the half block or so to the front door.Location – At the edge of Chinatown and 3 blocks to Little Italy, so it’s busy on the street and the sidewalks. Five minute walk to the Lower East Side.Staff – A BIG 10 for the staff. Every single person we encountered was friendly and helpful. Servers were attentive, housekeeping friendly and the maintenance guys were polite. Front desk was always manned by a friendly and helpful person, no matter what time of day or night.BAR – The Rooftop 93 bar is absolutely great. Wonderful views and well-made cocktails. This is a bar manager that TV's John Taffer (“Bar Rescue”) would be proud of!TIP: My tip is to call the hotel directly to check on the best rates and availability, especially if you’re a repeat visitor.NOTE: There is a major construction project going on to replace windows in the hotel (July 2018) but we were not interrupted in the least by the work. There is scaffolding around the building but it shouldn’t affect your stay.The only downsides we found were: 1). a lack of neighborhood restaurants that were not Chinese (snails? really???). But the food at the Bowery Beer Garden (connected to the hotel) was excellent (burgers!). We did not try the restaurant in the basement (Mr. Wu’s). It's a short walk to the LES and Little Italy where there are many options. 2). The A/C was a pain in the butt and required a visit from the polite maintenance staff to get it cranking after 2 days. In all fairness, this was during the July heat wave, but that made it even harder to get comfortable. In the end it worked fine.Bottom line, this is a well-run, well-managed, clean, affordable choice for your NYC visit.","Drums, PA USA",19,5.0

Otherwise, I would normally opt for a Marriott properly.I drove in and the hotel is easy to find using GPS. First thought upon finding the hotel is where is the valet? I read from other reviews that you could do valet (which I wasnt planning on doing) but I was really looking for a place to be safe to unload. Well you do it on the street; there is a sign that says loading area and its about the length of 3 cars in front of the hotel. The good thing is that if you are unloading, the front desk says you are okay to leave your car there for a bit ; you wont get ticketed or towed. What didn't like about the front entrance is that its stairs only. If you have heavy luggage you are not going to have fun, and there are no special needs entrances that I could see. Then its just a revolving door to enter, so my thought is how limited the entrance is. So l grabbed our stuff, checked in, went to the room, yada yada, and came back to move the car. From other reviews I read about using the local parking garage a block over for cheap instead of the hotel $60 valet (didn't even see a valet person around). I already booked on spot hero for $25 overnight parking so dropped the car off and its 3 minute walk back to hotel. Since I never stayed at a Wyndham, I was surprised when they front desk upgraded us to a high corner room on the 10th floor (especially since I paid next to nothing from the room). Front desk staff was extremely friendly, and I saw this outside of the fact that they upgraded my room. Corner room has some nice view of the city; empire state building one way, world trade tower 1 the other. You are facing the street so you will get some noise obviously, but nothing too bad. I definitely enjoyed the size and layout of our small but cozy room (small in nyc is normal); great views from both sides of the room, and bathroom. The bathroom has a full window facing the street. Bathroom was modern, updated, and clean. I am not a fan of the European shower thing with just half a glass window, and water goes everywhere outside the shower, but the water heat and pressure were good. Bed and pillows were very comfortable, but only had a night stand on one side of the bed, so I had to put my phone (aka alarm clock) on the top of the bed post. Room had a nice sized desk, fridge, free bottle of poland spring water, standing upright closet (instead of built into the wall), LCD TV hanging from the ceiling, modern alarm clock with usb charger. I was definitely happy with the room itself, and my fiance slept like a champ. Couldn't test the hotel wireless; saw the network and its asked for a password, but I don't think it was included with out stay. I had great cell coverage anyway so not an issue.Therein are my two annoyances with my stay: I found I could not sleep good because the AC duct is right over the bed, and the sound and way it blew over me made it difficult to sleep comfortably. This is ymmv as the layout will change be room but this was very frustrating as the point of a hotel is to get a good night's sleep. Second thing that frustrated me was the amount of light coming into the room in the morning. This is the result of the the bathroom that I initially really liked. It has a swinging glass door that is translucent. Its really nice looking, but even if you close the bathroom shade and the door, you are going to get a good amount of light coming into the room in the morning. So I blacked out the rest of the room, but the light from the bathroom is full force in the morning, and it makes the light in the room too bright.Other points noting; there is a rooftop bar on 18th floor but can't comment on that. Also a bar/restaurant basically built into the hotel at the entrance. There are some other restaurants/bars in the hotel but didn't make it to any of them so cannot comment. You are however in Chinatown so a lot of good restaurants in walking distance. We walked about 3-4 blocks to Little Italy and had some of the best pizza ever around 11pm -- ahhh! Location of the hotel was spot on to make it there. Overall, hotel was average, and similar to a lower end Marriott I would normally stay at. I would stay here again if I was walking to the hotel and needed a quick overnight, but not if traveling with a car and luggage.",,28,3.0

We were not expecting much, just a decent room to stay in and that's what we got. So far so good.If I don't book a Hilton I don't need a lot of service and don't care much for it, however I am sad to say the opposite of service was what we received. On the last day we wanted to check out at 10 (noon checkout available) and leave our bags behind until 1.30pm. The lady behind the counter wanted $3 per bag - odd and this wasn't charged when we arrived and left our bags until check in. As we had three bags the grand total was $9. I didn't want to kick up a fuss and just accepted it, reached for the wallet and pulled out a $20. The lady mentioned that she didn't have change and that was it. I expected her to get some from the bar in the foryer but nothing, she wanted to charge it to the card. As I had cash left and didn't want to exchange $20 I said $10 will do. The response was that she only had large bills. I think the charge in the first place is poor service and if a small arbitrary charge is raised that is uncommon and not mentioned anywhere, change should be on hand.Beyond that throughout the stay, the staff was not visible or welcoming, just neutral.The lift buttons and card reader didn't work - we stayed on the fifth floor and had to press the up button to get a lift to the lobby. Tough luck if someone on an above floor called the lift as well. You'll have to go up first. One of the two lifts didn't have a function card reader which meant anyone could go to the guest rooms. This happened multiple times when a questionably looking fella just strolled in and followed us to the room or didn't know where he was going.While the room was good the soundproofing was not, we heard taxis and cars honking frequently. We were on the fifth floor.Don't look out for signage at the entrance. It is a construction site with scaffolding, however nobody actually works there. If you have heavy luggage think again, there are some stairs at the entrance and no ramp etc.The location is alright but then again, unless you're keen on a Chinatown and walking past smelly fish on the way to the train station this light be a bit of a negative.The advertised rate on their website was $319 for the night, we got it for $120 - it wouldn't be worth much more than that.","Brisbane, Australia",48,3.0

When we arrived at 9pm we checked in without issue but when we got to the room there was only one double bed, I was staying with my 21 year old son. (I'm a 45 year old man). I thought it would be a simple case of going back downstairs and getting an alternative room. When I booked I was asked how many room and for how many adults, I asked for 1 room for 2 adults but stipulated that I required separate beds. To cut a long story short the receptionist said that she couldn't help and that the special requests box is only acted upon if possible. During our discussion about the situation the phone rang on the desk, the receptionist ignored me and picked up the phone. At this point I decided that after all the travelling I'd walk away and chat to the manager in the morning. The reason why, even in these extreme circumstances, I couldn't share a double with my son is that he suffers from severe eczema and tosses and turns all night scratching himself so badly that he's in constant pain and doesn't sleep well at all. I had to sleep on the floor using the spare pillows and the runner off the bottom of the bed! In the morning I asked a reception for either a roll away bed, a camp bed or even an extra duvet to put on the floor, they couldn't even do that. The whole time they pointed out that it was my fault for booking the wrong room. I spent 3 nights on the floor despite asking morning and night for something, anything, better than sleeping on the floor with the bed decoration! This was my first visit to the states and as a serving British Army soldier I'd been told that US customer service was second to none. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth, I couldn't even get a spare duvet!Never again to this hotel or the booking agent Otel who have refused to even call me to discuss my complaint.

The stay here was comparable to a nicer motel at best. First off, the front desk messed up our reservation, which seems extremely common with this hotel. We had 3 people in our group and had booked a room for a king size bed + queen size bed. Instead they said that room was unavailable and had given us a smaller room with 2 queen beds. Front desk staff failed to clearly explain why the room was unavailable. However, after venting my dissatisfaction, an ""upgrade"" was offered. We were given a larger suite with just a king bed, with an option for a roll out bed for the 3rd guest. Larger room was a plus, but 3 nights on their springy roll out bed is not recommended unless you're under the age of 10.Not a full service hotel. No concierge, no room service, front desk personnel is just okay, but not helpful. Asked the front desk for an estimated taxi fare to JFK airport, and they didn't know and told me to just take an Uber. Seriously?

I just returned from a five night stay at this hotel and was not impressed and I must say disappointed because we booked based on the reviews. First of all, our room did have a nice view and we did enjoy the bar located at the top. The view from the bar was amazing. My son handled the booking and I really don’t know what happened but we ended up with a queen bed instead of two double beds. Upon check-in, they would not switch the room for us, but were very accommodating by allowing the use of a rollaway bed for the mere cost of $30 a night. (I’ve paid extra before for a rollaway but never $30 a night.) The room was extremely small to begin with and then throw a rollaway in. Shower did not work very well at all for the first two days. They had to install a new shower head. Not once did they replace the toiletries in the room. I accidentally spilled some soda on the comforter and they never bothered to replace it with a fresh one our entire stay. Never did restock the coffee that was in the room the first day. A couple of days we weren’t sure the room had been cleaned because the bed and rollaway were made very haphazardly. Staff was nice enough at check-in, but basically ignored us the rest of our stay. Had a great time while visiting New York but was very disappointed in this hotel.","Alpena, Michigan",4,2.0

This is not our first visit to New York and we wanted something different to the tourist trap of Times Square. The area on first glance is ok but nothing special, Bowery is the edge of chinatown so you don't get the ""watches, watches, bags bags"" while on the road itself as soon as you're off the road the area leaves a lot to be desired and I would suggest only breathing through your mouth especially on a morning! There were discarded pigs legs, fish and rubbish strewn in the road right outside to hotel! There's a subway station a couple of minutes away though which is good. The hotel checked us in quickly and we went up to our room on the second floor. This floor has a balcony outside the glass door in the room which is shared with all other floors so you can't open your curtains as there's always someone strolling by! The door had some tape on the edge of it I assume this was to stop the draft coming in but it didn't work as it was freezing on a night on that side of the bed. The room is a good size and has a fridge, large tv and coffee making facilities. The bathroom is good too but the fact you can see others showering when in the bedroom is massively offputting - perfect for a peeping tom! The shower was hot and powerful but the fixings were loose and the shower tray rusting, the shower also makes a screaming noise when running which I'm sure our neighbours didn't appreciate at 6am (we were in room 204 if you want to look at fixing that). The housekeeper did a great job of keeping the place clean and tidy, the main problem I had is that whenever we were in the room we were getting bitten by something which was leaving large red lumps on our arms, legs and bodies, we never saw what was causing it but it was definitely only when in the room. The rooftop bar has amazing views BUT the music is too loud, like ridiculously so. So much that you genuinely can't hear the person sat next to you and it stopped us going up again after the second visit. The bar underneath is also very loud - I'm writing this draft while on night 4 of the 5 night stay and I genuinely cannot sleep due to the noise from downstairs and the noise from the road too, I'm dreading tomorrow as it's our last night and we need to be up at 3am for the airport. The lifts are also just full of people going up to floor 18 making it harder to get to your room. Also, we asked the receptionist where we could buy some water for the room and we're sent into the hotel shop where we got charged $4 for a small bottle. The Hong Kong supermarket over the road do a large bottle for under $2. In summary - I'm genuinely confused as to what this hotel is aiming itself at as it seems nice but the uncomfortably loud music and number of visitors who don't seem to be staying in the hotel are stopping us enjoying the hotel for what we booked it for - relaxing and sleeping. That, coupled with the bites from whatever is feasting on us mean that on our next visit to New York we wouldn't consider this hotel again which is a shame as it could offer guests so much more by way of being a hotel rather than a nightclub. It was difficult to choose between 2 and 3 out of 5 for this hotel but I went for 3 as the description of 'average' is about right for what is on offer as a hotel meant for sleeping in and relaxing in.

Got a burger and fries. Good flavor however, no salt or ketchup provided so everything was a dry, dry, dry. Make sure you request it if you order.My room is good., nice view, small and clean(mostly) something weird on my sheets. NO counter space for my cosmetics in the bathroom, that’s a HUGE pain. Put some of my things on the toilet seat to get dressed. The mattress is encased and therefore bedbugs are not an issue.:-)The closet is a problem too. it's a half closet and my clothes can’t hang without hitting the bottom and getting wrinkled. So I use the Bathroom hook. Why the bar is so low I don’t understand. No dresser drawers either.No tub in 1001, but good city view. The shower has a weird design, only half a glass and the water spills onto the floor under the sink after showering. So the floor is wet, not great while you are trying to get dressed.Fridge works, but it’s not turned on, you must open the door and dial the number up before it gets cold..Windows don’t open. Small rooftop lounge for drinks.

There are some pluses, (floor to ceiling windows that provide a nice view, decent bar adjacent to hotel, fairly close to subway) but on my most recent stay (I've stayed here before) the air conditioning was not working. It was 95 degrees in NYC and the only thing you want after walking around in that kind of heat is to come back to a cool room to rest. It was awful - even the bedding was damp from the humidity. The front desk clerk who came up to check it (not even maintenance - the front desk clerk!) said maybe it was because the blinds were open. Um, it's midnight and the sun has been down for about 4 hours and the room is the size of a small closet, so I think if the temp in the room has gone UP since we arrived and set it at 68, it's probably not because the blinds were open. Then he tried to tell us it takes a little time for it to cool down. Like 8 hours?? No, not buying that. I asked to be moved and he said they were sold out. He offered a fan, which we accepted, however it did not do much to cool down the room. So we were not able to sleep much, which is really what we were paying for. On a separate issue, I asked at check in to change the credit card the room was booked under and the front desk clerk (same one from earlier) said he took care of it, but NOPE, he didn't.

Even though we had been there all week we were asked for id on the last evening. Bar food is nice (only ate on first night as we were too tired to go out). Nice big portions. Nice friendly staff.One other issue I have, I was asked to leave my debit card details, which I did as I thought this was standard procedure. Only to find out from my bank yesterday they debited $40 from my account FOR NO REASON. I will be contacting them when my statement comes trough.

They really maximize the city views with floor to ceiling windows in the rooms.3. The free WiFi in the rooms is easy to connect to and works great.4. You are within 3-4 blocks of multiple subway stops.5. The heat, bed, pillows, everything was on point and comfortable.What I Didn't Like:1. The bathroom. I didn't like it so much I am knocking a whole star off the review because of it. Despite being a very spacious bathroom, it is just not designed very well. The huge walk in shower has no ""traditional"" shower head and just a handheld sprayer on a sort-of adjustable arm. So you either need the sprayer always in one hand or have to somehow position it on that adjustable arm just so. Plus the water pressure was lame.Also, despite having plenty of room, there is literally no counter space in the bathroom at all. Luckily my Dopp kit is in a hangable bag, but if I didn't have that I have no idea where I would have put my stuff.The bathroom aside, I enjoyed the property and had a wonderful trip to the city.

Our hotel room on the second floor was so cold it was hard to sleep, and the hotel staff were not helpful. I had turned the thermostat to the mid to high 70s, but this changed nothing. I called the front desk asking if there was anything they could do about how cold the room was, and the man came to our room, turned the thermostat temperature to 90 (the maximum) and said that was all he could do. The thermostat might as well have been a decoration on the wall because it simply did nothing. It did not work, and the room remained extremely cold. I called them again and said that the hotel heating system must be broken for this room as the thermostat does not work, and asked if I could be moved to a different room on a different floor. I was told that there were no other rooms available that night, and that there was nothing they could do. Frankly, I don't believe this, we were staying during a very quiet time and it's likely they had nicer rooms on higher floors available but simply refused to move us even though our room's heating was broken.This supposedly 4-star hotel in New York city costing $200+ per night had a broken heating system and they did nothing about it, and they refused to even have us move rooms. I don't know how they can think this is remotely acceptable.Personally, I will never stay at a Wyndham again. I had even called their customer support after the stay, and they never got back to me.

Round the corner near Manhatten bridge is a dunkin donuts for anyone wanting a quick breakfast, also along Canal St there is a 7/11 which is good to get snacks.There are so many restaurants nearby but we were on a schedule with family that we only ate at one of the Chinese restaurants nearby, I wish we had had more time to eat there again.I would not chose another hotel as I felt this hotel offered all that you needed plus it was in an amazing location that would show a new visitor more than being in Times Square.The hotel also have a fantastic roof top bar which we only visited once which i regret as the view was to die for!","Hessle, United Kingdom",43,5.0

For those driving in (and leaving your car overnight) the valet drop-off is nearly non-existent during peak times - nothing is clearly marked; it's simply a parking spot on the corner of Bowery. Your car will then be driven to a satellite parking lot (my car was unscathed so no complaint there). The front desk upon my arrival was super helpful but I was surprised to see that she was the only staff (they could use more). The elevators during this time were pretty slow and reduced to only one operating - wait time matters when you're trying to get some rest. Thankfully there's a lot of good food and shopping within walking distance. The centrality of the location is great for convenience but not the best parameter for restful sleep. The showers in this place are kind of weird as they are separated by a half wall. There are great views of Manhattan available in the hotel's terrace bar. The bartender was kind enough to escort us to the empty deck on an overcast evening - do note that there was a two-drink minimum to access the patio area. By my valuation, the experience was overpriced but it was the right place to stay for a weekend getaway in Chinatown Manhattan.

Then I was told that someone might call me back in a few days, they ""could not guarantee that someone could call me back tomorrow."" If this was the case, then why did he ask me to waste my time calling back, when he couldn't ""guarantee me an answer?""I pointed out that they went ahead and charged my credit card with no notice of what the charges were, even though I left my email address with them.

It's easy to catch a cab here anytime. I'm glad to have stayed here, and I would happily do so again.

The bright, well-designed rooms mostly face north (always great light levels), with floor-to-ceiling windows that mitigate their modest sizes.

Compliments to the afternoon clerk Daniel, who cheerfully checked me in, and was very friendly and helpful.While the basics are absolutely solid at this hotel, but why don't I rate this place higher? A few small details prevent it from being a great hotel. The luggage check is somewhat chaotic due to lack of space. The food at the ground floor restaurant is generally forgettable. More than anything else, it also feels somewhat impersonal, even though it's not that huge a hotel. It's certainly does not feel unfriendly, but it doesn't feel all that welcoming either. Even when they are not ostensibly busy, most clerks here are completely indifferent as you come and go. Just a few nods or subtle smiles of acknowledgement will do wonders.

The rooms had a nice TV with decent channel options as well as a safe, refrigerator, and a coffee maker. There was a small closet but very little other storage. The bathroom was a major challenge as there was no door on the shower, only a half wall which meant the entire floor for soaked. Between that and the humidity in our room, our towels were all completely drenched everyday. The only other complaint about the bathroom was the door. It was glass! And didn't latch properly and offered very little in terms of privacy. The restaurant onsite offered decent food, some things we got were really good, others not so much. Service was spotty.

Then we find out that our room wasn't available despite us getting there at 7. We had to wait while he found another available room. It seemed like originally we were supposed to have a higher floor room as he first checked the rooms on top, but after he placed us on the second floor, you know because they weren't available. Housekeeping apparently still hadn't cleaned it?Then the issue of the elevator- it seems the buttons don't work consistently. Some times after we swipe it would light up other times we had to press it multiple times. Oh and the elevator seems old and small too.When we got to our room it was tiny. I mean I could understand that part at least, but it was still small even for NYC standards. Another issue was the fact that there was no laundry machine.

I was in a corner room and could never get the temperature below 73 degrees, even though the thermostat was set at 60. I was told that it was because it was a corner room and I had two glass walls and the AC was blowing in the wrong direction. They tried to alleviate it with giving me a fan to help circulate the air, but it didn't do very much good. Of course, as I was leaving I found out one of my coworkers was also in a corner room and her temp was always at 68. So, who knows.The lobby is tiny, it's slightly claustrophobic, but that's NY. The other thing that was crazy, like I almost switched rooms, was when I got into bed, I could feel the end of the unfitted sheet on my feet. Like, the maid forgot to tuck it under the mattress.

It's funny how one person can change your feelings about a hotel by seeming genuinely caring.I admit that I was a bit annoyed from the start, when I called to talk to the hotel itself and could NOT get through... only to the main 800 Wyndham number. The 800 staff would not give me a direct hotel number... would only relay my questions while I waited on the phone. (i had some super specific questions, like whether the floor-to-ceiling windows were treated for privacy... the answer was going to affect the sleeping attire i brought.) I also requested the highest floor in our category and/or a corner room, letting them know it was a special occasion. There was absolutely no mention of this... no note of congratulations... no nothing. We had paid for a more expensive 'empire view' room' because it was a special anniversary. Our room barely had a view. Our request was ignored and when we politely asked, the answers were super officious. You know the drill... ""well, mam. we can get you a higher room for X-amount per night.... The woman working the front desk VERY grudgingly moved us to a corner room the second day (so annoying... i believe they are just betting that clients will not want to pack and move if they put off the room change to the next day.) I DO believe that she knew that the air conditioning wasn't working properly in the new room. It was almost 100 degrees that weekend. We got home that night, having let them know earlier that the air wasn't working, only to find an oscillating fan set up in the room. REALLY??So --- unbelievably hot and tired (being a tourist isn't easy!!) --- and on our actual anniversary night, we had to pack up and move again. In fairness, our next room did have a beautiful view. However, it had a balcony outside the windows, which I don't recommend. As others have mentioned, it is open to all rooms on the floor so there is really no privacy if your neighbors decide to walk around-- back and forth-- which our neighbors did frequently. (**note to future guests-- stay in front of your own room to enjoy the view!! It's just good manners, no?? Also-- the smell of (I assume prescription) pot was so very heavy on our floor that it was even strong in our room. This went on for 3 days. One could smell it from the elevator. I don't understand why the hotel doesn't take some control of this. I certainly didn't want to be the floor monitor on this issue, and chance an unpleasant confrontation with our neighbor. I feel this should have been their job... and it would be IMPOSSIBLE for them not to know. Honestly--- read my hundreds of reviews. I'm not usually so negative and am really quite forgiving. But this hotel has a couple of very unpleasant people at the front who really put us off so that things like broken air conditioning became harder to overlook.What we loved? The bed was super comfy. The room was kept super clean. The large windows are beautiful. We had a yummy breakfast in the bar area. Water pressure was excellent. Wifi was good. The rooms were very well insulated so that we couldn't really hear our neighbors. We liked the neighborhood... close to such a variety of cultures and experiences.

First impression: Fancy for budget in NYC. New hotel in Chinatown. Small sink. I don't think I'd go back, unless it was similarly priced, but it wasn't BAD or worthy of a 3-star rating. Small (but very nice and modern) rooms. Bathroom sink was really small, bathroom overall just so-so. BUT… VERY COOL: There’s a Penthouse bar on the 18th or 19th floor that had a cool vibe, floor-to-ceiling views looking uptown (Empire State Building was visible)… and zero people inside on a Monday night at 9pm. I love empty spaces like this, so I'd recommend it. If you're coming here as a business traveler, you won't be disappointed, you can get work done and it is a modern room. But the location isn't ideal, sort of a ""dead zone"" for hot restaurants etc. 4 stars is a perfect rating for this at that price.","New York City, New York",11,4.0

Stations. We caught the J train from Jamaica after our arrival from the airport, so cheap. We even caught the train to Coney Island and back for the day. It is also a few minutes from the restaurants of Little Italy. We used the subway a lot, so it was no problem staying far from midtown, two to three stops from the action really. At night it was the best because we loved to eat at the restaurants nearby. We thought the staff were reserved but polite when we had questions. The room was a good enough size, clean and comfortable with an excellent TV just in a perfect position to watch it from bed. Bathroom big and super clean but the glass shower screen is definitely too small, so to stop the water from spraying everywhere, the pressure is low, so you cant take a quick shower because of that. The water was plenty hot enough though. The maid always left plenty of towels, of every size and her cleaning was the best I have enountered in any hotel stay. We had a wardrobe, safe, coffee machine with pods and teabags, a fridge and free water. The Chinatown location shouldn't bother anyone if they take the subway.

For the first four nights, I was given a 12th floor queen room, with a wonderful view of the Empire State Building. Since I had a roommate joining me for the last half of my stay, I had reserved a double twin bed room. Because my roommate was arriving after taking a red eye flight, I asked if I could check into my new room early so that I wouldn't need to store my bags after I checked out of the first room. The staff went out of their way to help. They said that if the new room wasn't ready by the time I needed to leave for a meeting, I could just leave our bags in my old room and they would transfer them for us. Instead, housekeeping and the front desk worked hard to quickly get our new room ready. It happened to be the room right next door, so it made things very simple.The location of the hotel is perfect for those who want to stay in Manhattan, but not pay the price for being in midtown Manhattan, and avoiding the isolation of the FiDi. The Grand Street subway station is a very short walk, and that station has express service to the West Village, midtown, and into Brooklyn. Yes, the hotel is located in Chinatown, which can get crowded, with dirty streets, and an assault on the senses if you're not used to it. Get over all that. This is New York CIty.The only complaint I have about the hotel is something that they are unable or unwilling to address. There is absolutely NO way to have a shower and not create a flood. The glass partitioning wall does nothing to keep the water inside the shower. You'll need at least another towel or two to have on the floor because the shower mat they provide is woefully inadequate. I'm not usually someone who has housekeeping come into my room on a daily basis, but this was the only way to ensure getting fresh towels and clearing out the wet ones.","Calgary, Canada",100,5.0

It's in Chinatown. Not necessarily a bad area, but it's not a trendy area or an area close to mainstream shopping or mainstream tourist attractions. It is a fairly close to a subway station for a NYer, but if you are a suburban person and not used to walking, it is NOT right around the corner from a subway either. Also, this is one of the busiest, most hustle bustle areas of town during daytime, so keep that in mind.It's a small hotel and the rooms are small. The windows are all glass, so depending on which aspect of the building you get a room in, you may get an excellent view.There is also excellent light in the bathroom because the walls are glass too.We didn't have a problem with noise, despite what other reviewers have written, but that might have been our luck.On the bad side, the separation between the bedroom and bathroom is glass as well and there is hardly any noise privacy.

The most surprising and disturbing thing in the bathroom was the shower, there was only half a shower door. After showering, I had to use several towels to dry the floor. The room, which is small (that's expected in NYC) could use some updating, the lamp was outdated and didn't provide adequate light for the room. And alas, the window didn't open, it's always nice to get some fresh air. The hotel is located close to the Brooklyn Bridge and several tourist attractions. I truly enjoyed being able to nearby Little Italy and eat at Ferrara Bakery, where the food and pastries were wonderful, and the waiter was truly welcoming and polite. One positive aspect of staying at this hotel was the reception staff, who were very accommodating, even when they were busy. That's certainly a plus. I ate at the hotel restaurant, mostly too avoid the unseasonably wet and cold weather, the food was adequate, but again the waiter was very friendly.

The Wyndham Garden Chinatown is perfectly located for both. Easy walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go and only 5 minutes from the Grand St subway station.The room was very good. It's New York so we went there not expecting much space, but it was a decent size. The bed was clean and comfortable. The one weird thing was the shower, which was one without a door and so every time we took a shower there would be water splashing out.

A really great deal on this hotel (offered at $160-180 a night depending on the room) kept us in the city for the weekend and we couldn't have been happier. The location is really great - right between Chinatown and Little Italy, a few blocks from the heart of Soho, and even walking distance (15 minutes or so) to Tribeca, Financial District, Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side. If you get bored staying here, its your own fault. You can also get to the Grand Street subway in about 5 minutes, and the Canal street station in about 8 minutes. Plus, if you want to take a taxi, we were pretty much able to walk out of the hotel and get one within 90 seconds at most. It is a high traffic spot, coming off the Manhattan bridge, so there are always empty cabs heading towards mid and uptown. Beyond the location, the staff is friendly, and the rooms are nice. It is a NYC hotel room, so don't expect anything spacious. If you can, get a higher floor room - there is a good reason why there is a rooftop bar there, as the height of the hotel in this part of town gives it an amazing view up towards mid town - a clear shot to the Empire State building - and on the front side towards the Freedom Tower. No major complaints about the room or hotel - good outlet accessibility, good HVAC, good bed and pillows, clean well appointments rooms. If I had to pick any complaints, I would say it would be that the hot water took a long time to get going in the morning (at least on the floor we were on), and that the shower is one of those that doesn't have a door that closes - must be something about this part of NYC, as I've stayed at others in the area with the same design. After three days I couldn't figure out how to take a shower without getting water splashing out of the shower. Truly a hidden gem in the area and great for anyone looking for a fun weekend in the city.","Barre, Vermont",6,5.0

Life had been a bit depressing in my first hotel (it will remain nameless), but it has definitely gotten better here. Though I still spend most of my time hunched over my laptops working, my days are brightened by the incredibly kind housekeeper on my floor, Kumaire. Even when I'm my most manic work mode, she kindly cleans around me, and makes sure I have everything I need. The room was spotless when I got here, and somehow it seems even cleaner by the day. I guess beyond Kumaire, I should add that the room is decently sized -- especially for NYC -- and the downtown location is cool.

This hotel is in a fairly good location if you want to stay downtown. The World Trade centre is nearby. There are plenty of restaurants and a few diners nearby to eat in. There are not as many bars nearby, so it depends what you’re looking for. There is no bar in the hotel. There was no restaurant in the hotel at that time. There was a mix up with our room when we arrived – our booking had not recorded that we’d paid for an upper floor room, so we had to spend 2 nights on a lower floor before they could move us to the upper floor we had actually booked. We got a very small refund on our room rate for those two nights, but no compensation, and no real apology. The rest of our stay went smoothly. The rooms were clean, and the lifts were a good size. The view from our upper floor room once we got it was fantastic. They did store our luggage for us on the last day before we went to the airport. They called a taxi for us but the service was really poor, they tried to charge us per item of luggage rather than on the type of vehicle we hired – our luggage comfortably fit into a normal sedan with room to spare.

But in any case, we enjoyed our room, which was comfortable and nicely designed. We also loved being in the heart of Chinatown; one of us really loves the Chinese bakeries.....;).

We could hear traffic on Bowery but it wasn't super loud and I always bring ear plugs with me when I travel anyway. The room was a little chilly, owing to the floor-to-ceiling windows (store bags and clothes away from the windows so you don't put on icy jeans!). The view was worth the chill. The thermostat was adjustable, and I like it at 65 F...I'm sure anyone could adjust it higher to counter the chill from the windows though.I really liked this hotel room and I definitely will be back, but I'm giving it a 4 rating instead of a 5 because the bathroom really irked me. I think the designers sacrificed functionality for form. It LOOKS beautiful but there were no towel racks! There is a very small hook behind the door, but nowhere else to hang a towel. Also, the shower has a glass half-partition, but this one felt shorter than half. As much as I tried to aim the shower head the opposite direction and close to the wall, water got everywhere. The toilet paper rolls hang right there, and they got soaked each time we showered. The floor is ICY in that bathroom - bring slippers or thick socks!!! But it did LOOK nice. It just wasn't as functional as I would have liked. It won't preclude another stay, but I felt it was pertinent to add this info so other people are aware and prepared.Overall, this was a great stay.

The entire building is new, I would guess under 3 years old, so everything is new and fresh and contemporary which is always a treat.

It's not the lap of luxury and it's in Chinatown, but that's why it's reasonably priced. We like character and Chinatown definitely has it. The hotel is one block from the Grand Orange subway stop, so you can get almost anywhere in Manhatten within 30 minutes. It's about 3 blocks from Little Italy and maybe 9 to Soho.All the beds are doubles and the rooms are almost as small as in Paris, but I've heard that's common in Manhatten. My husband and I usually sleep on a king and we don't sleep well, but we had no problems sleeping. The bed was firm but comfortable. No sign of bedbugs. Very nice pillows and they promptly brought us extras when we requested them. We also requested a portable room fan for white noise for sleeping and they promptly provided that. We were on the 5th floor and near the elevator and if we hadn't had the fan, we would probably have heard some street and elevator noise. The street was fairly quiet at night and the hotel is so small there's not allot of people in the halls to create noise though. The staff was very courteous. Our only issue is that the shower door is like they have in Europe, only covering half the needed area so that tons of water spews out on the bathroom floor. I don't understand why anyplace would want that, since it's got to decrease the life of the bathroom flooring. Make sure you have plenty of towels to sop it up.

Not great, but definitely serviceable. Everything looked new and clean, as far as I could tell. Everything was very small but I assume that is standard in NYC (this was my first trip there). The price was pretty reasonable compared to other NYC prices, but still kind of high for what you get. It was pretty close to a train station, so it wasn't too hard to get around. The area itself was pretty dead though, there were no bars, stores, pharmacies, etc other than the small grocery stores that comprise Chinatown and those all shut down pretty early. The restaurants were not very clean looking, so I did not partake in any of them. You'd have to walk at least 20 or so minutes to get to anything good. The hotel bar and restaurants were closed, with just a printed notice in the rooms telling you it was closed for menu changes, which seems weird for a supposedly new location. It was just really inconvenient since there wasn't much else around to go to, it would have been nice to have a place to eat quickly. I overheard the hotel staff being very short and kind of rude to a customer who was inquiring about this. I guess they're tired of answering questions about it, but there's no need to be rude. It's your job. As far as the room goes, the bed was comfortable. There was very little storage for clothes, just a very small armoire, no dresser or anything. The view from our room wasn't terrible if you turned your head and looked down the street.The bath room is my biggest complaint, but I think we were in a handicapped room so that could explain some of it. There was absolutely no place to put your toiletries. There was a pedestal sink with no room for anything. No counter space, no shelf above the sink, nothing. There is a very small shelf next to the shower, that's really the towel rack, so we put a couple things there, but most things had to cram into the very small clothes armoire and be carried in and out (I felt like it was a dorm bathroom!). Also, the shower was walk in, so it had no curtain or door -- aka no way to stop the water from escaping. The floor would be SOAKED every time one of us would shower, and we'd have to use all the extra towels to sop it up or else stand in water while you dry off.Overall, it was fine.

On arrival found that they placed us on 2nd floor, so asked to be moved to the 7th floor away from Bowery St because of street noise. The balcony was not particularly usable, so in future I would not pay extra for that. Nice view to the north through the window though. Room was small - as usual for NYC. Lack of any kind of towel bars in the bathroom was rather annoying and impractical. Rooftop bar had beautiful view, but you had to buy a minimum of 2 drinks to sit up there. We found the location to be conveniently located to our son's studio & gallery and walked most days to breakfast in Little Italy and dinner in Chinatown and lower east side restaurants.

Staff are friendly and helpful, even though they didn't really believe us when we called down to reception to tell them we had no TV remote (?!) and one of them came up to look in the drawers (as if we hadn't already) - a new remote was brought to the room within a quarter of an hour. The beds are comfy - we stayed in a twin room, so space was at a premium, but it didn't feel too cramped. The bathroom had a frosted window on the inside - unusual and I'm not sure I really liked that, despite the bonus of natural light in the bathroom. Best not to look too closely when sitting on the loo either, since the shower configuration meant it basically pointed out of the glass half-wall, and the tiles stopped after 3 inches, meaning the wallpaper had started to peel. My dad and I enjoyed peering down out of the window at the junction of Bowery and Hester to figure out why everyone was beeping their horns all the time. This was fine during the day and early evening, but it did disturb his sleep when there was a traffic jam at 11.30pm (I wore ear plugs, so missed the excitement). The in-room air con was also noisy, but effective. Strange bubbling noises seemed to emenate from a service room opposite ours, possibly linked to common areas air con or the elevators? Sometimes this was quite loud, but not at night.The hotel is well situated, on the edge of Chinatown and close to Little Italy, with two subway stops within easy walking distance (2-3 blocks at most), which was very useful as we used the subway almost exclusively to get around. It benefits from being the tallest building in the area, with excellent views of the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings if you're facing North. Sadly, by the time we decided to go to the rooftop bar to have a drink and a look around up there, it was shut for a 'menu revamp', and we couldn't even go to just take a few photos. Would I stay here again? Possibly - the free wifi was a massive plus, and always worked, with full signal in the room - but Brooklyn might be a cheaper, quiter option next time.","Cambridge, United Kingdom",8,4.0

I usually stay in the midtown area but wanted to try something closer to Soho this time. The location is convenient for walking around and there is a subway a few minutes away. The street this hotel is on (Bowery) doesn't have a lot happening at night (mainly lighting stores) so if you're looking for lots of nightlife, there isn't much in this area (not that I found anyways...and especially compared to Times Square). I had a room on the corner of the 12th floor facing north and it had the most beautiful view of the city at night. The room itself was a decent size (I've stayed in smaller and bigger) so I think it's pretty average. Everything was very clean and new so I think you can't go wrong for the price.

First off, if anyone reserve this hotel with the intent to use the sofa bed, DON'T. The cushion was thin and you can feel every spring when you lay down. That's what my 9 year old said, so imagine being worst if a full size 120+ lbs adult were to sleep on it. Bathroom. It's one of those looks great, but not practical bathroom. The standing shower is the half glass half open design. It's great...if it's a large enough shower, but we're talking about NYC and it's tiny. We're talking splash damage everywhere.....or a mini flood in the bathroom when you're done. By the way, they didn't clean the shower properly. There was quite a bit of hair left in the shower drain and under the drain, black slime buildup. I was grossed out big time!!!! Pictures are worth a thousand words. I uploaded pictures of the drain so you can come to your opinions on that. Other than the issue with the shower and sofa bed, the hotel is pretty decent overall. Nonetheless, these are problems that is unacceptable to the brand of Wyndham. Hope they improve on that area.",,20,2.0

You are in the heart of Chinatown and on the edge of Little Italy so you can be sure to get good eats within easy walking distance. This is not a swanky neighbourhood so you will see shopkeepers putting their wares on the sidewalk, smell the spices and the fish, and be offered knock off handbags on nearby street corners. You will rub shoulders with workers hurrying to their jobs and you may not find an American style grocery store nearby - but you will find lots of Asian grocery stores, noodle shops, dim sum, jewellery stores and other shopping. We found it a bit far from the uptown sites we wanted to visit but we had not yet learned about switching to an express subway (get a subway map from the front desk).

The views were incredible over the city. The location was good. We were a bit dubious at first as we thought we'd be a bit far out from the centre.

The room and entire hotel was very clean, and our room was decent size. The staff was great! Everyone was very nice and helpful. The location was good, very close to the subway, although I hate the fact it is right in the middle of a fish market, whew stinky! The rooftop bar at the hotel had just recently re-opened, however the first night we stayed there it was closed for a private party. The second night we had a pre-show drink up in the lounge, it was very nice, very reasonable during happy hour. The prices to get on the rooftop were ridiculous! If we are paying guests at the hotel we should be able to enjoy the rooftop without the hefty entry fee, the drink prices should be enough of a cost to be up there. I had read there was a drink minimum, but I guess that recently changed to an entry fee + 1 drink. But to be clear you can go to the bar inside and there is a great view, the fee is only to be on the rooftop.The only problem we had with the room was when we arrived. We had been assured we had rooms next to each other (we had 2 rooms for 4 friends), one room with 1 bed and one with 2 beds, and that we had a balcony. In fact we were told back in April/May when this was arranged that our rooms had already been assigned. I called once before we arrived to check this arrangement, and I was assured it was still booked that way. When we arrived we were told only one of the rooms was on the 2nd floor (therefore had a balcony) and not only was the room with 2 beds not next door, it wasn’t on the same floor. Further, we were told there were no doubles on the second floor, period. I must have misheard him, because we found out the next day that there were in fact doubles on the second floor (we could see in the window), and in fact there was one next door to our friends. That was infuriating. If you accidentally gave out “our” room that is one thing, but to tell us there are no doubles on that floor was a bit far. The balcony on the 2nd floor was nothing to write home about, it is a shared space between all the rooms with no chairs or furniture on it, but it did allow fresh air into the room, and we would have been next door to our friends, which was our entire purpose of this trip to NYC, to spend time catching up. All of these other reviews are correct, there are huge windows (although we did not have a floor with a view), the shower water can be messy (but we liked the nice water pressure!), it could be loud if you are on one end of the hotel (corner of Bowery & Hester, so ask for a room away from that corner if that is a concern)....For the right price I would certainly stay here again. It was clean, well located, and overall a nice stay. I did not give them a lower rating because of the room mis-hap, but just be forewarned it happened to us, so if rooms are important to you, call an confirm again and get names.",Texas,34,4.0

The rooms aren't large, but they're well designed and efficient. I wish there had been hooks for towels in the bathroom, and we ran up huge cab bills getting to and from the hotel from other areas of the city because the traffic in chinatown during rush hours can be impossibly slow. But if business or pleasure keeps you downtown this is a great location. One serious criticism is the in-hotel restaurant called ""Elevate."" Avoid this at all costs. The first morning we tried to have breakfast there, the waiter informed us that the only beverages available for our kids was soda. We went back the next morning having been told that the full breakfast menu was now available, but it was a huge disappointment. For the cost I didn't expect cold coffee, little diner-style paper napkins, and gum stuck underneath the tables. Gross. It was not an ""elevating"" experience.",Red Hook,5,4.0

And they accept pets. After being assured that there was a park very close I thought it would be fine. The park is filthy. Three days of overflowing trash cans and all kinds of litter. I did find a couple of patches of mulch for her but it was full of broken glass, We did have a very nice room. It was a corner king suite with a sofabed and small fridge. The room was very hot and humid so I called for service to fix it. A repair man came and said that he took care of it. During the night it did go down a couple of degrees but by the next morning it was a sauna again. They did move us to a one bedroom suite that was much better. I was told that all of the corner suites are hot when the weather is sunny. I only had takeout from the restaurant but it was very good. Parking was $60 a night but worth it as all of the self parks were $50 for a minivan and it was worth the extra $10 not to have to do it ourselves. I was hoping that I could find a 7 Eleven or similar but there was nothing of that at all. I wanted Asian culture and I got it. The first night I wanted some cans of Pepsi but they had removed all of the soda vending machines so a very rude man walked me down to their breakroom to use that vending mach. I think that he hated me as he then had to walk rather than sit to do his texting from two phones. Ling was the best. The hotel should be all Lings. Guests in rooms on the second floor have access to a large balcony but I didn't see any chairs or tables. The lounge area is very nice and you can get food there also. I saw some awesome plates of Sushi there. Works of art.","Maumee, Ohio",2,3.0

Just a two-sided hook where the hair dryer is stored. 3) The restaurant is nice, but automatically adds on gratuity. This might be a New York thing.

We’ve stayed at other hotels on Manhattan and expected small rooms, older furnishing, limited service – all in exchange for location.We made our way through the exotic streets of Chinatown to our hotel and experienced our first surprise: the building looked brand new and smaller than we’d imagined with an interesting glass façade. After a friendly check-in, we used the elevator to get to our room on th 12th floor, hardly a high floor by Manhattan standards. And opened the door to the second big surprise: the room appeared large through smart design, the bathroom was cool modern with neat lighting, and the view was jaw-dropping. After tearing ourselves away from the window, we noticed the neat little touches, space to hang up clothes next to a convenient practical desk area, the luggage stand fitting exactly in the space between closet area and wall.We slept wonderfully that night not just because we’d done our sports by crossing the Brooklyn Bridge twice on foot but because of the great mattress.But before we went to bed, we enjoyed the ***** fantastic view from the City View Lounge on the 18th floor for chilling on our last night in Manhattan and the US. The view was as good as that from our room, the server friendly, the drinks cold, and the music perfect. We’d return anytime and maybe enjoy service on the fantastic open-roof top above the lounge too. Just a pity TripAdvisor doesn’t have a separate listing for the City View Lounge since it’s open to non-hotel guests too. (We couldn’t charge our drinks to our rooms since the proprietor is separate from the hotel.)And as the last pleasant surprise next morning: no normal breakfast buffet but breakfast a la carte with fine ingredients – and the somewhat slow service slowed us down before our last day of touring Manhattan.My Spanish husband made friends with the Dominican assistant and we easily clarified the problem with breakfast – it should've been included in the room rate but was listed extra – with the manager.

The good news first. The room was well equipped with coffee maker and refrigerator. The bed was great - very comfortable and TV worked. The view is amazing and the bathroom is a decent size and very clean. Water pressure was okay but not super strong.Service was excellent and housekeeping great too.No complaints over staff what so ever - all friendly and helpful :) Wifi worked great too. The terrace room does feature a large shared balcony with 5-6 other rooms so it is not very private - a few flowerpots to divide the space and a couple of chairs would have been a great improvement. The view is fabulous though. The room is extremely small for two people. Only room for one suitcase and does look a lot smaller than the rooms shown on website but it might only be this room? There is an ice-maker right outside this room which is quite noisy at night so if you are a light sleeper avoid it. The room was very cold even though I turned the heat up but it was unusually cold in the end of April. I paid an average of 220 US per night which is probably too much for what you get. Had I paid 180 US I would have been happy.(no breakfast included).Location: It is a few blocks to the subway on Bowery street but that is only brown and orange line which does not take you uptown. For uptown you need to walk over to Canal street which takes about 10 min. Restaurant and shopping starts in little Italy and Chinatown a few blocks away so not a bad location. It is easy access from the airport -20-30 min at nighttime at roughly 60 US incl. tips. If I could get it a bit cheaper I would stay again.,"Hong Kong, China",106,4.0

Room was good, fairly spacious and bathroom small but comfortable and stylish. WiFi worked well and was included. Room came with balcony, but BEWARE. The balcony is a shared balcony with all the other rooms on that floor on street side. This does not feel safe and takes away the sense of privacy. We did not find this comfortable, but the hotel could not offer an alternative. We booked including breakfast, this was continental and basically means coffee, juice, fruit and either a pastry basket (mini-croissant, mini-muffin and mini-danish) or oatmeal (not both). No savoury toppings, just a mini-jar of jam. You can choose a warm option (e.g. eggs with bacon & toast) by paying extra, but be prepared to pay USD 5 per person extra, not the USD 2 difference on the menu. We got into a whole discussion with the breakfast room staff due to them adding tax and service charges etc. Not worth the uncomfortable discussion and avoidable if they were more clear on the actual extra costs on forehand. Knowing what we do now, we would not book breakfast and grab something elsewhere, as the USD 10 for the continental is NOT worth the money. The breakfast room is in a restaurant offering sushi for lunch and dinner, with fair prices. We didn't try it, but it appeared good. Atmosphere at breakfast was not great, staff was not unfriendly, but lacked any enthusiasm or smile. You can go up to the roof of the hotel for a great view of NYC. Location-wise, it is good for exploring south manhattan, and about 5-8 min. from the nearest subway. We did a lot on foot. I was not that comfortable with the neighbourhood (especially Canal Street towards night time did not feel nice) and both Chinatown and Little Italy were disappointing, so not worth being in the middle of. Lacked nice restaurants or coffee bars in the street. But that is personal preference. We were on the 2nd floor and I had to sleep with ear plugs in, but my boyfriend did not, so depends on being a light sleeper or not. Overall, it is a very comfortable and clean hotel, but in our view rather pricey for a 3-star. Our special thanks go out to the maids: we have NEVER met such cheerful, friendly and pleasant cleaning staff anywhere else (and we travel a LOT). They were so kind and helpful, plus did a great job cleaning, that they set a great example for how service and a great consumer-experience should be.

When you're going alone Manhattan is undeniably very expensive. Admittedly I got a great deal on this hotel through booking.com so wouldn't have been able to afford it otherwise but if I compare it to somewhere like the Cosmopolitan hotel in Tribeca which is about the same price normally if not more, this hotel is better in every way and totally worth it. The hotel room size was much larger than other hotels I was looking at with the same star rating, the staff were very friendly, my room always clean and coffee etc replaced every day. These may seem like things that you would assume all hotels did but I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the last few months with higher ratings and have come to learn there are many things you can't assume! I asked for a quieter room, which they fulfilled, my neighbours were pretty noisy in the morning but I can't blame the hotel for that! I also spilled something in my room and they sent a cleaner up right away to deal with it. I don't have a bad thing to say about the hotel. I can't comment much on the restaurant, I had breakfast there one morning which was OK but have a feeling the lunch and dinner menu may be better, it has very good reviews on google.

The hotel is located 2 blocks from a subway station (Grand St, B & D trains).We found this hotel to be priced well, compared to many other hotels in Manhattan. Yes, the rooms are smaller than a typical hotel room, but it's New York City. But with two of us in the room, we found it to be sufficient. The decor, both in the lobby and in the room itself, was stylish and modern. The room was clean and well-stocked with amenities (bottles of water, toiletries, etc), and the bed and pillows were comfy. Wifi worked very well for us, and we didn't experience much street noise (though we did have a loud, noisy neighbor one night). The front desk staff was particularly friendly, helpful and efficient.There were, however, some minor flaws we experienced. *Our room (702) had a balcony, which is great, but the balcony was shared with the rest of the floor. In other words, we could walk past all the other rooms from the outside and even see into the other rooms if the curtains were open. It made me a little uncomfortable, and made me double and triple-check that our balcony door was locked. We also never opened our curtains.*The shower didn't have a curtain or any sort of enclosure, which caused a lot of water to splash out of the shower and onto the floor. We used our extra towels as bath mats because there was so much water outside of the shower. Even the toilet paper rolls got wet because the water from the shower splashed out.*The only towel hooks in the bathroom were on the opposite end of the bathroom, so you had to walk out of the shower (and drip all over the bathroom) to get to the towel hooks. Hooks or even a towel bar could've easily been placed right by the shower (there was plenty of wall space in our room).*When we arrived back to the hotel one evening after a long day of sightseeing, we went to the bar ask for a bottle opener to open a bottle of Coke we had purchased. We stood at the bar for almost 10 minutes (no one was behind the bar, but there were plenty of patrons sitting at the bar). When the bartender finally arrived, we realized he had been standing outside the whole time and had seen us waiting there but never bothered to come in and even acknowledge us. That was our only poor service experience at this hotel.Despite the flaws, we would stay here again. The price, the location (close to a subway station), the cleanliness, and the great staff (front desk, at least) make it worth it to stay here again when we return to NYC.","Las Vegas, Nevada",67,4.0

After consulting TripAdvisor, decided to try this Wyndham hotel in Chinatown. We were not disappointed. Clean, quiet (quiet in the building - there was some street noise - car horns), comfortable. Responsive, friendly staff (actually much more friendly than you will find in larger hotels Uptown). $100 less per night compared to our favorite Midtown choice, Novotel. One thing to note - if you are sensitive to left-over cigarette smoke look elsewhere - this hotel's regular clientele appears to routinely ignore the no-smoking restriction. Our room had previously been occupied by a heavy smoker which the hotel promptly set about remedying. It didn't matter to us, but it may to you.The lower level restaurant for breakfast was a bit odd - my guess is it is independent of the hotel. Good price and food with very uneven, yet friendly service. Not busy. The ""Cup and Saucer"" diner nearby is a much better option (classic NYC diner - prompt, friendly service with good food at bargain prices). Excellent location for financial district, ChinaTown, Staten Island Ferry, Brooklyn Bridge type of day. Several good restaurants nearby.In summary - if you are looking for a NY hotel bargain, this is it.

Never had an issue with any Wyndham, didn't have one here either just came across a slight design flaw that had me shaking my head. First, very nice front desk staff. Friendly, helpful, accommodating. Everything you'd want in your front desk staff. Room was on the 12th floor, very small but comfortable. GREAT view of the Empire State Building. HOWEVER, the bathroom is what I'll remember. For starters, they have a huge frosted window in the bathroom! You can't see in but you can clearly see what the person is doing in the bathroom. PLUS, at 5am when the lights are off and your guest is trying to sleep they won't be asleep fr long when you put the bathroom light on. With the window there it lights the entire hotel room! Second, no shower door! There's a tiny glass partition but only on the shower head side. After my shower there was a huge puddle on the floor. I used three towels just sopping it up. They apparently are trying to be a boutique hotel with these designs, but it doesn't work. Ya gotta be practical too!","New York City, New York",28,3.0

The hotel is only about 5 years old so, as you would expect, it's very modern on the outside and the inside. It certainly stands out in Chinatown anyways!All of the staff were very friendly, accommodating and gave good advice whenever you asked them. The hotel rooms were very modern, clean and they were average in size for New York. It's very unusual to have a 'big room' in New York.The area isn't fantastic but all of the locals are friendly enough and the hotel is a 5 minute walk to Canal Street Subway and from there there's multiple subway lines taking you to locations across New York. The subway is really cheap as well. We got a taxi home from Times Square, on St Patrick's Day evening after a few beers, and it cost 15USD including tip. I would expect it to be a lot more during the day with traffic. The hotel also arranged a taxi for us to Newark Airport for 79USD as the weather wasn't great - the bellman arranged this and the service was great and the transfer arrived 10 minutes early.We wanted to visit the Skyline Bar but this always seemed to be closed whenever we wanted to visit it.We also requested a high floor room as we wanted views of the Skyline and also we didn't want to be too low down as we were aware the traffic can be quite loud at all times of day! The hotel acknowledged our request and, thankfully, we were allocated room 1204 which was a twin room.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anybody staying in New York.

We used the restaurant only for breakfast. The French toast was the best my wife and I have ever had. They also have a happy hour for an afternoon drink with great prices. There is also a small bar in the lobby. The room while small was well furnished and equipped, it even had a small fridge. The shower was forceful with plenty of hot water.

Feeling a bit stressed by this, I proceeded to check online with my travel site to search for another hotel, because the one that I was in, was okay. But, I didn't want to pay the full amount, just to extend my stay one more night. The view from my window, I could see the Wyndham Garden and how beautiful and new it was. So, I checked to see if there was a rate for this hotel. Success, I found the rate that I was willing to pay and booked it right away. Now, all I have to do is pack up and move across the street.Well, my room was not ready, however, I left my bag with the Wyndham and proceeded to enjoy my day in the freezing cold of 19 degrees of New York City, on my unexpected, extended stay in the Big Frozen Apple. The room: absolutely gorgeous. At first thought, I could have kicked myself for not staying here first. Four panels of Ceiling to Floor Glass Windows that framed a perfect view of the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and all of its neighboring landmarks, like the Citibank Bldg. The bathroom is spacious and roomy by any standards also fashioned with a Ceiling to Floor Window pane, that shares the similar view as the main sleeping/sitting area.Everything is well decorated with a touch of Chinese Art. Nice comfortable bed, sitting chair at the desk and the sitting chair in the corner under the wall mounted television. I can't say enough about this room and the hotel. It's just too bad I only enjoyed it for a few television and sleeping hours. I would've loved to explore this hotel and wanted to see the rooftop bar.

I spent 9 days here eight months earlier, and was impressed enough to say that whenever possible, this would be my NYC home going forward. With that in mind, I booked a quick 4 night trip over the Presidents Day weekend.Upon check in, the front desk clerk looked up at me at said ""welcome back."" She had recognized my face from my previous stay. She couldn't remember my name initially, but caught on as I began to say it. Check in was a breeze, and that was a great way to start off the trip. The queen room was clean and comfortable, and was a good size for a Manhattan hotel room.My main previous issue with the rooms at this hotel was the shower setup, which resulted in a fair amount of water collecting on the floor. That's an issue that won't get solved anytime soon. This time around, there were two things that annoyed me to the point that I could only give a 4 star rating this time around. The first issue was the water temperature in the shower. On some of the coldest days in the winter, the water temperature at whatever time I took a shower was downright tepid. It meant for some quick showers and a fair amount of shivering afterwards. Not good when the air and wind chill temperatures were 0 to -10F (-15 to -25C). My next door neighbour indulged twice in room service, and when done, left his dish tray out in the hallway. Both times, the trays were left in the hallway for more than 4 hours, as they were there when I left my room and still there when I came back. It really isn't all that appealing seeing someone's half eaten meal staring at you. All in all, I'll still come back here.

I had stunning views on the 8th floor of the gorgeous NYC skyline, I kept my curtains open throughout the evening just so I could wake up to that beautiful view! Seeing the Empire State building all lit up and gorgeous just before you fall asleep is just incredible and a view I will never forget. I know many people have mentioned about the bathrooms having a frosted glass panel letting light in from the room into the bathroom, and to be honest, it never bothered me. In fact, I wouldn't mind my bathroom at home looking like that! The bathroom was brand new with a wonderful shower and was light and spacious thanks to that frosted glass wall.  Even the cleaning staff were lovely! I got speaking to one lovely lady when I popped back to drop off some shopping before popping back out to see a show and she was absolutely lovely and had nothing but lovely things to say about the hotel, which is always a good sign! She did say that next time I should try and get a corner room as they have even BETTER views (if there is such a thing!) so I shall keep that in mind for my inevitable next visit. Transportation is excellent with Grand St Subway station about 50m away from the hotel front doors and there is an abundance of good food around the Little Italy area which I shall 100% utilise properly next time. The only slightly negative point that I had was that the restaurant on site wasn't the best (and I'm not really picky about food) but if that's the worst thing about the hotel, my goodness they're not doing badly at all!

We would have stayed longer but our special day just so happens to fall right between Christmas and New Years so the prices are ridiculous. The hotel is beautiful! Very clean and modern. Awesome location. The rooms are small but they are immaculate and gorgeously decorated. Besides, who goes to NYC and stays in their room??The only bad thing I have to say is that upon check-in I was told that we had the option of going with the room I booked which had a balcony or we could get a room a few floors higher with no balcony and a king bed instead of a queen. We wanted the better view so we chose the higher up room (the view was incredible, btw!). I asked if they were the same price since I had already dropped close to $300 for the original room at which point I was informed that this was an upgrade so we were actually getting a better deal. I don't know how getting a slightly bigger bed and losing the balcony is an upgrade but whatever.. Also I gave them my credit card for ""incidentals"" and they charged $50 to it upon check in. It's still pending so hopefully it will disappear in the next day or so. I would have appreciated being told that this was going to happen. Staff was very pleasant and both check in and check out was fast and efficient. We didn't get to go to the rooftop lounge since it was closed but we did have a few drinks at the bar in the lobby. Drinks were good and reasonably priced. Bartender was great.","Dumont, New Jersey",3,5.0

Two elevators were more than adequate; never any waiting. But for me, the surprising pleasure was location. We visit New York a few times a year and always use subways. At this location, you have your pick: a block away from the D (with transfer to the F or a quick trip to West 4th ) and a few blocks from the 6, you have your pick: midtown, west-side, east-side, all the different places I wanted to go were easy.

I've stayed in some very good hotels in NYC so the standard was high. It's safe to say that the Wyndham was up to these Standards.We had, what i think, was a standard room on the 11th floor. The room was not the biggest but this seems to be the theme for NYC. It was large enough for 2 of us with a large suitcase each. The room featured a floor to ceiling window with a nice view looking north, a very comfortable Queen sized bed and a nicely laid out bathroom. There's a large (32""?) TV on the wall with access to all the major channels as well as some on-demand films etc.The bathroom didn't have a full bath, only a shower cubicle. Some people have commented that the shower enclosure doesn't fully stop water from coming out of the side of the shower and can cause a slippy floor (the floors are tiled). We found this to be the case but we always ensured that we put down the shower mat just outside of the cubicle to catch any excess water.There's free WiFi in the hotel which was good enough for general surfing (we didn't try any downloading or streaming).There seems to be some construction work going on just behind the hotel which didn't cause us any issues when we were there; but on the day we checked out of the hotel there was loud drilling noises which caused difficulty in hearing anything in the lobby. I'm sure this is only temporary and won't affect most people's stay.The location of the hotel is right in the heart of Chinatown. We felt reasonably safe walking the streets at night and the hotel is only about a 5min walk to the nearest subway station, as well as being close to SOHO and Little Italy. The subway (Grand St) is served by the Orange Lines (B,D,F,M IIRC) which will require a change to another line further up the track if you wish to get into the upper part of town (we usually changed at W 4th to the A,C,E line).Overall; we really enjoyed this hotel and wouldn't hesitate recommending it as an option for people who are travelling to NY.","Coventry, United Kingdom",4,5.0

Not too far from the subway...um maybe 2 or 3 blocks. The 3rd floor hotel room was quite big and it wasn't supposed to be fancy. Maybe it was a little bigger because it was a corner room.

If you are a light sleeper - like my husband and I - this is no good. It is not a fault of the hotel, more of a fault of the street location. At the end of the 4 night stay we were worn out, New York is tiring anyway but with no sleep it is exhausting. the good points are the access to some of the main attractions - Brooklyn Bridge - 5 minutes walk, World Trade Centre - 10m minutes walk and Battery park.","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",14,3.0

The bed was very comfortable and the temperature in the room could be adjusted to suit myself.I have read in a lot of reviews comments about the bathroom facilities and the lack of a shower door.

Yes water does get onto the bathroom floor after a shower but it does drain and the excellent housekeeping staff always had the bathroom back in tip-top condition once they had done their daily rounds. My only complaint would be that on my first morning there, housekeeping knocked on my door at 9:30am to start cleaning so for the remainder of my stay I put a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign out every night until I was ready to leave in the morning.The hotel is extremely well-located to the subway with Grand St on the B,D lines being a 3 minute walk away (and from there only 4 stops to Times Square) and the Canal St stops just a 10 minute walk away.

I have to say that of all our NY visits this was in fact one of the least impressive hotels we have stayed in if you judge on hotel alone. But it's not all bad news: when we arrived in the evening we went to the bar on the 18th floor for drinks and that was amazing, so at first we thought we could forgive the smallish bedrooms and lack of storage etc and remind ourselves of the fact that sometimes you make allowances for NYC. However, two problems with even the fabulous bar 1) they do not serve any nibbles or food up there, not even a bowl of peanuts, and 2) you cannot put anything on your room tab as it is a separate business to the hotel. And the hotel restaurant is in the basement so at complete loggerheads with the bar. Er hum! Our bedroom was on the 7th floor which means a balcony and view. The view was lovely at night and you can look out at the top of the Empire State building from in bed. A big issue for us was that the balcony flooded due to a day of heavy rainfall and a large strip of the bedroom between the bed and balcony window became sodden and entirely out of commission. The staff tried to dry it out for us but firstly this didn't work and secondly left a musty smell to the room that suggested to us this was an on-going problem and not the first flooding episode (indeed melting snow, and it often snows in NY would be a huge problem). That said the room was clean and tidy and for a short trip would be just about big enough (we were on the final leg of an 18 day visit to USA and therefore had big luggage, so not good). The staff were friendly but somewhat indifferent to the flooding issue (to be fair what could they do? We didn't want to move rooms with the amount of luggage we had). Finally, the location of Chinatown and bordering Little Italy, Nolita and also walking distance to East Village is fabulous, very vibrant and if you like chinese or italian food then you're absolutely spoilt for choice. We loved it and would recommend it, but not for first visit to NYC. Being in the heart of Chinatown it felt much more like we were in Hong Kong than New York (and we know both). So I would say to anyone contemplating a trip visit to NYC, the classic NY experience is better experienced from Uptown NY - and whilst you can venture over there it is a bit of a trek on the subway that will eat into your day.","Nottingham, United Kingdom",8,3.0

Apart from that, we found a very clean room, nice public spaces, and a ground floor bar and street level restaurant which we did not use.Happily, we were given a ninth floor room with a large bathroom and a nice sized bedroom.

The hotel is very new, lovely clean smart rooms. All staff we had contact with were pleasant and very polite. On check out we booked a car to the airport with reception which was great value and cleaner than the typical NYC taxi. The view from the roof/ bar was great, tallest building in the area and nice to see the city from another angle. The china town area was perfect location to explore the city from, all be it a little bit grubby around the local streets but this did not spoil our visit. A walk across the near manhattan bridge first thing on our first morning was one of our holiday highlights, we had woke up very early due to the time difference from back home and crossed the bridge to Brooklyn, then came back to manhattan via the Brooklyn bridge, lovely views with perfect weather and very quiet as to early for crowds. My only disappointment was being on the second floor, I had made the booking via booking.com and paid a little bit extra for a room with balcony, assuming that would mean a high room ... Possibly my own fault but photos of rooms lead me to believe I'd booked a room with a view. I now feel that If I had paid the lesser charge I would have been higher with a better view but no balcony, which to be honest we didn't use. I had also put on booking that it was for his 40th and could we have a high room, I'm guessing they were all taken. However I must say I did not complain as i did have a room with balcony as booked, I just think it's something to mention in case others make the same mistake. My hubby was over the moon with the room and his surprise I think it was just maybe my expectations, as I wanted it to be something super special. We were in room 202, the door to balcony was a little on the drafty side, however this did not bother us as it saved the use of air conditioning. The room however was ample in size and well equipped, nice wet room style shower room, fridge, tv, wifi and ample storage. One last thing as a note to hotel, in bathrooms there is a note about being green and reusing towels by putting then on the rail provided etc etc. However there was no rail, just a hook! 2 bath towels and a hand towel can not possibly hang to dry on one hook, you should possibly think about some towel rails.",,11,4.0

There are a number of subway stations in close proximity to this hotel, though I would have to say the larger subway stations can be a tad confusing. Whilst we initially found Chinatown somewhat unattractive, we came to appreciate it for what it was. If you are into street photography, you could do worse than walking the local streets. The hotel is between Chinatown and Little Italy so there was no shortage of top quality restaurants to walk to. Napoli Café was our favourite - the seafood/lobster spaghetti was bellissimo and the service first class. The hotel also boasts a more than nice Japanese restaurant.As an amateur photographer I was also delighted at the brilliant views from the 19th storey roof top. Some of the sunsets I experienced were truly amazing.Other strong points were the clean, modern rooms and good wifi access.The only downside MAY be noise, but hey, NY has police, ambulance and other sirens going 24/7 so its really a NY issue not a hotel one.We would definitely stay here again.

First the receptionist didn't believe us that we had (what they called) continental breakfast included in our rate and then didn't bother explaining how it would work, which led to some confusing the next morning. Continental breakfast then was exactly 3 pieces of tiny pastry with some butter and an assortment of 2 jams. The second breakfast had half of the staff aggressively reacting to other guest's request and comments while we had to ask the obviously overwhelmed other half for almost every single item of our complicated continental. The third breakfast we didn't even get our 'pastry basket' but where seemingly graciously offered the hot buffet of sausages, eggs and bacon – which all turned out to be cold (except for the tea in plastic cups) ... after that we ate out, there's more than enough places around the hotel area to do that just fine.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom",35,3.0

Ask for a room on Hestor St. I would hate to have a room facing noisy Bowery. Chinatown is so fun to walk around in. Feels like I was IN China! Subway couple blocks away. Two issues: 1. The shower has only a stationary short door so the water floods the bathroom. 2. The business center in the lobby is not user friendly. A front desk clerk has to sign you on which means they have to leave their desk and either inconvenience the people waiting for them, or you wait forever. Once they sign you in, then you can use your internet code. Why the first step? People off the street can't use the computers since they don't have a room internet code. Then, trying to print tickets or boarding passes was fruitless because a flash player was needed and couldn't be downloaded. The front desk clerk had to sign into my personal airline account to check me in and get my boarding pass. This means she had access to very personal information. That shouldn't happen. Then when she finally got my boarding pass I needed to settle my bill. She asked for me to step aside so she could help someone else first. As a business owner, bad customer service bothers me the most. Please, fix the computer issue so your staff is not removed from their primary jobs and they aren't forced to awkwardly act on a guest's behalf online where sensitive information should not be seen.

Chinatown was great - just like being in Asia and Little Italy was buzzing and interesting with so many restaurants to choose from.

Your best bet is to head a few blocks away to little Italy. The other detraction - the shower. Unfortunately they aren't the first hotel to go with the stationary 1/2 glass door. Water gets everywhere on the bathroom floor but if you befriend the sincerely wonderful and friendly housekeeper Kumarie, she will give you extra towels to mop up the floor. This also makes for a semi cold shower as although the water is hot, you can't close yourself in with a full door or shower curtain. This may look modern but its not convenient.

A quick trip downtown to Chinatown provides a visitor with easy access to some of the city's more interesting neighborhoods (SoHo, Lower East Side, Nolita, Little Italy as well as Chinatown). After spending a week there we can say that this hotel is a wonderful place to stay with easy subway access, and all the other amenities one could want. We chose to upgrade our room for an additional $10 per night to an upper floor which provided us with a drop dead beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline. The rooms are typically sized for New York, but are efficiently designed. The only shortcoming is the lack of an additional hook or towel rod in the bathroom.The rooftop bar, which is under separate management, has an upper level with a deck and killer views. Definitely worth a visit. The bar on the first floor offers a very reasonably priced happy hour.The staff was attentive and extremely helpful. The only other shortcoming was the fact that there was no Starbucks around the corner. That is more than made up for with all the other choices nearby. We look forward to our return to New York and (hopefully) to this hotel.","Saint Louis, Missouri",23,5.0

As mentioned in other reviews, the rooms were small but everything a guest would need was provided for. The staff at the check-in was very efficient and friendly. The bar at the lobby level had great happy hour prices. One advice: ask that your room is as far away as possible from the elevator as possible, as we heard elevator traffic having been right opposite the elevator doors. Also, the balcony attached to our room was not very good as they have one balcony running along the entire side of the floor so your neighbor can be chatting right outside your bedroom, which was often the case for us as our room's balcony ""space"" had the water drainage which the smokers amongst the guests on that floor seemed to use as their ashtray.

Cheap accommodations are cheap for good reasons. With this hotel, we got great accommodations for cheap prices (by Manhattan standards).I booked here primarily because of the great reviews on this website, coupled with a fantastic rate that was offered through Travelzoo. The double/double room we stayed in was very large for Manhattan, and offered us a reasonably sized desk, a night stand, and a small bar fridge. The bathroom was large enough with a shower stall, sink, and toilet. The only complaint I can make about the bathroom (and this is a constant complaint among the reviewers here) is that there is no shower door, just a piece of glass that covers half the stall. It makes for a lot of splashing water on the floor. This forces you to basically take one of the towels and use that as a bath mat. People have mentioned the Chinatown location. Yes, Chinatown and the LES is not the greatest part of NYC. However, I had no issues whatsoever. As far as commuting around the city goes, there are several options to get onto the subway. The closest station was about two blocks away at Grand and Chrystie Streets, where you could get onto the B and D lines. Taking those lines afforded you a very quick way to get into midtown. The Bowery station was only 3 blocks away, while the Canal Street stations for the 6, N, R, and Q lines were about a 10 minute walk away. I think the location scares people who aren't familiar with NYC away, and that plays into the advantage of more knowledgeable people. Walking home from the subway is perfectly safe. This Chinatown offers the best Asian food I've ever eaten outside of Asia, and Little Italy's food is pretty darn good too. Eating in Chinatown also stretches your tourist dollar, as meals can be very reasonably priced there.I would not hesitate to stay here again.","Calgary, Canada",100,5.0

My room was very quiet and had a great unobstructed view of the Empire State & Chrysler buildings. The rooftop lounge was completely empty which was great for us. We had the roof to ourselves with a 270 view of the city. Drinks were relatively inexpensive too. I didn't hang out in the lounge itself but the roof was great. The only negative was that when my room wasn't ready at 2:45, and I complained b/c I really needed to make a call over wifi in a quiet place, they said ""we only guarantee the room for 3pm"". I had to make the call in the corner of the bar with poor wifi. Not a big deal I guess, but then the room wasn't ready at 3pm for my husband to check in. So they shouldnt use the word ""guarantee"" when it isn't. Oh yeah, and I'd booked a King room through travelzoo and I got an email two weeks earlier saying they had a scheduling error and it's actually a queen. But given the price and how close to the trip it was, I couldn't really do anything about it. I'd stay here again if able to get a mid-week deal again.",chicago,82,4.0

For what I paid through Expedia, I can not really complain too much. I feel that there were some design flaws that should be taken care of by Wyndham. The bathroom is nice looking, but there are no towel racks for the hand towels or washcloths. The only place to hang towels is a tiny hook next to the shower. This does not work especially if 2 people are sharing the room. Face and hand towels had to sit on the counter. The modern glass wall shower also did not work with my daughter, The entire bathroom floor was soaked after she took a shower. I could see someone slipping due to water on the floor. The entry way to our room had a light, but it was still dark and the safety box is located on the bottom shelf of an armoire in the entry. You have to get down on your hand and knees to use the safety box and the area was dark at least in our room. This was not are real problem for me, but if I had been older it would not work. The first day, we stopped back at our room at 2 and the room was not clean. Then next day, the room was not cleaned at all. However, when the room was cleaned, they did a nice job. The overall cleanliness of the hotel was very good. The hotel is located in Chinatown which worked for me for this particular trip, but I did not find it a desirable area, rather dirty. But, it is a short walk to more desirable Little Italy and Nolita, Soho. The hotel is a short 5-10 minute walk to the subway which serviced almost all lines.","Bloomfield Hills, Michigan",33,3.0

The price for all of this is very good and if this hotel was near Times Square it would be 3 times more.Even though this is a brand new hotel, it feels like your part of the neighborhood.

Walk to subway not too bad (couple of blocks), walk to financial district about 20 mins, a good 45-60 mins to midtown but worth doing at least once to see some bits of the city tourists miss.Hotel itself meticulously clean and we requested a city view and we were not disappointed, we were on a high floor, I think 12th, and could see the Empire State Building day and night.

From treating us so nicely to doing little extras, such as explaining a subway map, this hotel is top notch. The room we had boasted a fabulous view with the floor to ceiling windows, clean, clean, clean! Happy Hour was fun, watching the staff interact with other staff and guests should be used as an example to others on how to treat people. Negative reviews? Baahh!

Staff were extremely accommodating to our last minute change in plans and allowed for a rollaway bed to be added to our room for a reasonable price. The room itself was smaller than I expected but I can understand why it would be the norm for Manhattan - very little space once the extra bed was put in but this was our fault for changing plans when it was too late to book a twin. It was clean and well maintained. As others have mentioned, the shower sprays out into the bathroom which is a little frustrating but housekeeping happily provided extra towels. Staff were all lovely and friendly throughout our stay. Our room was on the 2nd floor and I was initially worried that traffic would disturb us throughout the night but the sound insulation is actually pretty good. Main negative is the terrace outside the room - it is communal so have to keep curtains closed the entire time for privacy.Location wise, it was really convenient. The nearest Subway is less than 5 mins walk and Little Italy and SoHo are both on your doorstep. Saying that, Chinatown is not the best location as it is not clean and the smell of raw meat and fish is really off-putting.

Good access to the subway made it easy to get to tourist sites in Manhattan. Because of its location on Bowery the rooms can get a little noisy with emergency vehicle sirens, but expecting rural quiet in the heart of Manhattan is asking way too much.The only glitch was an out of date room service menu in the guest folder, but a current menu from the hotel restaurant was quickly brought to the room and the breakfast that was ordered arrived promptly, but wasn’t very exciting. I’d suggest exploring many of the quirky cafes in the area for much better dining. The legendary Katz’s deli is only a 15 minute walk away.The room’s balcony gave great views of Manhattan, but only the floor that I was on has rooms with balconies. Be warned that the balcony is shared with all of the other rooms on the same floor, so you can walk the length of the building, past other people’s rooms and see into them.

In theory, I liked the idea of it being in Chinatown, on the edge of Little Italy not far from the World Trade Center and harbor. In reality, it was perfect. We arrived four hours early for check-in but the front desk manager put us in a room right away. We walked into our hotel room (on the 10th floor) and our hearts opened up--the room had a city view that included the Empire State Building. Compact but very clean and modern with fridge, good tv, coffee maker, etc. Really comfortable bed. We dropped our luggage and took off. Walked and walked--every street was interesting and took us to amazing places. Souvenirs, interesting food stores and foot massages in Chinatown; amazing restaurants in Little Italy; the World Trade Center memorial and the new building were profound. We stopped for a delicious lunch at an Italian outdoor cafe on the esplanade over-looking the Statue of Liberty and spent a few hours in the Jewish Heritage Museum. Took a taxi back to the Wyndham and went up to the 18th floor for a drink. The bartender told us to go up one more floor and see the view. It was incredible. Next day, we walked through the old lower eastside to Greenwich Village and back to the hotel. I have been to New York several times but have never had this much fun or learned so much.

This time the Wyndham Garden Hotel caught my eye with a decent price and a very high Tripadvisor ranking. I had high expectations and for the most part the hotel lived up to these expectations. It's very clean, well located and the rooms have a good floor plan, but there are a few annoyances that keep me from giving this hotel the full five stars. Some of these annoyances maybe nitpicking, but that's why we're talking 4 vs 5 stars.First of all the bed's duvet is too short. I'm 6'4"" and either my shoulders or your feet go under, which is annoying because the airco draft is noticeable at night. Also the duvet cover fits badly and your feet get stuck in it. Both of these issues can be remedied somewhat by turning the duvet 90 degrees, but that's not an option if you're not staying there alone.Secondly the bathroom is not very well though out considering this is a newly and purpose built hotel. There is no shower curtain or door. There is only a glass panel covering the first part of the shower area. This is not enough and water splashes out soaking not only the floor, but also wetting the only clothes hook in the bathroom (see photo). Secondly it's hard to live up to the reuse of towels policy, because there is no decent rack to hang your towel to dry. There is only the aforementioned hook, which is too small for the large (but good) towels (There is enough place to retrofit a rack). The use of wallpaper in a bathroom, especially next to an open shower is not smart and the results of this decision were already visible (see photo).Generally the furniture is good (I especially like the desk and it's well places outlets), but the comfortable chair in the room is not comfortable at all, it's basically an odd sized clothes rack (see photo). Like many hotel rooms also this room didn't have a simple coat hook near the door. Why don't hotels understand how easy a simple hook would be to hang your coat or bag.Finally I want to mention the most subjective annoyance, which is the fact that you cannot open any window. You are fully reliable on air conditioning and you cannot feel the outside air before you actually go down and exit the hotel. To some this may not be an issue, but I prefer (sleeping with) an open window over airco whenever possible.All in all this is a good hotel which I would recommend to others.","Son en Breugel, The Netherlands",33,4.0

The only other thing that may irk is that the bathroom has a frosted glass door and floor to ceiling windows, which is great during the day. But at night keeps the whole room bright even though you have blackout curtains - so if you're sensitive to light suggest you sleep with an eye mask!

We found the accommodations to be clean, comfortable and in a great location. We were on the fourth floor and were not bothered by road or club noises, as previous reviewers had mentioned. The rooms were spacious enough for two and our luggage while still allowing space to move, and at this price point, that's more than you can say for other NYC hotels. The room was tastefully decorated. The linens and towels were clean, soft and in great shape, and the bed was firm but comfortable. The bathroom provides little space for toiletries and would benefit from a shelf or two. The shower pressure was great and the provided soaps are of a high quality. Others have commented on the design of the shower leading to water on the floor, but it was a minor issue for us and was nothing a bath mat couldn't correct. Our issues with this hotel mainly revolve around customer service. On the first day, we attempted to order something from room service after reading the in-room menu which listed a variety of foods at reasonable prices. Upon inquiring, we found that almost all of the prices were outdated and that the actual price was much higher. We ended up eating off-site as a result. On our second day, we called the front desk for additional towels as we had opted out of daily housekeeping. We had requested the towels be left on the floor outside of our room as one of us was asleep. The gentleman who brought the towels knocked on our door, which went unanswered to avoid waking the sleeping party. The desk called and mentioned our Do Not Disturb sign and asked us to open the door, to which we again asked that the towels just be left on the floor. The gentleman with towels then knocked AGAIN, waited a moment, and left without ever leaving us our towels. We ended up borrowing some from our traveling companions' room. We both work in hotels, and rule number one of Do Not Disturb signs is that you never knock unless there is a crisis. On our third day, we asked for a recommendation for local restaurants from a woman at the front desk. She gave us three options and, when we asked for directions, her attitude changed to one of ""figure it out yourself"". She pointed vaguely down one street and mumbled the name again. My boyfriend asked her to repeat the route, and she again pointed. We ended up going to a small cafe that we found ourselves. All in all, we did enjoy our stay. We found the staff to be less than helpful (again, by the standards of two individuals who are employees at well-respected Vermont resorts), but the accommodations left little to be desired. We would consider a second visit on our next NYC trip, but we would recommend to management to address these service issues before it becomes a pattern.","Waterbury, Vermont",23,4.0

The subway station is only a 5 minute walk.The staff are extremely friendly and the rooms are well equipped and spotlessly clean, with comfortable beds, coffee makers, mp3 players and a nice big HD TV.Although the rooms look impressive, their are a few design issues to the room. There is very little draw space (only 2 small bedside draws), and only one side of the bed had a bedside light on it. Another issue is the location of the in room safe, which is at the bottom of the wardrobe so you have to lie on the floor to gain access to it, not an issue for me but for some could be a major issue.The marble bathrooms are big and well equipped, although the shower heads are fitted at a very strange angle. Toiletries are plentiful and of good quality, however there is no shelf in the bathroom to put your own stuff on.The rooftop lounge has the potential to be amazing, but falls down on two points. Firstly as a resident in a hotel, I would expect to be able to charge drinks to my room, but this was not allowed. Secondly, the DJ needs to be more aware of the occupants of the bar. When we first walked in, the place was empty and the music was very heavy trance style music, which obviously the DJ was enjoying. Approximately 10 minutes after we arrived, a party of 5 women in their 30's walked in (bringing the total number of people in the bar to 7), but still the DJ insisted on playing the same music, despite the visible distaste on everyone's faces. This resulted in everybody leaving the bar pretty sharpish, and obviously the bar returning to it's previously empty status.Despite these ( small ) issues, I would recommend this hotel and the surrounding neighbourhoods as a valid alternative to overpriced and plastic Times Square.","Liverpool, United Kingdom",72,4.0

There is also a large roof terrace on the 19th floor with a breathtaking 360 degrees view (we skipped the entire trip to the Empire State Building because of this)!Top Queen Size bed with quality linens, refrigerator, spacious safe for laptop and passports etc, coffee/tea machine, sufficient electrical outlets (important!), iron/ironing board. The water pressure was good, and the bathroom had lots of thick towels and a hairdryer.Many hotels have free, but poorly functioning Wi-Fi. That is not an issue at Wyndham Garden! We used the web extensively and without any problems. In the lobby there is also a PC for free use, not to mention a connected printer that made it easy to print our boarding passes before going home. We ordered Room service/used the hotel restaurant a couple of times, and the food was yummy.Nearest subway station (Grand Street, B/D train) is about a 5 minutes walk and we had no problems getting quickly to Central Park, Times Square and other popular sites. We recommend purchasing a 7 day unlimited MTA-pass for $30. The hotel booked a taxi for us to Newark Airport, it worked great with their regular contacts - and a flat rate was arranged.Heartfelt thanks to the Director of Rooms Omar Bouchaar, Katie, Hermin, and all the other members of the hotel staff who made our 10-days stay to such a nice experience, we would love to come back to this hotel!","Oslo, Norway",4,5.0

The room was spotless and despite what has been said on here was not too small. I wouldn't try squeezing two adults and two children into a room but for two adults, our queen deluxe room was more than adequate. Our room was located on the eight floor and we never heard a sound from the street. Our view of northern Manhattan via the floor to ceiling windows was awesome, especially at night. Canal Street shopping was just steps away, Little Italy dining about a five minute walk away, SOHO/NOHO shopping 5 to 10 minutes and Greenwich Village nightlife just a 15 to 20 minute walk away.

We had a great view of the Empire State Building from the floor to ceiling windows and the air con went from hot to cold whenever we wanted it too. Our only complaints concerning the room was that there was no extractor fan in the bathroom (which meant that the wallpaper (why?) is starting to peel away from the walls already) and that the double glazed windows could be a little thicker to cut down on the noise which could be heard from the surrounding roads despite being on the 12th floor. Every member of staff we had contact with were both friendly and efficient, which can often be a rarity in this city.

The reviews did not deceive: our room was spacious for NY hotel standars, very clean, and had a modern feel. Despite Bowery being a busy street we were never bothered by noise during the night. We liked the floor-to-ceiling view from the window and the room was quite pleasant. We also appreciated the coffee/tea maker and complimentary sachets - and the free WiFi, of course! We once had breakfast in the hotel restaurant but I would not recommend it. It wasn't included in the room price and it was not any good. We're seasoned NYC visitors, so we didn't need much help from the staff, but they were always very polite. We had never stayed in Chinatown before. As a neighborhood, it's a little too 'specific' as far as things to do and see, but it was definitely interesting and colorful. We love Asian food, so it was fun exploring the restaurants nearby. Soho and Little Italy are really close, so it's easy to see other areas in lower Manhattan. Definitely better than staying in super-touristy and overwhelmingly busy Times Sq. Grand St is the closest subway station, and there are more stations in walking distance. All in all, it was a very pleasant stay and the value for money was unbeatable. ","Athens, Greece",3,4.0

We were actually right under it in 1605 and it was appalling. The phone to reception wouldn't pick up and when it eventually did they couldn't help.

In the past we've stayed in Midtown but we were thrilled to stay on the LES: MUCH better value and zero tourists.THE HOTEL:Modern, recently built, immaculately clean. WIFI is fast, reliable and FREE. Service was courteous and prompt if not overly friendly. We parked our car for the week & were satisfied with the nightly rate offered through the hotel. We skipped the lobby bar and hotel restaurant (so many other options in NYC) but the lobby bar always had a few people enjoying a drink. On a Thursday night we tried the 18th floor rooftop bar because we were too tired to go elsewhere. Great view but strong odour of stale cigarettes, terrible music (One Direction & other teeny bop pop) that staff kept changing mid-song, sickly sweet drinks at prices that rivaled seriously good cocktail lounges ($14ea), and the place was EMPTY. Don't go.THE ROOM: We reserved a 16th floor queen and had jaw-dropping views of the Freedom Tower, financial district, Manhattan bridge & Brooklyn bridge. Room was quite small but totally acceptable for NYC (this isn't Vegas!) and we had enough room for our small/med suitcases and all our shopping bags. Room was stylish and well laid-out, bed and pillows were exceptionally comfortable. Nice bathroom with tub/shower combo; believe all other floors are shower only. On weekends I could hear a bit of bass coming from the rooftop bar two floors above, but it didn't prevent us from getting to sleep.THE NEIGHBOURHOOD:On the Lower East Side in Chinatown/The Bowery near the border of Little Italy. Since NYC's LIttle Italy keeps shrinking you'll see far more Chinese markets, shops and restos than Italian ones. Go to Brooklyn for Italian instead (Juliana's Pizza in DUMBO, 1 subway stop from hotel). Walk 15min in any direction and you'll hit Soho, Nolita, Tribeca, East Village, Tenement Musuem. Can't beat this location. To go further afield, walk 2 blocks to Grand St subway station (lines B&D) or 3-4 blocks to Canal St station for trains running uptown, further downtown, and to Brooklyn (lines 6, J, N, Q, R, Z, 4).OVERALL:Exeptional value, I can't think of a time I've gotten more value per dollar spent.

Asked to be moved and was put downstairs on the 2nd floor, to a larger room with a King bed and again no access to the balcony. Kind of pointless charging extra for a balcony, if you can't access it, even in the winter. The room was freezing cold and we had to get additional heaters in the room. The rooms are lovely...good beds and desk area. The room was big, hence hard to heat. I suggest the best option are the balcony rooms on the 17th floor, which are smaller. heat better and also have baths and great views over Manhattan.The staff are a mixed bunch. The men are so unbelievably friendly and welcoming but some of the women behind the desk are just indifferent. The phone to call reception didn't work for the whole stay and I had to run down to complain about the cold. Internet is pretty good and water for $1 in the room is good value.

Neighborhoods such as The Lower East Side and SoHo are within a reasonable walking distance.Finding a cab has always been easy. There is a bus stop on the corner and the Grand Street station of the B and D lines is right around the corner. The D train can take you to the Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn nonstop. Either train can take you to Macy’s in midtown in three stops, Rockefeller Center in five.

The staff were friendly, the hotel seemed well put together, and the rooms were impressive with floor to ceiling windows, and a nice design in each room.What a difference a year makes. We returned this week - Feb 2014, for the same trade show, and decided to play it safe by staying at the same hotel we thought was so great last year.So far, we've already had two opportunities to experience how bad this hotel has become, and we still have two nights left!After our first night here, we placed the DND sign on the door, so that we weren't disturbed early in the morning by housekeeping (we'd had a long drive from Ohio, through a snowstorm - we wanted to sleep in a little). When we left the hotel around 10am, we took the DND off the door, and assumed (as most people would) that housekeeping would come and clean our room by the time we returned later.This didn't happen. We returned to the same messy room we left. We called the front desk, and they said they would send someone up to make up the room - I asked if they could come in around 45 mins, since we would be going out again at that time - they told me to call back when we were leaving, and they would send someone then.We called back before we left. We spoke to someone else, who acted like it wasn't normal to clean a room in the evening - a different reaction to the first person we spoke to (45 minutes before). They said they would send someone though. 5 minutes later, a maintenance guy knocks on the door, and hands us a pile of sheets - as if we were supposed to make our own bed. We were confused - and said we wanted the room made up. He took the sheets back and said he'd come back - which didn't make sense - he was a maintenance guy (working on the elevator), not a room cleaner.On the way out, we spoke to the front desk. This time, they told us they ""don't have anyone to clean rooms at night"", and accused us of leaving our DND sign on the door all day. We told them we didn't. At this point, all 3 of the people at front desk disappeared into a back room to ""check something"". The one lady came back out, and rudely said ""yeah, your room was on DND so we didn't clean it"". They said something along the lines of ""we only have the maintenance guy here, but we'll see what we can do"". We just asked that they get the room cleaned, and we left. No-one should be spoken to in that way, when they're paying for a hotel room - not at any any price , or any place. What kind of hotel expects its guests to make their own bed?! What kind of hotel doesn't have at least one cleaner on hand to deal with a room?!I noticed that their checkout time is 12pm, so they MUST clean rooms after midday - and our DND sign was definitely off the door by 10 - 10:30am.Anyway, we came back a couple of hours later, and the room was made up - not sure if it was done by the maintenance guy, the front desk people, or what... but it was done.After an evening of being extremely frustrated - more by the way we were spoken to, and told that we were liars, rather than the fact that the room wasn't cleaned - we came back to our (finally) cleaned room, to hear thumping bass from music - coming from somewhere in the hotel.We assumed it was probably in a room just above us, or just below - and tried to go to sleep - hoping it would end soon. By 12am, we still hadn't slept, all we could hear was bass. When we put our head on the pillows, it was like the bass was literally vibrating through our pillows into our ears.We called the front desk to ask that they look in to the music - hoping that they could find which room it was and ask them to stop. They acted like they didn't know what it was, but they would have the security guy come up and check our floor.about 1am, the music was still going on - and we still hadn't slept. We called back, and this time the front desk told us that there was a party going on on the 18th floor (we were on the 9th floor), and it was someone's birthday and they were ""celebrating"" - but he would go up there and ask them to turn the music down. (How did the story switch from not knowing what it was, to a party on the 18th floor?! And how can we hear their music 9 floors down?).Anyway, the music never got quieter, despite the front desk telling us that they turned it down. Clearly nothing was going to happen to resolve this, so we just kept trying to sleep, and probably got to sleep close to 3-4am.That was when I read some other people's reviews on tripadvisor, and where we found out that the ""City View"" on the 18th floor, was actually some sort of night club, not owned by the hotel, and that they have no control over.Why the lying? Why act like you don't know what it is? I can't imagine that no one on any floor between 9 and 18 hadn't complained about the thumping bass vibrating through their expensive hotel room. I'd hate to be on one of the more ""premium"" rooms, closer to the 18th floor.So... as I said - we have 2 nights left - we're not happy with the hotel (after being extremely happy 1 year ago - which is a shame). We are going to speak to management this morning - but regardless, people should know about this ridiculous night club on the 18th floor, that clearly isn't sound-proofed appropriately.If you're going to open a venue in a hotel, FINE - but sound proof it properly! When you can hear the music 9 floors down, that clearly hasn't been done.Extremely disappointing that Wyndham would let this happen. Also extremely disappointed in the way Wyndham employees treated and spoke to us, and the fact that the don't have appropriate staff available around the clock. It's a hotel - not a 9-5 business.I look forward to the generic management response that I've seen on everyone else's post here. If management isn't helpful today, when we speak to them, I'll simply use my credit card dispute option, to claim that we didn't receive the service we paid for, and get our money back.","Akron, Ohio",5,1.0

What's lacking here is management: no one seems to be in charge. For instance, the desk clerks aren't on the same page: one will tell you that to get a cab to the airport you should phone the front desk ahead of time to let them secure a car; then, when you phone the front desk ahead of time, someone else will answer and tell you that the front desk doesn't arrange taxis. We stayed five nights and this sort of thing happened consistently.This sort of disorganization becomes a significant liability in extreme circumstances, as was illustrated one night when the fire alarms went off. A party was going on--either on the roof or the top floor--and it was attended by numerous people who were not guests at the hotel. Most of these people were very young, very loud, and very drunk, and my guess is that one of them thought it would be hilarious to pull the alarm. Anyway, it was around 1 a.m., and guests were pouring into the hallways, asking, ""Is it real? Should we evacuate?"" This was during the recent cold wave, so people were hesitant to rush outdoors into the 13 degree night. Incredibly, there were no employees to be seen or heard from: none in the halls, none at the desk, none directly outside the hotel. I have no idea where they disappeared to. It was a total fiasco.However, the worst was yet to come. Once the fire department had left, it was virtually impossible for guests to get back to their rooms. The non-guest goofballs from the party upstairs took over the one working elevator. I now became aware of three employees: two security personnel who kept fiddling with the alarm--which kept going off randomly--and a seeming manager who stood watching the mess as if it were someone else's problem. There was no organization: no one saying, ""Guests on the first two or three floors, please use the stairs back to your rooms; guests on higher floors, line up at the elevator; goofballs from the party, step back."" Once I complained to him, thirty minutes later, he began to take action, asking the party people to please turn loose of the elevator and allow paying guests of the hotel to get back to their rooms first. For the next two hours, the alarm kept going off every fifteen minutes or so, ringing for about a minute or two. There was no explanation from management, and no one answering the phone at the desk.This sort of thing isn't going to happen very often, I know, so I still rate the hotel a solid 3 because it has lots of merits. But God help you if you're staying there when management has to take action in unusual circumstances . . . because, at present, employees lack training.",Florida,28,3.0

Directly in front of the hotel is Hester Street, which in 4 short blocks leads you to Mulberry, the main street running through Little Italy. A safe, easy walk to the right on Mulberry, then left on Prince , leads you to SOHO, a great place for shopping and dining. Along the way you will pass numerous places for drinks, dinner or late night desserts. Behind the hotel is the Grand Street Subway Station, which is ideal for going anywhere else in the city. All the women said they felt safe going there. Location made it easy to catch a cab and hotel made other transportation arrangements to and from the airport for the ones flying in the group, less than I'd priced it myself. There is a lane in front of the hotel, easily blocked off for the tour bus to pull up and unload, very unusual for NY. Secondly, because many NYC hotels have impressive lobbies, but the rooms are old and musty, QUALITY was important to me. This Wyndam hotel is new, rooms are spacious, beds are unbelievably comfortable and furnishings are beautiful. The 'glass wall/windows lounge"" upstairs was perfect for a romantic view with drinks and the conference room with glass wall/windows was equally impressive for our groups breakfast on arrival. Finally CUSTOMER SERVICE of the staff was a must, because satisfying over 50 women at one time is almost impossible. Lindsay, the Sales Director, was professional, easy to work with, and handled even the simplest details, making my group feel first class. The front desk staff was patient, courteous and even helped with luggage when needed. All the Managers on Duty I dealt with, welcomed my group like we were part of the movie crew filming there at the time making us feel just as important. I will not hesitant to book this hotel again for my groups and will be staying there myself when traveling alone to NY in the near future.","Rock Ridge, North Carolina, United States",8,5.0

But we get it, its NYC. Here's the problem though. There is a property called City View (actually a lease) that is a night club. It occupies the 18th floor. Unbeknownst to any guest, unless you stayed before and were gluttons for punishment and returned, City View stays open until 4:00am! I called down to the desk at 1:30 after the bass had been pulsing through my body a half an hour. That's when I found out about their closing time. They said but ""often the music stops at 3:30, not 4. Thanks you idiot. He did offer to move our room though....at 2am? Really? So the next morning I spoke with the ladies at the front desk and they apologized, saying that ""must have been tough to sleep through, but you know, we don't even know how late or how loud they'll be on any given weekend because they aren't owned by us"". What a joke. They didn't comp our room and if they hadn't billed my American express card the day I booked it, two months ago, I would have cancelled the whole transaction. They did comp us 2 $10 continental breakfasts for our troubles and moved us to the 6th floor for our second night. You could still hear City View on that floor but at a much lower decibel thankfully.

The breakfast was really quite reasonable for hotel fare -- the continental had choices and the staff was very agreeable. The valet parking was excellent and we were assured it was safe enough to leave a bag of odds and ends in the car, something we wouldn't ordinarily do. Only slight negatives for us: the lighting was a little low (and unflattering in the bathroom), no dressers (but that's OK for a short trip), and the music in the rooftop lounge was too loud for us middle-aged folks (but there were 2 other places to catch a nightcap in the hotel and the view from the rooftop was the same as in our room, so it didn't matter to us).",Arlington VA,35,5.0

The hotel is located in the heart of Chinatown and within a few minutes of Little Italy - a huge variety of restaurants are right on your doorstep. Shopping in So-Ho is also easily walkable as is the Brooklyn Bridge (approx. 15 mins).

But these items wouldn't prevent me from returning. The experience which left me with a bad final impression was being informed upon checkout that I owed 3 cents.... And Katie expected me to give it to her.

This turned out to be a good choice, as there are excellent subway connections in the area to all parts of Manhattan and beyond, the trains were quick and efficient. It is also in easy walking distance of SoHo, Manhattan Bridge, Little Italy, East Village, etc. It is located on a main road (Bowery) but we didn't find it to be particularly noisy. From our room we could barely hear the traffic below at all.From our room on the ninth floor we had a view northwards to the Empire State Building - a stunning view at any time of day. The room was smallish, but plenty big enough; comfortable, clean and attractive, with artwork maintaining the Chinese style. Sneaking a ride on the lift to the 19th floor revealed a rooftop terrace, with even more stunning views of the area, including southwards to the financial quarter, and south-east to Manhattan Bridge. I believe this terrace it to be turned into a rooftop bar of some sort, which would be fantastic.There's a bar on the ground floor which we used on the first day, and a diner on one of the lower floors which we used for some snacks on our last day. There's also a gym which we didn't get round to using.The staff were all extremely helpful, knowledgable and friendly.

Brooklyn is within walking distance, and we hiked across the Williamsburg bridge one day to spend a day in that area. I found the lack of a true grocery/convenience store in the area a small issue, it was a bit of a hike to find beer/pop/chips for the room.Room was really nice, comfortable bed. we didn't have a great view, being on the 3rd floor, we were looking across at (mostly rundown) Chinatown shops (I should note we booked through Priceline for ~$180/night and I know Priceline/Hotwire customers don't usually get the ""choice"" rooms). Everything was clean, but as has been mentioned here before the showers in the washroom have only a half door and water sprays out everywhere, housekeeping was great and gave us extra towels to deal with this.Staff was very friendly and polite throughout the stay, our only major issue came on the last day. When we arrived after a long drive, we opted for the valet parking ($43/night), even though I knew there was cheaper self-parking in the area. It seemed that the convenience of being able to leave it in someone else's hands would be worth a bit extra... and it was until it was time to leave and it took them over 2 hours to get our car ready for us. I know it's another company handling the valet service and not entirely the hotel's fault, but with a 9 hour drive home waiting for us, the difference between leaving at 10AM and leaving at noon was pretty significant.That experience and the bathrooms prevent me from giving the hotel a 5/5 review, but I would still recommend it and would stay here again.","Peterborough, Ontario, Canada",2,4.0

I explained to them again and they seemed to not quite understand, maybe they didn't understand English as well as I expected. We arrived to the hotel about 8 pm, and I asked about upgrades and they ""upgraded"" us to a tiny room with a balcony, which we were not told was shared by the entire floor. I go to open up the door to the balcony and the sliding lock basically falls off as I open the door and lands on the floor. The bulb by one side of the bed was out, so I went to the front desk with it and requested a new bulb. They assured me a new one would arrive shortly. It never did. We called down to request toothpaste since we forgot to bring it and that actually arrived about ten minutes later. When turning down the sheets I noticed yellowing and dirtiness around the pillow area, and hairs under the blankets. Not cool.  Then about 10 pm the party starts in the room next door. Great. Now I don't know why they would put us right next to this group of about 10 kids drinking and yelling and going in out of the door, slamming it, as well as the balcony door many times. At one point one of the people in that room actually tried 3 x to get into our room using their key, until I went to door and told him he had the wrong room. This went on until about 2 AM when finally I went downstairs to complain because the phone call I made earlier mentioning it made no difference.

A decent small gym with free weights and a handful of machines was in the basement with a cold watercooler, a choice of three overhead stations and a TV. Every interaction with the staff was pleasant and accommodating. Housekeeping inadvertently threw out a plastic bag that still had a case in it because, by my own fault, I had left it beside another obvious bag of garbage.

Helpful and polite staff everywhere. The hotel had upgraded our room from a regular queen to a corner room on 16th floor, and the view was jawdropping! The room was also spacious, had a large bathroom (with bathtube and a hairblower that actuallly worked,- not like the other ones that heng on walls in other hotels,) it was clean, the bed was good with one big double duvet, it had cofeemaker, fridge, safe++ (Sometimes the smal tings make one big plus.) Hubby used fitnessroom almost every morning and was satisfied with the equipment (nothing broken&good aircondition.)For an extra good night sleep: buy earplugs, because the road outside is busy, but that's NY.The location is downtown in Chinatown, you can walk 2 min. to Little Italy, and it's just about 15 min. walk away from the more ""trendy"" areas.

We had mainly two issues with the hotel. First, we paid $50 more to have a premium room on the 16th floor and the room was advertised as having a balcony, but there was no balcony. The room did have ceiling to floor windows and an excellent view of the Manhattan skyline, though the windows were a little dirty. We saw a balcony on the floor below that wrapped around the side of the building, but it was apparently a shared balcony for all rooms on that floor (which we wouldn't have liked so much). The windows did help keep the outside noise down though - there was no problem with noise from the street, most likely due to being so high up. But when we were settling down for the night we heard someone vacuuming on the floor above us, and moving furniture around. This went until around 11:40 p.m. From what I've read on here the 17th floor is used for various events, so it was probably the clean-up after a party. Other than these issues, the place was fine. The staff members were wonderful and the hotel appears to be well built. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. Bed was very comfy and bathroom was great. Beautiful lobby, and great location for those interested in touring around Soho, Chinatown, Little Italy. Restaurant suggestion if you like wonderful French food - Parigot - it's a 5 minute walk from the hotel. We highly recommend though that the management straighten out the website so that the rooms are more accurately represented. And that they try to ensure that the 17th floor is quiet by a certain point in the evening, perhaps by 10 or 11 at the latest.",Pikesville,5,3.0

What a fantastic hotel, there were four of us and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay.Initially we were placed on the fifth floor but my husband asked if there were any rooms available higher up, so we moved to the ninth floor and what a difference. We had wonderful views of uptown Manhattan, and also of the financial district, which made such a difference.The room was extremely clean, as was the rest of the hotel, it wasn't huge but contained everything we needed. The room itself had 2 floor to ceilng full width windows and the bathroom window was floor to ceiling , what a brilliant feature ! My husband and I found the bed uncomfortable, my husband asked if they could make it more comfortable and the next two nights were much better. My husband found that the aircon did not cool the room sufficiently, however maintenance tried to sort it and it did get cooler (I was shivering), plus the fact hubby wasn't 100% which could have been the reason.The staff were excellent and worked hard to sort things out and make the stay enjoyable. The position of the hotel is fantastic as Chinatown is fun and interesting, but its only a short walk to Little Italy, and there is a subway station around the corner. There is a bus which goes uptown which is useful as well.The reason this does not get five stars is its restaurant and bar, which we have learnt is a franchise. Breakfast, we ordered oatmeal and coffee, was a complete let down and we were not offered a top up for the coffee. The oatmeal was tasteless. There are plenty of restaurants/cafes around so the rest of our stay we went out. My son and husband had a few problems at the bar as well, however my husband spoke to Omar and after that there were no problems.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and when I return to NYC I know where I will be staying.

Plenty of restaurants and mini-marts nearby. The views from our room (top floor) were fantastic - snow over NYC, the Chrysler building and Empire State Building. The room was very clean. Reception staff were very friendly and unpretentious, and check-in was easy. We were 'upgraded' rooms, HOWEVER, we had booked a balcony room and were 'upgraded' to a room one floor up but that had no balcony! We couldn't be bothered requesting another change so stayed there. Cons - Rooms a on the small side (normal for NYC), so difficult to move around with 2 large suitcases in the room. Additionally, the bathroom doors are almost transparent (looking straight through to the toilet), so if you don't like being able to see your partner on the toilet then this is worth knowing! Our biggest issue here however was the parties that were hosted on the top floor (the very top floor of the building, above the uppermost floor of guest rooms). It seems that this space is rented out for functions/events, so you end up sharing the lifts with many non-hotel guests who are heading up to the parties, and from our room, it was VERY noisy. Having planned an early night in one night, we were surrounded by the sound of thumping bass in our room and when we phoned reception to enquire about the noise, they just apologised and said it would be done by midnight. There was no change to the volume or timing of the end of the function, as I guess they aren't able to do so when somebody has paid to use the space. Furthermore, reception staff did not offer us a room change, and didn't tell us that there would be another function held the following night!!! So, same problem 2 nights running, which I felt was poorly managed.Overall - probably a good experience, marred by the events of the Friday and Saturday night while staying near the top floor. If I was to stay there again, I would definitely book a floor a few levels down from there to be safe, and confirm before booking RE function noise.",Australia,35,4.0

Our housekeeper greeted us both mornings and wished us a good day when we left for the day. The room was clean, TV good with several channels, super compact with a shared balcony, had good lighting (I'm a stickler for reading lights on both sides of the bed), a small fridge, coffee maker with coffee, tea, and water. As others have noted, the lack of full shower glass makes a mess on the floor. The first morning I had a water pressure issue but my husband adjusted the shower head and that helped the problem.We ordered room service one morning. The food came quickly, was hot, simple diner type food, but definitely a good value.The location is great with lots of restaurants and much to do, being close to Chinatown and Little Italy. The subway station that was close by was not working during the time we were there so we had to walk quite a way in the heat, which was not so great.Would I stay at this hotel again? Yes!

I had breakfast there on the first morning of our stay and it was unequivocally horrid. Service was non existant too so we never ate there again. Good options reasonably nearby though, my favourite being Russ and Daughters. The bar was also a little strange - very open and in the lobby so again that didnt appeal for a drink and we avoided it.Service at reception was good- always friendly.

However I would strongly recommend considering Wyndham Garden Chinatown. Here are the reasons:1) It is really close to the subway, and reaching any tourist spots is not a problem. NYC is not some place where you can just walk around without transportation. Get yourself a metro pass and stay close to the subway!2) Contrast to all those expensive midtown dining places, you can save $$ by eating in Chinatown and little Italy. There are great bakery shops, supermarkets, and restaurants offering special cuisines. Yummy and cheap! If you really want some expensive experience, you can try having brunch or desserts in SOHO, which is within walking distance from the hotel.3)Regardless of how the area looks, the hotel is modern, clean, and brand new. Staying at a brand new 3.5 hotel is much more comfortable than staying at some out-of-date 5 stars (both physically and financially).4) The hotel staff are welcoming and helpful. Here I must thank Massy, who worked at the front desk the day I checked out. My cousin said she would pick up my mom and me at the hotel and drive us to Penn Station, but she didn't show up on time. Massy generously offered his cell phone for me to contact her to avoid roaming. After knowing we decided to go to Penn Station directly, he kindly pointed out the closest subway station and told us the quickest way to get there.I am satisfied with the room size. It is not big, but fits 2 people comfortably. Road construction was annoying, but that was not the hotel's fault. Plus, NYC is having summer constructions everywhere.However I do want to point out two things for further improvement:-Ours was a three-day stay. We are fine with not replacing bed sheets, but we want our bathroom floor to be cleaned everyday. You know, mom and I, two women = long hair...-Giving out 2 bottles of water upon arrival is awesome. But what about the next day and the day after? The weather was so hot and we were really thirsty. Thank God the supermarket in Chinatown was nearby.","Mississauga, Canada",1,5.0

The bathroom shower was huge. They don't have anywhere to hang towels though and should be addressed. The air con blew quite strong on one side of the bed (room 702) and was a little cold even when the room temp was good (it was on the slowest speed). The bed was and cushions were very comfortable. We had a balcony but oddly they're not sectioned off to your room so you can technically walk around to the rooms next to you, not a major issue though.The wifi was good, 1Mbps. We didn't find it easy to park next to the hotel to drop our bags though but it is NY so what can you do. The hotel did help as much as they could when we arrived. They sent a porter down as soon as we arrived while I waited at my car.The restaurant downstairs looked good even though we didn't eat there.There's 2 subway stations nearby and loads of shops and restaurants on your doorstep.We would definitely stay here again.",Johannesburg and London now,31,5.0

I stayed there for the Chinese New Year celebration in February and most recently 2 weeks ago. The hotel is extremely clean and in a great spot; off of Canal so away from the madness but still close in proximity to Little Italy, SoHo, and thick of Chinatown. The rooms are fair for Manhattan and there are neat amenities such as a pretty nice gym. The thing that put me over the top to write this review is the amazing staff; always SO nice and just a very professional crew...you can tell they really value their clients and want you to return. On both occasions, I have had the great pleasure to deal with Janice and Hamza who always have a smile and are willing to make your stay a pleasant one. Through reservations, I have dealt with Meyin, who is God-sent in how she is speedy in her replies and ensures you have all concerns answered to the point she gives you 3 phone numbers to contact HER if there are any issues. For example, we intended to stay at WGC in the fall of 2012 right after Hurricane Sandy; however, due to the City's damage, it was postponed. Meyin ensured we were able to seamlessly transfer to another Wyndham property and followed up with handling a subsequent stay in February. I've stayed in NYC MANY times and have seen some decent hotels and some not so great; for me, WGC is probably our favorite for the value and location but most importantly, people like Janice, Meyin and Hamza ensure I will return each time.","Baltimore, Maryland",0,5.0

There are some major pros and cons to consider when deciding whether the relatively low cost (for Manhattan) is worth the stay, and while I had a pleasant stay I probably wouldn't return. On one hand the hotel is brand new so it's clean and not at all run down. The room I stayed in was a decent size (for NYC), and the staff was friendly. The hotel is a quick walk to the D train, Chinatown and little Italy, and if you don't mind walking a little further you can get over to SOHO for some shopping, the R train at Canal, and to a Whole Foods and great restaurants north at Houston. It's also a super-quick walk to some amazing views from the Manhattan Bridge, which is the edgier and less tourist friendly cousin of the Brooklyn Bridge.On the other hand the hotel is located right in Chinatown and while it's a short-trek to nicer parts of town the immediate area is very sketchy, especially after dark. I imagine that for those not from a big city the distinct smells of Chinatown, the insane crowds, and the filthy run-down neighborhood in the vicinity would make them very uncomfortable. On top of that traffic in this part of town is true chaos and even from the 9th floor it was way too loud on a few nights. Overall this hotel close to the subway is sparkly and clean for a great value, but the immediate neighborhood is a bit of a downer and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who would be travelling alone or uncomfortable in a rough neighborhood.",Toronto,32,3.0

My main complaint would be the same as many other have stated: the shower door situation is very strange. It is impossible to keep the water in the shower. My second issue was the lack of places to hang towels in the bathroom, making it hard to do the eco-friendly practice of using towels for more than one day. However, since we usually had to use towels to sop up the water from the shower, this wasn't as big of a deal as it could have been. Still, there were spaces where they could have put a bar or hook to hang hand and bath towels in the bathroom.

Staff was very pleasant, and a pleasure to deal with. They held our bags while we went to park the car in Brooklyn (free, easy parking). Complimentary drink coupons upon our arrival was a generous gesture. A few things stuck out to me from my two night stay here with my wife...-The hallways & elevator didn't have air conditioning. On the hottest days of July, this kinda took me by surprise. No biggie though...just odd.-No ice machines! One of the first things we normally do is get ice for the room. Each floor appears to have an area where an ice machine SHOULD go, but there are no machines. Cost saving measure? Perhaps. Inconvenient, for sure. But luckily, the staff is responsive to requests. A simple call, and staff will bring you ice. (They get it from the restaurant downstairs. I think you can go down there and get it yourself as well). Odd.-The bathroom shower. Hmmm...its designed beautifully. But there is a disconnect between form & function here. There is half of a glass door, that allows for the shower to splash all over the bathroom floor. Yeah, they give you plenty of towels for the floor. but...uhhh...its beautifully awkward. Those ""odd"" things don't take away from our experience though. It was a great hotel.

It is a new hotel, modernly furnished, with well-appointed rooms, modern bathroom, and lots of natural light. The staff is very helpful and professional. It is very well priced and it has become one of my favorite hotels in the city. The location is excellent as well--an easy subway ride to the financial district or 15 min walk to Soho and LES. Two things I think you should keep in mind, particularly if you are planning to visit in July or August:--There is a road construction going on right in front of the hotel. Since this is New York, the actual work is being performed each weekday night before 10pm and 4am to minimize impact on traffic. Imagine listening to drilling, banging and other noise while you are trying to sleep! The construction lasted during my entire 9 day stay (except on Sat and Sun), and based on the info posted at the construction site, it is supposed to go through late August. Needless to say, my sleep suffered greatly. --The AC in rooms is very loud, which I found very surprising for such a new hotel. To be honest, though, the AC loudness did drown some of the construction noise, so in this situation I guess it was not necessarily a negative. All in all, I think this is a great hotel and I plan to return, provided that the street construction is finished by my next trip in September. In the meantime, I would recommend that the reception staff becomes more knowledgable and is able to provide more info about the construction to guests who ask about it ( when we originally inquired about the construction, the staff was very apologetic, but said that they did not have any info about when the construction would end, although this info is actually posted at the site).

The ""ultra modern"" look is such a non-green choice. The shower enclosure had a glass panel in lieu of a shower curtainhat is supposed to make the bathroom look larger I guess. But the wall it abutted to was not straight (or the glass wasn't straight) so every shower results in a soaking wet large bath towel. A bath mat towel was provided but that was needed to mop up the flood from the two foot wide expanse where a shower curtain would have been had there been one. And since the spash zone extended all the way to the sink, yet another towel was nbecessary to mop up the water from the tile floor to avoid a potential slip and fall incident. Because there are NO TOWEL RACKS all the towels get to be picked up by housekeeping and washed DAILY. Seriously, who thought this design was a good idea?The restaurant is incredibly overpriced. I went down for dinner one night and was the only patron. I couldn't understand the waitress who told me the beer had ""poo poo"" on top.

We really enjoyed our stay and warmly recommend the hotel to all travellers. There is absolutely no need to stay near Times Square, even if you are a first-time visitor like we were. There are very good subway connections from three subway stations near the hotel. Very convenient if you are landing in JFK, as there is a direct subway (J/Z) from the AirTrain station to Bowery, so no need to take a taxi. We used this both coming from and going to the airport.I had originally booked a Premium Queen Balcony room, but as a courtesy we were upgraded to an Executive Queen Balcony (thank you Vanessa!). The room was lovely and the view absolutely magnificent! Our room was situated on the 15th floor (room 1505) and whilst not very spacey, we had no problems staying there and had ample room for our suitcases as well. The bathroom was perfectly fine, it was one of those rooms with a bathtub and a shower curtain, so we did not experience the problem with water all over the floor, which seems to be the case in the bathrooms with walk-in showers. Even the bathroom had a floor-to-ceiling window, so we could have a bath and see Empire State Building while bathing. How cool is that!The bed was fine, as was the refrigerator, which we used to keep juice etc. cool. There is a small coffee machine in the room, so we had breakfast in the room a couple of times. There are really cheap and tasty Chinese bakeries nearby, so just go and get some warm buns, croissants etc. in the morning. Most were priced 1-1.75 USD, so you can get a breakfast for a few dollars. We never tried the hotel’s breakfast, as it was not included in our room price.Someone commented on the loud airconditioning in an earlier review. We found it to be true at least in our room, so much so that I had to use ear plugs during the first night; after that I got used to the noise and slept well. We did not hear any traffic noise from the streets with the exception of an occasional siren. I would prefer having a separate reading lamp on both sides of the bed; now there was one only on one side, but this was not a major issue. The room tended to get quite humid despite the airconditioning, even so that books that I had bought started to curl their pages due to humidity.Two things that I think the hotel could improve: get the ice machines installed, please! The hotel has been ready since last November, and still there is only an empty place in the hallway where the ice machine should be. Yes, I know you can go downstairs and ask for ice from the bartender, but we never bothered; besides, nobody mans the bar during the daytime. Another thing: please get some chairs and tables on the balcony! We so much enjoyed sitting on the balcony, watching the incredible view and having a drink, but we felt a bit uncomfortable having to sit on the balcony floor on towels and pillows taken from the room. I would really have expected the balconies to have furniture by now. Please note that the balconies are not really private, i.e. you can walk along the whole balcony, passing another rooms. This did not bother us. One thing that we thought was a bit odd: one of the windows of our bathroom was broken (it was so when we arrived), the outer glass of the double glazing was totally gone, only a few glass shards remained on the balcony floor. During our stay nobody picked the shards away, neither were any attempts made to replace the broken window. As the windows have double glazing and the inner one was still intact, this didn’t bother us much, but I just hope that they get it fixed before the weather turns colder.All staff members that we met were really nice and friendly, always saying hello when we passed the reception. If you travel with your pets, note that this hotel accepts pets, as we saw at least three dogs in the hotel during our stay; again, this did not bother us. Our room and the whole hotel was immaculately clean.We would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again and will recommend it to our friends.","Turku, Finland",5,4.0

Good service. Well kept property; seems quite new. Stylish decor.

Only a duvet as bedcover, so either too warm with it or too cool without. Could have used an extra chair besides the desk chair. Internet was spotty, and we kept having to log in; it didn't remember us.Also, to comment on the location. We didn't choose it - we were part of a wedding group.

Nice decor. Awesome views of the Empire State Building and upper manhattan from the floor to ceiling windows. Except, really serious design flaw; you couldn't see the view unless you were sitting at the miniature desk or walking into the the hotel room. The bed could've been facing the window and the amazing view. But it wasn't. While lying in bed, you could hardly see anything at all. A shameless missed opportunity. The smoked glass in the bathroom made it seem more open but if you had to use it at night the light would pour into the room. Also the toilet was so loud, that I didn't flush during the night because it woke my husband up. Gross but better than the alternative. hopefully you're not traveling with light sleepers. Nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom while showering. But my biggest gripe was the ac was impossible to operate. The room was either freezing or hot as hell. Couldn't change the temp to anything but 'more cold'. We called down a few times, was told someone would come up. No one ever did. Finally we called down again and were told the ac is set by the hotel and it can't be changed from the room. What? First off, why have the ac panel in my room then if all I can do is look at it. Talk about a tease! Second... an additional, What?! I've never been to a hotel where I couldn't set the temp of the room. That was the worst part of the stay because it was freezing when the air was on so we'd turn it off. But within minutes it was so hot, we'd have to turn it on again. This went on the whole night. Because its NY we were out during the day but I certainly wouldn't stay here again specifically because of that. Hotels are supposed to be comfortable.

You can imagine how expensive the hotels were for the last week of May (also happened to be Memorial Day Weekend) as all families descend into this small and incredibly city to attend the festivities. We went with this hotel given how close it was to my sister's apartment and NYU. After some extensive research, I found this new hotel and rates that were within reason, especially for a brand new hotel in NYC. I booked a two double beds room with limited view for a 4-night stay in late January.When we arrived at the hotel, there was a minor confusion on their system but the check-in person was about to clear it up for me. We were checked into Room 410. When we walked in, the room looked smaller than I had anticipated in comparison to the rooms at the Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca nearby. I wish the rooms were bigger as staying in such a room for 4 nights can be too cramped for 3 adults. Also, my parents drove me mad so the size of the room really didn't help as I wanted nothing but space. However, the room was super clean and modern especially the bathroom. The bathroom had a big sink counter with a sleek, floor-to-ceiling tiled shower with a glass partition. My only complaint is that this glass partition didn't do much as water got everywhere when I showered. On the first night, the floor was almost flooded after my dad showered.In terms of hotel service, the staff were superb! Every time we had a question or concern, they addressed immediately and followed up to see if there was anything else that they could do. I have to give them an A+ on this as I have never experience such wonderful service at a hotel. My parents even acknowledged this and they are rarely do. On one late afternoon we stayed in when it started pouring outside with isolated thunderstorms. When the storm got stronger, we were having trouble getting any television reception. We called front desk and they sent their engineer immediately to check. The engineer stopped by our room to let us know that the storm was interfering with their satellite dish but our reception should be back on it.In terms of the location, the hotel is located in the heart of Chinatown (not the best location) as the neighborhood was a bit rundown. In sum, I had a wonderful stay at Wyndham. I would considering staying here again. Thank you Wyndham Chinatown!",Pasadena,10,4.0

The room was modern with neutral but Asian-inspired decor, with a very comfortable bed, an excellent, well-lit desk, good internet, a large (for New York) bathroom with a tub/shower combination and a window, and all the other things you could want in a room -- ironing board, iron, safe, luggage stand, and temperature control. The aircon/heater provided a bit of white noise but this was manageable. The hotel lobby is clean and bright and the staff seemed genuinely concerned and eager to help with any questions that I had. The location of the hotel has its pros and cons. For walking in the neighbourhood and environs, it's great. For travelling by subway, the hotel is a bit less convenient as it's a bit of a haul to the Canal Street subway stops and the ones closer are not that convenient. Taxis are very plentiful, however, and any taxi driver can easily find their way back to Chinatown. The quality-price ratio is very good at this property.

For some reason I didn't like the first room they gave me opposite the elevators (I was wary of elevator noise, and the room felt like it had bad feng shui); I asked if other rooms were available and they promptly moved me to a large room away from the elevators facing Bowery. Everything about the room was great – comfy bed, spacious desk, nice bathroom and I loved people watching through the floor-to-ceiling window onto Bowery – except for the street noise.

On this small street in Chinatown, Doyers street you will find hidden gem Pulqueria. Not the easiest place to find, it’s one of those secret NYC treasures, but once you do you are in for a treat (FYI, right next door is Apotheke, a bar where you’ll need a password to get in). All and all, great hotel, we will be back and can without hesitation recommend anyone to stay here.","Stockholm, Sweden",16,5.0

We even walked over the Brooklyn Bridge from there and would say this is a MUST do! AND there was a Popeye's Fried Chicken around the corner!The hotel itself was perfect for our needs. We were in the standard queen room and felt that the space was adequate for 2 adults with luggage and lots of NYC shopping! We made good use of the in-room fridge and the bathroom was very modern and well-appointed, including the shower which did spit excess water onto the bathroom floor, but its water on a tiled floor that can easily be wiped up with the more than generous amount of towels provided, so you just deal with it and move on with your day! The front desk staff were always eager and willing to help or simply smile and acknowledge you as you walked past. John Chen was excellent and provided a great recommendation for dim sum 3 blocks away! TASTY!! The housekeeper as well did a great job and refreshed our room consistently and I felt that personal touch...example: some hotels pile on pillows and coverlets, etc. on the bed, which is fine, but as a guest to have a housekeeper that notices all that excess bedding is on the floor each morning and rather than just doing the bed as usual per the manual, leaves the excess off and folds it nicely on the chair in the corner is WONDERFUL!

We chose it because the ""queen suite"" could accommodate our whole family for less than the price of two rooms at any other hotel within walking distance of our son's school.First the good: Our ""queen suite"" (room 607 the first stay; 606 the second stay) was reasonably spacious by Manhattan standards and very clean. There is a mini-fridge you can actually use (not a minibar), reliable free wifi, and the room and bathroom had a nice modern design (we looked at some of the same fixtures when we renovated our apartment). The staff at the front desk was extremely friendly and tried hard to be helpful. I also think the location is very good for anybody with business in Chinatown and excellent for tourists who are looking for a more interesting place to stay than the typical tourist mega-hotels in Midtown (walkable to many interesting neighborhoods, and good subway access to the rest of the city). But there are some significant drawbacks to this property. The hotel is very new. I believe it opened in November 2012. But it appears to have been cheaply built. Our first room had some water stains on the ceiling near the windows, indicating there had probably been a leak at some point. Our room on the second visit had a desk lamp that barely put out any light, a semi-broken temperature control in the shower, and a sink that filled faster than it could drain.There were also a number of bizarre design decisions. The ""suite"" is a big square room with a full wall of floor-to-ceiling windows and an L shaped wall that divides the room into three areas.The L wall runs parallel to the windows and turns into the room to create a bed area. The bed area was barely larger than the bed itself and completely walled off from the windows, but the bed was comfortable.Between the wall and the windows, there is a mostly wasted space where they've put an upholstered chair (that I can't imagine anybody ever uses) and a desk. The desk thoughtfully has open electrical outlets at desk level for plugging in computers and phone chargers, but lacks a phone. In both suites I had to unplug the phone from the bedside nightstand and plug it into the desk (which at least has a jack) to make phone calls while working at the desk. But at least local calls were free, and the hotel's free wifi worked well with my computer.The rest of the room is a living area. There is an incredibly uncomfortable (for sitting or sleeping) pullout couch. Unlike most hotels with pullout couches, the mattress comes bare and you have to request sheets. And the pullout is very small--not even close to the length of a regular bed. It was fine for our 5 year old, but I would NOT recommend it for a full grown adult. There's also a very high marble table with barstool-like seating that looked cool and was okay for eating meals, but precarious for our 2 year old.The mini-fridge is enclosed in a cabinet that has no ventilation, so unless you leave the cabinet open, the fridge is engaged in a Sisyphean battle against its own heat production.The bathroom has a nice aesthetic, but doesn't have a bathtub (shower only, with weak water pressure and the aforementioned semi-broken control in one of our two rooms), has very little counter space (although there are shelves below the sink) and nowhere to hang wet towels, and has a translucent door that allows people in the room to see the silhouette of someone sitting on the toilet.The wall of windows had an intresting view from our 6th floor rooms and had effective privacy and blackout curtains, but none of the windows open. Given the hotel's location a block from the entrance to the Manhattan Bridge, that's not necessarily a bad thing (the air outside is likely worse than the hotel's recirculated air, and the windows are very well soundproofed against the sometimes cacophonous traffic), but for some people the lack of open-able windows can be a deal breaker.The hotel's service was okay, but not great. It took three calls on our second visit to get sheets for the pullout couch. But they're very friendly, keep the place very clean, and provide nice freebies like a crib for the 2 year old.All in all, I'd consider returning if the price is right, but would only recommend it to folks who need a cheap suite in the area or who want a reasonably priced modern hotel in a fun neighborhood and don't mind the quirky details.",NYC,37,3.0

Some drawbacks include the half-wall for the shower being inadequate for keeping the water off of the bathroom floor, the mattress for the pull-out bed will leave you in agony, and our corner room did little to contain the noise from the traffic outside making sleeping difficult. I would recommend asking for a room that doesn't face The Bowery (even though your view might not be as nice). The staff is freindly and helpful.

I saw one or two comments re breakfast in some reviews here, sure it is a basic continental in the room rate but with a $10 credit meaning only $5 to upgrade to some very good cooked options that is no big deal even on a budget. Location is great, transport access easy, all the downtown sights in easy walking if you are fit, Katzs deli just far enough away to make you feel almost virtuous as you eat a vast sandwich. Some very good Asian options, we had a great Malaysian meal at Nyonya and a decent Szechuan at the Famous Szechuan, Vinces Clam Bar did some good simple Italian dishes and Lombardis Pizza is well worth queuing for.

We checked in early.....unfortunately our room was not ready...but that was fine...staff took our luggage and we went to have lunch and explore.The room (on the 15th floor) was a reasonable size.....everything was very clean....there was minimal street noise.....however the bed was a bit firm for our liking.

This hotel offers fantastic value for New York - it is very new so has been designed from the start as a hotel, not an old building where hotel rooms have to be squeezed in. So rooms are I think bigger than average for NYC, plus with floor to ceiling and wall to wall glass they are fantastically bright. We had a fairly standard room relatively low down on the 6th floor but could still see the buildings of Wall St and No 1 World Trade Centre to our left and Empire State Building to our right! Views from higher floors must be amazing. As other reviewers have said the hotel staff are really friendly and helpful, the free wifi worked with no problems at all, and the breakfast (which we had included in the room rate), was perfectly pleasant - some tasty little pastried and fresh fruit and tea/coffee. No its not large but there are so many other great places to eat in new York you don't want to fill up at breakfast and miss out! Hotel is also right in the heart of Chinatown and Little Italy which are great areas, only 10min walk to Soho and West Broadway, only about 20-30 minute walk to Greenwich Village and only a couple of minutes from the subway to get anywhere else. Definitely recommend this hotel.","Birmingham, United Kingdom",17,5.0

Greeted warmly by Vanesssa who proceeded to place us in a room with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Room was a bit small but not unlike other establishments in NYC (as this was our 15th visit to this great city, we've seen all sorts and sizes of rooms and this one was great). Two issues: 1) the open concept shower, while nice to look at, does not function well. Too much water finds its way to the floor and you almost have to tilt the showerhead towards the wall to avoid a massive puddle. 2) the coffee maker was wonky from the start and ended up breaking on the last day. Other than these two minimal issues, the hotel and service was excellent. Room was very clean and employees always greeted you with a smile. Hotel is close to the B-D Subway lines (Grand St), a few blocks from the N-Q-R & 6 lines (Canal St) and a short walk to Little Italy (try Ferrara's if you've never...amazing).

Complimentary bottled water and nuts, too (high-quality nuts at that). The room and white lobby all remind me of a superior Taiwanese hotel.The location is important, because it will be ideal for some visitors, but not others. When they say the hotel is in Chinatown, they mean it. Hester St. is one block north of Canal St., the heart of Chinatown, and Little Italy is just a couple of blocks west. (Little Italy is no more than about two blocks these days, but the restaurants that have survived are all pretty good.) So it's a vibrant and interesting neighborhood, with lots of delicious restaurants nearby, but if your business is elsewhere in the city, this wouldn't be the best location for you.If I have one small complaint, it's that a single unisex bathroom seems to serve the entire lobby, and the toilet seat is already wobbling.","Yardley, Pennsylvania",168,4.0

Even though it was more affordable than the previous hotel the room, despite being a little smaller, was just as nice if not nicer. I particularly appreciated the floor-to-ceiling windows with a great view, the walk-in shower (the only problem being the lack of a complete door and/or floor drain in the main section of the bathroom, making a wet bathroom floor a distinct possibility unless you are extremely careful) and the very cozy bed. The only additions I would like to see as far as the accommodations are concerned would be a pool and hot tub, full glass sliding doors on the showers and ice machines on every other level (currently one must go to the bar and hassle the poor bartender for ice)... Short of this I can't think of any suggestions. The lobby is very contemporary and the bar is quite sylish, with Kubrick-inspired seating (no milk-girl statues, it's classy) and even the bar/lobby restroom has style, with a cool, backlit blue ""fountain"" style faucet. The room was clean and comfortable. The location is pretty optimal for explorers, being located in bustling Chinatown not far from Canal St. and very close to the Grand St. subway station.My experience with the staff was nothing short of fantastic. Everyone from the bartender to housekeeping should be commended, but perhaps especially Ahcene and the rest of the front desk/lobby employees. My travel companion had a flight get cancelled and we encountered all manner of difficulties in dealing with this, and they not only stored our luggage in the office for nearly a full day while we dealt with this but gave me personal use of a micro USB cable to charge my phone for emergency use and allowed me to stay in the lobby for hours using their computers to print maps and communicate with others to resolve this. All this on the day we were departing, AFTER we had already checked out.All in all, I cannot recommend the Wyndham Garden Chinatown enough. But while the room, location, view, bar and lobby were all very nice, the outstanding service from the staff is to be commended above all else. My special thanks again to Ahcene and the front-desk/lobby staff. The next time I am in Manhattan, I will definitely be checking to see if a room is available here.","Lewiston, Maine",21,5.0

We had a queen Deluxe room and boy, it was really deluxe. Finally a comfortable bed, with great linen... the corner room, with outer walls completely in glass, featured also a small living area. Great view, even if the 5th floor was a little noisy - the hotel is on the corner of two busy streets, so there's a lot of cars honking etc. etc. We were extremely satisfied by the room, and the two flaws we could find have been already written by other reviewers: 1) the lack of a door on the shower, which means that you cannot take a shower without getting water all over the floor (the water was properly hot every time, though) and 2) the continental breakfast that was part of our rate. This breakfast consists of a bowl of oatmeal + two slices of toasted bread OR three pastries PLUS a bowl of mixed fruit + orange juice + tea or coffee. The real problem here is the three pastries. They seemed stuff baked the day before. Did not seem fresh at all. The pieces of croissants were re-heated, so they were kind of dried out, and the other pastries were oily and tasted a bit stale. I think that, being such a nice hotel (I chose this hotel in Manhattan after having carefully read through the reviews of nearly 100 other places!), this is an annoying flaw. At least in Europe, breakfast is very often part of the roomrate, so it was odd to be treated a little rudely every time we presented the breakfast coupons. Apart from this minor flaw, I cannot praise enough the staff. Everybody was incredibly friendly and ready to help us out.

I had been stalking the hotel's reviews for several weeks prior, and they were nearly all glowing. And while this is a nice hotel, it does have a couple of flaws. First, the good/great of the hotel - the staff is friendly & helpful; the decor is very attractive; the room was exceptionally clean; the fitness room was very user-friendly; and the hotel is located 2 easy blocks from the subway (this was a huge plus for us). Minor flaws: the hotel has no ice machines, even though they are advertised in the hotel's info book; the free breakfast that was advertised when we booked the hotel is no longer offered; and by far the biggest flaw - the bathroom. The bathroom/shower is very physically attractive, but it is the most impractical bathroom I have ever used. The shower has no door, which I thought would be no big deal, but my husband and I both soaked the floor every time we showered, no matter how hard we tried not to. The worst part of no door, though, was that the shower was FREEZING. The water was never ""hot,"" only warm, which would have been okay had there been a shower door. But without a door to trap the steam/heat, the shower was freezing cold. It was not fun taking a shower. Not having a shower door to trap the steam also meant that when we got out of the shower, everything in the bathroom was covered in condensation (there was no fan to vent the steam, which I wouldn't have used even if there was one, because that would have only made the shower even colder). I couldn't store my makeup or other supplies in the bathroom because they were soaked after showering if I did. This was a pain. The other negative of the attractive bathroom was that the back wall was frosted glass, which meant that I couldn't shower early in the morning or late at night without waking my husband and daughter, because the light and sound carried right through the wall.I'm sure the minor flaws we experienced will be fixed, and they are greatly outweighed by the positives of the hotel. However, my husband said that because of the shower situation, he wouldn't stay at this hotel again. Too many other choices in NYC. However, if they could fix the shower situation, I would definitely come back, based on the hotel's staff, cleanliness, and proximity to a subway stop.","Peoria, Illinois",11,4.0

The Wyndham Garden Chinatown exceeded ALL my expectations. The hidden surprise: world-class service. I arrived at check-in haggard and stressed, having drudged in from the airport by bus and train with suitcases. The director of rooms, Omar Bouchaar, greeted me warmly. I said, somewhat coyly, ""So, you're going to 'wow' me, right?"" Omar's reaction sealed my impression of the hotel. With a twinkle in his eye and a friendly smile, he seemed genuinely intrigued by the challenge---and he rose to it. After a few minutes on his computer, Omar confided: ""We ARE going to 'wow' you. I've moved you to my FAVORITE room with a view."" On the 15th floor, I enjoyed a panoramic view of the Brooklyn Bridge, City Hall and the Empire State Building. The room was the perfect size for NYC, comfortable, nicely appointed and boasted a closet and desk (thank God). Not least important, it was immaculate. The hotel's exercise room had a handful of treadmills and machines, perfect for my needs, as well.Omar embodies fine hospitality, and his service is a big part of why I'll book here on my upcoming trips. He even picked up on my needs for 'hydration' and had extra water bottles sent up to my room. The rest of the staff was graciously accommodating, routing directions to all my business meetings by train and fetching taxis when needed. Special note to my fellow yogis: Check out the nearby Yoga High studio, just two blocks away on Forsyth and Grant. Fantastic instruction; another gem. In short: For a traveler who enjoys the diversity and a mix of bustling streets and quaint side streets, the Wyndham's location is ideal.

The room was compact (but not tiny) and functional and very clean. There is a refrigerator included which is nice for fruit from the stalls and leftovers from all the great restaurants in the neighborhood. Two two-drawer nightstands and a narrow armoire for hanging clothes provided adequate storage. The bathroom is spacious, but as others have pointed out the water from the shower is strangely attracted to the floor and needs to be soaked up with the very nice towels provided. There is also no hook/rod in the bathroom to hang the towel near the shower. Be prepared for the frosted glass wall that separates the bathroom from the bedroom --you do get a shadow show when someone is using the facilities and the bedroom lights are dimmed. The view from the room is spectacular -- we were on the 12th floor and were greeted by a panorama that included the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Watching the rain move down the island was especially fun. Definitely ask for a higher room -- lower floors look straight into the building across the street which might make those floor to ceiling windows a disadvantage. The staff from housekeeping to the front desk to the bartenders and maintenance people were all extraordinarily friendly and accommodating.

Wanting to stay near the Lower East Side, we chose the Wyndham Chinatown.I loved the location on the edge of Chinatown/Little Italy and close to the action of the LES. The price was good as well.As my title says, the place is brand new, so the rooms are immaculate. I was also very happy with their lobby bar. Its a far cry from a usual lobby bar: the bartenders are hip, witty, and good mixers, the snacks are great, and Happy Hour prices had me floored. CHEAP drinks and Cheap snacks (dollar clams or oysters and more).I was disappointed to discover their happy hour is only weekdays, not weekends.My only complaint is the size of the rooms; they're very small. They bumped my brother to a penthouse room (his balcony door would not lock), but it was no bigger than our standard queen size room. Theres very little room to navigate around the bed. Theres also only one chair in the room (can't fit much more anyway), so if you're 2 couples travelling and decide to hang in the room before heading out, 3 have to sit on the bed, one in the chair and perhaps rotate.But hey, its Manhatten, right?I'd recommend this place for its location on the lower east side, for its 'newness' (cleanliness), for its weekday happy hours, and for the price.

I don't think I would've stayed here had it not been for the sale as the regular rates are far too expensive for my pockets. Nevertheless, it is New York, so if you have the money, this is an excellent stay in the heart of Chinatown. The hotel is brand spanking new. You can tell they pay attention to details and keep everything super clean. The staff was very friendly, especially on our last day when we we're waiting to get a cab to the airport. One of the female receptionists took her time to hail us a cab AND help carry our bags, which totally wasn't necessary for a female to do. Our room was very clean and spacious. We stayed in a room that had a king room and a pull-out sofa bed. Besides these two colums that were on both sides of the bed, the room was easy to move around in and felt very comforting. I dont remember the street noise being much of a problem at night, but then again, maybe I'm just a heavy sleeper. The area is very safe. It may not look great outside like say the upper east side or midtown manhattan, but Chinatown and the SoHo area are perfectly safe areas to be in. In fact, you're about a 10 minute walk away from what I consider being the best pizza in NY (Lombardi's on Spring & Mott). You're a short 5 minute walk away from different subway stations that can take you anywhere you'd like to go which is a huge plus for me when traveling to NY. The free continental breakfast menu when I stayed in December was very limited and not the best tasting (you either chose between plain flavored yogurt, which is very strong, or very bland tasting oatmeal), but it is free so I still ate there every morning as it was acceptable. I don't know if they have changed the menu since, but this by no means should be a deal breaker as the hotel was excellent in all other aspects.","Miami, Florida",1,5.0

Bathroom has no countertops or anywhere really to put your toiletries (shaving cream, curling irons, etc.). There also is very little storage space, so it might be a problem if you're hoping to stay more than a few nights. The knob on one of the cabinets was broken - I took it to the front desk, had a couple of drinks, went to my room and it was repaired. The open shower is a mess - after my shower the bathroom floor was covered in water. If this were more convenient to my business meetings I would probably stay again despite the bathroom issues.

In order to make this a useful review, I thought I would break it down into what I loved, what others might not like but I didn't mind, and the few things I thought could be improved. First, what we loved: our view was amazing. We were on the 10th floor and north side of the building, and we had a spectacular view of midtown Manhattan, including the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. It was particularly lovely and romantic at night. We also loved how beautifully the room was decorated and the bed was very comfortable. Finally, Chinatown was a great location if you love a truly authentic New York neighborhood that is a real Chinatown still, not a touristy embalmed version. It's also really convenient to the B and D train and fairly convenient to the 6 and the N and the R.What others might have minded but we didn't: I noticed when I looked at previous reviews that some people thought the rooms were small. While our room was a bit on the small side, I think that's a function of New York hotel rooms and they've done a great job making it much nicer by including a full wall of windows (see above re view). Also, I lived in New York a while ago and so am used to the dirty and crowded streets that you find in neighborhoods like Chinatown. If you are new to New York or to city travel in general, you might find the location a little TOO authentic. Finally, if you are concerned about being able to easily get everywhere in the city, including Central Park or other far uptown places, this hotel may not be as well situated for that. We wanted to hang downtown so this location was perfect.Some suggested improvements: the shower was really strange--it had no door so water got all over the bathroom floor no matter how much you adjusted the head. I think they could put in a better shower head to avoid this problem. Also, the front desk staff was very nice but not very knowledgeable about the area. When we asked about a breakfast place, they could not recommend a specific restaurant and sent us to Grand Street because ""there are lots of breakfast places along there""--which there weren't when we got there. Overall, I thought this was a very good hotel that could be great if the staff updated their knowledge of the area more.","Chicago, Illinois",5,4.0

The Wyndham Garden did not disappoint. We have a beautiful penthouse corner room with sweeping views of NYC. From our room we could see the Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge, Freedom Tower, Union Square, and the Empire State Building. It had a balcony that ran the length of our floor, but we were the only people who were ever on it. The room was small, but it's NYC, you're paying for the location and the view. The location could not have been better. Very very close to Subways and very easy to hail a cab. Canal street is a 2 minute walk, Little Italy a 5 minute walk, and SoHo a 10 minute walk. You truly cannot beat it. We were lucky enough to be in town for Chinese New Year and got caught up in the festivities daily. It was such a treat. The staff at the hotel was incredible. They remembered us by name at the front desk with each passing. We even rode the elevator with one of the guest services members who asked about our stay, and if I had any suggestions.

Journeyed to hotel by Airtrain andSubway from JFK. Alighted at Bowery station. Hotel is about 3 blocks south of the station. No problem finding it. Check in was smooth. Requested for high floor room with a view. Given one that was in the upper half of the building but faced Bowery Road, so no view of the north and Empire State Building. Also requested for late check out on because our flight was in the evening. Check out extended to 1pm, which was quite good enough for us. Room itself was comfortable. Cable TV available. Bed was comfortable. No issue with that. Wifi was good. Had no problems with that either. Previous comments about toilet are true, The screen for the shower area was too narrow, and there was a less than 1cm raised barrier that prevented water from getting out of the shower area into the toilet. Despite utmost care and using lower water pressure during shower, water escaped out into the toilet area. The basin was on its own below the mirror. There was no space to put toiletries and make up stuff, which had to be placed on the top of the cistern of the toilet bowl. A set of toiletries was provided by housekeeping seem slow and reluctant to replenish the toiletries, even when our shower gel and shampoo etc was less than half filled. Having said all this, the toilet and shower was fitted with branded stuff. By the way, housekeeping also did not top up coffee and tea sachets. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. No problem holding our luggage after check out too. Breakfast was included in the deal and it was adequate. Choosing the standard continental with choice of pastry or oats and toasts means no added charges other than tip for waiter/waitress. Also came with coffee. Order anything else means pay the difference plus tax and tip.I find that the best feature of the hotel was its location. It was right next to one end of the Manhattan Bridge, with the Forsyth St market right below it. Can get cheap fruits there from the road side stalls. Many restaurants nearby in Chinatown and Little Italy, all within walking distance. The more useful subway station is Canal Street which is 10 to 15 minute away. ","Singapore, Singapore",65,4.0

Everything is squeaky clean, Most importantly no bugs (no small feat in NYC hotel). 3. Staff is friendly, helpful and attentive. 4. At the time price-wise it was a steal at $145. . 5. Location is near perfect for lower Manhattan - the subways stops are 5 min (B,D) ,10 min (j,Z), 12 min (N,Q) and 15 min (F)respectively. Plenty of good food options around - some tourist traps some not. Little Italy is 5 min walk (if you are into it),, great Jewish deli's of Lower ES ( I particularly recommend Katz) at 15 min away, etc.6. If you are into South Asian fruits (rambutan, longan, lychee, mangosteen, etc). then added bonus are Chineese/Vietnamese groceries 3 min away. The only drawback I can think of it breakfast.

The rooms were immaculate and modern with good views. It is a new hotel. Queen bed was very comfortable. We got a great price of $161 base on a weekday-less for the weekend. The bar is small but friendly with an awesome bartender (Victor) and a loyal local crowd. We did not eat dinner in the restaurant but word is that the sushi is good. The subway is a 2 short block walk- very convenient. The negatives (and they weren't enough to bring it down in rating): 1. We weren't given the free breakfast that other guests were given because we made reservations through a 3rd party rather than the hotel itself (Hotels.com). Can't complain too much, I guess, since we got a good rate and there is a good breakfast cafe a short walk away (see Yelp). We did eat breakfast one morning in the hotel and the prices were high- $10 bowl of oatmeal, $15 for 3 eggs. 2. The bathroom has no towel racks- it has a little hook but it is insufficient. We wanted to be ""green"" and save our towels but since we couldn't get them to dry on a rack, we ended up piling them on the floor to be washed and got new ones every day- wasteful. 3. I could never really figure out the shower fixture and I couldn't get the water warm enough to my liking. There's only a little half glass wall and the water tends to escape to the bathroom floor. 4. The a/c was a little loud. Not rattly loud but sort of like loud ""white noise.""

CHECK IN: When you arrive try parking in the very front of the hotel. You most likely will need to go in and let the front desk know you will valet the car. Approximate wait will be 10 minutes or so since they have to contact the garage. The cost is $55.00+ a day with no in and out service available. You may wish to park on the next street, Crystie Street garage. The cost is $30.00 a day or $15.00 for a half day. This way you can go in and out. An inexpensive option for a NYC garage. ROOMS: Very clean, on the small side, but adequate. Storage space is at a premium. Just one side bed end table. Request a shower tub with a curtain if you wish to avoid a little water on the floor from the glass door showers. BAR: Happy hour at the friendly small bar is just super. Other times they are pricey. BREAKFAST: Forget the free breakfast, add a couple of dollars to your $10.00 voucher and get the 3 egg platter or Grand Marnier infused french toast. That's it, I just wanted to point out that these minor details are the only things you may wish to take into consideration.

There are plenty of cheap Chinese eateries nearby and its not far to walk to the Lower East Side and Little Italy. We could even walk to Greenwich Village and the Financial District and Brooklyn Bridge in less than 30 minutes. Plenty of subway options on the doorstep for Midtown and Uptown aswell. The staff were very welcoming and friendly as others have said. Only negative things I would mentions were: free Breakfast is a little spartan and the oatmeal was pretty ordinary (although we only ate it once while we were there). They havent got any ice machines yet (its still a pretty new hotel), but you can get some from the friendly barman though. The shower only had enough glass to cover half the entrance, so quite a lot of water got on the floor which seemed like an odd design choice! If you can get away with it, try and go up to the top floor which has an amazing 360 view of upper and lower manhatten, but is yet to be built by the looks of it (I cant understand why they dont have a rooftop bar already - it would be a big drawcard).

Let me just start by saying that all the great reviews of this hotel are spot on. Check-in was quick and easy. The reception staff was very friendly and efficient. The hotel is very new and so shows little signs of wear and tear. It is located in Manhattan's Chinatown (but also very close to Little Italy) at the corner of Bowery and Hester. For me it was very enjoyable to be in an ethnic neighborhood like Chinatown because it emphasizes the melting pot that is New York City. The neighborhood is full of the sights, sounds and smells that characterize the Chinese community in this great metropolis. I felt safe coming and going at all times and am really glad I chose to stay here as opposed to Times Square or a more touristy part of the city.The hotel is close to a couple subway lines (less than 10 min. walk) so getting anywhere in NYC should be no problem. That said, I was able to walk from the hotel to SOHO, the Village, and the financial district. So if you don't have problems walking and want to really take in Manhattan and its neighborhoods, the hotel's location won't present a problem. And, of course, the the subway is nearby for going further afield.The hotel's physical characteristics put it squarely in a 4+-star category. It is a modern high-rise building of approximately 20 floors. I was fortunate enough to be given a standard room on the 16th floor with a view facing uptown. Although the room was not huge, it did not feel small because of the floor-to-ceiling window that comprised an entire wall of the room. (Even the bathroom had a small floor-to-ceiling window with a view!) I could look out the window toward the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings while lying on the bed. There was probably less than 3 feet of space between the foot of the bed and the window, but the spectacular view created a great effect, especially at night.All the furnishings in the room were top notch and everything functioned perfectly. The furniture and bedding were done in a contemporary dark brown and beige. The bathroom was of a nice size, with a bathtub/shower combination and high-quality fixtures and toiletries. Water pressure and temperature were great.My rate included a daily continental breakfast. This is not a breakfast buffet but rather it is something you order from the restaurant menu and is served at your table. I was given a voucher for each day that had a value of $10 and was enough to cover the cost of the continental breakfast selection, which consisted of a generous bowl of oatmeal, a small bowl of fruits, one slice of toast, and coffee or juice. It is possible to order additional items from the menu at an extra cost. I will mention that the staff at the Elevate restaurant, where breakfast is served, is extremely polite and courteous!The hotel's public spaces are not very big. There is a small bar area and lobby area, as well as the Elevate restaurant, which is on the lower level. I must say, however, that the hotel very efficiently and tastefully makes use of the space it has, being intended more for the business traveler than for someone traveling with the family on vacation.All in all I am very glad I chose the Wyndham Garden Chinatown and would not hesitate to stay there again. The special rate was very reasonable for NYC and the room and view were fantastic!","Chicago, Illinois",28,5.0

Thanks to other reviewers we requested a corner room and were rewarded with a great view of the city on the 11th floor. The room was small, enough room for two people. We had a handicap room so the bathroom shower was exposed and the floor did get wet but I didn't mind too much. I think it'd be awkward to share the room with someone other than a spouse/significant other - the bathroom door is made of glass though frosted and sounds do come through. The service from hotel staff was great. I would not recommend getting the free breakfast downstairs. I had steelcut oatmeal and it tasted pretty gross. The service was also slow and lacking. There are so many yummy Chinese restaurants and even Doughnut Plant nearby where you can grab great, cheap food. Overall, it was great and affordable place to stay.

This is probably not the best hotel location-wise for the first time NYC visitor, but it is a wonderful choice for the seasoned Big Apple traveler. The hotel must be nearly new -- the rooms are spotless and modern with a nice flat screen TV, strong (and free) wireless Internet service and a hip little bar in the lobby.I really liked the location in the heart of Chinatown. The neighborhood is really interesting and vibrant. There are a few really great, cheap Chinese restaurants nearby, as you can imagine. Little Italy is a few blocks away. I also walked to the East Village and had a great meal.Subways are close, though not right next to the hotel. The nearest line is a few blocks away. The noise from the busy street could be a problem for some. We had a room on the 6th floor and the street noise was evident, but it didn't bother me much. If you think it will bother you, ask for a higher floor, which will give you even better views of the Chrysler Building, by the way.The staff was friendly and very helpful.The ONLY reason I did not give this a five star rating was a party that was happening next door on the last night of my three-night stay (a ""guys"" weekend in Manhattan with my 16-year-old son). Though it is not the hotel's fault that some idiots decided to use their room as a party location, the reaction to the fest could have been handled better. I called down once at 1:45 a.m. to complain about the noise. I had to call down again at 4 a.m. Needless to say, I didn't get much sleep that night. When I gently explained to the staff that I wasn't happy about the party when I checked out, they comped my breakfast.Yes, breakfast is included and as others have said, it is not much, but you can use the $10 value toward credit for the much, much better options on the menu, most of which are $15.

We had an amazing time, and the hotel, its staff and the location were a huge part of it. Granted, we are all related, but the rooms were spacious enough that we did not mind sharing our (2) queen-sized beds (we had two separate rooms.) Initially my mom and I were given a corner room on the 16th floor that was super tiny, but after addressing the size issue with the front desk, they gave us a bigger room on the other side of our accompanying party. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was super chic (I love the sink's wall-mounted faucet!) We had no issue, as others have mentioned, with the shower leaking on the floor. Maybe they didn't put the liner inside the tub??? My only complaint with the room is that we were in a room with a balcony that had no access to the balcony. Stinks, but it was February and snowing, so we really didn't miss out on the outdoor experience. The views from the upper-level rooms are amazing! The breakfast was excellent! We all opted to upgrade our continental breakfast to something more substantial. It was great to have that option. For an extra $5 you can have a hearty, egg breakfast with bacon and potatoes. Omelets, frittatas... Table service was very attentive, too.The hotel bar was a lot of fun. We met up with my husband's brother and his brother's wife for dinner in Little Italy. After dinner we all decided to have a drink at the hotel bar. The service was impeccable and the drinks were great. The feature that really sets this hotel apart from its competition is its staff. Everyone who works here really has a sense of ownership in the company. It feels more like a boutique hotel than a ""branded"" hotel. Hamza, the manager, went above and beyond to ensure we felt welcome in his ""home"". He, personally, made sure we knew exactly where we were going before we walked out the door.

There was an error in the arrival date which required me to wait in the hotel lobby over two hours for a resolution, 45 minutes in the morning, then 90 minutes in the afternoon. Each employee wanted to blame another person and not try to actually fix the problem. They even said that ""Wyndham made this error."" Wait, aren't you Wyndham?!?!

After I had already checked out, a local hotel staff employee emailed me to offer discounted rates, free upgrades or complimentary meals or drinks at a future visit. Too little too late.

John personally promised me that everything would be sorted out by 3pm check-in time. I returned at 4:30pm, John was gone, and I discovered that the issue was still not resolved. I was told that I needed to call Wyndham Customer Care for a new hotel assignment since Wyndham Garden was fully booked.

This was the perfect choice.It is a brand-new hotel, so everything was pristine. The lobby was nice and bright, the concierge was smiling and welcoming. The continental breakfast was sufficient, 3 pastries and a bowl of fruit. I had the queen suite for $229, and it was a god value.The negatives: 1.No king-size beds. My husband is 6'5"" and a queen is simply too small for him to get a good night's sleep.2.There is no hook in the bathroom to hang your towel. The only hook is where the robes are hanging, and that's as far away from the shower stall as you can get. Bad planning for something so simple.3.Auto wake up service didn't work.4.No ice makers on the floor. You have to go to the bar in the lobby (if they're open).5.$54/day for valet parking. This should be posted somewhere on the website (if it is, I didn't see it).6.When I called the hotel to ask about king-sized beds, they automatically transferred me to Central Reservations, where I spoke with a person who didn't have a clue about the hotel & took forever to get anything done. I was on the phone at least 1/2 hour trying make a reservation. I finally got him to disclose that he was in the Philippines! When he went to process the reservation, he received an ""error"", and wanted to start all over. I gave up and went online. Never again, never again, never again...I would have given 4-stars if I hadn't had such a bad experience on the telephone. Kinda ruined my day.","New York City, New York",9,3.0

On this occasion the booking was made by my colleague so I was a bit anxious when she told me where we were staying the only plus was I love downtown but…. Bowery!!?? I wasn’t too sure…. even on a recent stay at the James I felt it was a bit too downtown…..I can now say location was great, what a wonderful atmosphere and close to great bars, restaurants and one of a kind shopping, it is very easy to get about with plenty of taxis buzzing about who stop....... unlike trying to hail in midtown!The hotel is spotless and very comfortable with no noise problems. Shower temp and power was excellent and towels were great quality. Beds were very comfortable and a great night sleep was had!The most special part of our stay and a very important reason why I have booked my next stay there and will continue to return when staying in NYC are the staff. They are a credit to the hotel. It is very hard to find a hotel with staff like they have…. Amazing! Nothing was too much trouble and every request was fulfilled quickly…. v refreshing in NYC.

Check-in..... this was a bit of a pain, however that was nothing to do with the staff, it was to do with the company I work for making some booking errors. Staff helped as much as they could, and to compensate they upgraded my room to a suite on the 6th floor. They didn't have to do that, but I think they realised I was pretty miffed at the problems that my office had created.Room..... well I was in a suite, and it was lovely. A great size, floor to ceiling windows, separate sitting area and office space, as well as a table and high stools to look out on the view, which admittedly wasn't fantastic, but the bustling streets below were great for people watching! The only negative thing about the room was the very loud air-con. Even on the lowest fan setting it was still very noisy and I did turn it off overnight. FREE WIFI was a great plus!Food.... I ordered room service on my first night and the food was delicious, even it if was a bit of a wait (about 40 minutes), but it was worth it. There was a breakfast included in the price for the stay, but it was a very limited menu, predominantly continental style and not very filling, but there are loads of places around the hotel where a cheap and filling breakfast can be had.Location.... I love Chinatown, so close to trendy stores, great bars and eateries, as well as sight seeing must-do's like 9/11 memorial, Wall Street and Little Italy, great location.

Wyndham Garden Chinatown is the best hotel experience of them all, by far. The hotel is brand new, the staff are all excellent, (I had interactions with everyone from front desk, to bartender, to restaurant manager and servers, concierge, and housekeeping). The room was fantastic, even better with the high floor and view I requested. I told all my friends in the city to send their friends/family there when they visit, and I will be back everytime I am in NYC.The only MINOR issues I found are with the shower - while aesthetically very nice, the glass wall/partition thing doesnt extend far enough out to prevent water from spraying on the floor, and where the partition joins the wall tiling it is not sealed with caulk, so water leaks out there as well. In addition, there are no towel hooks or anything else to hang your towel on within reach of the shower.Other than that, everything was phenomenal and I look forward to staying again.","San Francisco, California",10,5.0

I am a OCD and I inspected everything even under the duster on the bottom of the bed and everywhere in the room was just perfectly clean, the bathroom is so beautiful and has such a Zen feeling.

The food for room service was delicious, as was the food as the restaurant downstairs. Also, Chinatown is right between SoHo and Lower East Side, so great restaurants/shopping were a 5-10 minute walk away. The only downside is that the hotel is on a busy intersection, so you can hear trucks, traffic and lots of honking throughout the night. However, you might be better off if you request a room higher up, like on the 15th floor. The rates were extremely reasonable ($130 for weekdays, $160 for weekends).

It was a bargain, and highly recommended. I would stay again.Pros: New construction opened in late 2012. The staff was quite friendly and helpful. The rooms and public areas are clean and modern. An example - by my early morning departure, the front steps and sidewalk had already been scrubbed – you could have eaten directly off the steps. The lighting in the room was excellent. The pillows weren’t the rigid foam block style. And there is an actual, working thermostat on the wall. The street noise (from the 11th floor) was significantly less than hotels in midtown NYC. No noise from adjacent rooms. The work desk is large, with lots of power receptacles and an ergonomic chair.Cons: My room was small, with a double bed; but there was an ok amount of space around the bed, desk and entry. OK for one, probably two, with a couple of pieces of luggage. The breakfast restaurant is in the basement – low ceiling and no windows. The included breakfast is Spartan – but you get what you pay for. Given the location, taxis are somewhat minimal, especially at rush hours.

It was an amazing room with a tv, fridge, super comfy bed, insanely clean and a really nice big bathroom with a walk-in shower etc! The aircon/heating was really good and then to top it off the staff were by far the friendliest people I met in hotels. Sure the location is a bit further away than you might like but to be honest Manhattan isn't that big and I walked everywhere anyway and a cab to like Times Square for example was only $10 and you'd have to pay a whole lot more than that per night for the same class of hotel in mid-town.

I would like to address the employees that made huge difference in making this stay memorable and would allow me to become a repeat customer to this great hotel in NYC. Kim: She went well out of her way to make our stay enjoyable and stress free. Let me tell you that I had ordered a few packages from an online retailer that stated the packages should arrive on the given days we had stayed at the hotel. However, the carrier that was used scanned the product at the wrong time making me believe it was already delivered at the Hotel. Kim noticed that I called to check on this item. She said it did not arrive and I was worried that it was just left without any communication. Kim went out of her way and called the carried to assure them that nothing was left @ Front Desk. The carrier reiterated that the package was dropped as per last communication. Kim then opened an escalation ticket with the carrier to have this properly investigated. During our time there we did run into minor problems with boiler room heat and toilette water (discolored). All this was taken care of by Kim through her resources. Kim is a great asset to this company and I hope to meet more people in the service/hospitality industry with similar traits to her. Nadia: She is a very pleasant woman that was eager to help out by any means while we had this issue with the packages. She was always willing to help out when we had any issues with our stay and was very pleasant to speak to. Massy: He is a very comforting man to speak to you about NYC. He gave us proper and safe directions to our destinations and advised us of our options while travelling throughout the day and the night. He is very knowledgeable about the surroundings of NYC. We enjoyed our talks on the daily basis and was always looking for him before each day when we depart from the hotel and return. Janice: We mostly saw Janice in our evening hours of the Hotel. She was very accomodating with all of our requests and was sympathetic to our incident with the packages that were suppose to receive. She said that Kim is on it and I am sure everythinig will be resolved shortly. I do recall that on our last nigth I wanted to get hot chocolate and she spoke to the lower café to see if they would serve it but unfortunately they didn't. She recommended that there was a Dunkin Donut nearby and it will have Hot Chocolate. Due to the time frame of 11pm , I had walked over to find it was closed. I thanked Janice for letting me know all the available options. She complimented on my Wife's ring and that showed a sense of care. Its these little things that help make a trip go over the top. ""The Kid"": Sorry, I forgot your name. He was very eager to help out and I provided him with some good advice about school. I told him that having a second language which he did, opens alot of doors for him to propser. I wished him good luck in his studies. John: I didn't meet you and I am very greatful that you allowed us to stay in Room ""1202"". It was a beautiful view and my wife enjoyed it very much. Cafeteria: The staff was prompt, structured and offered our options with a great smile on their face. Eventhough, it was free contintental breakfast with our package we never felt second rated when ordering. I would like say ""Thank You"" to all of the staff @ Wyndham Garden Chinatown for an enjoyable stay. We would be glad to come back to your place. It was unfortunate thought that the prices I got for the hotel stay were through a 3rd party vendor. Although, I went through a 3rd party, you had never made me feel that way.

I was dissatisfied with the shower in my room. The shower is beautifully done, but when I bathed, water got everywhere (the floor had about 1 inch of standing water on it all around when I was done). I mentioned this to management, who stated they were aware of the design flaw and are more than happy to dry the floor. Then they offered to change my room, which I graciously accepted. Shortly after moving rooms the staff arrived at my door with a box of chocolates and a personal apology card. This was a nice, personal touch that made a huge impression on me. This was just the beginning of their extraordinary hospitality. The staff remembered my name and face and greeted me like a friend every morning when I left for work.

The thing we didn't like too much was the breakfast. It is not that it was bad, but it was a bit too scarce for the price it was supposed to be. However, we also have to be thankful that they let us have the breakfast even though we arrived after 11am.If we go back to NY, we would probably chose Wyndham Garden Chinatown again, it's convenient and has a good value for money. :)","Mountain View, California",33,4.0

If you need to go uptown, you can easily take the Green 6 line on Canal Street (no transfers required if you don't walking a few blocks). I stayed on the 15th floor and had a wonderful view. The size of the rooms was good compared to other NY hotels I've stayed at.

The room was small, but very clean. Our shower did not have a door on it, which I found to be annoying because water was getting all over the floor, but hey, whatever. I've recommended this hotel to anyone who has been to the city before and wants to stay downtown.

I was very nervous that the pictures on the website and tripadvisor would be far better than what I would receive upon my arrival, but as I entered the room I immediately said to myself ""this is exactly what I was looking for"". My goodness the view is breathtaking. I could see not only manhattan but also part of long island city crystal clear from the room. I absolutely loved the cleanliness, the bathroom, and oh man the bed , the bed, the bed. The floor to ceiling windows really make the room. Now on the downside the entrance onto the balcony was locked, so I was unable to enjoy my room even more, but that definitely will not stop me from returning to the Wyndham.

The deco is simple, tasteful and modern. The location is perfect since it puts me in the middle of Chinatown and I can eat at all my favorite places. I took the Lucky Star bus from Boston to NYC. The bus stop is in the same block as the hotel so I felt completely safe wandering the few steps to the hotel despite the midnight arrival time.Here are some negative factors we encounter. I would mention them in case they help other travelers: 1) When I booked the room, I saw that rollaway bed is available. But when I checked in, I was told that cannot be done in a room with two double beds. Would have been nice if the website clearly mentions that. 2) This hotel charges more for a room with two beds but only give you two vouchers for the continental breakfast. That is a rather odd practice and inconvenient for a family of 4. We gave the restaurant a try. It was way over-priced and the food was below average. Considering the Chinatown location, if the hotel doesn't provide you with enough vouchers, you're better off eating elsewhere.3) The hotel directory suggests there is an ice machine on the 3rd & 5th floor but the hotel is so new; the ice machines have not even been installed. I saw an opening that is not sound proof in the narrow hallway. I hope that's not where the ice machine would go since that would be too noisy. But then again, the hallway is so narrow; I can't see where one would put an ice machine without the noise.4) The bathtub is designed with a very short splash glass, no shower curtain. When you take a shower, the entire bathroom gets quite wet. Remember not to bring your dry clothes in. I also wonder if the hotel could keep mildew from developing on the bathroom tiles since it gets surprisingly wet in there.5) The hotel is located on 93 Bowery Street. One night, I asked the front desk if I should go left or right if I want to head toward 70 Bowery, the two guys at the front desk didn't know. I was surprised. The front desk staff should really know the neighborhood better. Mgmt please give them a map and train them to assist tourist.6) If you are afraid of rats, you will want to use the Bowery Street entrance and avoid taking Christie Street at night. Since we arrived in Chinatown at midnight and took the shortest path from Lucky Star bus stop to the hotel, it means we took Christie Street. At night, NYC has some of the largest rats roaming around. With all the garbage piled on Christie Street, we saw rats as large as a small dog running around. In fact, my kids thought they were cats at first.All in all, the rate at this hotel is reasonable for now, especially for single rooms. I question the double rate since it doesn't provide enough breakfast voucher for a max of 4 participants. I would stay here again if the rate is right because of its location. But next time, I would know its shortcomings and make my decision accordingly.","Boston, Massachusetts",78,4.0

Also, although we were on a low floor, the floor to ceiling windows were great and offered a nice view of the city. The electronic safe in the room was pretty sweet too. The bathroom was kind of small but was adequate. We would have liked a little more counterspace by the sink, but it's not a big deal.We had the free continental breakfast, which was in the hotel's restaurant, once and it wasn't that great. The yogurt and muffin were kind of weird, so we'd recommend you just get the toast and fruit. Or just find one of the many bakeries or restaurants located in the city for breakfast/brunch.

The night we checked in the pretty young gal said, ""oh, we just ran out of queen beds."" So i said, ""oh does that mean we get a King bed"" which is what I thought we paid for. She then said, ""i'll put you on 15"" and I said, ""is that a better room?"" She said, ""its a higher floor, better views."" I did not realize a higher floor meant my husband and I would be stuck in the worlds smallest full sized bed. Seriously, its a good thing we're not the tallest people. What bugs me is she looked me right in the eye and did not answer my question regarding the bed. Did she think we wouldn't notice the tiny bed? Its just poor business to lie to your customers. And by not answering my question, yes, she lied...The hotel itself is in a great location for urban travelers. We were going to a concert at the Barclay Center so the location was ideal. It was one subway stop from the the hotel to the concert. Also it was only 3 subway stops from Amtrak to the hotel. I'd say its a five minute walk to the subway from the hotel. Be prepared its mobbed on the sidewalks regardless of the time of day.Also, you are right in the middle of Chinatown, a short walk to the Village and the Lower East Side. Oh and Little Italy, but that is such a turnoff thanks to the desperate restaurant employees trying to get you to eat in their restaurants. The free WIFI is a great bonus. However, the 'free breakfast' is laughable. First of all, its not free, its worked into your price for the room. But as others noted, its not serve yourself but a sit down restaurant where your breakfast coupon really only covers the Continental breakfast yet they give you a menu to choose from. So what happens is if you order something other than the continental breakfast you have to pay the difference. That being said, if i'm paying additional for my breakfast I'll go elsewhere it was average at best...I'd rather my $10 back please. Overall its a nice hotel, very clean and new...",Boston,6,4.0

Our original plans were to stay in NJ and ride PATH, but Sandy wrecked the station and we had to 'punt'. We came across a new property in Chinatown, a block from Little Italy. AWESOME location (Canal & Bowery, just off the Manhattan Bridge) with two subway stations within a short walk. We arrived late (weather delays at Newark) and the staff greeted us with a very warm welcome at 1:30 AM! The hotel had arranged a car service at the airport that WAITED for our delayed flight. How wonderful it was to have a ride waiting after a long day of airport lounging & weather jitters.First off, the hospitality at the hotel was infectious. From the GM to housekeeping to front desk, everyone working there acted like it was their house and we were their guests. I don't think that's the norm in big cities. Our room (1502) was breathtaking. 15th floor, corner-room with glass walls on two sides. Front view was the Empire State Building and the Crysler Building. Side view was the Freedom Tower at the WTC site. The rooms were very nice...not huge, but certainly not small. Also VERY clean, but the hotel is only a few months old. I am betting the property stays clean and attractive for years to come. The room rate was very reasonable and did include a breakfast voucher that covered the Continental breakfast or could be applied to another choice. (REMEMBER to tip your wait crew based on the voucher totals, not your balance due.) All of the staff feels an 'ownership' for the property. They all want your visit at their place to be the best ever. Wow, that is refreshing.The security at the hotel was very visible, yet I didn't see an obvious need for it. We walked to restaurants in the neighborhoods regularly at late hours and never had an issue. Doesn't mean we would never have trouble, just didn't during the week we were there.In all, the best thing I can remember is the dedicated staff that really did make you feel at home. The hotel was fantastic, spotless and new, but even if it wasn't, the warm, friendly employees would make up the shortfall. Special thanks to James at the front, the concierge and to Tom the GM. Those are only a few of the folks that made our vacation one of the most memorable trips we've ever been on. We WILL return and WILL stay at this property - NO DOUBT!","Springfield, Missouri",83,5.0

This is a new hotel, expectedly clean and fresh looking, but also features thoughtful design. The rooms are small, however they don’t feel cramped thanks to the floor-to-ceiling windows and reasonably-sized bathroom. We slept great - despite its bustling Chinatown surroundings, the room was very quiet with a comfy bed. The staff were eager to please and helped point us in the right direction for our touring. We also loved the location. The two subway lines going to upper east and upper west are within a 5-10 minute walk. We had two fantastic meals just steps away in lower east side.","Beijing, China",5,5.0

The concierge staff has been wonderful with advice on where to go, when to go and not to go. The best advice was to get the express pass for the Empire State Building.

Best bang for the buck in all of Manhattan. Service: The staff is amazingly pleasant. From Janice and Kim at the front desk, to Jennifer and Danna hosting the bar area. Friendly and prompt to every request and need. Location: For business and pleasure, you have access to all of NYC! I have been working in Brooklyn, Staten Island and Manhattan.

We had vouchers which can be used towards another meal of your liking. The Egg benedicts was really good! The rooms are small but is made up for with the views and how well kept and comfortable it is. The shower is great being a walk-in and the maid service was really on spot with a paper every morning and the whole room made nice. Even the phone charger was coiled every day!

So, we're in Chinatown, which I personally like culturally-speaking..feel pretty safe there too at any time of day. The hotel is extremely good value at just over $200 per night including continental breakfast. Here are some of the things that I found on arrival:1. Iron in the room with a loose (non-attached) ironing board (= hra)2. Lots of sockets around the bed3. GREAT view4. Very clean and plenty of space5. Complimentary still and sparkling waterI had a very comfortable night's sleep; I got in late and front desk was able to give me a small tube of toothpaste = nice.In the morning, I had a very good shower..one of those showers with just the right force from the nozzle and easy to work the dial temperature-wise. Lovely. I also saw that the height between the floor and the bath is very small (I'd say 9""), which means that it isn't in any way dangerous to step in and out; found that impressive. I had a shave in a sink which was very cleverly designed - it is noticeably deep, which means that you can't really splash the water. Small details these are, but for a regular traveller, they stand out.Unfortunately, for me, I tried to cap off my stay with the breakfast in the cellar. Oh dear. No jasmine tea in the middle of Chinatown is forgivable, but the eggs were v v greasy and over-cooked; small amounts of tasteless ham and warm soft toast. I don't usually eat breakfast in the hotel, but I was so surprised by the quality of everything else, that I took the chance. Mistake.But otherwise, Wyndham Gardens, take a bow...",Dublin,95,4.0

Best room I ever stayed in at Manhattan for less than 270 dollars. Brand new and friendly. There was no breakfast as the hotel just reopened but I'm sure they will add it. Extremely recommended.I'm an international traveler that spends a week out of my home country each month for customer meetings and conferences. An hour before my flight from Salt Lake City to JFK I still didn't know if I'll have meetings in NYC or NJ so I kept waiting and then booked in the very last minute. I was quite surprised to see that the prices for 3 starred hotels anywhere in Manhatten were all in the high 300s and every hotel I picked was fully booked, including anything in NJ except the airports. After twenty minutes I came to the conclusion that all of the reasonably priced and starred hotels in both Manhattan and Newark area had zero vacancies, perhaps because of the recent Hurricane Sandy, and at some point I came across this hotel in Chinatown. It was 269 dollars which was about 100 to 150 lower than anything else that I saw, plus it was the first hotel out of two dozens I checked that was actually available. Bookings.com said seven people are viewing the room right now and I decided to chance it.I got there at midnight. Chinatown is a dark place at nights but the hotel was glowing with light and inviting. The staff welcomed me and the checking process was extremely fast. I was told that my room is brand new and in fact I will be the first guest ever in it. Since there was no breakfast the clerk said she'll deduct 20 dollars from my fee which I found to extremely nice.I went to the room on the eleventh floor and my jaw dropped as soon as I entered. It was beautiful. A huge bathroom, sparkling clean and nicely decorated; a lovely king side bed; amazing night skyline from a wide window, plasma TV, compact closet, well designed division between bath area and the bedroom using smoked glass and wooden tiles, powerful air conditioning and a useful desk with lots of electricity plugs for the iDevice challenged. Overall it was pretty amazing and I felt lucky.Summary: just take it.","Tel Aviv, Israel",23,5.0
