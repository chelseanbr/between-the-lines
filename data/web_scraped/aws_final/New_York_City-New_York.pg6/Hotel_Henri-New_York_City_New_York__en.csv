Rooms were a bit small and housekeeping could do a lot better but the staff made it a fun stay. Courtney at the front desk was really sweet. One night me and my girl were on our way back in from a night out and walking past the front desk there was a strong smell of marijuana which is legalized where I live. I decided to ask Courtney if she knew where I can get some for myself and she was nice enough to sell me some of her own then she even called a dealer to come to the hotel personally which I thought was really nice. All together I enjoyed my stay at this hotel despite the poor housekeeping the fact that I was I was able to get pot right from the front desk made it all better.

We were here in a very cold winter night so that was a plus. Melanie at the front desk during check-in answered every single question we had. She even went to the subway station with us to show us which one was downtown and which one was uptown. That was absolutely magical because we have gotten lost trying to find the downtown train. When leaving Melanie gave us step by step directions to get to the JFK using the AirTrain !!!!! This hotel is small and private not a big branch but it is absolutely perfect.

The bedding - when clean - was very comfortable. Had it not been after midnight, we would have contacted housekeeping right away. After reporting this to front desk the next morning, they changed us to a different room on a higher floor. This was also due to how loud our previous room was. We live in a city and frequent NYC - not typically annoyed by noise. It is a boutique hotel; however, you can barely get close hung in the small closet. No drawers. Extremely small shower stall. Thankfully, we are average sized; but a lrge person would have problems. Lastly, there was black mold in the corner of ceiling near the window.

He even called our room to check-in and make sure that all was well.

Our trip started out badly when my 11-year old son and I arrived at the hotel after a long day of cross-country travel to learn that the room we booked (deluxe two doubles) had been given to someone else. Courtney was very apologetic and did what she could to make it right, including free breakfast and offering to move us to our desired room midway through our 4-night stay. With Ess-a-Bagels around the corner we weren't going to be eating breakfast at the hotel, but I appreciated the gesture. She also offered us a free room service dinner which we didn't take advantage of because we'd already secured reservations for dinner each night of our trip, but again the gesture was appreciated. Courtney was the highlight of this place.We woke up the next morning at 9 am EST (which felt like 6 am to us) to someone knocking loudly on our door. It was someone from the hotel asking if they were going to move us the next day. I was confused, woken out of a sound sleep, and told them yes that we would be moved. Then she left. We didn't fall back to sleep. I thought it was odd that we didn't receive any housekeeping at all this day.That afternoon my son and I were relaxing in the room when the scent of cigarette smoke filled our room, despite it being a smoke-free hotel. We literally had to leave the room because we both got headaches. I called the front desk and they said they'd try to take care of it. The smell came and went for the next day.That night, New Year's Eve night, our next-door neighbors threw a party to end the decade. I had to call the front desk two times in the middle of the night to ask them to have our neighbors turn down their music. I finally fell asleep at 6:30 am, exhausted and frustrated by the hotel's inability to enforce policies. New Years Day we were out for the day. I got a call from the hotel at about 11 am and they said that we hadn't packed our things to be moved. I was confused as we hadn't been told what time we'd be moved and didn't realize we had to prepare for that. Ultimately I told them we'd just stay in the room, as long as the next-door neighbors (partiers) had left. It was all such a hassle and the lack of communication from the hotel was really apparent. I asked why our room hadn't been cleaned the day before and she told us that if anything is left on the bed they won't clean the room. Good to know?On the morning of Jan 2nd we were getting ready for the day when I heard someone's voice out in the hallway. They proceeded to OPEN OUR DOOR and the man walked halfway in before leaving, startled, saying he was there to check the minibar. Excuse me?Hotel Henri was far from what we needed it to be: relaxing, comfortable, a good home-base for our NYC travels. Beware! This hotel is none of those things.","Seattle, Washington",27,1.0

Came back to my room at 10:30pm and it was cold. Turned the heat up but after a few minutes realized i had no heat. It was cold! Called the desk and someone came up around 11pm and tried to lie to me that I didn’t have the thermostat turned high enough. I told him I knew better. He took the HVAC unit apart, asked if he could use my corkscrew since he didn’t have a screwdriver and he proceeded to do something that gave me hot air. Two days later i filled out something like a review where I said I’m the shower was leaking on the floor and mentioned the heat had been off when I arrived but that it had been fixed. They entered my room even though I HAD A DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door. Management hasn’t read that I had said the heater was fixed (they later admitted they hadn’t read it) and this guy made it where the heat wouldn’t turn off so it was 80 when I got back. This guy also tried to fix the shower leak and took my towels, threw them on the floor, put his dirty shoes on the towels and dragged them around On the floor then just left them with the dirt from his shoes on them. Unreal! ai at 10:30pm i have to wait for someone to come fix the unit that didn’t need fixing. It took him about 15 minutes to fix it once he got there. he apologized for coming into my room with a DND sign on the door but said the GM told him to ignore it. I asked him why he had Left the dirty towels on my floors and he said he left them for housekeeping to get. So that was a lie because my DND sign tells them not to come in. So at 11pm+ at night I’m having to deal with this crap. Another guy finally brought more towels. So 2 out of 4 nights I stayed I was up at 11pm+ dealing with this. And they didn’t even offer me a complimentary breakfast or say they were sorry. Nothing! I had friends staying in another room And they were treated with total disrespect, too.

The bed was the comfiest hotel bed we have stayed in, the location is perfect. (Far enough away form the hustle and bustle of time square, but still in walking distance to all the main places.)

The company he was working with was to pay the hotel and sent a credit card authorization form. When he checked in they “couldn’t find” the credit card authorization form and wouldn’t let him check in he had to wait until 4 am to check into the hotel when the UK office of the company was open to resend. At 4 am the night person working was very rude and didn’t want to let us check in cause we would have to leave soon anyways - yeah we know that! The room was rundown and the bed was very old and squeaky and uncomfortable. The took $100 for incidentals on personal card which is fine. After checkout they started trying to charge our card another $114 to cover the rest of the accommodation cost even though they had the CC auth. We called and they said they would fix it and the security hold would be returned. Again they tried to charge the card at 4 PM the next day and this time said it was because they lost the credit card authorization form but somehow found it again. 2 days later they were still trying to charge the incorrect card for the remaining payment and we had to keep repeatedly calling them and waiting on extremely long holds to have it fixed.,,0,1.0

There is so much I want to say so I thought it would be easier to break it down into sections. Location...On 24w Street this hotel is perfectly located to walk almost everywhere, which we did. We decided to travel to the hotel on public transport from the airport, although easy, it was a bit of a hassle with more than hand luggage. HotelI must admit, when I walked in I was surprised at how small the reception area was. The pictures on the website gives the impression of a much bigger reception. This wasn't a problem, just took me back a little. When we went to check in with the receptionist, she seemed a little preoccupied with a personal phone call but did welcome us. When she had finished the call she had noted on the computer that it was out wedding get away and congratulated us. Which was a nice touch. The hotel itself is lovely. I was very happy with the choice, however I do agree with some of the comments that it could do with some TLC. Just a lick of paint would be enough, where the maids had hit walls with trollies etc. No issues, just noticeable for a 4 star hotel.Rooms...The room was lovely. Having been to New York a number of times I know that rooms are not massive. But the room we were given (1401) was perfect for 2 of us. Large comfortable bed, climate control, flat screen TV, safe, free bottles water and coffee machine. The bathroom was beautiful and large. Power shower and plenty of room. Turndown service was regular and to a good standard. We were on the 14th floor which really helped as we didn't hear any noise from the road below which is great for New York as it meant we had a great night sleep every night.Also, we were welcomed with a bottle of champagne and a wedding card to Mr and Mrs … which made us laugh as a gay couple, but it was a lovely gesture and the champagne was enjoyed. Staff...I have to give a massive shout out to Bernie in the hotel lobby bar. He was the star of our stay. We popped in for one drink on the first night and ended up going in every night just to see Bernie and hear one of his hilarious stories. He is a credit to the hotel and definitely someone we will never forget. I know our paths will cross again in the future. Also a shout out to the 2 Carlos's especially the one from Puerto Rico who's sense humour made us laugh!All reception staff were friendly and helpful and could not do enough to make our staff perfect. Just a few points for improvement...One of the reasons we booked this hotel was the free happy hour vodka in reception. We never saw this once. Maybe a note to advise when it will be offered so customers know. There was only hot water and hot chocolate in reception. Although this is a nice touch, it would be a lovely gesture to also offer coffee, especially on the cold days.Overall...The hotel is perfect. One of the best we have stayed in New York. We didn't try the roof top bar as we enjoyed our time with Bernie in the lobby bar. We also didn't try any of the food as there are plenty of restaurants around, but from what I saw the good looked and smelt delicious.We will definitely be coming back to stay and we never stay in the same hotel. Although I have pointed out some improvements, these are no way negatives. I would highly recommend this hotel and I know you won't be disappointed.Thank you Hotel Henri! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","London, United Kingdom",19,5.0

If you go one block in either direction you can catch basically any subway line. The hotel has a great restaurant on the lobby level and an amazing lounge on the roof level. There are so many great restaurants within walking distance that we wished we had more time to experience all of them. The greatest part of our getaway came as a surprise. When we were checking in the manager was at the desk and heard us talk about it being our anniversary and that was the reason for our visit. The next day when we were out exploring the city the hotel had placed a bottle of champagne along with a hand written card that wished us a happy anniversary. This was so unexpected and it really showed us that the staff really cares about their guests and that they also listen and are not robotic fake. On our last day at the hotel we asked for a car to be arranged to the airport and to our surprise they had a luxury vehicle waiting for us for the same price we paid a yellow taxi to get there. We had to ask who the manager was who made sure to make our stay special and they said his name was James. So we have to say thank you so much James.

I stayed for 5 nights, it never got better. The bed was squeaky and way too soft, bedding very basic. The staff are unfriendly, they almost seem bothered by having to work, especially the tall waitress in the restaurant who (from my experience) covers the breakfast shift. Every morning I waited at least 15-20 min for the kitchen to toast a bagel and boil an egg-there were only a max of 4 guests at a time. Really?? When I checked in I found rotted milk and carrots in my mini-fridge that must have been there at least a week. The bathroom fan is so loud I could not hear my phone ring. The fan runs while the lights are on, so constantly. The air con was equally noisy, I had to buy earplugs to sleep. The rooftop bar seemed a good idea, I think it’s ran separately. Always quiet which is good since it’s tiny and the only outside space is a narrow walkway with rickety bar stools. The outside restaurant area (called Rodos) at the front of hotel is quaint, but sadly served by the slow kitchen and unfriendly waitstaff. For the price, I would Highly recommend staying elsewhere.

I was a little concerned having read lots of reviews that said that the hotel wasn't very clean, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not as pristine as you might expect, but it certainly didn't feel shabby or dirty, just ""well used"", which is a good sign because people want to stay there!We had a superior room and were pleased with the size of the bed and the bathroom. There isn't much storage in the room...we hung a few things up but mostly lived out of the suitcase because there were no drawers or shelves to put clothes. There was a useful stand to put the case on, and a large full length mirror. The safe was great...the lid lifts up so it's easy to fit tablets and laptops in.The room was clean, where it mattered. There was an empty pizza box out on the balcony so I don't think the cleaners are the most thorough, but the bed was fresh, the floors were clean and the bathroom was immaculate. Plenty of towels, which were replaced every day, and the shower was amazing! The water and coffee were also plentiful, and we were encouraged to take water out for the day with us as well as having it in our room, which we thought was very generous. The city maps available in reception were the best ones we found. Don't bother buying a tourist map before you go...these freebie ones are brilliant!The location of the hotel is the best feature by far. We couldn't believe how close we were to everything and how easy it was to take the subway when we wanted to go further afield. For that alone, I'd recommend this hotel a million times. We had excellent drinks in Bo's and the Taqueria opposite the hotel, and the Tappo pizza next door was expensive but very tasty and lovely service. 230 Fifth rooftop bar had wonderful views of the Empire State Building and plenty of space to sit outside in the evening sunshine. Eataly had a beautiful rooftop bar as well, so we didn't use the rooftop bar in the hotel because there were so many great places elsewhere!The service from the staff was lovely. Yaya and Joaquin couldn't have been more helpful and friendly and we would like to thank them personally for such a great experience.Overall a great stay in a top location for a very reasonable price.",,1,4.0

It’s easy to get anywhere you want to go because it’s close to the 23rd St station at 6th Ave and the 23rd St station at Broadway. At the end of the street is Madison Square Park which is a nice hangout with a view of the Flatiron Building. The neighborhood has tons of excellent restaurant choices within a 5 minute walk. The room itself was small and basic, but modern and very reasonably priced compared to other places in the neighborhood. My room 704 was clean except for the dust on the window blinds. I was traveling solo which was a good thing because my husband and I would have difficulty sharing this Deluxe King room. The closet cabinet was sort of a joke, because it’s not deep enough for hangers. Because of the sliding doors on the closet you can only hang clothes on one side. Thankfully this problem was solved by a huge amount of hooks on the wall. The letters on the wall that say SHOW TIME can all be used as hooks. And there are multiple hooks in the bathroom. One of my biggest complaints about almost all hotel rooms is why can’t they have more hooks? So I was pretty delighted by the hook situation here. One more critique is the lighting in the bath is not bright enough to do makeup. But there is a floor lamp near the desk with very bright bulbs so I sat facing this light with my travel mirror to do my makeup. The vanity in the bath is small but I liked how there is a ledge above the vanity where you can line up all your toiletries. My mattress was kind of creaky and squeaky, could probably be replaced.

The only loud noises were the BOOMS when other guests would shut their doors, so if the hotel would suggest for guests to shut their doors gently but securely as a courtesy to other guests, that would completely eliminate the noise disturbance. My room was COOL when I arrived, as the AC had been running, and CLEAN. So important to not find other people's hair in the bathroom, etc., so Kudos to the Housekeeping Staff! The only minor bummers were: no shower cap; no shower gel -- bar soap just isn't my thing; and the shower did leak and to form a puddle along the doorway. I was just careful stepping onto the marble floor and after drying off, I laid down the towels to soak up the puddle.

At check-in I was given two complimentary drink tokens, (that I didn't use,) as they were going to have a rooftop happy hour, (I slept through it!) and in the lobby they had two ice cold dispensers of complimentary lemonade and ice tea with vodka and another bottle of booze, which surprised me, lol! But hey, it's Manhattan, so that made sense. I loved the lemonade. Anyway, the positives vastly outweighed any negatives and I highly recommend Hotel Henri! ","Marin County, California",2,5.0

The location can not be beat. Eataly at the end of the block, Tacombi & Bo’s Kitchen across the street, Tappo Thin Crust Pizza & Chop House out the door to the right, Trattoria Italienne and Junoon to the left, a Greek restaurant in the lobby, & drinks on the roof. There’s even a Starbucks on the corner if you’re in need of a mediocre coffee. Just around the corner from the 23rd Street/7th Avenue Subway Station to easily get you uptown and down. The hotel is in the heart of the Chelsea/NoMad area and is convenient to everything. Rooms were typical small but quirky NY hotel rooms with modern decor & updated bathrooms. Unlike other reviews, the A/C in our room did a great job in cooling our room, which was a stark contrast to the excessive heat outside. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff were warm & friendly, made small talk, greeted us each time we came in and out. No one was unpleasant. Little touches like the hydration station in the lobby (with an occasional bottle of vodka & tequila thrown in to add to your lemonade or iced tea) were much appreciated. My husband and I were standing outside melting in the heat while we consulted our map, and Antonio ran outside with cold bottles of water for us. For the low price we paid for the room, the service was exemplary. A few minor things in the room (outlets that needed tightening to the wall, chipped paint) & a slow elevator did nothing to take away from an overall great experience.

Coming in from a full day of travel and getting checked in quickly with courtesy is always uplifting.

It has just lost it’s affiliation to Wyndham. I booked on the American website and went for the higher rate as I had read the reviews which spoke about the small rooms. First, the good things: very responsive staff ( our room was changed when we told the staff the bed sagged), great location, plenty of good restaurants close by, wonderful neighborhood. We booked because of price which was a good rate. Things to consider when booking: be aware that all the rooms are the same no matter the price(we booked a deluxe king and did not receive all the listed amenities and the size of the room was no larger than the « standard » room-but there are 3 balcony rooms), beds are not great, passable but not great, very little breakfast options in the hotel, cleaning was not adéquate ( our trash cans were not emptied but the beds were made), no drawers for clothes storage, closet very narrow, so much so that coat hangers had to be turned on an angle to close the door.","Winston Salem, NC",11,3.0

I know that hotel rooms in NYC, especially boutique hotels, are shoe boxes. so I got a deluxe (read: normal) hotel room for my mom, and a PREMIERE deluxe (read: larger, with private balcony, higher floor) for myself and my wife. I reserved this directly from the hotel website, not from a 3rd party travel site. I have a confirmation email with both rooms, showing one being 50 dollars a night more than the other, and laying out clearly that one is premiere and bigger with a balcony. I go to check in, and the desk clerk claims her system doesn't show a room upgrade. it sure shows that I am paying more for one room though. The unhelpful clerk acts as if I'm bothering her that they aren't honoring my reservation. Pretend you reserved a fancy dinner at a patio table for six, 3 months in advance, and when you get to the restaurant, the host doesn't understand why you are upset that they've reserved you a two top by the bathroom. So after pulling teeth, the desk clerk agrees to at least credit me the difference since I am overpaying now for a normal room. guess what? it's now 3 days after I've checked out, and there is no credit on my card for the difference. Add to this that the rooms are on floor 9-17 and one of two elevators was out of service all weekend, with 10 plus minute waits for the one working elevator. at least we walked off our dinners by climbing up and down 9 flights of stairs. This place is pretending to be much nicer than it is, there are plenty of boutique hotels in NYC that actually honor their own reservations and don't act like the customer is the problem when it is clearly them.

I was told that I had booked a double bed. Luckily, I was able to pull up my copy of the reservation that clearly stated I had booked a king. They changed my reservation and I was given a room on the 12th floor. I asked about breakfast for two but this wasn't acknowledged. I figured that I just had to show my key but stopped by the front desk to confirm later that evening. Once again, the front desk had no record of the package. I had to pull up my confirmation that clearly stated I had breakfast for two included. Only then did I receive a complementary continental breakfast pass.

There were two double beds in the room. Normally a Wyndham Hotel has 5 foot doubles but these were only 4 foot 6, so a bit of a squash compared with what we're used to, but OK. Very comfy beds and pillows, anyway. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was excellent. Communication with the hotel beforehand was difficult, as I emailed to make an enquiry and a Dayhana Cobles eventually replied but only answered half the query, then when I wrote to her again, I never got a reply at all. Other people I know who have stayed here have said the same thing, that email contact beforehand is very poor. I had informed Dayhana that it was my daughter's 21st, so I was hoping there would be a 'happy birthday' for her when we arrived, but there wasn't. Half way through our stay, they wrote to us asking how it was going, so I said I was disappointed about the birthday being ignored and that evening a bottle of cava in a bucket of ice was left in our room. Unfortunately we got back quite late and all the ice had melted, plus we weren't quite sure it was for us and not a mistake, but the thought was there! The one down side about the hotel was there was a grid outside over a drain which was loose. I noticed it the first day but assumed they would fix it but the next day I managed to step out of a taxi and walk onto it so that it tipped up and I had quite a bad fall onto my knee. The staff were helpful and brought me some ice for my knee and they asked if they could call an ambulance. The receptionist asked me about it every time I went by after that, so they were caring about it, although I couldn't help thinking it was because they were worried I might sue! Hopefully they will now get the grate fixed in place properly.

But back to the puke in the elevator--we stayed over a weekend, and the rooftop bar (not anything special) is apparently a haven for 20-somethings from the suburbs--which is not conducive to a small hotel vibe. We returned from a night out at 1:30 am, and one of the 2 elevators was out. Not a problem, if you're only serving hotel rooms, but there's the rooftop bar to deal with. So the elevator is super slow, and when it finally gets to the ground floor, it opens up, and a load full of inebriated college kids comes out, and it stinks in there, because someone puked. The hotel staff quickly mopped it up, but with no other elevator option, that was not the most enjoyable way to finish an evening.

He apologized for our poor prior experiences at other hotels but said he would do his best to make sure things were good here. He then spent a few minutes talking about the new restaurant and a michilin star restaurant nearby when I asked for food recommendations. I am happy to say that our experience at Hotel Henri was the compete opposite. When we got to the room we received a small upgrade due to being max status. In our room was a bottle of champagne. The room was clean and well maintained. It also had all the little extras you might need like tooth paste, a sewing kit, makeup removers etc. The only negative about the room was you could hear peoples doors and talking when they were in the hallway.In the evening they had fireball whiskey, rum, cider, and hot chocolate for guests for no additional cost.

We did not have to ask for anything at any time. The bellpersons I would also like to throw a shoutout too as they brought in and out over 30 bags for us as we had done a lot of shopping. Pro tip: You can find free parking on the weekend by going where TWo Brothers Pizza is and parking on that area. Most of the parking restrictions are removed for Saturday and Sundays. Just read the signs carefully. We ended up saving about 50 bucks for parking this way. Otherwise use Spothero to save a bit of cash.",,17,5.0

Upon check in we waited close to 10 minutes for a front desk staff member, the door man kept us company and was a great guy. The front desk lady finally came and was friendly enough and professional. She told us we could select pretty much any floor we wanted, however she did not bother to tell us that their would be a party until 3am on the Saturday night at the bar. Had she done so we obviously wouldn't of selected the 17th floor which is right below the bar. I have a recording of it on my phone and it legitimately sounds like we are playing music from a speaker in our room until 3am. The door man felt bad for us and said we should call and try to switch rooms, however the front desk informed us all rooms were occupied and that all they could do for us was bring ear plugs. The doorman said that someone should of told us about this at check in because they have known for atleast a week about the party. We also planned on using our 2 complimentary drink tickets on the Saturday night, however due to the private party in the bar we were not able to even use them on the Saturday night. Again something you think the staff would inform us about at check in. The kitchen is under renovation so you cannot get any food, which is something that wasn't told to us until we asked how late room service goes, once again something that should be told to you upfront. The elevator situation which already had some serious issues became even worse when 1 out of the 2 broke down completely on the Sunday. And lastly I dunno how you are promoting a continental breakfast package but in reality its just muffins and danishes, 0 warm food such as eggs, bacon etc and the coffee and hot water were both empty at 9am when I was there because the poor women running it has to go all the way to the main floor to refill everything (18 floors down). 1 positive is the the cleaning staff and door staff were amazing and the rooms are actually nice.

Dyhana was the first person we encountered and she couldn't have been nicer or more welcoming to us. After making an emergency landing in Newark, NJ flying in (thanks a lot Delta) and dealing with extremely rude Delta staff when trying to figure out a ride to our hotel, we were very pleased to find a friendly person like her at the front desk. Dyhana made us quickly forget about this disastrous experience and put us at ease from the moment we walked in. Delta could learn a thing or two from Hotel Henri. The hotel provided complimentary hot chocolate and apple cider in the lobby along with vodka and fireball to give it an extra New York kick. Our bellhop Danny was funny and very welcoming. We interacted with most of the staff during our week long stay and they all exhibited the same high level of professionalism. No matter what time of day, there was someone at the front desk greeting us and wishing us a nice day when we walked through the lobby.Our room had all the amenities we needed for the week given that we were out on the town most of the day. The only thing it lacked was a refrigerator for the food that we came home with. Water was provided to us on a daily basis and housekeeping staff was not hard to find at any hour of the day. Halfway through our trip, we requested to be moved to a balcony room and the hotel happily obliged. There were only two aspects of our stay which were not perfect. One of them being the thinness of the walls. We could hear doors slamming in the hallway (which was very tiny) as early as 6:30 in the morning. We were unable to sleep in any day due to this. We brought this to the attention of the staff and they told us they would be addressing this as they sought to continue to improve their guest experience. The hotel's lobby restaurant was also undergoing renovations and the daily morning ""breakfast"" was moved up to the rooftop bar. Our stay included breakfast each day but others were charged $10 per person for coffee, juice, donuts, pastries, frosted flakes, and bananas. Perhaps things are different in New York but I would not have paid $10 for this breakfast spread and we witnessed many patrons who were disappointed at the options once they arrived at the rooftop.

We spoke to Nathalee who was courteous, professional, and expertly made us feel like we were her only customer. Our first call with Nathalee was to confirm whether there would be a room available to check into early. She said that the hotel was sold out the previous night but she would keep an eye on things, and we should call back when we arrived into town. We called upon arrival and Nathalee said that we should some to the hotel as soon as possible because there was only one room, and she would hold it for us.With respect to the overall experience, the hotel is clean and has a modern feel. The rooms were spacious, which was a pleasant surprise given that this is a small hotel with seventeen floors and only eight rooms to a floor. The location is central and near the 23rd and Broadway subway station which makes getting around town quite easy. There were a number of amenities that add a fun touch. Among them, the cider and hot chocolate were our favorites. Overall, I feel we received excellent value for money.

Moreover, even after I have requested to not have anybody entering the room, later the same cleaner knocked at my door announcing the room service. Luckily I was in the room and I could decline the service.Because of the incident, I had to visit twice the police station during my vacation and until now I haven't received any contact from the insurance company of the hotel. Another unpleasant situation occurred with the room service: one morning the cleaner entered the room at 7 am to do the cleaning because she received the information that the room was empty. My boyfriend and I were awfully frightened by the loud noise of having someone entering the room in a way we couldn't sleep anymore on a day that both of us had a wedding ceremony that would occupy all the day of ours. I'm sure Wyndham knows the user experience is the key to success of any business and I can guarantee you that mine and my boyfriends' were terrible. I have imagined that Wyndham would grant us any offer to mitigate all the incidents that occurred and had been reported during the stay, but on the contrary, by the time of our check-out, I have realized that final prices were incorrectly and a little higher surcharge, if compared to the price that I previously booked (last unpleasant surprise after 9 days of stay).","Bologna, Italy",0,1.0

But when you pay for a 4-star hotel, even if in a lower range of them, you expect something much better than what Hotel Henri offers. The location is definitely great, but that's about it about this property. The breakfast is just a joke. Cleaning service must hace skip our room for a couple of days (no vacuum cleaning at all during 4 days, and shower mat and a towel were removed from our room one day before departure). The ventilation in the bath room makes you feel you're still in the plane that brought you to NYC, and the one next to your room door, in the hallway, is at least as noisy (and this one never stops... 24h a day!). Don't choose a room to high up in the building because you'll be using the stairways a lot (the lifts are so slow that they could as well be manually operated). The staff at reception is extremely nice, though. And that was really appreciated.

I was greeted by the associate at the front desk who was really welcoming, but the room was not ready even though I called to request a room early. The decor for the hotel seemed dingy and dark I guess ok for those who like that, many cigarette butts outside near the restaurant. As I waited for my room I realized 2 other hotel guest check in, did the hotel staff forget about my room? I asked again, and “Oh” yea the room was ready. After checking in I was handed keys to my room, as I waited for the elevator I overheard the front desk associate get reprimanded by management?? I think something like that should be done behind closed doors. My room was perfect, tiny but perfect, we faced another building in the back so we had no view, but who wants to stay in their room in NYC. Fast forward to our check out Saturday morning, my girlfriend and I party hard the previous night and just wanted to have breakfast and go home and maybe an aspirin. The front desk manager Sandy, insisted that we post a review about our stay even offered drink vouchers for their bar. As if that is what we wanted to hear after a long night out.

Checkin/out: Fast, efficient and friendly. Can’t fault in any way. Now onto the fees. The Henri charges a facility fee on top of the nightly rate and this is one of the reasons for the 4-star. I honestly can’t remember if this was shown at the time of booking, but either way, it’s a deceptive fee used by hotels to be able to lower the headline nightly rate. This old school practice is slowly disappearing but just make sure you factor this in as it’s still charged by the Henri.Room: Spacious in NYC standards (or so I’m told). Modern and well equipped. The shower leaked badly, soaking the floor. Lots of mould in the shower as well. This seems to be in multiple other reviews, so hopefully management take note, as it slightly lets down an otherwise perfect room.Noise: Seems to be mentioned in multiple other reviews. You will hear horns, sirens, trucks etc. But it’s downtown NYC, so it’s to be expected and the street the Henri is on is a less busy at night than the surrounds.

The room was small but very clean with a small modern updated bathroom. The nice robe left in the bathroom was also a nice touch as was the dental and personal hygiene kits which you often don’t see anymore in hotels. Febreze has been sprayed in room so it smelled fresh and clean. The continental breakfast was also free for rewards guests so sign up for the reward program. We grabbed muffins/pastry juice coffee and fruit. Lastly I left me cell phone charger in the room when I checked out. When I called 2 days later they located the charger in lost and found and held for me at front desk so my kids could pick it up for me. All in all I recommend this hotel highly.

The cleaning of the rooms was also lax: I had to let someone know at the front desk that the bathroom had not been properly cleaned, and the sheets were never changed during my four-night stay. I left my room one morning before 9 a.m. and the bed had still not been made when I came back at 4 p.m.! The major problem I had with the room was noise. The room itself was not noisy, but the the one that I booked for my mother, which faced onto the street, was intolerably loud from very early in the morning.

The wait staff at the Mykonos Grill weren't very friendly and the food is seriously overpriced for what you get. We didn't get our 10% off for being hotel guests.

I had checked on the Wyndham site for hotels near Manhatten but not to close as to get the noises. I found Hotel Henri. Its only a 30-45 minute cab ride from La Guardia or JFK depending on traffic of course. The hotel itself is very clean from street view and also upon entering. It is a small hotel with a greek restaurant located on premises.the rooms all appear to be the same size and that size is very small, not so small that it discourages you but if your used to larger rooms this is not your place. The rooms come with a comfortable queen size bed which pretty much fills the entire room. the bathroom is also quite compact but usable. There is a mini fridge but it is filled with mini bar materials meaning no room for your own drinks or leftovers you might carry home. There is a safe, ironing board with iron available in the room. The exterior noises were non existent from my room #901. the down sides, during the evening there are get togethers on the roof top bar and that traffic can have an impact on the elevators, we waited 10 minutes for 1 of the 2 elevators to finally arrive to the lobby. the shower is going to leak onto the bathroom floor no matter what you! its a design flaw. the entire floor in our room was vinyl flooring which in my opinion might be easier and more cost effective to maintain but isnt appropriate for a hotel room. you can literally feel every grain of dirt and sand as you walk. now remember the shower does leak/ flood the bathroom floor so that wet floor extends all the way into your bedroom area and your feet become a mop for the dirt on the floor.i had to rinse my feet off after I had showered just to put socks on, not good.bottom line, its a nice hotel, very trendy, close to restaurants and time square even by foot.if they could fix the shower so it doesnt create a mess and add area rugs to the rooms I would give it 5 stars.","Lillington, North Carolina",0,4.0

The hotel feels like a boutique hotel more than a Wyndham - with cozy but updated rooms, a small breakfast area serving muffins and fruit with coffee from a pot, and a stylish rooftop lounge on the 18th floor that has a bar and lounge to chill after a day of meetings or to meet friends.The rooms have a keurig-style coffee maker and come stocked with a mini fridge and multiple snacks. The bathrooms have been updated and are roomy enough with a shelf and hooks to hold your stuff, and plenty of hot water.The staff is helpful and very accommodating, they really care about your stay.The only dings I would put on the hotel is that for 2 of the 3 nights of our stay the rooftop bar and lounge had private parties - which meant hotel guests were out of luck in using the lounge. I told the hotel about this and they gave me some drink coupons, which was very nice. But my plans to meet my friends there got scuttled.

While the staff was friendly and helpful, the room was quite small with everything seemingly in miniature. The bathroom was half of normal size with a single sink and small counter; the shower was very small and would not accommodate a large person. The desk was half of a normal size. There was a small space between the front of the bed and the wall to walk to the other side. The floor of the room was a cold tile rather than carpet, which likely has benefits in terms of cleaning. The innovative and creative lighting and decor felt very trendy and cool and I was impressed by how much they fit in such a small area. I was fine by myself but if my husband was with me, we would have been maneuvering around each other to get to the bathroom, bed, etc. I met a couple there who had also relied on Trip Advisor reviews and had the same impression. We wondered if we had each just had the bad luck of getting a postage stamp sized room but concluded that every floor and every room was the same size based on the structure of the hotel. Small rooms seem to be the trend and are fine if that's what you expect. A continental breakfast is served in the Rooftop lounge and is free if you book directly through Wyndham. I enjoyed coffee and the view although the cereals and baked goods are not what I enjoy for breakfast.Rereading this review, it sounds very negative, which was not my intention.

It's a small hotel with a small staff, yet they always were attentive and helpful.Breakfast - a selection of pastries and cereals in their penthouse lounge each morning was a great way too get the day started and I appreciated the extended service until 11am as I had a few late nights in the city.My Room - While a bit small, It had a very comfy bed and still offered just the right amount of space and with a very comfortable size bathroom. Perhaps a bit more lighting would be nice, as I often kept my blinds closed since my view was of an office building across the alley....thus their view would be of me. Next time I may request a 24th street facing room - however, it was quiet on the back side of the hotel.

It's a Wyndham masquerading as a boutique hotel, so the room has been redone to look like the Ace hotel (example: one wall looks like it's concrete that's been tagged with ""always be a poet"" but it's really wallpaper) and very dim Edison style bulbs in the room. There's LED rope lighting around the bed frame and headboard. Room is small (it's NYC, all hotel rooms are small) but since it's sparsely decorated there's enough room to move around. The shower is great. Mini bar features outrageously priced booze, snacks, and an intimacy kit with condom, lube, and vibrating ring in case you forgot stuff. But you can walk to the CVS around the corner for any of those items (okay, maybe not the ring) if you'd prefer to not pay for the convenience. All in all, they've turned a sleepy business hotel into Stuff Millenials Like, but even if you're not in the target audience you'll find the room to be comfortable.But since the Henri is trying to be Stuff Millenials Like, they have a rooftop bar with loud music at night. When I read about the bar when I booked it I thought it would be a nice quiet place to have a drink and look at the city. When we checked in on a Saturday, our room was two floors under the bar and all we could hear until the wee hours of the morning was the thumping bass of EDM. We had packed a white noise machine and had a bluetooth speaker in our suitcase, so between the machine at its loudest setting and the speaker cranked up playing a white noise app on my phone we were able to mask the thump enough to get some sleep. If you're here on a weekend, consider having something like that in your suitcase unless you're planning to be out all night. (We had a cruise to get up for in the morning, so partying like a rock star was not an option for us.)All in all, the Henri is well located and has a comfy bed. There's no breakfast offered, but there's plenty of food nearby. It's trying too hard to be hip, but if you can excuse that you can get a little sleep.","Houston, TX",53,3.0

After a few minutes we were greeted by the front desk agent who was a lovely young woman. She told us where everything was and offered us some fruit flavored water. Nice touch because we were driving in traffic for two hours and were thirsty. After a brief explanation of where the elevators were and and how to get wifi access we went to our room. Everything about the room was perfect. It was clean and the room smelled like fresh flowers..... Not sure if they have a flower sent coming from somewhere but it was a nice touch.

When I enquired about the possibility of early check-in (even though I was prepared to leave my bags with the concierge before returning later to check-in), the staff somehow was nice enough to check me in early after a slight wait in the lobby. It was the biggest gesture that came in an otherwise bad day and the rooms were modern and clean and stocked with complimentary bottled water. There wasn't any view in my room except seeing the office buildings across the street but it was nice in a way since it gave me an insight into the environment of workplaces in NYC. The beds were comfortable and the towels well stocked. The furnishings are modern and artsy somewhat with slightly dim lighting (not exactly my type but they are decent and acceptable) and the rooms are very decently sized in my opinion. I was rather surprised by the overall quality of the stay I received from Hotel Henri. It is a small hotel, but if you are looking for a decent place to stay, there's good tv, good beds, friendly staff, and a very responsive and hotel manager Chad, who helped look into some extra charges that came on while I was checking out that somehow wasn't included when I made my booking. Chad helped look into the charges and reversed them as a form of goodwill and I really appreciate it. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a place that gives you good value for your money. In NYC and for the location in the 24th street area, I would say it is a very decent price and I will definitely come back if I am looking for accommodation in this area. But more importantly, the hotel staff, from the room cleaning crew to the lobby staff and even the manager were definitely friendly and helpful and really did make all the difference to the stay.

Decor is as expected, minus a few corners of my flooring had lifted enough to stub my toe. The $25 of nasty red wine in the room is a bad idea, learn from my mistake. A great opportunity to improve my stay was the bar I had looked forward to.... and fail. The hours were poor, there’s no kitchen, the bartender was aloof and not engaging. Then the bar was closed one day all together and no one knew it would be! The sign was even out on the sidewalk. At check out they mentioned a “$15 facilities fee”. What for I asked? Oh, for all the amenities, like the bar. How about you manage this hotel better and can include the minimal amenities this property offers in your room rate like every other hotel I’ve stayed at. This is a joke given the bar is only drinks, crappy hours and service, and apparently not reliable either, and there’s no other amenity I can think of!

The hotel is centrally located and can be accessed by a couple of subway lines. The room is well appointed, with a more modern taste in its interior design. Although my room is clean, the bathroom smells stale upon our arrival. We thought it might be poor ventilation, so we turned on the bathroom fan before we left for dinner and the evening event. However, when we came back at night the smell stayed. We did not report the problem because we already settled in, and we were here just for a short one night stay. We checked out early the next morning and did not experience any problems. A couple of days later, I was shocked to find out that my credit card was charged an extra of USD 33.75 from Hotel Henri. I called the front desk to inquire, and I was told that it was from the minibar in the room. I told the person on the phone that we never used or consumed anything in the room during our very short stay, and he said he would reverse the bill. A week later, I got the credit back. Although the incident was resolved quickly and the person I talked with on the phone did a good job in reversing the bill in a timely fashion, I was surprised that Hotel Henri does not do its due diligence to verify the charge and inform me before charging directly on my credit card. It's WRONG to charge my credit card without even sending me the bill (via email, at least) detailing why and what they are charging for. More importantly, the hotel manager should do a better job to verify each single extra charge reported from his or her housekeeper.","Chicago, Illinois",410,3.0

The temperature in the room was not regulated well and I ended up tossing and turning because it was way too hot. The continental breakfast was cute and I enjoyed the offerings and I really like the complimentary water which is hard to come by and also left me skeptical. The most disappointing part of my stay was an anonymous charge on my credit card for about $9.00. We only drank the water and had breakfast. We were required to sign in for breakfast so it makes me wonder if we were being charged for something regarding that or maybe it was for the ice? If so, I feel as though this should be disclosed.

This is an issue because if you stay here, your belongings are left vulnerable for the taking. My biggest issue with this is that the Hotel has been altered to the issue for months (I have screenshots of postings from social) and have neglected to address the issue. The only response we have received from anyone are apologies from junior level staff and combative General Manager who deflects and focuses on undermining your frustration and refuses to accept responsibility. Christian N. Manager at the Hotel Henri has now responded that he is disappointed to read our review but brushes the account off saying that the hotel does their best to fix any problem but this issue has been reported by past visitors before us going back to April 2017 yet the issue still persists... The detailed account is below.I called the night of the incident (12/1) and have a reference # 3950320. However the issue was not addressed during our stay and I have yet to receive a comment from the Hotel Henri. The only response we get from Wyndham is a promise that they are looking into the situation but the first window of 1 week has come and gone.On our first day exploring NYC we returned to our room to find the room had been serviced by housekeeping, but the door was propped open. We had been gone for nearly 7 hours. I immediately called down to the front desk, but the phone rang for nearly 5 mins with no answer. My partner began to search the room to see if anything was missing, so I ran down to the front desk to alert them to the issue.The staff at the front desk was busy but were able to chase down the managers. The assistant manager (female, her name escapes me) did not offer any answers and could only apologize. I was upset because I was about to propose to my partner and the engagement rings were hidden in a bag in our room while we were out. I was expecting the room to be secure (because I checked the door as we left) and I did not use the safe because my partner and I were both using the safe for our computers and iPads. He would have found the rings and blown the surprise.In my conversation with her, I asked the assistant manager to look into it a few things:1. How did this happen?2. What is going to be done to prevent it from happening again?3. Where do we go from here?All of which were fair questions, I wanted to know that our belongings were safe. I am a former resident of NYC and now live in LA (Hollywood). We are familiar with petty crimes in high traffic areas. She sounded like she was going to look into the situation until the General Manager, Christiaan Aldoy, stepped in. He told me to calm down and that I was being unreasonable. I asked him, ""how should I be feeling?"" because it was the employee of the hotel that went into my secured room, with my belongings, and left the room unsecured for hours. He did not have an answer... He said I was being aggressive, but I wasn't. I explained that I was being assertive, I explained that I was protecting what was mine and trying to understand why the Hotel failed to provide 1 of 2 main services we were paying for (1. a comfortable and safe place to stay. 2. a safe and secure place to keep our belongings). He began to backpedal and didn't have answers. I asked again ""how should I be feeling"". I asked why he thought he should tell me how I should be feeling... He said he didn't mean to tell me how I should be feeling and tried to take back his comment. I asked him ""why was my tone inappropriate and why shouldn't I be upset?"" He didn't have an answer. Not once did he apologize, take responsibility for any mistake, try to move us to a more secure room, or make up for the situation in any way. Why? We booked our rooms for 4 nights / 5 days. This happened on the 2nd day. He never tried to make it better.Upon returning to the room, we figured out the issue in 5 mins. The door was not latching properly without being pulled shut (a video has been provided to Wyndham Group). The situation could have easily been addressed, but Mr. Aldoy decided to be combative and unapologetic rather than work towards a solution. All we asked was 1. How did it happen? 2. How can we prevent it from happening again (so we could leave our belongings in the room with peace of mind)? 3. Where do we go from here? Should we move rooms, etc? None of those questions were answered in the next 4 days. There were no attempts to remedy the situation. We were blown away but the standard but did not want to let this situation completely ruin such an important weekend for us (we got engaged).The next four days we didn't allow room service into our room, no turning down the sheets, no fresh towels, no cleaning the floors. It was awkward walking by the front desk, awkward walking by everyone that works there. The entire stay was very uncomfortable.Do you really feel that this is the acceptable treatment of a concerned guest at your hotel? Is this the experience your brand strives to provide? I have worked in hospitality for many years. We paid for a stay and experience that we did not receive and no one tried to make it better or help us, instead, they insulted us when raising the issue.It has been weeks and the only communication from Wyndham is the communication I initiate. No one is following up to address and provide a resolution. Further, I hope someone review's Mr. Aldoy's qualifications in holding the position of GM. This situation could have easily been addressed and avoided. Mr. Aldoy appears to be failing to address a simple maintenance issue but worse, he insults his guests when they raise issues to him (rather than taking responsibility and addressing them). I also want to point out that this issue has been raised to the Hotel Henri for months and no one has addressed it. A screenshot from the Hotel Henri Facebook Page has been provided where the same exact situation happened and they received similar treatment. I hope someone takes this issue seriously as it has the potential to become quite costly. I hope someone finally addresses it.","Los Angeles, California",5,1.0

I'll start with the positives:Location is pretty good. You're within walking distance to several subway lines and the PATH, as well as Madison Square Park and Eataly. That said, trying to get a taxi early Thursday morning was surprisingly difficult. The hotel's decor is also not bad, and despite the beds' ultra-soft feel, they were more comfortable than expected.Now, onto things that could be improved. First, we had reached out several times before check-in with requests. The emails were sent to both the hotel owner as well as the generic front desk address. No one ever responded. Then, at check-in, our simple request to have two reservations associated together so we could avoid having to check out only to check back in again was apparently not possible to do (vs. every other hotel we've ever stayed at), so we actually did have to technically check out before checking back in. Not sure if that was a system limitation, or training.The hotel offers free breakfast (that said, don't get your hopes up), though on weekdays, they limit hotel guests to a very small section of the dining area, as apparently they lease the majority of the space to some co-working group. Needless to say, that's not very hospitable to guests.Other (minor) annoyances include: a bathroom sink that didn't drain, a shower configuration that inevitably led to large water leaks, a central air system that was always too-hot or too-cold, and super tight rooms/closets (standard for Manhattan).To the housekeeping staff's credit, they consistently left us two bottles of water each day, even though we had ""do not disturb"" on. I've never had a hotel do that, so that was much appreciated.Would I stay here again? Maybe, if it was just myself. But not with two kids in tow.","Arcadia, California",93,3.0

Check-in: We came in on a red-eye so got to the hotel by 10AM hoping a room would be available. There was not. We were told there might be one by 12 or 2 o'clock. There was not. We were also told we'd get a call when a room was ready. We did not. Fortunately we were able to leave our bags and set out for a walk. We returned around 3:45 and were told a room was ready since around 3. It would've been nice to get the call we were promised but we did not. Aside from that minor hiccup, our overall stay was fine. We didn't have opportunity to take advantage of the 2 drink tickets for the rooftop bar but it was nice to have the option nonetheless. (And no, those tickets were not offered for having to wait for the room, it was just what they were doing to presumably promote the bar). Staff were friendly. Wi-fi worked fine. We would stay again assuming the price is right the next time we are ready to book.","Seattle, Washington",13,4.0

Usually we stay at Pod 39 (great Prices and hotel) but they did not have any adjoining rooms. After a lot of research I found Henri hotel in the perfect area with 2 queen beds for a great price. Typical in NYC, When I booked our room the price was $286 not including tax. Thank god I booked it when I did! I checked the site a few days later and the same room was $450 a night. Loved the location right literally at the Flat Iron building. We walked a few avenues west to the high line past FIT. Then walked south to the galleries in the meat packing district. Lunch in Chelsea and an easy cab ride to Times Square and Rockefeller Center. Typically when my husband and I visit NYC we are on the East side but this trip was so convenient to be west. The hotel lobby was small. Very Friendly staff. The rooms were big and clean. Gorgeous marble bathroom and showers were great. And nice and quiet. Plenty of goodies were stocked up in the room we did not use.. alcohol, candy, cookies, etc. making it very comfortable stay for anyone looking to spend more time in the room.

They share a the rest of their first floor space with a co-working office space, but it is blocked off after breakfast. The rooms are TINY. And the hallways are exceedingly narrow, making it difficult to maneuver around the corner with a rolling bag. They are also painted black, making everything seem even smaller than it is. The whole time we stayed there, the housekeeping cart on our floor was parked right out side the elevator. Given how narrow the halls are, it made it that much more tight. Also, as the hotel is one trying to be about design, it kind of takes away from any ambience to have a huge housekeeping cart the first thing you see every time you get off the elevator or leave your room. Of the two nights and three days we accessed our floor, the cart was only not sitting right there one time, no matter if it was morning, mid-day or even late at night upon returning from dinner.

It was an expensive stay for me at over $400/night. While I'm accustomed to NYC's expensive stays, this hotel just didn't measure up to the cost. The location is fine, near the Flatiron building. The lobby is bleak, with half of it dedicated to what looks like a shuttered cafe/restaurant that someone told me is now used as a coworking space during the day. Check-in was fine. The staff were fine. The hallway to my room was filthy and needed a serious vacuuming. The room itself was minimally furnished and had insufficient lighting. I had a view of the offices across the alley. The soaps and shampoo were of poor quality, and there was no body wash. On the day of my departure, I inquired about late checkout and was informed that it would cost me $100 for an extra couple of hours on top of my already exorbitant bill. To make matters worse, my friends informed me they had booked this hotel on Hotels.com for $140/night! I guess at that price I would've been more satisfied with my stay, but don't waste your money on this location. There are tons of options in New York.

I chose the hotel because it was close to a party we were attending and I trusted the Wyndham name.Parking at a nearby garage and check-in went smoothly. There were, however, a few issues with the room: lack of luggage racks and a light that wouldn’t turn off. I didn’t notice it until it was too late at night to call the front desk, but since it was held together with scotch tape I’m sure it must have been noticed and ignored. Nevertheless, it was a clean room with a comfortable bed. I had asked if anything could be done about a bright red blind on the window and when we returned from the party I was quite impressed to find that it had been replaced with a very nice Venetian blind. “Good service,” I thought. But that’s where the ""good"" part ended.I read that the hotel restaurant served breakfast. Unfortunately that was not true. In fact the restaurant doesn't serve anything because they are permanently closed. We were directed to either Starbucks or a coffee shop on Sixth Avenue. It was disappointing but tolerable.What wasn’t tolerable is what happened next. After returning home I received an email with the invoice and saw that the hotel had charged my credit card $256.33 instead of the confirmed $236.84 rate. I called the hotel immediately and was transferred to Wyndham Customer Care. The agent I spoke to checked with the hotel and told me the person in charge (the hotel manager?) would contact me the next day. That did not happen. When I contacted the hotel the following day the desk clerk put me on hold and deliberately disconnected me--twice. When I finally spoke to her she shouted something about a facility fee. I told her it was included in the original confirmation and I offered to fax or email my original confirmation, but she didn’t want it; she said the manager would contact me that afternoon. It didn’t happen.Using the email link for the hotel on the original confirmation, I sent an email and it was returned undeliverable. I filled out the feedback form on the hotel website and nobody responded. I called Wyndham Customer Care again the following day and was given a case number and told my complaint would be investigated. I was assured that someone from Customer Care would get back to me. It didn’t happen. I waited a week and called Customer Care again and the agent told me they contacted the hotel and were told that Hotel Henri sent me an updated invoice. Of course, that didn’t happen. I figured I had wasted enough time trying to deal with the regular sources so I wrote to the CEO of the Wyndham hotels and included the documentation. He responded immediately and contacted the CEO of Customer Care who contacted me and put someone in charge of the “case.” She was very helpful. This has never been about the $19.49. I could have disputed the charge through my credit card company, but they would have absorbed the charge. I didn’t want that. The chain would have been willing to refund my money. I didn’t want that either. I wanted the hotel to refund the money and to apologize, especially for the rude and deceitful treatment I received.I never received an apology from the hotel, but ultimately they did refund my money, but not quite correctly. Instead of crediting my account $19.49, they issued a credit of $19.48. I will never know if it was a calculation error or if they wanted to have the last word. The penny is my donation to their much needed hospitality fund. My advice: stay away from this hotel","Westchester, NY",27,1.0

After scouring the ""Hotels Tonight"" app for a nice hotel with average pricing, the Hotel Henri caught our eye amongst a plethora of hip new hotels Manhattan has to offer guests. Conveniently located in the Chelsea area of NY, this well designed and comfortably hospitable boutique hotel also offers guests a relatively inexpesive and conveniently located $40/night Self-Parking option. I know you are thinking $40/night parking . . . ARE YOU CRAZY? But, let me be the first to tell you that this was the best parking price we found amongst all the other offering and a major factor from the app in selecting Hotel Henri. Just be aware that the garage itself is a couple buildings down and is a self-park situation to a certain degree, so don't be afraid when you need to hand your keys over to a garage attendant. THE HOTEL - You never know what you are going to get when booking a hotel from a couple of pictures, but Hotel Henri lived up to all of our expectations. We were greeted by a hospitable team, not overtly welcoming, but did check us in in a very timely manner and provided a bellhop to assist us with luggage to our room. THE ROOM - was well appointed for a Manhattan hotel room, trust that they can be really small sometimes, and perfectly designed to allow guests enough room to move about without crawling over furniture; they even took the time to cover the A/C unit with a grate to hide its unsightly display. Although probably too dark for most people, I found the room decor very inviting and comfortable; especially when you come back from a night of parting in NY and just want a dungeon to crawl into to sleep off the pain from the night. The floors are cleverly designed with wood plank tile allowing for the highly trafficked rooms to be well maintained, yet offer a relaxing welcoming appearance. THE BED - Let me just say it . . . BRAVO to a hotel that gets it! This was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on with sturdy and nicely sized pillows. THE BATHROOM - adequately sized with enough room to maneuver and very clean. There was no mold or hairs in the shower, which is a nice reprieve from the norm of most hotels. AMENITIES - although we did not eat at the restaurant, the menu appeared very appetizing and ambiance chicly designed. The continental breakfast was a nice added touch that other hotels do not offer, but basic in its offering. MY CRITICS - the bathroom could use a bit more lighting for application of makeup for the ladies. Although the continental breakfast was thoughtful, there could be some healthier options instead of all sweats and carbs. The mini-bar was packed full of for sale product, which does not allow guests to stock with their own items. All the snack and amenity offerings on the ""one"" shelf in the room need to be removed to allow guests somewhere to place their items instead of the floor. The black carpet in the hallways showed every speck of dust, piece of lint and trash tracked in from the streets of NY, so they were constantly in need of a vacuuming - need to rethink that design element. The ice machines are not conveniently located and require guests to trek all the way upstairs or basement to get ice. All in all, it was a lovely stay and we would definitely return on our next visit to NY as the Hotel Henri is a TRABERT TOP PICK!","Fort Lauderdale, Florida",10,4.0

In the morning we realized all the noise had been the air conditioner as it never rained.  After the morning water from the shower leaked all over the floor, we met a hotel employee in the hall. We related our concerns about the room to her. She was very sympathetic and said we should tell the front desk and they would probably compensate us in some way. We did tell the front desk, but they could only offer us an "" I""m sorry"".  The room is very small and dark with no place to put your luggage. You must put it on the floor against the wall and hope you don't trip on it. Our cousins were on the 5th floor.

I have also figured out the problem with the consistent complaints about the hall carpeting looking like it's never vacuumed. They do indeed sweep those floors - I saw them once, and heard them the next day. Looked near-perfect right afterwards, but a few hours later, the white specks were back, obviously tracked in from somewhere. I also left something in my room after I checked out.

Checked in 5 days ago, albeit extremely late at night, and the only info we were supplied with was the wifi code. Have since found out, and only by seeing it one morning, that a continental breakfast is available, on a first come/ first served basis, nothing is replenished! Today we also asked if maps were available and were given some, but you obviously have to ask, they are not offered. The room is small, and rather dark, there is nowhere to either place or store your cases. The hanging space in the wardrobe is barely adequate and there are no drawers. We are 2 female friends, here for 17 nights, so you don't feel you can really unpack and 'settle in'. on the plus side, the beds are extremely comfortable, the air conditioning is good and there is a small bar fridge, which we are using after arranging for hotel staff to empty it. We went out today at 8.45am, returning at 3.30 to have a rest before going out again tonight. Our room had not been done, at 4pm housekeeping arrived so we just asked for clean towels as we were trying to rest. At 4.45, a woman entered our room, I thought it was housekeeping returning but no, it was a guest who was just checking in and had been given our room number and card!!! What the??? I am still waiting for a phone call from reception to apologise. We have not been informed, however I have read a review on trip advisor that a daily ammenities fee is charged, really??? What for? There are none!! There is no swimming pool, no lounge to sit in, there are 4 small chairs in the lobby where you are expected to sit and eat breakfast. The 'rooftop lounge' (really the top floor) is really a bar that opens at 5pm, with loudish music, not really somewhere you can sit and relax for a bit.","Frankston, Australia",2,2.0

Personally, I would not choose this hotel (Henri Hotel) again. This was my second time sightseeing in NYC. The hotel I stayed last time might not have such great location (not bad though), the room rate was cheaper with a bigger room and way better shower system. Location: Great location. The Flatiron building on 23rd St is just “at the corner”, only half block away from subway stations. It is very easy and handy to get to any places in midtown and downtown Manhattan. HOWEVER…Room: This was a family trip. I traveled with my parents. The room we stayed was soooooooooo small for three adults. In addition, the room is very dark and dusty. There was no place to sit. We had to sit on beds all the time. This reminds me hotel rooms in Hong Kong. I am sure there are bigger rooms in this hotel. I booked the hotel room through Expedia for three adults. I was wondering how come the hotel did not take this information into consideration and give us a bigger room. Even in Hong Kong, a small hotel room would have a bathtub. But not this one. The bathroom was terrible. Firstly, it is tiny. It is lucky that neither of us was big. Then the shower room drain was clogged for the first two nights and I had to ask for a mechanic to unclogged the drain. What’s worse was that the shower room is ill-designed that water overflew on the bathroom floor even after the drain was unclogged. That made the bathroom floor watery. It was NOT pleasant. Shouldn’t the hotel staff or mechanics check such thing regularly to make sure things are working? Lobby: hmm… I am not sure if that is a lobby. So tiny, not much space for people to sit or stand. The restaurant next to it takes most space. OMG! No! Housekeeping: Housekeeping service is not consistent. I left the same amount of tips every day. Perhaps not enough, eh? I guess the hotel has different housekeeping staff each day for each floor. I saw different faces throughout my entire staying. Sometimes, the beds were made and the bathroom was cleaned with new towels. Sometimes, only the beds were made, the bathroom was slightly cleaned with no new towels. Sometimes, the beds were made and the bathroom was kinda cleaned and used towels were taken away with no new towels. I was like: “okay. Should I leave more tips (apparently not with such inconsistency) or just forget it? What is the service consistency?” Cleanness: Overall, it is a clean hotel though there was not much housekeeping consistency. I especially enjoyed the fragrance of the bed sheets. This was very nice.

At check out they claimed they didn't charge my card and INSISTED on swiping my debit card again, despite the fact that I physically showed them the charge in my bank account. They said the first charge was just a hold and that money would be refunded in 5-7 business days. Well guess what, it wasn't. So after spending an hour of my life (that by the way, I'll never get back) on the phone with bank of america the issue was resolved. So unless you enjoy being scammed and paying for a mediocre hotel room twice, stay somewhere else. Its not worth the aggravation of dealing with a front desk clerk who is lazy and incompetent, a manager who can barely answer your questions or a day spent on the phone with your bank trying to reverse the damage done. I believe there is a holiday inn just down the street that I'm sure is comparable in price and star rating.","New York City, New York",2,1.0

However, Fabiola at the front desk checked to see if anything was ready, and we managed to get a room on the 15th floor overlooking 24th street and the skyline... awesome, after a 24 hour flight from Sydney!Room itself has a comfy King size bed with nice linen, and is decently equipped with good air con, flat screen TV and fridge. Best of all, the room is actually pretty big (for NYC) with room to hang clothes and store 4 big suitcases without feeling too cramped.Throughout our stay the entire team were friendly and helpful, with things like printing tickets for us etc no problem at all. Hotel is pretty funky and modern, and there's a nice looking bar / cafe on the ground floor, and the fabulous Eataly just round the corner.Would definitely stay here if we return to New York.","Grand Terre, New Caledonia",51,5.0

The city of NY is expensive when it comes to hotels so I was actually quite happy concerning the price - especially since the location of the hotel is just perfect. Walking distance to all that NY has to offer in a quiet street. The room was actually more than big enough but facing back of the hotel is was very very dark...no sunlight. The room had quite recently been renovated/redecorated and was OK but the cleaning of dust was not too good when I checked.

I asked if they would let me use the $5 bottle of spring water in my room for free. The answer was no you can't do that well have to charge you. You can give us your ice bucket and well fill that with water. Not knowing the cleansliness of the ice bucket and having to go down to the lobby I was not game. Also there was no notice that this would be the state of affairs. We did get a note letting us know that the water would be off yesterday from 10 am - 5 pm.Also the walls are paper thin. You can hear everything from the neighbors having sex to the clanging of the elevator so bring ear plugs! That said my room was spacious and the bed was clean and comfy.

The front desk was very nice and was kind enough to store our bags and give me a call when my room was ready. There is by no room in the lobby to relax and wait for your room.There are many cons about the recent remodel in the bedrooms. For example the is no drawers to store your clothes, no place to put your luggage except on the floor because there no luggage rack. There is a large selection of snacks and alcohol for sale in a refrigerator. The fact that the refrigerator is only for sale items you can not use it for your own food or drinks is a major con. There really is no need to have any sale items with all the nearby stores and bars.The common area carpets always looked dirty. It seem that there was only one elevator that worked. The website stated that breakfast was included but the front desk didn't inform me of the details. Then when I went to the restaurant in the hotel for breakfast and I felt very unwanted. First the host asked me for my voucher, so I asked the front desk and went back the restaurant. The breakfast was much to be desired. There were not plates I used my napkin, only a few coffee mugs. A couple of juice crafts and some danishes. Out of my four night stay I only tried the breakfast once.The best thing that this boutique hotel has going for them is the location, it's in Chelsea close to Madison Square, Park and the Shake shack and close to good restaurants and bars.","Hollywood, Florida",20,3.0

At rates ranging from $300 to $400 per night, hotel points enthusiasts may be drawn to this selection given the great return on Wyndham points. Well, once you get there, you might think differently. The microscopic lobby gets crowded even with a few people. Even more absurd, several times I was passing through the lobby, workers were attempting to bring what appeared to be very large laundry or garbage carts through the tiny lobby. Is there no working service elevator or entrance/exit? Speaking of elevators, they are slow, dirty and smelled either strongly of cleaning supplies or urine. I wasn't sure what was worse. Despite seeing cleaning staff in the hallways throughout the day, the hallways were filthy. Cleaning supply carts frequently blocked passage through the narrow hallways. I saw garbage stored in the stairways (pretty sure the NYC fire inspector would not approve of that!). In addition to common area cleanliness issues, I found service at the downstairs restaurant to be inhospitable, even by NYC standards. We went down to get some pre-dinner snacks as we had noticed a few things that looked quite nice on the menu. We stood for 5 minutes next to the sign that stated: please wait to be seated. Several workers passed by us, never even making eye contact. The bartender, standing feet from us, never acknowledged our presence. So, we walked passed the workers who were ignoring us and were finally handed menus and told me could take an outdoor table. So we picked what we wanted to eat and a waiter came up to us and said: I'm not sure why you were handed those menus because we aren't serving food. I was perplexed as I looked around at other people eating food and being served food. He then responded that the kitchen was closed from 4 to 5. All of this could have been prevented by simply being greeted at the door with: Hi guys, our kitchen is closed until 5 but you're welcome to have drinks while you wait. Simple, common customer service prevents so many issues. Needless to say, we walked out. To bad. I really wanted to try those duck confit spring rolls. The good stuff. Front desk staff were friendly and welcoming. While the decor may suggest that this hotel is going for a low-scale W hotel look, there was none of the famous W hotel rudeness. The room itself, although small, was very clean. The decor wasn't my taste but didn't really matter. Street noise was problematic as was hallway noise but that's pretty common in NYC. With a website that conjures up images of globe hopping tourists and luxury, this one is almost a con-job. But since the hotel is obviously in the midst of transition, I'll try to be generous and give two stars.I am scheduled to stay here again in the fall but will probably be cancelling and switching to the nearby Four Points...just a few blocks away. Prices are generally lower, rooms a bit bigger, common areas are cleaner.","Hyde Park, New York",49,2.0

It's still a Wyndham, and I stayed on points. But there's good news and bad news. The good news is a majorish item, the bad ones are all fairly minor. But there are a lot of them. The hotel has gone to the dark-wall/Edison lightbulb sort of decor that has become so popular. There is less furniture in the rooms than previously, which makes them seem larger, and I think perhaps the bathrooms, which are completely remodeled, are indeed bigger. But if you're bringing much more than a toothbrush, you'll discover there isn't much room for what's in your suitcase. There was one tiny drawer in the shelf-desk, and that was It. Yes, a closet (with a safe in its floor), at least. Where could the suitcase go? Can't put it on top of the heating/AC operation under the window - there's now a fenestrated wooden screen in front of it. A luggage rack? At this point, there are none in the hotel. At all. It seems unclear whether this will be a permanent situation or whether they're On Order. The desk was very apologetic, perhaps a little embarrassed, and offered me a second chair, just like the slightly flimsy Thonet/ice cream parlor-style one at the desk, for my suitcase. In the bathroom, there's no shaving mirror, and the lights go up only one side of the mirror, making odd shadows for putting on makeup. The room was very clean, although the hall didn't seem to be vacuumed daily. I thought the bed extremely comfortable. No lighting over the bed, but tiny pencil spots on each side, although not at a height that made reading easy.  Personnel are very pleasant, and there's now an adjacent restaurant that has a largish, slightly raised terrace open to the street that would be a reasonable place for a drink on a nice day or evening. I understand hotels don't particularly want long-term guests. But when even a carry-on suitcase is a problem in a room, what should we think?",Missouri,109,3.0
