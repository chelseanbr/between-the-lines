I was told booking the hotel was a big mistake. However, my experience contradicted that advice; the stay was great! Clean room, friendly and accommodating staff, and an excellent location. I would definitely stay there again. That’s the Pro’s. The Con’s? The hotel charged me above and beyond my $160.68 “Resort Fee” an additional $71.00. Here is the crazy part. That charge appeared AFTER I checked out! I called to complain. The only rather unpleasant person on their staff (because he insisted on rudely interrupting me) said, “Oh give it 24 hours and it will fall off your account. We do that all the time.” My problem? That you do it all the time doesn’t make it right. The person said it was for incidentals. What incidentals are there after I’ve checked out? In my opinion they do this to ride the customer’s money for a few days. The hotel was great but there are no incidentals. They have no room service, no amenities (In fact their vending machine had only two choices: Coke and waters and you have to pay at the machine. In conclusion, it was a very pleasant stay. I would stay there again, but to charge an additional $71 dollars on top of the city wide ripoff practice of charging “resort fees” that supposedly are to cover those services was the one thing that tainted the experience.",,0,4.0

Hopefully no one has the same problems I did, it was just bad timing and a bad room. On the first night a hotel staff came up to our room asking if we had just showered, and we had, he said the room below us was leaking. A couple hours later of the staff not showing back up, I went to the front desk and asked if I could take a shower because of the leak, they said we could but that the leak was essentially our fault, that we had overflown the bathtub and got water all over the floor, we had not done that, there was almost no water on the floor. I told him that was not the case and he proceeded to argue with me telling me I was wrong and there HAD to be water ALL over the floor. I told him that I just wanted to shower and if it did leak again, I don't want to have to pay for damages or anything. He said ""well i don't know what to tell you about that"". At the check in I was told I was paying a $90 security deposit, and I have not gotten that back. I left my room in good condition so I don't know why I haven't gotten that. Apart from my bad experience, the other staff was friendly, and the place was pretty clean, you get what you pay for, the rooms are very small. ",,0,3.0

We had already stayed there several times. We liked the excellent location of the hotel, as well as the good treatment by the staff, all very friendly and attentive. However, the last time, we noticed the presence, among the employees, of a tall, thin man who wore a turban. He seemed to be a type of manager.Such an individual never spoke to us, and he seemed to try to avoid any contact with us, as he always left the room when we approached. Such a situation was very uncomfortable. The breakfast, which according to the hotel, is a courtesy, has dropped in quality. The hotel, in addition to its name, also needs to change its furniture, which is very old and old-fashioned (the ironing board was broken ). Finally, I would like to express our thanks to all the receptionists, porters, maids and butlers, who are the best in the hotel.","Rio de Janeiro, RJ",4,3.0

It had tea and coffee making facilities which were refilled daily but no fridge, however there is an ice-maker downstairs. It wasn't a problem, but be prepared for plastic cups in the bathroom and styrofoam cups for coffee. We hadn't experienced this in any hotel before so it took us by surprise, but it might be normal for New York.

I'm sure others have better experiences.The Good - Times Square Location: Usually we stay at the Crown Plaza two blocks away, which is also next to Times Square, but the cost was less at the Broadway @ Times Square (the name when we booked in February), Casa Tui (name last week when we visited) or NYCASA46 Hotel (name I found on TripAdvisor today in order to post my review).The Bad - Billing: Wow. So many people in the lobby having trouble with their bills. Lots of raised voices. Primary issue is that if you booked months ago under the Broadway @ Times Sq name there wasn't a facilities fee (or it was lower than the new owners' current facility fee) and the staff had to manually match your copy of the booking invoice to their computer screen pricing. If you didn't have your original booking notice it was a mess. Thankfully we prepaid in full with the actual hotel last February and had that email confirmation and they had to match it. They took a copy of the email and asked us to come back in an hour while they manually adjusted their computer system to honor it. Also those that booked through a third party (like Booking.com) had issues with the pricing of the fees as well. So... watch your invoice if booked before ownership change.The Bad - Comp Breakfast: I had thought this would save us some money, however, the food was so pitiful that we ended up eating out after that first breakfast. Unripe bananas, Trix flavored yogurt (strawberry and VERY sweet), stack of frozen Eggo waffles, hard boiled eggs in a crockpot, dry pastries... The Bad - Size of Room: I mean very tiny. We were on the 9th floor (top). There are 10 rooms per floor with one permanent resident (sweet old man we met in the lobby). Anyhow, the bathroom counter was only 11"" x 25"" with a corner shower of 33"" x33"". The 31"" television is on the SIDE of the queen sized bed so the two guests can't sit and watch the television without sitting on the side-edge of the bed. We didn't watch the tv, but placement was awkward. Clock in the room had USB outlets for charging your phone bedside (great) but the time not the clock was wrong by over an hour and there was no button to adjust the time. No, it did not synch with your phone to the correct time when you were charging either. Bed was comfortable though.The Musty - AC: Beyond the tiny size, the very musty smell of the AC was barely livable. We tried spraying Fabreze but the AC/heating units need DEEP cleaning.

On the day we checked out, we learned that the hotel had been sold and renamed Casa Tua Hotel. I can tell you that the former owners provided an outstanding breakfast (bagels, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, donuts & sweet breads, pre-made waffles, bananas/apples, yogurt, orange juice, tea, and coffee from 6 am-10 am. There was an room with more than adequate seating and an attendant made sure the food did not run out. Our room had a comfortable queen-sized bed (I have back problems so I have to have a good mattress). There was a dresser and plenty of room for our bags. The air conditioner was strong and reliable. There was a safe for valuables and a full-size iron & ironing board. The bathroom was roomy and had a good-sized shower (no bathtub). There was a hairdryer. The shower gel, shampoo, and body lotion were dispensed from wall and shower receptacles so bring your own bar soap, shower puff, etc. if you’re particular. We were in Room 905 on the ninth floor and hear absolutely no noise from the street. The location of this hotel cannot be bearer if you want just a short walk home from all the theaters and the discount TKTS booth is a short walk away. The employees were very friendly, especially the doorman, who allowed us to store our luggage for a few hours between our noon checkout and our departure for LaGuardia.

Fruit Yogurt, Water, Tea and Coffee were available 24 hours. The rooms had a TV with ample programming options. Wifi was excellent.Overall, it was a pleasant stay.However, I feel the hotel needs to upgrade it's look to make it more modern. The carpets need to be changed for sure to newer and modern ones.

A few times, I had to request the housekeeping to spray my room with an air freshener.I wish the breakfast had more options, preferably healthier ones.

We couldn't justify the price to stay there without the package, so we moved to the Broadway @ Times Square for the last two nights of our trip. The Marriott Marquis it is not, but this hotel did have some great things going for it.Pros:The location... just a block or two from Times Square and a short walk to Avenue of the Americas. There were lots of great restaurants nearby as well.Staff - Everyone we encountered on the staff from the front desk, to the baggage valet, to the maid were very friendly and helpful.Free breakfast - it's a very basic breakfast (yogurt, fruit, toast, hard boiled eggs, cereal, coffee, etc) but it's free! With how pricey things are in NYC free food is an excellent bonus.Rooms - were clean, beds were comfortable. They have soap and shampoo dispensers as opposed to the little bottles. I prefer the dispensers as it cuts down on waste and is more environmentally friendly.Cons:Rooms - While the bedding and bathroom was clean, the room was cleaned with a very strong perfumey type cleaner... the smell was so strong that we had to open a window to air it out. I sometimes feel hotels do this to give the impression the room is clean and fresh when it is actually not. That being said, the floor and wall paper were definitely in need of a deep cleaning and/or refresh. The room we were given was also VERY small... like once you get the bed in there there isn't much floor space for anything else. There was a very spacious closet though but no in room fridge. No view - Like I mentioned we had come from the Marriott Marquis where we were given a large room on the 20th floor with views of the NYC city skyline. When we looked out of our window at the Broadway @ Times Square we saw a brick wall. Overall, we did like our stay and had we not stayed at the Marquis prior to staying here we would have found these accommodations adequate. For the really high prices of NYC hotels, we felt the Broadway @ Times Square was reasonably priced and will probably stay here again in the future.","Vancouver, Washington",36,3.0

Nobody told us that we are not allowed inside to park the car, we've been kicked out of the car, with kids and luggage, while the car was half in and half on the sidewalk. The front desk area seemed to be nice and clean, soon we discovered that it is the only area like that. The room was a total disappointment. A tiny room, 2 queen beds so close to the walls that you could barely walk in between. One of them was six inches away from the air condition unit that was blowing right towards it. To get to the bathroom you had to squeeze yourself in between the bed and the TV stand. The carpet was a dark color, mostly due to accumulated dirt. Everywhere it looked like nobody cleaned the dust in a while. The wallpaper was peeled off and it had a grey look. In the bathroom the vent was full of dust. The smell in the room was almost moldy but they tried to cover it with a lot of perfume.Breakfast was a joke. Same thing every day. Boiled eggs, bagels, doughnuts, apples, bananas, cream cheese, butter, cereals and milk. In one morning we arrived at 9:30 am, while the breakfast is served until 10 am. Everything was completely empty. When I went to the front desk to ask for some food, another employee, that was just sitting there chatting, told me that is to late because in a few minutes the breakfast will be over. When he saw that his answer almost made me explode of anger, he quickly went to the breakfast area and started to pull out of a closet different things to eat. After that he had to refill it several times, since more guests came in.I thought to change the hotel but it was in too short notice and they would have charged me the first night anyway.The only good thing about this hotel is its location, just a block away from Times Square.Over all, if you have standards, pick another place to spend the nights in New York.",,4,1.0

Excellent location at the hearts corner of Times Square but smaller than usual rooms yet I feel they are quite pricey comparatively. Also could improve on its breakfast offering although I suspect due to the fact that it’s surrounded by restaurants it doesn’t make food offering core.

Location-if the main highlight of your trip is Broadway shows, hotel's location is perfect, walking distance. Anything else you are doing in NY I would recommend choosing another location, Times Square is always packed, noisy and dirty.OK- breakfast, it's an OK breakfast, less choices than most hotels offer in their continental breakfasts.Rooms are small but expected in NYC. One tiny window facing a wall, no natural light.Bad points -DIRTY!! Hairs on bed, bathroom and shower. Musty smell of dirty socks that would not go away with AC. Showered with flip flops. But my main complaint is service.WORST SERVICE EVER!! Can't think of a worse experience service wise in my past. Lobby receptionist is rude, unhelpful and made us feel as if hotel was doing us a favor in hosting us. I had a problem with parking and asked to speak with manager, and that happened only two days after I had the problem and only because I insisted to speak with her. Manager did not apologize for receptionist's behavior and did not solve our problem to my liking. Would NEVER recommend this place to anyone.","Miami, Florida",10,1.0

The rooms were better than 3 star and would honestly say between 3.5-4.0 overall. The cleanliness was very good. The continental breakfast is definitely a 4.0 and was very good for a start every day. The local NYC prices for food are very high so having drinks and some nice basic breakfast every day was a real treat. The room price was very good but the Apple Core chain itself are priced properly. This location is 300 feet from Times Square. There are several noisy restaurants close by. The luggage steward on arrival was lacking any service and the front counter staff were friendly but recommended walking the 300 feet and hail a cab on Broadway ourselves, which we did and became very successful at it. I pre-booked VIP airport pickup and redelivery thru USA Guided Tours and I was very happy with that but I would recommend that you use the GO bus thru the hotel staff as it was a lot cheaper but realize it is by the person whereas USA was by the vehicle and if you 3 or more folks it could be cheaper just to have VIP services do it. The front desk had many months to put us together with rooms but did not set aside rooms close by but 2 floors away which was NOT convenient. We was told to try and change rooms the next day. If they had done it right the first time we would have to try anything. I even called and they were not friendly or helpful on the phone to get it done months in advance. This is a great place for a NYC hotel for location and price but the shortfalls at the front desk keeps their rating down.","OMAHA,NEBRASKA",5,4.0

I know to expect smaller rooms, and I even try to avoid the major chains and stay at the boutique hotels when the price and location are right. So when I saw all the excellent reviews for Broadway at Times Square Hotel, I gave it a try. But this hotel goes beyond ""boutique"" - small is one thing, but this was a pit. First, a hotel can be small and still be modern and useful - like the Cambria. But Broadway at Times Square was not useful. It was old and cramped. To start, the elevators are so tiny 3 of us barely fit with our bags. If you needed a luggage cart, forget it. The housekeeper got on with her cart and pushed us into the corner - it was that tiny and claustrophobic. The hallway outside of the elevator is also so slim that only 4 people can wait in the hallway for an elevator. On either side of the hallway is a fire door leading to 2 rooms. So if there was anyone waiting for the elevator, you had to basically wait in your room. OK, so much for fit. The condition of our room was so disappointing. Our room was beat - peeling wallpaper, rust on the bathroom window, tiny old rusty sink, no internet service, no place to put your suitcase. Luckily, it was a one-night stay. Maybe there are better rooms at this hotel and that's why so many good reviews? I feel like the reviews I read were for another property. I didn't realize when I booked that this was ""formerly Comfort Inn"" -- maybe that should have been a clue.","Northern Virginia, Virginia",23,1.0

There were some good things and some bad things. Let’s start with the good. The location and price was very reasonable (according to our research). Just a block from Times Square, close to subways, bus lines, restaurants, theatres, the Rockefeller center and a 15 minutes walk away from a lot of the midtown attractions. The staff was very friendly and the room was fairly spacious by NYC standards. Now the bad. The room was a little stinky/musky smelling. The carpet was damp, yes damp. Not sure where the smell came from, ventilation, moisture, or what? But that should be taken care of for future folks. I have read several reviews on here about the smell, so I am sure it wasn’t just the room we were in. The breakfast wasn’t good at all. I just went for a cuppa joe and a couple donuts every morning. If you are a breakfast person you will be going out every day. The room we were in did not have a microwave or refrigerator, so that was a bit disappointing. And only one elevator. I guess it’s not so easy to add another...We were basically in our room just to sleep, so most of the complaints I have, we could live with for the price we paid on our first trip to NYC. This place is not a dump, but it is nothing close to posh either. You get what you pay for I suppose. We will probably pay a few more $$$ and stay elsewhere next time.","Roanoke, Virginia",22,3.0

We visited locations from Harlem to Lower Manhattan with ease. We didn't really make it out to the other boroughs just due to time constraints but they were easy to reach via subway as well.Staff was friendly, our room was clean, the beds were soft and comfy, and the luggage check was really helpful so we could get out and start our visit on arrival day. The breakfast was small, but good. The fresh chocolate chip muffins are where it's at! I was a little concerned about noise, given the close proximity to Times Square, but ultimately it was an unfounded concern. The room was pretty quiet. We caught two Broadway shows (Hamilton and Lion King) during our stay, and I loved being so close to the theaters so we could walk back quickly and change before/after the shows. We chose this hotel primarily because it had two queen beds (which isn't easy to find in Manhattan) and it was centrally located to most of the attractions we were hoping to visit.If you're looking for a luxury 5-star experience, this probably isn't it, but if you want a safe, convenient, reasonable, comfortable, mid-range place from which to go out and explore the city, you've found it!","Spring Hill, Tennessee",59,5.0

So no complaints about the room or amenities, but after midnight, the front desk allowed someone claiming to be a delivery person to come up to my room. This person started knocking but refused to identify themselves, trying to get into the room. I called the front desk and they said it was a delivery for me and when I told them I hadn’t ordered anything they said they’d send someone up. When I called back to get more details on what exactly it said was being delivered (since now I was panicking that someone had stolen my credit card data, room details, etc. bc apparently they knew my name) all the front desk person would say was that it was a mistake. Now maybe it was for someone with my first name and different room number, who knows. But it was still so scary I’d never come back here nor recommend that someone else does.

We, ever cautiously although there was no hint of smoke, made our way downstairs (literally, not using the elevator) to the lobby, where the night manager sheepishly confessed to the cause of our rude awakening. After about 15 minutes they figured out how to use the PA system, notified the mostly still-room-bound guests of the error, and a few minutes later managed to turn off the lights and sound.

This saved us quite a few dollars and time. I had a small quiet room on the ninth floor and it was perfect for one. My travelling companion had a larger room with fridge and microwave on the third floor. The decoration is recent and the lobby very nice to meet up before heading out to explore.

As we stayed during the coldest January America had seen for 25 years, the single glazing did little to hold in any heat and if the heating went off for just a minute, the room would instantly get draughty and cold. The breakfast was basically bagels, doughnuts and cereal, so if you're looking for a full breakfast spread, I would go elsewhere. On the first day, the butter we got from the counter top smelt and tasted a bit cheesy, but the day after we got it from the fridge and it was fine. The final flaw would be the noise. My boyfriend and I are heavy sleepers so managed to fall asleep to it just fine but I can imagine for lighter sleepers, the sound of sirens going past at all hours of the night and morning (not helped by the single-glazing) would not be ideal.

In the evening, we were always met by a security guard at the entrance. The elevator was not the quickest, sometimes you had to wait couple of minutes , as it served all 9 floors and lower level.

When we got there, they thought they didn't have a room ready, but were going to place us elsewhere for the night, then have us move back, on their nickel. We weren't thrilled, but after more than 10 calls, the desk couldn't find another place with an opening, so they explored options within the facility. Magically, they found a room which we went to and had for the following four nights. I'm guessing someone was coming in even later than we and we ended up with the room, but I didn't ask. I didn't want to know. We had the room as planned and onward.The room was small, but comfortable. I believe, based on the map, every room is slightly different in size and shape. The bathroom is comically tiny, but works well if you are used to your partner's routine, and my wife and I have it down. All the 'stuff' worked as it should, but the smallness of the made temperature control an interesting issue. We did fine, but anticipating a quickly heating or cooling room is imperative. We had no noise issues. Breakfast was reasonable and the space was more than sufficient for the traffic. Desk help was always available and was indeed helpful. Location was the reason for our choice and it was close to Times Square, so that made us happy. There was construction on the adjoining building so navigating scaffolding was necessary every time we came in or left. We noticed the majority of folks at breakfast were European, with English, at least American English, not in the first two languages spoken. No problem, just an observation. We might try another hotel in the area next time, but we'd also be more than comfortable at the Broadway. We'd just schedule our flights differently, if possible.","Moses Lake, Washington",166,4.0

The lady that checked us in, a Sikh gentleman who sometimes was at the front desk, and both of the bellmen we met while staying there were nice. The lady who checked us in went out of her way to check with housekeeping when we had arrived to see if a room had been finished. The other person at the front counter when we tried checking in early took 2 seconds to look at the computer and tell us no. When we did get to the room it was underwhelming. It was ""clean"" but there were other issues. The one good thing is we didn't get bedbugs (which was a concern when we saw the room).While we were standing at the front counter waiting to hear about a room we noticed a sign posted that water would be off in the hotel starting at Noon that day with no end time provided. We were assured it would only be off for three hours (To be fair, this time period is between standard checkout and checkin). While waiting to get on the elevator we heard one of the front desk staff say it would be 3 or 4 hours. They then followed that with should be no more than 4 hours. We were heading out to Central Park for the afternoon so it didn't really matter too much to us but was a point of concern such that we looked for other hotels nearby to transfer too if the water was still out when we returned. The water was on when we returned but the lines had not been flushed in the rooms and the water was very, very brown and had a bit of an oder to it. We let the water run in the sink and tub for a while and it cleared fairly quickly but put us off drinking it. We went and got bottled water at Duane Reed to use for toothbrushing, contacts, and such. The room stunk of must and mildew. The AC unit smelled musty at best and like urine at the worst. If the AC unit got turned off or the temperature turned down too low the smell would get pretty bad. The carpets in the room don't look to have been steamcleaned since President Bush was in office (43 or 41, I couldn't say). The bed sheets did seem to be clean. They looked and smelled laundered and the bed was in decent shape. We didn't get bed bugs so, all in all, it was okay. The bathroom and towels were clean. We had one housekeeper the first day we stayed who was pleasant. The gal that was there the rest of the time seemed to have a perpetual frown and a matching attitude. She was NOT happy one morning at 9am when she knocked on the door wanting to clean the room. When we asked to come back later she wanted to know when we would be gone and wasn't thrilled when I gave a time range. Same with the guy down in the breakfast area. The issue with the water had put us off eating the light continental breakfast they offer and we went out for breakfast anyway but still yet another surly person. I thought we could save some money by moving from the Marriott after a conference. This will teach me to try and save a buck. You get what you pay for.","McKinney, Texas",7,2.0

For the area the price was also pretty good and they had a free continental breakfast in the mornings. The gentleman who worked the desk in the morning and early afternoons was quite nice, remembered our name and on the last day when we need a car to the airport he took care of it for us. My only complaint and it is more because it just wasnt expected was the size of the rooms. I knew it wasnt good when the elevator door opened and the opposite wall was literally 3 ft away. We had a hard time making the turn out of the elevator into the hallway, with our suitcases, were you are meet by a door as soon as you make that turn. The hallways were one way streets and when we opened the door to the room it was no better, as it was tiny. I think if you get the ones with a king bed they are bigger (they have to be a king bed wouldn't fit in our room) so make sure you reserve a king bed. You had a bed and enough space to walk around it and that was about it. But in its defense I will say it was clean, the bed was ok and when you are in NY its not like you stay in your room anyway!

We wanted to be centrally located in Times Square but not pay a crazy price. I feel we made a fantastic choice!In doing my research, I didn't find many hotels that offer free continental breakfast and this one does. Granted, it was VERY basic. Lots of carbs and not much else but it was free and gave us a start to the day. White bagels, white bread, donuts, muffins, waffles, 2 cereals, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, watered down juice, apples and bananas. It was ok. But again, it was free. Would have been great to change up the fruit options like maybe oranges one day. Also, maybe some whole wheat options instead of just white bread everyday.Also, we really wanted our room to have 2 beds and many of the options only had 1 Queen or King bed. This hotel had 2 beds so that was another plus.Everything was clean and updated. The lobby was pretty contemporary. Our room was small but livable. Most of the room was filled up by the 2 beds. But they still squeezed in a table w/ TV and a desk and chair.The location is fantastic. 1/2 block from Times Square. But at night, trying to go to sleep, you wouldn't know it. I never heard a thing. Never had a hard time falling asleep. Absolutely no view out the window but who cares. We were only in the room to sleep. The view was of the wall of the neighboring building.We arrived a little early before check in time and our room wasn't ready so they had a guy to help check your bags into a storage room until the room was ready. That way we could head out into the city to explore a bit and then come back later to settle into our room.There was a little sign in the bathroom to hang your towel up if you didn't want it washed or put it on the floor if you did want it washed. So the first morning, we left our towels hung up so we could save water by reusing them. We returned to the hotel later that day to our towels missing and replaced by new folded ones. Why put a sign that says what to do if you are just going to replace them everyday? This happened each day even though we followed the instructions to hang them up.There is shampoo and shower gel in the shower. Only thing is that the shampoo was so liquidy/runny that I would squirt it in my hand and it would run off into the tub before I could get my hand to my head. Maybe the hotel should invest in a little higher quality shampoo.All the staff we encountered were friendly. Ran into the cleaning ladies a few times and they chatted with us and were very friendly. Made sure we had everything we needed. The guys at the front desk were very helpful. They helped us get a taxi to the airport the day we departed. There were a few times where multiple people were at the desk needing help and they managed the crowd well.Overall, this hotel was perfect for us. We didn't need anything fancy. Something affordable (for Times Square NY standards), clean and great location. This hotel met ALL my expectations.","Atlanta, Georgia",13,4.0

We were not disappointed! The Broadway is located half a block from Times Square, a very short walk. So much to see and do in that area. Perfect for Broadway shows nearby, lots of restaurants, subway and many Tourist attractions. We stayed at the Broadway for one week. From the time we walked into the lobby to the time we departed, we felt comfortable and welcomed. The staff at the Broadway is so friendly and helpful. From the staff at the front desk to the staff cleaning rooms, they were all friendly. The hotel is very clean, smells good and the continental breakfast was great. Fresh bagels, donuts, breads, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, waffles and pancakes and more. We especially loved Antonio, our breakfast server that took care of everything there. He made sure everyone got what they needed and so very friendly! Thank you Antonio for starting our day with your wonderful smile! Our room was just right for the two of us. It was clean, the bed was very comfortable. Yes, there was noise from the outside road but its New York and they honk their horns all the time! You just get used to it. We will definitely come back and highly recommend the Broadway at Times Square Hotel.

We booked two rooms and both were spacious, very clean, and even though right by Times Square and all the hustle and bustle of New York, surprisingly quiet. The staff were excellent and very friendly.

If you can't handle that or if you can't sleep with earplugs, then don't stay in this area. The room door is not very tight, so light leaked in at night. It wasn't enough to keep me up or bother me, but you might be different. The wifi isn't the best, but it is included.

We had a room on the seventh floor, with a queen bed. If I have to say anything negative about the room, it is that it was very small, but we really weren't spending much time in the room anyway, so it made very little impact on our overall enjoyment of this trip. On the plus side, the staff at this hotel are wonderful - everyone always had a smile on their face and a friendly greeting. The front desk staff were always ready to offer a hand with anything we needed and generally everyone was very accommodating. The breakfast that is included in the room was a huge plus, as we found NYC to be quite expensive for restaurant eating. It is stated to be a continental breakfast, but we found it to be ample, with lots of choices from fresh fruit and yogurt, to boiled eggs, to waffles and pancakes, and, our favourite, amazing bagels. The rooms, though small, were very clean and the bed was quite comfortable, with good pillows. There is also a safe in the room for our passports and other things that we didn't want to carry with us all the time. The fitness room looked good, although we didn't use it, and the business centre, which is also complimentary, was very handy for booking some sights and tours in advance and printing off our tickets. Add to this the location, which allowed us to walk to almost all of the sights and theatres that we went to.

The biggest pro - the location! Literally steps away from Times Square and the theater district, as well as the subway. We were on the 6th floor and were shocked at how quiet our room was, given how close to the hustle and bustle the hotel is. Second pro - two queen beds.Most NYC hotels seemed to have plenty of rooms with two full beds, but this was one of the few that had queens, which was necessary for our family of four to sleep comfortably. Third pro - the breakfast. While not fancy necessarily, there were plenty of simple, filling options that saved us an estimated $20-$30, had we ordered those same options at a restaurant. The decor is old school hotel versus a more trendy look, but the rooms are clean and comfortable. As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms are small - but what rooms aren't in NYC? We found the hotel to be a solid value for the money spent.","Clarendon Hills, Illinois",8,4.0

The room was NYC sized, and we did not have a view from the window (it was just brick outside). However, this is balanced by its proximity to everything- Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Grand Central, and train/subway lines all around it. It could not be more convenient for a trip to NYC.

It is also one of the few hotels in New York to offer a room with 2 queen beds, making it an easier sleep for our family of 4 with two teens. This hotel is about 2 blocks down the street from Hamilton the musical. Everything Times-Squarish/Theaterish is a no-problem stroll. And the noise really isn't too bad inside the hotel. Sometimes we could hear the people in the next room but they tended to pass out quickly!The room is indeed tiny. It's definitely a one-way street to go from the bed to the bathroom, or the bed to the closet, or the bathroom to the front door, etc. Just get everyone coordinated and you'll be fine. The room was clean. The beds and pillows were super comfy. We had a view of a wall but the room still got good light. The wifi was free, good and fast (we were on 5th floor.) The business center was in good working order and we were successfully able to print things.The bath always had warm water. One thing to note -- when I refilled my water bottle from the sink, it came out a milky white. It turned out to be minerals and after a couple of minutes it cleared up. It was a little jarring, but I promise you will not die. Or, at least, I haven't yet.The best part of breakfast is that it exists. We had fruit, yogurt, donuts and cereal most mornings, but there were eggo-style waffles and hard-boiled eggs available. The coffee was really not that great, and I'm pretty easy in that department ... so I'd suggest really gussying it up with sugar/milk, making your own in the room (coffee maker) or going out. The breakfast room was large and clean. The hotel lobby is very nice and modern with plenty of places to sit. There was only one elevator, but we never had to wait long and it was always in working order. The hotel contains only 79 rooms. We were able to check in an hour early which was of great help to us, and it marks the first time EVER we have been able to check in early anywhere in NYC.If you get your parking ticket from the garage listed on the hotel's website validated, you will get a great rate. We parked our car for 3.5 days and only paid $78. That is an amazing rate in Manhattan! They do charge more for SUVs or luxury cars, but we just have a dopey old Toyota.I'm not sure where the staff-to-rave-about was. In all of our time there we only had one perky person ever say hello to us when we entered the lobby. And the maids were very nice. The rest never made eye contact or offered any sort of greeting. They were not impolite, just not very friendly. It's NYC though, those hard, jaded city people!Honestly, an overall good experience. I would stay again.

The food was great with choices like toast, muffins, doughnuts, bagels (really fresh and tasty!), yoghurt and cereals as well as tea/coffee/orange juice. The breakfast room was fairly large and was never busy when we ate around 7:30 (although I would imagine it could get difficult to get to the food once it gets a little later).

We picked this hotel due to the fantastic location, trip advisor reviews and low price. We were not disappointed. This is a no thrills hotel right in the centre of Manhattan, a stone's throw away from Times Square - the perfect location for first time visitors to the city! The room was small and basic but the bed was exceptionally comfortable. Our room was at the front of the hotel which was fairly noisy - not from people on the street but things like dustbin trucks at 4am. We were advised about the noise on check in and offered a quieter room from the following day but they didn't have any others that night. My mum woke up a few times during the night but I was not disturbed as I am used to the noise living in London. However, we did not feel the need to change rooms.The room also had a coffee machine and free tea bags and coffee sachets.The bathroom was basic but shower was very powerful and got nice and hot. Towels, toiletries and hairdryer all included. Our hairdryer broke on the first use but it was replaced immediately on calling reception. The breakfast again was very basic but adequate and kept us full until lunchtime each day for no additional cost - bagels and toast with cream cheese, yoghurts, donuts, boiled eggs, oatmeal pots and tea, coffee and orange juice. I wouldn't recommend the coffee! Finally, all of the staff were exceptionally friendly.We would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a comfortable place to sleep during your stay in New York in an extremely central location.

The free confidential breakfast did not skimp on options and included fresh donuts, cereal, waffles, yogurt, fruit and a variety of other choices.The double room itself was a bit on the small side - for example, if someone is sitting at the desk, there is no room to walk in front of the beds to get to the bathroom. But, we weren't in the room very much and since we are both young, we could just climb over the beds. But, it is something to note for people with physical limitations. The room was clean, the beds were very comfortable, and the most pleasant surprise of all - the room was very quiet, even on the second floor. We stayed there for a week and I never heard so much as a single siren from outside, despite being less than a block away from Times Square. Indeed, the only sound the permeated the room was the sound of church bells from the late-1800s church next door, which was actually quite nice. If I wasn't already up when they were ringing, they did not wake me. The sound of other doors slamming was pretty loud, but there was almost none of that after 11:00 PM or so. This may seem silly, but my favorite thing was the window-seat style window frame in the bathroom. When space is limited, having that extra shelf to place things on, such as a change of clothes when showering, was a real life saver. Wi-Fi was free, fast and easy to use. No problems at all. And finally location. The location of this hotel could not be better, especially if you're a Broadway lover me. As I already mentioned, the hotel is less than a block away from Times Square and as such, all the major Broadway theaters are a ten minute walk or less. We were able to see a show every night we were in the city because our close proximity to the theater box offices allowed us to be there when they opened in the morning. All the must-see sights of mid-town Manhattan are easily within walking distance and those that are downtown or uptown can be quickly reached by subway.The official pictures of the hotel are accurate. I would stay at this hotel again without hesitation. It was an all around excellent experience.","Hilton Head, South Carolina",17,5.0

It's very convenient for that due to its location, and is only one block from the subway lines that go down to Herald Square (a couple blocks from Penn Station, I arrive/go by train). The rooms have comfortable beds, are clean and well-equipped. I always ask for a room that does NOT look over the street for quiet reasons, and one away from the elevator although that tip is true for any hotel. This hotel is considerate in that they have door closers on the doors leading to the elevator foyer, unlike many hotels where they can slam. The front desk staff is polite and helpful. I don't eat breakfast so have no opinion and don't care about that. They have a coffeemaker in the room. The rooms are small, of course, but I've had smaller in the budget category (like the Paramount nearby). This hotel has extremely reasonable rates compared to any nearby hotel that I know of, sometimes by hundreds of dollars (not usually that bad, but recently I was there over Columbus Day weekend and nearby moderate hotels were charging $500 or more a night for some reason I couldn't figure and this hotel was less than $300). It's easy to walk to decent restaurants in hell's kitchen or west of Broadway. Of course it is a total zoo right around Times Square itself, I would never stay here if I weren't going to the theater as the crowds can be so bad you have trouble walking in the streets. It's just a good location for short theater trips and convenient subway access. YOu can walk east a few blocks to the buses that go up Madison to the museums or come down Fifth to return, also. The only thing I don't like about this hotel is the TV is set parallel to the bed due to the room configuration of walls/windows, which makes it difficult to watch TV easily.

Check-in was quick and smooth; the lobby has two generously-sized seating areas and the 'business center' consists of two desktop computers in a corner of the lobby. There is just one elevator to serve the hotel's 9 floors but the waiting times weren't too bad.

The hotel is located in a perfect place. You get out of the hotel turn right and you are already at the heart of Times Square. 15 min walk to central park. They have breakfast included, which is very good and very convenient. They have a variety of stuff like pancakes, waffles, eggs, bagels, donuts, butter and cream cheese for the bread. They also have yogurt milk juice coffee tea , bananas apple. I loved it, plus you don't need to spend more money on breakfast cuz its already included. They have computers wifi and printers, we had to print out boarding pass and we used their printer. Also, for the check out you can leave your luggage with them, they have a little room where they put them and they give you a little card for each bag so they know which one is yours. Which is awesome because you don't have to be walking around the city with your stuff. That way you can enjoy your last hours in NY. The only thing I didn't like was last day, the guy that was in charge of the luggage room, he was nice at first but at the end he was kind of telling us stupids for using uber. He said that ""in NY you don't do Uber, because of the traffic "" idk how am I supposed to get to the airport, I think he said that because they can call someone to pick you up if you want to, I guess they get commission for it and he was upset cuz we used uber instead.

Our reservation was booked through applecorehotels and when we arrived many hours prior to check-in (7:30am), without asking, the manager was happy to hold our luggage until our room was ready, and offered us breakfast (although we technically weren't guests yet)! The breakfast host was friendly and did a good job keeping items stocked. Breakfast included yogurt, muffins, pancakes, waffles, boiled eggs, donuts, oatmeal, tea, juice and coffee... no meat.Since the hotel was able to hold our luggage, this allowed us time to get an early start wandering the city. The subway we used most often 49th/7th was fairly easy to get to. We decided to take the train down to Staten Island to see Lady Liberty. By the time we took the ferry, stopped at the 9/11 memorial, and back to Midtown to shop at the Lego store, our room was ready by Noon... still hours earlier than expected!Upon check-in, I was able to get an additional discount using my AAA card!Our room was on the 5th floor, the doorman handled our belongings and the elevators were fairly quick. Our Deluxe King room was just spacious enough for the two of us. In room 507 there is no view, but it was quiet. Comfy bedding, coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator were the best features of the room, imo. The 2nd night I asked to change rooms and management was happy to oblige without question and moved us to room 907. Same layout, corner room, different view. We could see a bit of Times Square, the steeple of the church next door and the rooftop of a bar/restaurant. In addition, the price of the Deluxe King had gone down on their website, and I was able to take advantage of the discount. The room(s) ended up being $30-$60 per night cheaper than when I initially made my reservation. Winning!There is a 24 hour deli/grill/grocery right across the street from the hotel called Cafe Abbondanza and they have fresh foods, some grocery, and yummy made to order items that are reasonably priced. There is also seating upstairs. We shopped items for our fridge there and also at a Food Emporium on 8th. Upon check-out, the front desk was able to arrange car service to LaGuardia for a flat cash fee of $50. I think Uber would've been a little cheaper, but I didn't have a problem using their car service.Yes, I would definitely stay at this hotel again (only) if I wanted to be in the heart of it all and have a decent place to lay my head.","Columbus, Ohio",5,5.0

They have parking arrangements with a garage conveniently located just across the street at a discounted price so take advantage if you are driving in. I mistakenly noted only 1 guest on my reservation and the nice fellow at the desk only charged me an extra $15 instead of the usual $30 for having a second guest in the room (figured that was better than having my husband sleep in the lobby). The hotel is not opulent by any means but our room on the second floor, although lacking any view, was quiet, clean and had a nice comfortable bed. We also had a room safe in the closet, a mini fridge and microwave. Staff was friendly and although the continental breakfast they served was not spectacular, the bagels were nice and fresh and the coffee was very good.

(even with good orange juice, eggs and yoghurt) if one accepts it is all paper/plastic plates/cups/knifes , the rooms are nice in size and clean, and one has the option of late check-out even up to 3 p.m. if one is willing to pay for it. The only problem during our stay: the noise. While it was surprisingly quiet during the weekend, it was impossible to sleep without ear plugs all other nights. The windows are single pane which give no sound insulation at all, and all night long garbage trucks were shredding demolition waste from construction and renovation work going on around. We would definitely look next time for a hotel with insulating glass windows, as five nights without sleep do not ask for a repetition (and this although we had asked in our reservation for a quiet room, while we got only a street facing room, which maybe made it worse...)",Worms,26,3.0

I called the front desk to please remove the desk! Which they did! Very happy with their service but I do not recommend this hotel if you have more than two people to a room. We had 3 the first night and then just 2 the remaining time. For us 2 it was fine but 3 and 4 would be too cramped. And my friend kept her suitcase on the half the bed and I put mine where the desk was previously!! Also...the breakfast was all carbs. Besides boiled eggs that looked sketchy. I like hot eggs and bacon and fruit. The fruit was apples and bananas. Well...we got bananas one day. No other days. Overall...I wouldn't choose this hotel again...there was also a fight in the hallway around 3am that frightened me. Screaming men n the hallway.

The room was nice, but small. I had 2 plumbing issues. If i turned on the shower to the right temperature the whole room vibrated. So I had to either take a cold shower or a too hot shower. Obviously I took the cold route. I told the front desk that I had the problem and also that the toilet ran incessantly. The next morning I told them the problem had not been fixed. The 3rd morning I just let it bang and bang. My friend said to me ""did you hear all that construction at 8 this morning?"" and I explained what was going on. I waited for the manager to come in and told her that I felt that if they couldnt fix the problem they should have let me know. She knew nothing about it so I brought her up to the room and let her hear the noise. At 6 that evening she was still waiting for a plumber. The next morning it was fixed. I asked if my bill could be reduced somewhat because of my inconvenience. The front desk girl said no.I went to get my car and they rang up the bill and I said that I was told the parking was $26/ day not $55. He said I needed a stamp from the hotel. No one told me I needed a stamp. They only told me the parking was half price if I was staying at the hotel. I asked if he could cancel my transaction and rerun it if I went back to get a stamp. He said no. I hate feeling cheated. Life is tough enough without having the deck stacked against you. The bellman was very grumpy and said he hated working there. He said he is underpaid and can't wait to find another job. That's not my problem and I don't want to hear his woes.

I did not pick this hotel to stay in - a relative did but I enjoyed my stay very much. This hotel, (not to be confused with its sister hotel - The Hotel at Times Square) was off of the crazy Broadway but is a very convenient location if you are going to a Broadway show. The rate was reasonable and check in was a breeze. We were given an upgraded room because our room style wasn't ready when we checked in - EARLY! That was nice. In fact, everyone employee we encountered - the check-in and check-out clerks, housekeeping staff, the breakfast room attendant- were all very nice and professional. The hotel is small and the hallways are tiny. I was glad I didn't have a big suitcase. That might have made it hard to navigate out of the elevator. The room was a normal NYC size room. The bed was very comfortable. It wasn’t the most luxurious room I’ve every stayed in but it was clean and had everything you needed and more. It came with free wi-fi, a microwave and refrigerator which I wouldn’t have expected for the rate. We were lucky to get a room at the back of the hotel so we didn’t hear any street noise. The lotion, soap and shampoo were in refillable pumps which I had never seen before in a hotel and have mixed feelings about. On one hand, it is very smart and eco-friendly for a hotel to have. But on the other, I do like having a bar of soap in the shower. I was disappointed that the windows didn’t open. We love fresh air whenever possible. There isn’t a restaurant or bar on premises but the free, extensive, continental breakfast was all we needed to get started in the morning and there were plenty of places all around for our meals and nightcaps.

We had the benefit of reserving the hotel by way of free cancellation through booking.com up to one day before arrival so we did have that to fall back on.We made the right decision to fulfil the booking.Most hotels you attend will normally have a welcoming reception which looks very smart. This one was no exception. On the same floor was an area to use the Internet and print were required free of charge. Further down was a very small room which houses a running machine, bike and cross trainer. We never used it but would of if we hadn't done so much walking !!Staff were in attendance at all times and were very helpful.The main seated area was the breakfast room. This does have UK football on match days which was handy when we ate our breakfast one morning at 1000. Breakfast is included within the price and is excellent and offers the following :Toast (make yourself)BagelsFruitYoghurtPorridgeDonutsTea, Coffee and juiceAll help yourself but a member of staff was normally round so it's nice to drop him a couple of dollars as he does keep the area clean.Tea and coffee is available anytime free of charge.Our room was on the top floor and whilst looking old was clean and acceptable. Lots of plugs available for charging phones, laptops etc. TV was good as the reception was quality with a large amount of channels on offer. There was a heater in the room which was AC or Heat with the latter being on as it was -17 outside during our stay. There was a large wardrobe for the storage of clothes as well as your cases. Within this area there was also a safe which was free and very easy to operate.WIFI is available in the room with no restrictions on the number of items which connected. Signal was excellent throughout the stay with the odd refresh of the connection if you wanted to FaceTime.Bathroom was today albeit it cold but when the door was closed you couldn't feel how cold it was. It did however ice up on one morning giving the water we bought a nice cold taste. It was a very small bath so more a shower use but it was very difficult to get the shower to work to a temperature which wasn't burning hot.Location wise, what can you say - excellent !! Come out the hotel , turn right and walk 200 yards and you are on Times Square. Access to the majority of Broadway shows within 10 minutes, subway within two minutes. 5th Avenue was a 10-15 minute walk left out the hotel with Macy's about 12 blocks away but lots to look at on route.There are a number of bars opposite the hotel and all sold food. We didn't visit these but noticed that the prices appeared reasonable for the area and they did have happy hours every night. There is also an excellent deli offering fresh sandwiches should you not wish to venture out or if you are waiting for a transfer to the airport.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. So much so, we will be booking there next time we stay and my wife has recommended it for her girlie trip next year.

We were very pleased as we found the hotel to be very clean and very close to Time Square. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. We arrived a couple of hours before check in but they put us in our room right away. The room was on the small side and did not have a view (we were on the back of the hotel which was beneficial for sleeping) but we did not need a large room as it was just the two of us. The bed was comfortable and the room had all the amenities that we needed. The free breakfast was continental but it was appreciated. The hotel lobby, workout room and dining room are not large but we were not there to hang around the hotel.

It is right in around the corner from Times square. Took us literally less than 1 minute to walk there. We hot-wired and got this hotel at like $100 a night which was pretty great considering where it is!It is right beside a T.G.I.F's restaurant if you get hungry and across the street is a variety store and a bunch of bars! LCOATION:Perfect location. Right around the corner from main square in times square! Make sure you don't miss it. The sign for the hotel is small so keep your eyes peeked. Its right beside TGIF! ROOMS:Rooms are a good size with a bed, and a desk and the bathroom is normal! Read lots of reviews complaining about the size of the room. This room isn't any smaller than any other hotel room i've stayed in. The hallways and elevator are tiny but the rooms aren't bad. It has a bed and the bathroom has a toilet, and shower ... all you need. The rooms also have a small tv and a radio/alarm clock! We didnt get a nice view but thats okay! We were in room 300 and we actually had a view of a brick wall ahaha BREAKFAST:Continental breakfast from 6-10 am in the downstairs room (small - all there is, is a lobby and the breakfast room).Lots of choices for breakfast!! There is pancakes, waffles, fruit (banana's & apples), toast, jam, bagels, muffins, cinnamon rolls, cereal, oatmeal, boiled eggs, etc. There is also coffee, and tea which they have all day in the kitchen/ breakfast room. We always took a couple bananas and apple for the road!! GYM:Right off the lobby. Very small. Only has 3 machines. A treadmill, bike and elliptical. Went all 3 days i was there and never saw anyone using it. Also has a water machine in there so you can fill up your water bottle!! So you don't need to buy one when you are out. Just reuse yours and fill the water up there.Overall a great stay! The front desk staff is very nice and the one gentleman that woks in the breakfast hall is super nice and helpful!

Just got back from a two day stay and I just might not book here again. I reserved 2 rooms at the hotel for this recent stay when I was there in August. Two days before my arrival this past week, I received my customary ""Pre Arrival Confirmation"" stating I was confirmed for my 2 rooms. Upon checking in, I was told by Julio that my reservations were canceled due to my credit card being canceled and that there were not 2 rooms available. He said there was nothing he could do. I had been using that credit card continuously so I honestly could not understand how this would happen. This, despite the fact that I had my confirmation from the hotel, and this, despite the fact, that I stay at this hotel a minimum of 4 to 5 times every year. I was very upset and embarrassed. Julio said he could try to find us another hotel but I didn't want another hotel. Plus, it was the day of the Christmas Tree lighting in Rockefeller Center (Dec 1) so it would probably be a bit difficult. When I spoke to the manager, she finally did find us the two rooms I had reserved by changing someone from one room to another. I called my credit card company and they said my card was never denied by any company, including this hotel. Later that afternoon, we observed the SAME thing happening to another guest. Maybe it was the hotel's fault, not their guests! I still am unhappy about this, especially since I brought 3 friends with me. I was not treated like a guest and the manager and the hotel did nothing to make me feel like I should return.","Williamsville, New York",29,3.0

The best part was the location and the reasonable room rates. We were within walking distance to most broadway shows, bus lines, Times Square, The Rock and many others.

Loved the boutique style of the hotel as we felt it offered so much more than any of the larger hotels. Can't fault this hotel at all as it was everything that we needed and the check out time of 12pm was ok too as there is a luggage room with an attendant so all of your luggage remains safe while you explore the city.

One of the reviews did mention that it was a little noisy. Since we were only staying over one night and we were exhausted when we came back to the room we did not notice any noise. Well, you got to remember it's close to Times Square so any hotel in and around that location will be very busy. I would definitely go back. The total price, which included a continental breakfast was $278 for the one night. The hotel actually gave us an upgrade which I think it was a queen size bed to a king size bed.

They have friendly staff and the location is near Times Square. So what is the problem you say ? Well, the rate quoted for the room initially for a weeks' stay was from $ 124.99 to $ 224.99 per night and each day had a different rate. At first I thought that it might be because of the weekend but upon reflection the $ 124.99 and $ 224.99 both were on a Sunday so that ruled out the time of the week as a varying factor. The only thing that made sense was the expected occupancy factor. Since I made the reservation only a few days before arriving I was given a lower rate the first Sunday and a $ 100.00 more the second Sunday and each day in between a different rate.This practice I find very annoying and objectionable that I am paying a different rate each day for the same room and same amenities. I discovered the answer. I would call reservations every day to get a price quote for the remaining days of my stay and if it was a saving of $ 100.00 or more I would check out the next morning and then check back in - same room.On one occasion the front desk told me they could not check me back in because the hotel was full, to which I replied ""no"" I just checked out. They checked me back inAt times it is annoying to have to play this game but when the savings are substantial a tourist can well justify the process. If only the hotel would give a fair price up front for all the days a tourist is there then the feeling of being ripped off would go away.The last time I booked in for three days and I ended up checking out three times because of the large pricing fluctuation. Possibly if more travellers engaged in this process the hotel would reconsider their objectionable pricing structure and make it more palatable.","Toronto, Canada",41,3.0

The hotel desk told us that they would find us another hotel to stay in but couldn't find anything for over an hour. When the desk agent finally said she found us another place, it was all the way across the bridge in Queens. This was not satisfactory as we were in NYC to do some sight seeing in Manhattan and enjoy staying near Times Square. So the search continued. Soon after that, a family of 3 came into the hotel and were given a room immediately. So much for having no rooms available. After this, I began to express my frustration in an appropriate but firm manner. Once I pushed on the desk agent a little bit, a room magically appeared for us and we stayed in the hotel. Once we were given a room, the stay was great. I just wish 1) the hotel would have warned us ahead of time if there were no rooms, 2) Given us the room that was clearly open before waiting for 2 hours.","Ann Arbor, Michigan",1,3.0

The bathroom was good size, with bathtub and hand held spray, but it was too short. Towels were thick and fluffy and changed daily. Liquid soap and shampoo, so if to do not like liquid, better bring a bar of soap. We requested a fridge and microwave which we had. Large flat screen TV with many channels including foreign. The lobby is clean and has seating area and 2 computers. The breakfast room is larger than normal and the selection of food was adequate to start your day, youghurt, breads, danish, eggs, cereals, coffee, and juices. 2 elevators and short wait time. There are 5 steps from the street so pulling bags is difficult, but they do have a wheelchair lift. If you are driving, as you pull into 46th st. from 7th ave, the parking garage is on your right. Do not pass it because you will have to go all around 3 blocks to get back. The hotel is on the left side of the street mid block. Have hotel stamp your parking ticket for a $26/day rate. Do not request top floor, 9th fl. as we did, because the air conditioning units are on the roof and they rattle on and off all night long.

We spent little time at the hotel, using it as a hub to change clothes and sleep. We would leave early every morning after breakfast, spend all day around the city, and returning each night around 11pm for great people watching. Walking distance to many attractions, and close to the subway. We felt very safe in and around the hotel. Parking across the street was discounted with validated ticket by hotel staff.

Upon arriving in the hotel, a member of staff greeted us and after asking if we wished to check in, helped us haul our bags up the steps to the hotel check in desk. We waited for a few minutes whilst another guest was being helped. The desk clerk was friendly and polite and made small talk with us whilst checking us in. We were inside our room within minutes and were pleasantly surprised how spacious it was as we'd read negative reviews about room sizes. Everything worked, the room was clean...look, we did the 'seasoned traveler' thing of peering upside down at the sink and the shower stall etc..and yes it wasn't 'brand new' looking, but it WAS clean and tidy and was cleaned every day whilst we were there. The hotel maids are polite and helpful too and replenished our coffee/tea etc daily too. I guess if you walk in like a hotel inspector then you can find fault if you keep looking for stuff but as a whole it was one of the cleanest hotels we've stayed in, and we've stayed in a heck of a lot of hotels. The breakfast room was open 24/7 and we wandered in at different times to grab a coffee or a free newspaper. It's a nice space to sit and relax if you don't want to be holed up in your room. The breakfast was okay too. Again we had seen some negative comments, but personally I feel this is harsh as the food offered (and there's plenty of it!) was of a very good standard. Again the staff on duty are helpful and polite. The free wifi never dropped out once in the week we stayed. The TV worked the whole time too. Only issue we had was our key which locked us out of our room one afternoon, but the cleaning lady and desk clerk sorted it between them and we were issued with fresh keys in minutes. Given the location, and having stayed at the hotel, I am even more amazed by the hotel, the price, the facilities, and the staff who helped us. They are a credit to the hotel and the company and helped us whenever called upon, right up to storing our bags safely for the day after we checked out. We used the free printing/internet on the computer in the lobby for printing our bus tickets to the airport, which was convenient for us. One other thing to note is that even though it is 2 minutes walk from times square, we had no issue with noise, either from the street or from other guests.

The place is clean and comfortable, although the rooms are small. They are well-furnished, which does make for a bit less room to move around. Could probably do with smaller desk and TV cabinet. The location is terrific for attending theater, restaurants, shopping and subway. As two women traversing the streets after plays, we never felt the least bit inclined to need a taxi for safe passage. The areas around this hotel are well-traveled.

After I booked this room I noticed there was a price change two times where lower rates were offered. I simply called the hotel and spoke with them and they gladly matched the lower rate without hassle.  My flight was cancelled after we were already on board the plane. This was due to an aircraft sliding off the runway at a New York airport. The airports were closed and there was no way to get to New York to honor our reservations. I immediately called the hotel to cancel the reservation. I was transferred and could not find anybody that had ""access"" to my reservation. My reservation was always available when they changed me to a lower rate. I finally was given a number to the manager and I left her a message. She promptly returned my call, but advised me there was nothing they could do because charges are made through the computer and nobody there had a way to override this. They charged me for the first night even though the airports were closed. The amount I was charged was approximately $25 more than they told me it would be.

Asked for the manager who had quite a righteous attitude and also didn't really feel any sense of responsibility for our situation. ""The maximum I can give you is 10% ($28) off the last night"" she said. I didn't have time to argue any further as I had a 7-hr flight to catch (unwashed!!!).

Staff greeted us warmly and made efforts throughout our stay to remember our names and preferences. One of our rooms was on the 6th floor and the other on the 3rd. We found the 3rd floor room to be quieter because it was to the back of the property. Our 6th floor room faced the front of the hotel and we heard a lot of street noise, but nothing we couldn't handle. The room were spacious by NYC standards, very clean, and well-equipped. Housekeeping came by daily and we never had any complaints. The free breakfast was typical and perfectly adequate for our morning start. Coffee was especially good! The best thing was the location: less than a block off Times Square on 46th street and an easy walk to most of our activities. The night staff was especially friendly and helpful.

I went to the front desk and told them about this issue and requested to be moved to a different room. I was told the hotel was booked and there were no rooms available.

Although this is a chain, it's a small one...unknown to me at the time. I booked our room at a decent rate for the area,after doing some research to make sure it got fairly decent reviews. It started out very well with the quick, friendly, efficient check in. It only got better. Since our room was quite small...not a problem because we were only in the room to sleep at night, we asked the bellman, George, if we could have an extra luggage rack. It was in our room when we returned from our first trip out of the hotel. George was always friendly, upbeat, and helpful. Indeed an asset to the hotel. There is another bellman who is equally as efficient and friendly, and an asset. The breakfast are quite routine, but hey...it's in the hotel and we didn't have to go hunt someplace else to eat. The Houseman handles the breakfast room, keeping it stocked, cleaned, and ready for all who take advantage of the meal. Another asset to the hotel.Our room was always cleaned spotlessly when we returned from our days outing. I can only say good things about all those who work at this hotel. We asked for suggestions for a restaurant a couple of times...got great ideas, and used them! This place is definitely a gem for the otherwise busy, very expensive, Times Square area. We walked to GCT and to our Broadway shows. It's in a perfect spot. I should say that anywhere you stay in NYC, you might want to have ear plugs just in case the noise bothers you. It's a busy, noisy city...no matter where your room might be. I am generally a light sleeper, but with earplugs I slept like a baby in the comfy bed. I've been to the city a few times before, and always stayed in one of the big chains on Broadway, never again....even though I might have free nights available. This is just a great place to feel 'at home' while on vacation. You are like one of their family while you're here. I saw them treat all their guests this way...so it wasn't just my husband and I.","La Grange, Texas",140,5.0

It's located less than a block away from Times Square and other sites. It is an incredible value for the money. This is a smaller hotel with only 79 rooms or so, so it's not too overwhelming. As others have said, it makes a great base to do some NYC exploring. The hotel is near both the Orange Line and the Yellow line metro, which is nice, but you may have to walk a little ways (or transfer) if those lines aren't where you're wanting to go.The room itself in the hotel was adequately sized, with a queen bed, nightstand, slim dresser and table. It was also very clean. Nothing was outdated. Even the bathroom had ample space for the shower, sink (single sink) and towels. They have dispensers for soap, lotion by the sink and for shampoo and bath soap in the shower. The water pressure wasn't as high as what I'm used to perhaps, but nothing horrible. Also, the bed was not as firm as I'm used to (it seemed a little to ""squishy"") for me, but I slept okay in the room. Since this is a small hotel, you should know that it has narrow hallways. (I was glad I only had a backpack with me because I'm certain that anything more than a small carry-on luggage size suitcase would be difficult to fit width-wise in the hallways). The staff at the hotel was very nice and offered directions to anywhere we needed to go. Also, they told us about their free business center where you can make print-outs of tickets or reservations if needed. They also have free Wi-fi that worked great.The included breakfast was just okay for me. They had a variety of foods (mini-muffins, bagels, bread, pastries, a few cereals, yogurt, fruit, pancakes & eggs) but the pancakes were cold and the eggs were a little on the runny side. But...you can't beat it for something quick to eat before beginning your day. I guess if you don't expect that much for breakfast, then you'll be happy with what you get. Lastly, don't expect a view from your room, as this hotel is tucked in among other buildings, and there are only 9 floors, so my view was an office building (I was there to sightsee, so the view from my room wasn't important overall).

If you are doing NYC right, you are never in your rooms though. The entrance to the hotel is very nice and clean. Breakfast area was nice as well, but the breakfast definitely left a lot to be desired. We were located in room 908, which is the top floor in the back of the building. There is a roof top bar at the back of the building and you can hear people talk and the music going to late into the night. Never really heard any noise from other rooms though, that is a plus. The only real complaint we had about our room was the damp musty smell. It hit you as soon as you walked into the room. You could see signs of moisture and mold in the bathroom. The window in the bedroom constantly had condensation on it. This definitely bothered my wife more then it did me. The water pressure was also terrible and our tub didn't drain well. I just chalked those up to being a really old building. I think 90% of this buildings/rooms problems could be fixed with new windows. I really think this would fix the moisture problem and the noise problem you have read in multiple reviews. Overall it wasn't terrible or great.

We seriously had to horizontally edge our way around the beds to reach the bathrooms; the beds were so close to the bureau that it was not possible to open the drawers more than a crack. The bathroom, however, was a decent size and there was a sufficiently sized closet. The business center was also a minus.

Located on W46th Street a couple of hundred yards from Times Square, the hotel's position could not be better for many of the attractions in and around Times Square and is opposite O'Brien's Irish Pub, a good watering hole. Our room on the sixth floor was small but, by New York standards, of average size. A comfortable queen bed and good sized TV, together with coffee maker and an ice bucket (ice available on the ground floor) were all provided, but no fridge. Free wi-fi was available throughout the hotel and two computers in the lobby, complete with printer, allowed us to check-in for our return flights and print our boarding passes before departure. The bathroom was of reasonable size and included a walk-in shower with glass door. Shower gel, shampoo and soap dispensers were provided and kept topped up.Breakfast was included and was an enhanced self service continental type with scrambled eggs available as well as the usual muffins, bagels, toast, cereal and yoghurt. All supplies were rapidly replaced with fresh produce as they became diminished. Coffee and tea is available 24/7 from the breakfast room.The best thing about the hotel was the staff. They could not have been more helpful and friendly passing on tips about transport and where to find various local amenities. The staff even advised us to purchase a phone card at $5 rather than use their own costly in-room telephones! We were also advised to take a minibus to Newark Airport on our departure at a cost of $25 per person rather, than a taxi at $90 plus tolls. This proved to be a great saving and was an excellent suggestion, the driver dropping us off at the correct level at the correct terminal.All-in-all this was an enjoyable stay made more so by the attitude of the staff. I would definitely recommend to others.","Paphos, Cyprus",16,4.0

We were arriving very late on the first day and leaving very early on the third so planned very little time at the hotel. The rate was about $300 per night including taxes. However, after arriving with our luggage (and walking past all the homeless people camped out for the night right outside the door), we were told there was an electrical problem with our room and they sent us to a sister hotel about a block away. Really? They had our phone number and could not have notified us of the change? The ""doorman"" didn't bother to open the door on our way in our out and just pointed down the street when we asked where we were going. After arriving at the Hotel@Times Square, we were told the rate was the same (even though I looked online at the time and the rate was significantly lower). The desk person said they couldn't change the rate given at a sister hotel and I could take it up with the manager. That policy makes no sense, especially since we'd booked a king room and ended up with a queen sized bed. Then they were going to send up back to the original hotel the 2nd night. I said we wouldn't move so we were given the room for 2 nights. Personally, I think that they sent us to the lower rate room so the higher rate room was available for last minute reservations. I will rate the Hotel@Times Square in a separate review. Both hotels have great locations, but are lacking other benefits. I think, with a little research, you can do better for your money.

I chose this hotel because of its proximity to Times Square (oh, and complimentary breakfast) and I'm not kidding, it is crazily close! It was great for us visiting Port Authority, Central Park, American Museum of Natural History, Rockefeller Centre/TOTR, Radio City Hall etc.Our room was located on 5th floor and had a view of W 46th street below which was great so we could dress for the weather. Ours came with a queen bed, had a cooler fan (which I reckon could use with an upgrade - it was noisy and the grill/cover was falling off), coffee maker, a bathroom with the usual shampoo and soap and shower/bathtub combo. There was no mini fridge in our room.The complimentary breakfast was also good, with offerings of donuts, pastries, oats, fruits, yogurt, eggs, tea/coffee etc. There is also a microwave here which was a bonus so we could heat up any leftover takeaway.If you're after yummy Chinese food, give John's Shanghai across the road a go. There are 2 computers in the lobby area as well where printing is complimentary. The gym room had a cold water machine which was great cos we filled our bottles each morning prior to our day out.Housekeeping didn't clean our room a couple of times after we had removed the 'Do not disturb' sign and there was one particular housekeeper who wasn't very friendly.There is a church next door and there were a few homeless people sleeping outside, but that did not affect my stay in any way.Majority of the staff were friendly and helpful. I would definitely choose to stay here again and recommend this to my friends thinking of visiting NYC.","Brisbane, Australia",208,4.0

It is within walking distance from Central Park, Rockefeller's centre 5 th Avenue, grand Central. Even Empire State and Macy's are not that far away. We came for the count down but we didn't queue like many people since weather was freezing, but because of the location, we were still able to go out around 11.30 pm on New year eve and be part of the crowd for the New Year Count down and immersed ourselves in the spirits of joy,The staff are friendly and helpful especially those whom I have met before on my previous stay. The rooms are small but adequate and clean. The hotel provide a good breakfast with eggs, cereal, bread, yogurt, fruits, coffee tea and juices.

I didnt find many thing wrong and would highly recommend. I had a room at the back so wasnt bothered with outside noise but there is abit of noise from the corridor. The doors slam and there was someone in the room next to me that kept going in and out about 10 times in the mornings and afternoons slamming the doors which was really annoying. The rooms are good size and had everything i needed. The shower ran cold though after only a couple of minutes so have to be quick. Having a room at the back was great for the winter as window is a view of a wall, i didnt open the windows so dont know if this will be good in summer when you would want fresh air. There isnt a fridge so i kept my drinks on the window sill with the curtain closed it kept my water very cold.I only had my room cleaned twice as travelling along and dont require services everyday, i put the private sign on the door and on two occassion housekeeping rang to see if i required cleaning, this both happened whilst having afternoon nap and on one occassion rang twice and then knocked on door which annoyed me as woke me up. Room was great size for one person bed kingsize but quite soft and pillows too soft for my personal liking.I only had breakfast one one occasion which was good and also like you can have tea and coffee during the day as and when you want.I kept myself to myself so didnt really ask reception for anything but they were polite when checking in and out.

The windows aren't allowed to be opened so you are stuck with a loud air conditioner or sweating when it is minus 5 degrees outside. The hallways smell like weed- funny because it is a non smoking building.The cleaning staff only half finished their job- pillows left thrown on the side of the half made bed.The shower only stays hot for one person- a bit hard when there is two of us.The bathroom is unclean and has other peoples hair stuck to the walls (not sure if it was actually clean before we got here)The check in staff were a bit short with us, but they did store our stuff for us when we arrived a few hours before we could check in.The brochure says that vending machines are available- this is not true meaning you have to leave the hotel to get refreshments- no mini fridge either to keep stuff cool if you do want to stock up on beverages.Not having an issue with outside noise at this point- we are a fair way to the back of the hotel and up 7 floors.Elevator is slow- quicker to walk the 7 flights of stairs.The rooms are quite tiny which makes it a lot harder with the general heat of the room.All in all, you are paying for the location- which is fine, but the main point of your hotel room in NY is to shower and sleep- neither of which you can actually do comfortably here.I am not normally one to complain, but I don't think that the reviews here give the best overview of the hotel but more the location.location is definitely a 10.","Melbourne, Australia",0,2.0

Fruit was in good supply. The guy working in the kitchen was working hard to keep supply.

We couldn't hear the noise of the city at all in our room and the free breakfast was an added bonus. The hotel was all smoke free as well! The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. They helped us navigate around the city. The lady there was great. She gave my kids each a card that had the hotel name on it and address to put in their pocket in case they got lost, then they could show someone their card. SiDiBi, the baggage man, was the best! He was so nice to my kids. He really made my son feel great and like he had a friend. They even took a picture with him before we left. :) I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are staying in Manhattan. The price was right for being in New York, you get free breakfast, and it is close to everything. We will definitely stay here again if we go back!","Lehi, Utah",6,5.0

The two negatives: (1) I showed up to check in at 10pm and the one room they had left (note: I reserved a three night stay in advance) had a leak in it, so they sent me one block away to the Night Hotel on 47th (formerly the Stay Hotel). It wasn't ideal, but I rolled with it. (2) The other negative -- the hotel really didn't offer any consolation for my inconvenience. I didn't ask, but they should have offered something. Positives: Value - much cheaper than the Marriott Marquis and the Renaissance which are right in Times Square. The Broadway hotel is just a half block off of Times Square but much less expensive. And it's a nice and clean hotel. Modern and updated but not over the top. Nice furniture in the lobby, breakfast area, and rooms. The size of my room was average, but good. A little smaller than the rooms at the hotels mentioned above, but def. larger rooms that at the Night Hotel. The free breakfast was very good for my taste--It wasn't a hot breakfast, but they had bagels, toaster, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, and fresh apples and bananas. Wi-fi was free and worked fine. The staff were friendly when spoken to, but they didn't go out of their way. There's a fair amount of construction work going on, and it woke me up around 6:30 am one morning.

First of all, do not be turned off by the small size of the hotel. Yes compared to some of the chains in Times Square it is small, but it really makes up for the size in charm and cleanliness. The staff is accomodating and helpful and you really cant beat the location. Half a block from Broadway, how can you not like that?! I was also quite pleasantly surprised by how fast the wifi was here. Faster than in some of the larger chains hotels in the area. Yes you will say that a smaller hotel will have fewer people and fewer people hitting the network, but i have stayed at another boutique hotel closer to Central Park and the wifi there was abysmal. Here it was like i was back at my home network, easily able to send a ton of emails and stream vids if i wanted too. The room was a tad larger than i had anticipated which made me that much happier. I asked for a room overlooking 46th and i got two windows, small ones, but it was still nice. The corridors are small and there is only one elevator. The key here is to ask for a lower floor room and just take the stairs. It is better for you anyway. Breakfast was what I thought it would be, no omlet stations or anything like that, but a reasonable amount of choices. There was some door slamming by other residents, but this cant be avoided anywhere you go. I did have some issues with the Lodgenet movie services, but the staff did refund the movies that did not work back to me. Bottom line, if you dont want to spend upwards of 400+ in a room you will only be sleeping in, then this is a nice choice for you.

The location of this hotel is amazing, so close to Times Square yet you hear none of the noise. The staff on the front desk were always pleasant and helpful, the room and bathrooms were always clean, although small, and the free breakfast more than adequate to begin the day. The main negative for us was the room seemed very stuffy, even after putting the air on and there were signs saying not to open any windows. Also the only elevator was very slow at times and we would usually be happy to take the stairs except we were on the 7th floor! Otherwise this hotel was very good value for money for New York and I would probably stay again.","Perth, Australia",32,4.0

Clean. Decently decorated. Bed was comfortable and good night sleep was had.Other areas of the hotel: Reception and cafeteria areas were modern, sleek and minimal. Hallway of the second floor we stayed was surprisingly narrow and short. We heard people talking down the hallway while we were in the room but we weren't too bothered as they weren't loud. Workout room was very small (two running machines fit tightly). Staff: Friendly and casual.Breakfast: Self-serve with one helpful attendant refilling items (and to watch us behave). Plenty of bagels, breads, donuts, cereals, boiled eggs, orange & apple juice, yogurts, coffee, tea, bananas and oranges. Overall: We were happy to sleep there after a long full day. We'll probably return for a last minute theater visit. The price was on higher end for us ($255 queen size bed), but we understood that we were paying for the premium location. We were able to make the best of our short 30 hour visit. About the street: There was a church next door to the hotel which held a fantastic free recital on Saturday we arrived. The street got a little sketchy in the evening (11pm) as we walked back to the hotel but felt safe enough walking by as a pair.Extra info-1: You may feel a little cramped if you were looking to spend some time to relax in the room. It's a good place for a good night sleep after a busy day in town and a breakfast to get you started the following morning. Extra info-2: We booked through booking.com which gave us $10 off. We called the hotel to confirm our reservation just to make sure as we read some iffy reviews about booking.com. We did not have any problem.",Massachusetts,3,4.0

If you're not planning to stay in your (rather small-ish) room for any amount of time, this is the best place for your money. We were in room 205, near the elevator with one queen bed. We thought the location of the room might be noisy near the elevator (no) and being so close to the business of NYC (not at all). The room was tastefully decorated and a 36"" flat screen was on the dresser at the foot of our bed. Not much space around the bed but we weren't in the room much. The bathroom was carefully laid out to maximize such a small space (just a shower, no bath tub) and was quite clean. May need to ask for more towels - barely enough for two people. The lobby is modern, the breakfast area is large, with tvs and comfortable seating. Morning breakfast was vast and plentiful (bagels, toast, cereal, juices, coffee, doughnuts, fresh fruit, boiled eggs), though the lay-out causes bottlenecks with many eager tourists trying to eat and run. Seemed to be a popular place for foreigners - not much english being spoken the morning we were there but a nice diverse crowd.The hotel gladly held our luggage for the day after we checked out and the staff was quite friendly.

The location is something which cannot be beaten doe the price and this is what sold the hotel to me, along with the plethora of good reviews, thanks for trip advisor reviewers. The hotel itself is good, its clean and comfortable and offers a lot of plusses included in the price, Free WiFi, Free breakfast and which as much as people complained about it, is free and is just toast, bagels, doughnuts cereal and coffee and juice so it does offer a lot for very little. Price wise as I've said, it cannot be beaten for location and comfort. We were offered room 901 and while this was a great room, the problem we found was the elevator, the staff seem to use it a lot to move cleaning carts from floor to floor and they can obviously override call up, so this means a few times the lift came up to floor 7, then went straight down, so my advise to any of you would be to ask for a lower floor and like other reviewers have said, ask for a location at the back, it does get a little noisy. When we first arrived the lobby was covered in dust sheets and there were workers hammering and sawing and there was an overwhelming smell of pain thinners and dust, this was a bit of a let down, but on a positive note the breakfast room is complete and I have attached a photo.

I depend on reviews from fellow travelers when booking new travel. The reviews for the most part were good so I took the plunge. When we arrived last Saturday.....it had been raining and we walked from Penn Station to the hotel....looking like drowned rats! We walked into the lobby and it was completely torn up under construction, temporary desk....looked rather shady. I became very concerned but the staff was very warm and welcoming, stating that the breakfast area had already been completed and they were renovating the lobby. We checked in and went up to our room. It is typical New York, small halls and tight on space, but the room was wonderful! King sized bed, full bathroom. Very Very Clean! All nicely decorated. True the view wasn't wonderful, looked at a wall and other windows, but hey this is New York City! It's a concerete jungle.....if you want a hotel view, go to the beach! For the price it is amazing! Full breakfast every morning including pastries, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt.....you just can't get any better. We came to New York a couple of years ago and were lucky enough to stay in the Mariott Times Square.....of course it was fancier....but we didn't get breakfast and paid significantly more for the room. If you are on a budget, don't hesitate - stay here! You are half a block off of the main portion of Times Square - great value and location. A couple of pubs across the street - got the Irish and Scottish covered! And you can just walk back across the street. In short, very nice hotel, great value, and welcoming staff.

We got a room in the 4th floor, a bit small and quite dark, we could not manage to open the window to get some fresh air, anyhow the room was OK (the type of room you can expect in NY for this price), the bathroom was spacious and had been recently renovated, but with no window. The room looked a bit tired but was decently clean. There is only 1 elevator, so at times it gets a bit slow, anyhow it was never a problem. We had free wi-fi in the room and breakfast was included. The breakfast room had been recently renovated, it is not very big but we never had to wait for a table. It looks like a hostel breakfast, do it yourself, but we had yogurt (also light!), fresh fruit, cereals, bagels, toasts with jam and so on, for us it was great but it is not the usual international breakfast with service. The location is unbelievable if you are interested in Broadway shows! 5 minutes walk from every theatre! Great great great!!! The staff was very friendly and helpful, we were very satisfied with our stay and will definitely come back!

The rooms were very clean, nicely furnished and fairly small. This is an older, quaint building, so the floors and rooms had a European feel, with only a few rooms per floor. The beds were great.

I knew NY was expensive, and coming from Australia where everything is expensive, I thought I wouldn't get any wallet shock from hotel rates. This was our first trip to NY, and since we only had 3 nights and 2 days to spend here, we wanted to stay in a hotel that was close to a lot of things but won't break the bank. Broadway at Times Square was just that - average hotel at a perfect location. The location didn't disappoint us - it was about a 1-2 minute walk to Times Square. The hotel itself was average - very small lobby, breakfast room and bedroom. But for the price we paid ($290/night for 3 adults and 1 kid, vs $450++ for other hotels in the same area), this was a good deal. Breakfast was also included in the price - buffet selection which had waffles, fruit danish bread, sausage, bagels, loaf bread, yogurt, fruits, fried eggs and unlimited coffee for the whole day. It was an average selection and quality was so-so, but still a great plus for the price we paid.The room itself had two double beds, and a reasonable sized bathroom. The room was quite small, there was about 0.25m distance between the beds and the walls, and about 1m distance between the two beds. It was quite a challenge fitting all our luggages and ourselves in the room. I would have preferred a bigger room, but again, we weren't really there to lounge around in the room. The room came with free wifi and cable tv.The concierge was very helpful, he gave us maps and was able to book us on the hop in hop off Greyhound tour. He also booked us for our trip to JFK, which was about an hour trip from the hotel.

The multinational staff here is nice. The room was small, but nicely renovated. Our biggest problem was the heat. There was some problem with how it is adjusted, since there are no thermostats for individual rooms. We actually turned on the window unit AC to cool off. The breakfast was adequate, but there was not enough seating; it looks like they are preparing a new room for that. Oh, and when the deak tells you that the parking garage (a GREAT discount) is right across the street, don't believe them. It is half a block before you get to the hotel.

We were very happy with our stay. For anyone looking for glitz or glamour, or spacious rooms suitable for a group, this is NOT your place. It is a small, clean, comfortable place that feels like a little European hostelry, with its small lobby and tiny lift. You stay here for the friendliness, the cleanliness, and the convenience, and brag about getting a very reasonable deal, not about staying in a la-di-da accommmodation!Staff at reception were very friendly. When we called late at night to ask for extra pillows, a member of staff arrived within minutes!Our room at the back of the hotel was very quiet and we were happy about that. And I cannot begin to tell you how well organized it was. In order to fit a king bed into a small space, someone went to a lot of trouble to figure out how to arrange the furniture. The console under the television is more than adequate for a couple medium- to large-sized pieces of luggage, and the drawers are deep and held all our clothes. There is a desk and there is a small closet. The bathroom has a low, deep sill and you could sit down on it if you needed to, or store toiletries on it. The only suggestion I might make is that there be an additional towel bar, as we couldn't easily hang up our damp towels unless we slung them over the shower rod, which only puts them in the way of your travel partner when he/she is ready to take a shower. If you have some sort of over-the-door hook or hanging clip you can stash in your suitcase, pending the installation of extra towel bars, that might do the trick.Please note that if you are traveling with someone else, and one of you might need to go into the bathroom and turn on the light while the other is sleeping, you should be aware that the bathroom door has a long frosted/reeded glass insert, and the bathroom light will shine through it. This could bother a light sleeper. I love the glass, but was glad I had my sleep mask with me.As to the water temperature - you might have to run the water for awhile but it will get hot.Breakfast was fine; personally I would like to have some more healthful selections, such as plain yogurt, rather than the sweet/fruity type; and some unsweetened cereal choices; but I realize my preferences might not be shared by most guests.

This was the first trip that I planned from start to finish (my husband usually handles the trip planning) and I wanted to make sure everything ran smoothly. I read through dozens of reviews on Trip Advisor and received a lot of useful information that helped with my decision. I read many horror stories about travelers reserving rooms with various hotel chains through third party sites only to find that their reservation was lost or the hotel was overbooked after arriving at the hotel. With that in mind, I reserved my room by calling the hotel's reservations line instead of booking my stay online. The reservationist was very helpful, answered all of my questions and immediately sent the confirmation email to me. They told me to bring my AAA card for a 5% discount and to call the day before checkin if I wanted to request a particular room. The week before my trip, they sent another confirmation/reminder email of the date of my check in.The day before my trip, I called to request a room facing 46th Street and they handled it without a problem. Checkin went smoothly the following day and the hotel honored the AAA discount. Once we entered our room, I followed the advice of other reviewers and immediately checked the room for signs of bed bugs. I didn't find any. The room was clean, cozy and perfect for my son and me. The bed was comfortable and my son and I slept very well every night.The staff was friendly and made us feel welcome. Breakfast is served from 6:30 until 10:30 am and there was always lots of food. The hotel offered cereal, waffles, eggs, sausage, danishes, doughnuts, yogurt, bread for toasting and fruit. They also offered tea, coffee, apple and orange juice. There was more than enough food to fill our bellies so I was very pleased. The hotel is located half a block from Times Square and is within walking distance from the Theatre District, Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. At night we did notice that there were a few homeless people sleeping on the steps of the church next door to the hotel. This might bother some travelers but we always felt safe in the area, even at night. Whenever we entered the hotel, the staff greeted us with smiles.

We found it to be a bit rude, but proceeded to pay and then went up to our rooms.We now knew why....The extremely small & stuffy room but was clean (which was at least ONE good thing about this hotel). We then decided to unpack and go to bed. Our heating started spitting out gas or something so we called up Maintenance. He 'fixed' the problem and went away. It didnt stop for the next 2 hours. It was SO loud so we called them up AGAIN. We tried to ask the maintenance man what was going on, but he couldn't speak English, so they just moved us to another room.The breakfast was cereals, stale doughnuts and juice - I wouldn't bother eating there at all. Go across the street to the cafe deli shop which is open 24 hours.The rooms have paper thin walls, and can hear everything next door. When next door opened their door, our door shook and sounded like someone was trying to come into our room. I even heard someone going to the bathroom one night!!!One morning we were heading down stairs to go out and put the 'do not disturb' sign on our door. We ran into the maid on the way out, and she asked if we wanted our room serviced. We said no thank you and went out. When we got downstairs I forgot something in my room and my partner went up stairs to get it... He finds the maid at our door with it open?!?!?! I found that disgusting & very rude. Glad he got up there when he did in case she stole anything.The days we didnt get our room serviced, the maids got VERY angry and rude. They were very pushy. I know that is their job, but Im not letting people in my room who I don't trust.One day she asked if we we're leaving and then started cheering in the elevator. She was SO rude!!!The LIFT/ELEVATOR - slowest lift in NYC. There were broken tiles which my sister tripped on. And you would think that it would have a sensor if someone was getting in, the door wouldn't close on them? I started to walk into the elevator and instead of opening back up, it rushed towards me and closed, and have a terrible bruise on my leg.The staff are very rude and unprofessional, and not friendly at ALL.On the last day that we were here, we found out they charged us an extra $5000 on our card, on top of what we already paid!!!!!!!! They said the computer automatically charged it and would try and fix it soon. How many other people has this happened too????The ONE thing I liked about this hotel was the location, but PLEASE pay a little bit extra and go somewhere nice and professional.I was so excited to stay here from the great reviews, but NEVER, EVER EVER AGAIN.We have been extremely disappointed with our stay in NYC and cannot wait to go home.","Brisbane, Australia",74,1.0

Tea and coffee were available all day long, so when we had come back from our adventures we could easily pick up a hot drink without having to buy one from a store. There was always a man standing in the lobby greeting everyone who walked in and helping them if they needed it.Our only concern while we were there was the elevator. It has a limit of five people at one time and as there was four of us there could only be room for one more person each time we used it. One day we were on our way to the lobby and two other people got in and then it the doors closed and it got stuck half way down. We only had to wait for about three minutes before one of the staff opened the door for us. They do have one sign stating that there is a limit of five people but if the elevator is full no one can see it because it isn't that big. My only suggestion would be is to put a bigger sign on the outside of each level so people can read it before they enter.

It is a small little hotel with one tiny elevator with equally tiny but cozy rooms. We wouldn't have wanted anything bigger as we had no intention of spending a lot of time in the room.Our room faced an alleyway and as a result we could not hear a thing from the outside world. It was almost as though we were in a small little town with absolutely nothing going on at night rather than in the 'city that never sleeps'. The rooms were very clean and were maintained this way thoughout our stay. Linens, towels, soaps etc were replenished daily. Staff were unbelievably helpful, friendly, and accomodating. It might have been the best service that we have ever had staying in a hotel. Food was a bit of another story as the quality and variety was quite low. Although it was a free continental breakfast so I guess beggers can't be choosers! It was edible but not the type of food that you would expect from Bobby Flay's restaurant. Parking was a bit of a nuissance as it was at a location that was down the street (the opposite direction of the one way that we had already come down). The rate was reasonable considering it's downtown NYC. Make sure to ask if there is going to be a festival on the street the day that you intend to leave. We almost had to kill time until the end of the festival since the vendors were blocking the exit to the garage, however a very nice group of young guys agreed to move their stuff for us. Overall, an absolutely great experience and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a central location that has good value, clean and safe.","Ottawa, Canada",9,5.0

The room was very clean, modern, much better and more spacious than we expected. Considering its proximity to Times Square we were happy to find that it was not too noisy. The breakfast was great (bagels with cream cheese - yum!). We came down a little too late one morning, and the staff still invited us to help ourselves to breakfast. The toiletries in the bathroom were lovely, and the bed was so comfy. It was really close to the Rockefeller Centre, Radio City hall, and lots of other attractions. Bad points- If we let the door close too quickly on our way in or out of the room, the cover of the air conditioner/radiator would fall onto the floor and it was a little irritating putting it back on each time. Also, the elevator is really small, only fitting 5 people. Once, there were 6 people and the lift broke down. We found it was often quicker to walk up to the 4th floor than to wait for the lift.TIPS - we had the best biriyani (Indian rice and meat dish) at a food van near the hotel, on the corner of 46th St, west of 6th Ave.Must try if you like indian food.",Melbourne,37,4.0

A few days before check-in, they already charged us the deposit for one night's stay. Upon check-in, I should have looked more closely at the bill I signed because the guy at the desk charged us for the full amount--thereby overcharging us for one night. Later that night, after checking my bank account (which I am OCD about doing during travel), I came down to the desk and politely explained it to the new guy at the desk--not the same as the one during check-in. I think he said he was the ""night manager."" At any rate, he was super nice, immediately saw the problem, admitted the mistake. But then explained that, since it was the weekend, and the charge wouldn't go through for another few business days anyway, there was nothing he could do, but it would be fixed at check-out. He said this was a common occurrence, and that he had a whole stack of rooms that needed to be fixed in this way.And it WAS fixed at check-out. So the over charge was never taken out of my ""actual"" balance, it was just on ""hold."" But I still spent the entire trip just a little anxious about having less in my ""available"" balance than I should. All's well that ends well, sure. But come on, guys. How hard would it be to just not make this mistake to begin with?Okay, now on to the good! Fabulous location, as everyone has said. And again, great, attentive staff (with the exception of the guy at the desk when we checked in--he was nice, just should have double-checked what he was charging!). Our hair dryer practically exploded the second morning, and we flagged down the housekeeping lady in the hallway. She was super nice and got us a new one which we were able to use while we waited for the maintenance guy to come install it (and he did speedily!).Small room, but who cares? I'll take the super comfortable, giant bed over more walking space. (Hey, I slept on a guy's couch my first visit to NYC, so this was living, as far as I was concerned. A real bed! Our own bathroom!) Nice giant TV, nice view of the alleyway (again--if you want a parkside view, go the Plaza, kids). Good closet space, plenty of dresser drawers. I also didn't think the shower stall was as small as TripAdvisor had prepped me to believe. (First trip to NYC? Showered in an old-timey tub next to an open window in Brooklyn. Again, this is the life!) Fabulous free breakfast with superb donut variety in the morning. Also sausage, toast, cereal, juice, McDonald's-quality ""scrambled eggs,"" and if you looked carefully in the little fridge: actual, hard-boiled eggs! Score!Altogether, a great hotel with really only a small speed bump, even if it was a completely avoidable speed bump.

TripAdvisor is our bible when making hotel selections, but this time we feel that the rating was much too high.Broadway @ Times Square does have some redeeming factors. Its location is awesome. If you turn right out of the lobby you are only 1/2 block away from Times Square. However, it is also situated right next door to a shelter, so you have to pass by homeless people sleeping in the streets. Although NYC is heavily patrolled by police officers, it is a bit of a concern. Also, the hotel is surrounded by many restaurants, so when they place their garbage out the next morning it does tend to reek, especially since we were there during a hot spell.The rooms are exceptionally small, even by Manhattan standards. There was only one spot for a suitcase, so the other had to lie on the floor. The room was so small that the TV had to be placed on the wall to the left of the bed, so watching TV was uncomfortable. The wall in front of the bed had a spot that was not wide enough to place a flat screen TV because the air conditioner was one side and the door to the washroom was on the other.The cleaning staff were very good. They changed the sheets and provided towels every day. The one and only elevator is microsized and tends to take a long time to serve 9 floors. The stairwells are equally narrow. There is only one ice machine in the hotel, and it is located in the lower level. The breakfast room is right off the main lobby. It too is tiny. The breakfast fare includes cereal, donuts, hard boiled eggs, over easy eggs and sausages, as well bread, fruits, coffee, tea and juices. The sausages were horrid, the over easy eggs are pre-made and are chewy to eat. We bit into an apple and found it soft and brown.The hotel staff were nice, but their nerves were getting a little frayed since the air conditioning in the lobby had malfunctioned the whole time we were there.Don't get us wrong ..... the hotel is clean and situated close to Broadway.

Like you, I went to trip advisor to look for well rated hotels with good prices. Last time,. we stayed at a nice hotel that was one subway stop from Times Square. This time, I chose to be closer to the action, even though some people complain about the noise level when you stay so close to the activities. Broadway at Times Square is located less than a block from Times Square, and I was VERY happy about our decision to stay at this hotel.Before I continue about the location, let me describe the hotel. The lobby had a nice sitting area with a window view. The breakfast area up front as well, with about 5 tables available. The breakfast had many options to please many people: yogurt, eggs, frozen waffles to heat, sausage patties, cereal, oatmeal, bagels, donuts, fresh fruit, and assorted danishes along with milk, coffee, apple juice, and orange juice. The donuts were replentished throughout the morning, which was nice. There was an attendant waiting to take trash, help with questions, etc. Very nice breakfast experience.As to the room...I know NYC rooms are small. We had a room with 2 doubles. Our room was at the end of a short hall on the second floor. We used the stairs most of the time, though the elevator was fast enough if necessary. And a smart feature, they said that there is only one double room on each floor, and because families usually book those rooms, they placed those rooms at the back of the hotel, so it is less noisy. To me, that is a planning team using their brains!The beds took up 87% of the room, but they were a good size! There was a night stand between the beds, a desk with a chair, a dresser, and a wall mounted flat screen TV. The bathroom was VERY roomy, which surprised me. There was a window sill in our bathroom which was large enough to place a small suitcase. Also, there was a closet with plenty of room to put out a suitcase, and a rack to hang clothes. The bath/shower combo had a good shower head, and the water was always as warm as I wanted it to be. And I have to add, I really liked the lighting in the room and bathroom. Some hotels don't have a central light in the room, but this one did, along with other lamps. The bathroom and room were clean and everything was as well placed as it could be! Because of the size of the furniture, you did have to turn a little to get into the bathroom. However, we LOVED the beds, so I was fine with sacrificing a little space to have a great bed. They were very comfortable and made for a good night's sleep. I only have a couple of complaints about the room, but they are small. First of all, the television was not getting many stations, and the stations they did get were fuzzy. When I asked management, they said they had lost good reception when construction started on a building nearby. They had already had a hotel wired for cable the week prior, but it had not been activated yet. My other complaint was about the location of the air conditioner in the room. It blew across the head of the bed, which made for VERY cool nights. The way the room was laid out, there really wasn't a way to put the air conditioner in a different location. I talked it over with the management, and they said with CORE coming in to redesign the hotel, they would make a note to look at that. Some nice features I haven't mentioned....The business office downstairs has easy computer access for internet, printing, etc, at no cost. The wireless internet in the hotel worked great, no complications, and the fact that it was free was a WONDERFUL bonus. I did not use the fitness room, but it appeared to have a couple of treadmills and bicycles. I can't say enough how pleased I was with the quality of this hotel for the price. I'm sure that the quality and service of this hotel are matched only by hotels that are much higher priced. The hotel staff was INCREDIBLE. They gave directions, answered questions, offered to arrange car services, just anything I needed, they were ready to help. My last comments about the location, I really enjoyed being so close to Times Square. It was also just a short walk to Rockefeller Center, Harold's Square, just SO many great places to shop, eat, and sightsee within a short walk. Though there are other hotels I could choose for my next visit to NYC, I can't imagine why I would look any further than the Broadway at Times Square. I know you will LOVE it, but just make sure they have a room for me when I need one!","Arlington, Texas",92,5.0

If I stayed again, I would request a lower floor. We were on the 9th floor and the elevator is very slow and only holds 5 people. There is not much view from your window, but all you have to do is step outside and look over to Times Square, nearly across from the Marriott Marquis (where we have also stayed.)

I asked for a quiet room when I booked and we were given the quietest room ever - we could not hear a sound except for church bells ringing in the distance and on one morning a pigeon that decided to perch itself on the outside window ledge next to the air conditioner! It was hard to believe we were so close to Times Square - we were on the 2nd floor in a room towards the back of the hotel so surrounded by thick brick walls. The room was suitable for our needs - whilst smallish (but all NY hotel rooms are small) we had enough room for our bags and space to walk around. Our housekeeper kept our room exceptionally clean and lovely even with all our stuff around the room. She lovingly placed my daughters stuffed toys at the head of the beautifully made bed. The only issue with the room was the airconditioner - it was very noisy when turned on - if you wanted it on during the night it might be problem - we didnt need it at night so it wasnt a problem for us. The bathroom was perfect - spotlessly clean, beautiful hot water with good even temperature control and good even pressure from the shower.The service from all staff and at all times was friendly, prompt and informative. They fixed the noisey fan in the bathroom even before I told the staff about it. The breakfast room staff was attentive to keeping pastry/bread/cereals always available and coffee full and freshly brewed. The room was always clean when we arrived for breakfast.

This one is perfectly located for a theater trip. It's right around the corner from the TKTS booth where you can buy discounted tickets to a variety of hit musicals and plays. If you walk east, you're just a few blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. Be prepared for a very small room and bathroom. This is NYC and every square foot counts, but you will not spend much time in your room with so much to do nearby. We were out late pretty much every night and slept in (we got an inside room so it stayed dark and there was no street noise). There is only one elevator, so you might want to get a room on a lower floor. Internet is free, bed was comfortable, and water pressure in shower was great. It's not fancy, but if you want to have a fabulous time in NYC and not spend a fortune, this is the place for you.Note that the restaurants in Times Square are pretty pricey. Venture a few blocks away and try some of the local diners and delis for reasonably priced, tasty food. We've already booked our room for Christmas. You simply cannot beat this location and price.

I used it twice as not everybody in my family was leaving at the same time and I had completely different experiences. The first time I had a nice driver that posed no problems at all. But the second one was rude (he dropped my suitcase on the ground before putting it on the trunk) and also tried to charge extras for the ride. When I told him that I had paid part of the amount to the hotel (something the hotel requests when you book a cab), he told me that I did not have to pay anything to the hotel and I would have to pay the full amount in cash to him. As I refused to pay and said that I would call the hotel to discuss about this he used an ethnic slur and left.Although this person was not an employee of the hotel, the cab company was referred to me by the hotel and everything was arranged by the reception desk, so I think that the hotel is partly responsible and that they should be more careful when choosing their partners.","Maastricht, The Netherlands",56,3.0

The only outside noise we ever hear inside the rooms were the church bells from next door, which were not too early. We walked easily to Rockefeller Center and all over Times Square, and used the 42nd St. subway station which made for an exciting walk. The hotel staff were very kind and friendly. This trip was an important first for us in so many ways that I was so happy and just plain relieved that we had a good place to stay where the people treated us well.The breakfast was popular with the girls because they offered donuts with chocolate icing and sprinkles, besides the usual danishes and breads.

And when we checked in to that other hotel (which was basically just across the Times Square and where the price was almost double), that's when we really started to appreciate the Broadway@Times Square - smelly hallways, paper-thin walls so noise from the street and also from the neighboring room, far from perfect cleanliness.Next time I need to travel to NYC I will definitively try to stay at Broadway@Times Square Hotel.",Boston,1,5.0

Base rate was $135/night plus taxes and fees for a total of $165/night. For a last minute trip and a Times Square location, that's a good deal if the hotel is decent, and it was.The room was small and efficient as expected for this price. It was a bit dark which made it seem smaller. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The steam heat was pumping out and needed to be turned down, but it's better than freezing! The closet was small, but there was plenty of bureau space. 32"" lcd tv worked well, the iHome iPod clock player was a bonus, individual led reading lamps on the head board was a nice touch and the work desk had power in easy reach.There was no view from the rooms unless you were right in the front or right in the rear. The benefit was that it was quiet until the bells on the church next door started to ring at 7:45am.WiFi access was free and there was complimentary breakfast each morning. I didn't partake in the breakfast due to schedule, but I checked it out and they had a good spread of fruits, yogurt, muffins, waffles, etc (continental plus) that would satisfy most people's quick breakfast requirements.If you aren't going to spend a lot of time in your room lounging, then this would be a great hotel to consider.","San Diego, California",108,4.0

Windows in our room facing a wall. Location is fantastic, just 3 min walk to Time Square. The front desk staff is not friendly nor courteous at all. Also for some reason throughout the night, you can hear sounds of someone hitting a steel bar 'ting ting ting...' on and off which may be disturbing for light sleeper.

It was our first visit to NYC hence we selected this hotel. Food locations aplenty and subway stations highly accessible.There is a complimentary continental breakfast every morning which I find very useful as we did not had to look for other breakfast spots instead could simply have breakfast and get ready for sightseeing in the big city. Boiling water source is also readily available with coffee/tea/milk etc.Room for improvements are definitely the elevator which many have already pointed out is painstakingly slow especially if you are on a higher level floor and possibly any safety risks associated with it which I feel is of high importance. The price I felt was also a tad high relative to the size of the room, leaving very little space to manoeuvre around the room. The front of desks staff are rotated whereby some were very friendly others indifferent.In summary, if you new to NYC and would like a highly accessible location this hotel is recommended.

The rooms are on the small side, but I've been in smaller rooms than this in NYC. There is only one little elevator, and it is very slow.I had two problems with our mid-January stay of four nights, unfortunately. The room was uncomfortably warm! I called the front desk about it, and apparently, there is no way to adjust the (steam?) heat in the rooms. I had to run the window air conditioner full-time, and it didn't work well. They sent a maintenance man to address the situation while we were out and about, and whatever he did to the ineffective old A/C unit made the temperature passable, but just barely. His help kept us from changing hotels, which I had already begun looking into. Sorry, but I need to be able to have some control of the temperature when I need to sleep.The other problem was out of the hotel's control. After late nights, we were awakened at 7:00 am by very loud noise in the street by a workers strike at the hotel across the street. They blew loud whistles, clanged huge bells, and shouted continually. Sleeping was impossible, but again, the staff was helpless here.All in all, it added up to a less than perfect experience at what could be a really nice little place.

After much research on places to stay, we landed on this spot. At first glance it seemed affordable, liked the location, and there were NO reports of bed bugs anywhere to be found.After staying here, it was more than worth the value. The hotel was what it stated to be: a boutique hotel in the heart of Times Square. We got in much earlier than expected and the hotel staff had no problem checking us in early, which was a huge bonus. They also were willing to hold our luggage the day we left while we finished up seeing the sights. The hotel rooms were small, but that's to be expected of NYC and a boutique hotel. Plus we didn't stay in NYC to stay in our hotel room. So if you plan on staying in your whole trip, don't stay here, you'll be very disappointed. Our only chief complaint was that the room got very hot at night. We couldn't open the window and weren't sure how to operate the air conditioner. We probably could have had it fixed, but didn't bother. The elevator was a bit of a pain as it's slow and can only fit 5 people but there never was an instance where we had to wait that long... if you're in that big of a hurry take the stairs. The free Wi-Fi was great, definitely came in use when we wanted to find our next adventure and yes the breakfast wasn't fantastic but it did the job. My husband and I were satisfied with bagels, yogurt, fruit, and coffee... it was better than just cereal or nothing at all. The location was fabulous, what totally sells us on coming back! We loved being so close to Time Square and be able to walk everywhere. We walked to the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Central Park (just to name a few) It was perfect for us, plus there was a subway station right by the hotel (about a block away) which was easy to find and use to get other places.

Take that out of the mix and the stay was 5 star. Usually 5 star is reserved for high end but this met all of our requirements and was in the $300/night range. Our friends stayed at the Ritz and paid $1300 per night. Although not the Ritz this place was perfectly situated in NYC one block off of Times Sq. We are walkers and found it easy to get around town on foot. From the financial dist with the ""Occupiers"", to Ground Zero and the rebuilding of the Tower area and on up to Central Park and Fifth Ave shopping. This was the perfect location for us. The doorman, and I'm sorry I didn't get his name, was the kindest most helpful we've ever come accross. Front desk and Breakfast Bar attendant were above average and tried to make our stay special, which it was. We got off the plane and to the hotel at 8am. When asked if they would store our bags until the 3pm check in they said ""we have a room right now, if you like"" (Wow!) They even will call a car to take you to LaGuardia for a flat fee ($45). We were there in 45 minutes but it could have been longer depending on traffic. The driver knew all the back/uncongested streets. There also was a restaurant two doors down that was helpful for the two days it rained. I'll definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends.

Our desires were to be located near Times Square, in a non-smoking property, paying a rate which we deemed to be budget-friendly given the overall inherently expensive nature of our trip. Late October tends to be a difficult time of year for securing good values in midtown Manhattan, however we felt we had done just that by being eligible for the AAA rate. Comfort Inn Times Square manages to be in the ""center of it all"", and ""off the beaten path"" at the same time.As light-sleepers, we had requested a high floor, and that is just what we got. (In fact, had our room had a king bed, which is what we had reserved, instead of the queen bed we received, we would have listed the overall rating of this property as 5 stars, instead of 4). Our room was on the highest floor of the hotel - the 9th - toward the rear, facing east. There was no view, but blissfully there was no street-noise, which along with being a 100% non-smoking hotel, are our greatest priorities. The room was large enough, particularly with the decent-sized closet, that we had sufficient space to move about, without our cruise luggage being in the way. The queen bed was comfortable. The bathroom size was fine, and adequately ventilated. We did not find that housekeeping noise was a problem.There is just one elevator, and on one of the 2 mornings we experienced rather long wait times, as we competed with the housekeepers who needed to move their large carts up and down. This isn't a complaint, but I thought I'd mention this, as potential guests who are unfamiliar with New York should be aware that it's normal for older buildings to have just one elevator to accommodate several floors, and to expect to wait a prolonged time if situated on an upper floor. People with limited mobility should take note, as well as others who may object to taking the stairs, and perhaps ask for rooms on lower floors.Breakfast was abundant and varied, which is always welcomed. Every member of the staff with whom we interacted was pleasant and helpful. We would be happy to stay here again, should we desire to come to New York for the theater, and will recommend Comfort Inn Times Square to our families and friends.","Portland, Oregon",25,4.0

Room is NYC small but I've stayed in smaller here, actually - there was space in this one for a chair and a desk. The bed was comfortable, HBO on the TV though we didn't watch it much, a clean and workable bathroom with hair dryer, tissues, shampoo, soap, We did use the safe to store our valuables. It's in a very large closet with light, which would be nice for stowing suitcases if you were staying for several days.The staff was kept busy as there were a number of senior citizens staying who seemed to need extensive help with directions, and foreign tourists. I do greatly appreciate we were able to get a room when we checked in early. Breakfast consisted of waffles, bagels, cereal, fried egg patties, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, raw fruit, coffee and juice - plenty of choice for me though I guess it would get old every day. Cramped and crowded in the breakfast room so we ate in our room. And yes, the elevator is verrrrrrrrry slow.Overall, this is a fine budget hotel, but keep the word budget in mind.

We stayed a week earlier at the Distrikt Hotel (which is not far away from this one and only a little bit more expensive but much better). The location of the Comfort Inn is right on Times Square which made staying here a very noisy, crowded experience. Although Times Square is good to visit once, you don’t really want to be staying here when you are confronted with hundreds of tourists trying to cram into a very small area. Our room was on the street side which meant being woken constantly by the goings on down below.The rooms are small (expected for New York) but are pretty basic and could use a refresh with the furnishings looking pretty tired. The staff were always very friendly and helpful which made the stay here that much better. They were able to assist us in a number of ways and were only too happy to do so. We had breakfast included in our rate however we only ate here once over the four nights we were there. It was very basic continental style fare however, the dining room only fits about 4 people in it at any one time which meant that the first morning we were there, guests were standing around or spilling out into the reception area eating their breakfast. This isn’t a bad hotel; I just think there are much better options to choose from in New York for the price.","Melbourne, Australia",16,3.0

It is an excellent base from which to explore NYC, and it found it particularly convenient in the evenings when returning from a show, as Theater Row is within easy walking distance and thus no need for a taxi. The police presence in the city (partly I imagine due to the 9/11 anniversary) was also especially noticeable, and I felt completely safe at all times.The hotel itself is pretty much as described on its website, there is a standard continental breakfast from 6:30 am to 10:00 am. On offer are breads, rolls, waffles, fruits, cereal, yoghurt, egg, tea, coffee, juices etc. I found it perfectly adequate to start the day. The breakfast room itself is small - I counted just seven (7) tables, however at least for the first hour of service, there was plenty of room available.The room was bigger than I imagined and everything worked! Most importantly, there is an in-room safe and at least for a solo traveler, plenty of storage space. There was also a very useful NYC guidebook in the room (not to be removed) and in addition, the hotel themselves also provided a very useful guide to their amenities and polices as well as a lot of other general information about NYC - attractions, theaters, transportation etc.Not that you would be inclined to spend much time indoors, but there is a large Plasma-Screen T.V with something like 35 T.V Channels included, 2 in Spanish and the remainder in English - covering all the big networks - News, Movies, Sport etc. There is also a pay-per-view option. The rooms also have an FM Radio beside the bed which includes an iPod dock, and a reading light which I always like.There is no 'room with a view' as others have commented, and the room pretty much looked out onto a shaft/brick wall, however again and as for most people, I did not find this an issue considering the minimal amount of time you will spend in your room.The en-suite facilities were also fine, perfect water pressure from the shower nozzle and temperate control excellent. Housekeeping of a very high standard with facecloths, towels, and complimentary toiletries (shampoo and shower gel/moisturizer) replenished daily. On two occasions though, I returned to the room at around 1pm to take a break between points in my itinerary and at that point of the day, the room was not yet serviced. However, this is not a issue I would regard as in any way significant. The shower tray was also very small, and really only had enough space on which to put the free toiletries provided - which then kept falling off. I would have appreciated a bigger tray or a rack.I found that I did not have cause to interact a lot with staff as I really did not have any problems here - however from the front desk staff to the bellman, I found them all to be courteous, pleasant, and professional. In addition to the breakfast room on the ground floor, there is also a fitness center and business center, both of which are accessed using your key card. There is a printer in the business center and access was never a problem. The business center has 2 PC terminals and comfortable chairs. The lobby itself is very small and perhaps useful only when one is awaiting a taxi. Ivonne at reception called a taxi for me on departure and made several follow-up phones to ensure it was on its way and that I would be on time for international check-in.I would just have two minor issues - one with the in-room Air Conditioning as I found you could either have it switched on at full velocity or not at all - there seemed to be no 'medium' option. Secondly, the elevator must be the slowest I have ever encountered and so often frequently decided to take the stairs, again this is not a significant problem but it may slow some people with lots of luggage.Overall, I was very impressed with the value, service, and location on offer here and would heartily recommend it as an ideal and convenient base for a stay in Manhattan.",Cork,6,5.0

Everything worked out fine until the next morning. We were supposed to get a $50 room (Incidentals charge) returned and the desk manager was an out of control Alpha Dog who had no communication or listening skills. We tried to explain what the night manager had told us our $50 incidental charge would be refunded upon check out but because apparently he didn't know what he was doing, the receipt did not indicate we paid the charge. This desk manager was hearing none of it. There was an embarassing screaming match between us and a long line of people waiting. - all for a $50 incidental charge!

All hotels in NYC have small rooms, and this one is no exception but we're used to making things work so it didn't bother us at all. We slept well every night. The only issue we had was the air conditioner - it was very good, but the only option seemed to be off or high. It was very strong, especially for the people sleeping right next to it.

It hasn't changed since my first stay there. The staff is very friendly, some even recognize me by now, and the rooms are very clean and have standard amenities. I've stayed in both king and queen bed rooms, and both have been fine. This most recent stay I was in room 703. It's always very quiet and I never have problems sleeping in this hotel. In all my stays, I've never had a view of the street, it's always the back, so not much of a view, but it's quiet. I always get a good rate with AAA, but you have to show your card at check in, or they won't give it to you. I was there on some very hot days, and it always felt wonderful to step inside the hotel and feel the cool air conditioning!

The A/C isn't the best but we were comfortable enough to sleep. There is no view from this hotel - you will look out the window to a brick wall. That didn't bother us at all since we were barely in our hotel anyway. The location is fantastic - literally steps to Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, the subway and so much more. Breakfast was standard but such a nice perk to save a few dollars in the mornings. They also have a luggage room and will happily hold your luggage all day when you check out so you can wander the city. Awesome! Staff was helpful and polite, no issues checking in or checking out.

I would have liked some meats and/or sliced cheese in addition to the cream cheese and butter that were offered.Price was high, but I guess that was expected being on Manhattan.

Breakfast host was great and kept everything clean and stocked. One down side is that the hotel is on a side street where there is one ways / no turns, so getting a cab is sometimes easy as there are 2 or 3 hotels on street and difficult at other times as no cab wants to be on a road less travelled. but main roads at end of either end of block.

Unfortunately the carpet outside the room needs replacing, it was old, dirty and it smelled. The lift was incredibly slow lift due to its age. The air conditioner was so noisy we felt like we were in a plane and didn't seem to cool the room down at all. We had no hot water one morning which was not very pleasant, and our toilet blocked up. To be fair, the toilet was fixed immediately. The breakfast was basic and included in the room price. It was a very central location in Times Square. The desk staff were nice and welcoming. While the internet was free it was very difficult to actually get access and when you could, it was so slow.

Hotel location is unbeatable, just half a block from Times Square, and 1 1/2 blocks from subway, super convenient. From La Guardia I bought a Metro card for $10.51 at Hudson newsstand, and with it I took bus 60 then change (ask bus driver) to take the subway and exit Rockefeller Plaza-47th St (I believe it was the red line 1-2-3). Hotel was 1 1/2 blocks away.Staff at front desk was extremely nice, friendly and helpful, particularly Jovannie and Yvonne. Room was clean and decent for NY size. My room faced a brick wall so no noise complaints, I was on the 3rd floor. Breakfast was decent, again for the hotel rating – fruits, cereal, yogurt, eggs, toasts, etc. The sitting area was busy most of the time so people would take their plates to the lobby or to the room (I did).Please do NOT use the deli across the street – made that mistake one late night – food was horrible. For some light lunch go to Europa, a chain restaurant, which has fresh salads made on the spot as well as sandwiches and pastas. I had pasta with chicken and veggies made on the spot for $7.50 or so. Food was very good. The closest to the hotel was 2 blocks away on the corner of 46th and 5th. Internet service is very slow. Go to Starbucks 2 blocks away – Broadway & 47 – much faster. Or if you need a quiet environment take your laptop to the NY public library on 5th Ave, about 6 blocks away. Their service is super fast and free – just beware that they close early (6pm).Highly recommend this hotel.","Houston, USA",138,5.0

The rooms are tiny, but they all are in NYC and it's not like you spend much time in your room when you're there. The breakfast is a nice bonus since NYC is not a cheap destination. It does get a little crowded in there, but still good. Most importantly, the hotel was very CLEAN. I am very picky about the cleanliness of any hotel and have stayed at much more expensive hotels that were not as clean as this place. The room could've been a little cooler, but keeping the air on pretty much took care of that. It was just a little stuffy until we cooled it down each day when we got back.

The room was OK size wise for us it is as big as almost all hotel's in Europe. We took the bus from the airport to Grand Central and walked to the hotel. Mistake, it was to hot and to far.

Location is outstanding - just where we wanted to be. Of course it's older, and the rooms are very small, but for the amount we spent it was well worth it. This is not a flea bag hotel, it has recently been updated, is extremely clean, the staff are friendly and helpful, and we had absolutely no problems. We arrived hours early and they held our bags until our room was ready, as they did the day we checked out since we weren't leaving until evening. The front desk reception and bellhop service was always helpful and hailed cabs for us in the pouring rain. The day we left it was raining and we had checked out that morning, but they went out and stood in the middle of the street until a cab finally agreed to take us to the airport (for some reason the cabs don't like to do that in the early evening I guess, but thankfully the hotel staff helped us with that).The maid service was really outstanding too - not what you would expect from a budget type hotel.Other amenities used were the free wi fi and the computers downstairs to print out boarding passes. Some complain about breakfasts, well, I for one don't expect much with places like this so can't complain, I'm not much of a breakfast person anyway. It is the same stuff you get at all inexpensive hotels, I would have been surprised if it were anything else - don't understand why some people complain, I thought it was fine.

We were so close to everything, it was amazing. The last we stayed we stayed in NJ and went back and forth via NJ Transit. While that option worked out great and helped save some money, the chance to go back to the hotel for a few hours this time to rest was a great benefit.

Lunch was OK, but dinner was excellent...go for the petit filet. Great value! Speaking of value, the cost of the hotel is in line with what you receive in NYC. We were there to watch the Ball drop so the night before and the night after New Years Eve were economical, but NYE night was double the normal price. I'm sure this was typical of all hotels in NYC that night.We always felt safe at and around our hotel. Never a concern with any issues. My wife and I walked everywhere during our 3 day stay in NYC. Coming in from LaGuardia Airport (LGA), a taxi charged us right at $40 for the tolls/fare. On our return trip to LGA, we asked the front desk to order us a taxi for the morning of departure and they actually have a private car service they recommended.

Simply kind and friendly desk staff. There is a concierge if required. Quite frankly, with Penn Station with easy access to main airport with a simple train change at Jamaica, or airport bus services from only yards away from hotel, costly taxi services are superfluous.This hotel is on 20 floors, with four rooms per floor. The rooms are modern, with lovely bathrooms, large screen TV, and every facility that you could require. The rooms are perhaps rather small, but believe me, are excellent value. I stayed on floor eleven, but never had to wait more than a minute or so for a lift (elevator).Breakfast was a pleasure, with an adequate continental breakfast. A choice of coffees, juices, fruit, boiled eggs, a diversity of breads, jams (marmalade etc.), lovely cakes.If the breakfast room gets very busy, and it is rather small, it constitutes no problem as it is possible to take a tray up to the room.Adjacent shops and restaurants are very near at hand if you require anything for the room, such as milk or sandwiches.I will certainly stay at this very pleasant central establishment with its friendly kind staff and excellent value for money facilities when I next pass through New York on the way to members of my family who live on Long Island.","Brighton, United Kingdom",29,5.0

As with most Manhattan hotels, the room was pretty small, but big enough for the two of us. The bathroom was actually very spacious, with an excellent shower. The room rates are shockingly high in this part of town, especially for a small-town westerner like me. But, the rates were over $100 less at this quiet gem than for adjacent, more hectic hotels. There was only one small elevator, but since there are only 8 floors the waits were not too long. Don't expect a view. Our view was a slit which barely let in daylight. Great for sleeping, though. Hotels often claim to be 'one block from such and such' when in reality they are pretty far. This place is literally a block from Times Square. You exit the hotel, turn right, walk past St. Mary's Episcopal Church and boom - there you are in Times Square, right across from the Marriott Marquis.

I also saw people taking food upstairs. OK maybe it's not the place for a lingering breakfast but then thats not what I'm there for.I can also understand why people complain about the size of the room, perhaps it would be a little tight for a couple not used to being together 24/7 but I have stayed in much smaller rooms in NYC.Due to the fact that a school group from France were staying there the business centre with 24 hour access to the internet via 2 PC was sometimes busy but then hey it's free.

I opted for a sheet change so I could witness clean sheets being put on the bed and they sent someone up very quickly. However in the midst of making my bed the employee promptly left to attend to baggage downstairs in the lobby. Perhaps they were under staffed that evening, I don't know.

I definitely took advantage of the free breakfast though i ate each less each day - the smart people got food and ate in the lobby as it was less crowded.My room was really noisy, there was some weird banging noise from some nearby machine. It interrupted my sleep. Also ask for a room NOT near the elevator as I could hear it from my room. The walls are pretty thin, but its NYC there's noise everywhere so just get used to it. The room interior is OK - kinda chocolate themed 80s decor. The bed was OK. The comforter was a bit scratchy. I liked it how there was a coffee maker in my room.

We could have walked but it was really cold outside so we took a cab to the hotel. It cost $9 due to traffic but we got there in about 10 minutes. The hotel doesn't look like much from the outside but once we walked in it was very nice. The front desk was pleasant and our room was ready (at 2pm). The elevator is small and slow but did work. We ended up in room 307 so we just took the stairs most the time. The room was small but cozy and very clean. The TV and lights all worked perfect and the bathroom was nice. There was a very noticeble cold draft in our room though. We ended up closing the curtains tight and putting a trash can against them to keep the draft blocked out. The frosted glass door of the bathroom didn't bother us at all. The continental breakfast was very good and they had 24 hrs coffee/tea which was always stocked. The location is just fantastic and you are right around the corner from Times Square. We walked to see Jersey Boys on 52nd street and Wicked on 51st. The walk was about 15 minutes but we weren't really hurrying along. We also walked to Rockefeller Center, the ice skating rink, Radio City Music Hall, the Hard Rock Cafe and could have walked to Penn Station. We ate dinner at The Long Room and the steak was good with reasonable prices. I also heard the steak/BBQ at Virgils on 44th street between 6th &7th ave was very good.

For $297 (we had discount from the Entertainment Book, so it actually cost us only $277) you cannot beat this Times Square location. Any other decent hotel in the area is way more expensive. We arrived a little early, and the front desk attendant, who was very busy but still courteous and patient, told us he'd have our room ready in 30 minutes. He then offered us some tea and coffee from the breakfast room. I could not even finish my tea because our room was ready in about 15 minutes! The hotel is clean and the employees actually care about the guests and want to do a good job. The bellman referred us to an excellent pizza place for lunch and that made us very happy! Our room was situated so that we could not hear all the noise from Times Square, so it was very quite. The hallways are narrow, but we are skinny so it wasn't a problem. The room was small, but that is to be expected in NYC. Our only complaint is that you can hear everything in the hallway from the room. The walls are quite thin and we were awoken a few times by slamming doors. Overall, this is an excellent hotel with excellent staff! We highly recommend it!",Boston,18,4.0

It was half a block off of Times Square right in the heart of Midtown. There is a great Irish Pub accross the street that we ate and drank at a few times through our trip. We enjoyed the restaurants on Restaurant Row and would reccomend the Galaxy Dinner for breakfast to everyone. The hotel itself is very clean, the elevator is slow so we would often take the stairs down. The rooms are good, the bed was comfortable, the in-room safe was nice to have and the free breakfast was nice just for the apple and banana we would pick up and take with us for our day. We walked everywhere and found most places without too much trouble. The subway was easy to navigate through as were the streets.

We couldn't have done any better if we had planned months in advance! If you are used to European-style hotels, you will have absolutely no problem with this hotel. Small lobby, elevator (only one) and rooms, but incredible location a half-block off Times Square. Best of all, even for a Saturday night stay in Christmas season, we paid less than $350. The room was very clean and well appointed, even had a large flat-screen TV. Our room (#800) faced the side of the adjacent building and was very quiet. The only noise we noticed was the constant slamming of the room door of one of our neighbors. There are only ten rooms per floor, so not much hall traffic. There are lots of restaurants in the area, and it is easy walking distance to theatre district, Rockefeller Center, Central Park and 5th Avenue. The closest subway stop is two blocks away. The hotel offers a basic continental breakfast which was fine for us. I recommend taking your food up to your room (use ice bucket tray from your room as no take-away trays available) as the dining area has only about 5 tables. The only complaints I have are matters of personal preference. The bath towels were scratchy and a bit thin, and the bed pillows too soft for my liking. The rooms are heated by radiators, which made our room a bit stuffy. You aren't supposed to open the windows, so the only venilation was using the fan on the A/C window unit, which was a bit loud.

It is a few steps from Times Square. A perfect location. I was worried about our safety in a big city like NYC (a woman and a young girl) but never felt uneasy at all walking the short distance from Times Square to the hotel even at 11pm. Checking in with Stanlee was very quick and he was extremely friendly (even though it was 1a.m.). Our room was a little on the small size and the view from the window was of a brick wall. I called Stanlee straight away and asked if there was another room, but it was Saturday night and they were fully booked. He did make a note that we should be re-roomed the next morning for the remaining 3 nights of our trip. Next morning, true to their word we were swiftly re-roomed by Rodriguez. Excellent service and the new room was front facing and almost twice the size of the first room. Brilliant!!The breakfast room was always busy, with people often sharing a table, but where else in New York do you get a free breakfast? We only shared a table one morning out of the 4 that we were there and on our last morning we got our breakfast bagels, donut/pastries and a coffee and took it to our room to have.The room was very clean and all of the staff were friendly and helpful. If I go to New York again this hotel will be my first choice, without a doubt!!Over the road from the hotel is John's Shaghai. We got a take-away to eat in our room from there one evening. The food was excellent. Next door to John's Shanghai there is a grocery shop and we got our drinks from there.The hotel is perfectly located for you to choose whether you are going to eat out or on the hoof.I had to check in online for my return flights and this was no problem with the free internet access at the hotel. check in complete in 10 minutes. This saved us a lot of trouble at the airport as our flight was overbooked and if I hadn't done this, we may have been put on the next flight instead!!!!My tip to all air travellers is to CHECK IN ONLINE!!! We flew with Virgin Atlantic, but I know that it is common practice for lots of airlines to overbook flights and even though I had booked our seats, if you don't check in online your seats can be booked by someone else!!! I learnt this lesson on the way out to NYC and this made checking in 1hour longer than it would otherwise have been if we had checked in online.","Abergavenny, United Kingdom",29,5.0

The fitness center on the gound floor is far too cramped, though given the size of the hotel itself (tiny) it 's not too bad. Where this place really goes wrong is the rooms. As far as I'm aware most of the rooms are extremely small, which would be fine if the hotel hadn't tried to cram all the furnishings for a room twice these sizes into them. Huge body-length mirrors are hung in unfortunate places, cabinets can't be opened due to proximity to beds... you're basically forced to walk sideways to get from the bed to the bathroom.

In addition, Times Square is a fun area, close to restaurants and shopping and convenient to the subway. Although restaurant row is 8th Ave., my son and I found that 9th Ave. has tons of less expensive and just as good dining. The cab trip to the hotel from Laguardia Airport was $27 plus $4 toll plus tip. The hotel itself was very comfortable and the staff very helpful. I was able to use the computer and printer in the business room most times when I wanted or had a short wait. Although it is a large hotel, the elevator was not slow or full. Check in and out was quick. The breakfast room staff was very good and kept the orange juice and coffee etc. flowing. A big plus is that the coffee in the breakfast room is available fresh all day! No need to use the in-room pot. The room also has it's own ironing board and iron and a hair dryer that works. The plus of the rooms is that they provide four comfy pillows per bed and the mattresses are good-not extra firm or too soft. We asked for a two bed room, which I later learned are all in a row on each floor and do not have a view of the street. The window is high anyway so it wasn't important and the location was very quiet. We were on the 6th floor and heard no traffic or neighbors.The only negatives we found was that the door to the bathroom was mostly glass and you could see through it! Amazing, huh?! We had brought a garment bag for wedding clothes and there was a hook over the door on the bathroom side that we could hang it and cover the glass. Otherwise no privacy in the bathroom-beware! Also, like most places, they could use an upgrade in toilet paper and tissue. I did like the design with the sink and mirror in the bathroom and not in the sleeping area.I would definately stay here again to be able to walk to the theater and dinner.

She then wanted to charge us the rack rate + $15 extra (not our discounted rate). Thankfully, I had a hard copy of our reservation right with me.

It is about 20 minute walk from Penn Station to hotel or you can just take a taxi or take the subway to Times Square which is one stop north. As for the hotel itself, it is clean and seemed to be remodeled a few years back. The staff was nice and helpful - room was ready upon arrival around 11 am. The only issue is the noise from the street. There are some pubs across the street which get loud at night so I had to run the AC window unit to drown out the street noise.

When I attempted to check in they refused to give me a key until his return, changed the rate, and proceeded to quote corporate policy - all for a $15 dollar increase. I walked out to wait for my husband and when we both re-entered a woman was talking to the employee. All she was interested in was getting us to initial the $15 increase. I sent an online complaint to their corporate site and the the GM answered my complaint in a manner that indicated where the employee gets his arrogance and ignorance. Guess what...it was the woman. This GM did not bother to introduce herself or ask us any questions that night. All she wanted just our initials. In addition, my husband asked this same employee for directions to the theater.

I recently came back from a very pleasant 3 night stay. I actually booked this hotel months ago, cancelled when I found a better rate, then re-booked it when their rate became the best one. I got an excellent AAA rate booked through the hotel's website. I arrived early, and my room wasn't ready, he told me to check back at 12 and it would be ready, even though check in time wasn't until 3. He let me store my bags and use the business center as there was something I really needed to check. The breakfast room is open from 7:30-10:30, it was open when I arrived, but I didn't use it until the following morning. I didn't come back until later on in the afternoon, when I was checked in and given room 809, 1 queen bed as I was traveling by myself. The room was small, but quaint and charming. It was clean, and quiet, as it was on the backside of the building, my view was a wall and windows on another building. It suited all my needs just fine. Nice flat screen TV, comfortable bed, desk, decent size bathroom and closet. I had no complaints, it was perfect for me. The free wireless internet was a great amenity, and worked perfectly, I never lost the signal once. My only complaint about the room was the wake up call line always seemed to be busy, so I had to use the alarm to wake up, not a big deal though. It was a really nice alarm clock with an Ipod docking station. The hotel is small not just in rooms, but in size overall. The hallways are narrow and there's only one elevator (which I had no problems with). The front desk staff were all nice and helpful. The breakfast room, it didn't have many tables, but had a good selection of food, like cereal, yogurt, donuts, waffles, bagels, toast, coffee, juice, milk, and fruit. I always took my food back up to my room to eat, I also saw some people eating there's in the lobby. The business center has two computers and is open 24 hrs, as is the fitness center, but I didn't use that. There's two vending machines in the lobby, and the ice machine is in the basement, which is kind of creepy if your down there by yourself! There was a check in/out and flight check in self service kiosk in the lobby, I tried to get my boarding pass on it and it didn't work, but maybe it was just my airline, I don't know. I went into the business center and printed it off for no charge. The hotel's location is perfect, Times Square is only a minute's walk to the right, and the subway is a few minutes away. There always seemed to be cabs available out front, and there's restauraunts nearby. It's also a close walk/subway ride away to all attractions. I am glad I changed my reservation back to this hotel, as I had no regrets. I will definitely stay here again, I actually may change my reservation here for my next NYC trip in October. The price was great, but if you use the AAA rate, you do have to show your card at check in for them to give you the rate, there's a sign at th desk noting this, same for AARP rates I noticed.

We arrived at 11 PM exited and even planned a late dinner after check-in in a nice nearby restaurant.However the reception person printed a registration form with rates about $50 higher per night. When I showed him my printed confirmation letter which showed the original rates, he said there's nothing he can do and ""either sign the form withe higher rates or you cannot check in"". We asked him to first get the room and then sort this out but he refused and even suggested that if we don't like those rates maybe look for another hotel, which I thought was outrageous! He then tried to call Choice Hotels. It took some 20 minutes of waiting to talk to them, and amazingly they declined my rates too! After finally talking with Choice Hotels supervisor, it turned out that my rates were raised ""because I called them to ask for a room facing the back-side"" to avoid street noise. Needless to say - they never mentioned it would change the rate, and the hotel does not charge any extra for that anyway. It was after midnight when we finally checked in after giving up and agreeing to sign the registration form. We were nervous and frustrated and had to dine in a fast food place since the restaurant already closed. The matter was settled only the following day, when Choice hotels customer service called me, admitted their mistake, reset the rates and said they'll even discount one of the nights to compensate me. It was unbelievable that when we finally checked out, that additional discount was forgotten! (we did not bother to fix that)The hotel management claimed it was all Choice Hotel's fault. I thought that the guy at the reception should have honored our letter, check us in and then sort this out instead of offering us to look elsewhere.Last - the hotel and room was very nice.

The hotel was clean and comfortable. The rooms were small, but in NYC I was expecting that. We asked for the largest room we could get away from the street and they obliged. I slept well, but did notice you have to be very careful with the doors because they slam easily . There was only 1 elevator, but we only chose to walk down the stairs once and that was only because I was scared I might be late for the Lion King. I wasn't. The staff was excellent and they were always asking us if we needed anything when we came downstairs. The breakfast was great. It was fruit, cold cereals, toast., danish, bagels, toaster waffles, boiled eggs, ect. I wish they had a microwave though. I do not like cold boiled eggs. I loved the whole wheat toast! The breakfast room is small, but I would always go up to a table that had 1 or 2 sitting at it and ask to sit down, so the wait was never long. All and all we will stay here again. It has LOCATION,.

No wonder they have so many good reviews - it's truely a great choice of hotel when in Manhattan (Times Sq area). What we didn't like in the hotel was: 1. the rooms are really tiny - especially those not facing the street but this is not unusual in NYC hotels. The window we had was kinda fake cause it was facing the wall of another building, there was almost no daylight in the room due to that and it was very hot, but again it was also quiet. Also, you can't even open the window and have to rely on the airconditioning. 2. The A/C is very noisy and not great - sort of like too powerfull, it was soon very cold and ""windy"" in the room once it was on. But iit might be a good thing when the summer's hot... 3. Staying there is not the cheapest - but you pay for the area. We also found a great deal on hotels own website - they had a way better deal than all major hotel booking sites so definitely check it out! And now the things we liked and made our stay so pleasant: 1. the rooms & bathrooms are spotless clean, the cleaning staff are doing a great job! 2. we also enjoyed free continental breakfast - again the staff in the breakfast room are very efficient, very nice and helpfull, the place is clean, food is great - good choice (yogurts, juices, tea & coffee, waffles, bagles, pastries, donuts, fresh fruit etc.) & always very fresh & yummy. the tea & coffee is there all day long and you can take a cup to your room in the afternoon etc. 3. location is great - 2 mins from times sq, you can walk everywhere, to all major attractions, shops, sightseeing double-deckers etc. There's also plenty of good and not so expensive restaurants and bars (e.g. 2 Irish bars just opposite hotel), good quality take-aways etc. 4. There's also a tiny business centre (PCs, fax, printers, internet) at the hotel and it's all free of charge - e.g. we always travel with a laptop (free wifi) but we leave the printer at home;) - if you need to print your broadway tickets or other confirmations - you can do it for free in this hotel. very convenient I have to say if you're booking your attractions online and last minute. 5. They also have iPod docking stations in rooms - well done! wasn't expecting this and was delighted:) All in all we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it. In our case there were a lot more advantages than disadvantages - I only mentioned them to give you a fair review:) Would definitely go back there!","Yellowknife, Canada",399,4.0

Sure, the rooms are small, but they are clean, well appointed and modern. We stayed in king rooms, and I would recommend the rooms facing the street as they are larger and lighter. There is a little noise in the street facing room, mainly early in the morning when the gargage trucks go by, but most of the time it is not a problem. There is a flatscreen TV in the room, coffee and tea making facilities, plenty of drawer space, and the bed is very comfortable. Wifi is free in the rooms and throughout the hotel, and also a computer room with 2 printers for guest use which is great for those travelling without laptops. The breakfast is great, cereal, toast, a range of pastries and bagels, waffles, boiled eggs, fresh fruit, juice and coffee. Coffee and Tea is available in the breakfast room throughout the day. As others have commented, the breakfast room is small, but we never had to wait long for a table and most days didn't have to wait long at all. The staff member working in the breakfast room is very friendly, makes sure the food is replenished regularly and keeps the area clean. We found all the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful, and they will securely store your luggage if you have a late flight etc. The location here is fantastic, and while the rooms may be small, it is New York and value for money this is a great hotel.

That's why my choice will be, for the fourth time in five years, this comfy, well-priced (for New York!) hotel in the best location in the City! The rooms are clean, comfortable, and attractive, and the staff is very attentive, (and like other reviewers mentioned, the same staff members seem to be there every year, including the gentleman who mans the busy breakfast area and is very attentive to his job.) We find you just can't beat the location, price, and free breakfast. My husband loves to get up early every morning and run around the corner to Rockefeller Center to see the Today Show. We've walked easily to Broadway shows, seen the Naked Cowboy on Times Square a couple of hundred yards away, and dined at the excellent restaurants in the area (great Italian restaurant across the street and the Scottish Saint Andrews Pub with affordable dinners and wonderful atmosphere around the corner.) We've easily caught the nearby subway to Central Park, the Village, and Battery Park.

The Comfort Inn Midtown was a real winner for us. First of all, location was perfect - a half block off of Times Square. Next best thing was the friendly and very helpful staff. How pleasant it was to NOT see signs of frustrated, tired empolyees. They all went out of their way to offer help - especially ""Sidibi"" the bellhop. The rooms were crisp & clean and nicely furnished. Not all rooms were spacious like ours. We at first were assigned to a rather small room toward the back part of the hotel. We simply asked if there was another room with more space or a window view. They said there was (a handicap room), but that it was not yet ready. We gladly waited (sightseeing on Times Square). We were given room 602 with 2 windows with a view. Four days later 602 was needed for a handicap person and we gladly moved to 802. They actually moved all our things for us to the new room so that we could be on our way . Both rooms were spcaious and comfortable with lots of closet & drawer space. But keep in mind - this is New York where space is at a premium. About the only complaint we had was that the dining area was too small. But the food was good. So yes I would definitely go back to this hotel - and ask for a front room facing the street. We did not have any street noise the whole week we were there.","Lafayette, Louisiana",16,5.0

Halfway through our vacation we discovered a few thousand dollars were charged instead of a few hundred and we were in a panic! We thought we were in New York without any money.

After a deep sigh of relief, all was forgiven and our vacation continued.The bathroom door is as see-through as a foggy window! We didn't mind it except whenever I had to, you know, sit down. I would do this with the lights off to have as much privacy as possible. If you're not comfortable with the people you're staying with this bathroom door is gonna be tough times for you.

I would much rather stay in a simple room and buy my own luxury toiletries with the money I've saved! Oh, and did I mention the free wireless internet? Our two bedded room had a, shall we say, European standard of space. In other words, it was the smallest room I've ever stayed in in this country. It also seemed a bit drab at first glance because there was no natural light in the room; even though the room faced front the window was taken up by the climate control system. Upon closer examination however, everything in the room was newish, in excellent repair, and perfectly clean. The bathroom was also clean and modern. I am a big city resident, so I wasn't bothered by outside noise, but have to admit that the plumbing from other rooms was a bit annoying, but bearable. The location is terrific on 46th Street between 6th and 7th...Broadway and theatreland one block to the right, 5th Avenue and shopping one block to the left, restaurants everywhere. The staff seemed friendly, although I had no reason to ask for their help. One tip, it you book using a AAA or AARP discount, make sure you have your card with you! I carry mine routinely, but have never actually been asked for it at check-in but was here.  Minor quibbles aside, I would absolutely stay here again. At prices like this I will be able to visit NYC more often!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",14,4.0

We like seeing the same friendly and accomodating staff members year after year. We arrived quite early from the airport (8:30ish) and the desk staff said a room would be ready around 11:00, and offered us breakfast and held our bags till we returned from a walk. (They will hold your bags after check-out, too, until you are ready for transportation to airport.) The room is very comfortable and clean. We shared a king-sized bed, and room size is comfortable for two people. Bedding is nice. Bathroom is clean. Towels were a little scratchy. Complimentary continental breakfast is a real plus; food is good and the service person is very attentive. We love the location-close to theaters, shopping & the subway. We visit in February because the rates are lower; we have lots of fun despite the cold. We feel safe here. It is about 1/2 block down 46th St. from Times Square. Entrance is well lit and there's always someone at the front desk. I would heartily recommend this hotel, and hope to visit again.",Ohio,38,4.0

We were located on the 5th floor.Positives• The location of this hotel is awesome. I think this Comfort Inn should be renamed to the Times Square Comfort Inn instead of Midtown because Time Square was just at the end of our street. • Hotel offered free wireless therefore could connect from your room (given you have your own laptop). The wireless speed was really quick too. They also provided a business centre area available 24hrs and could use their pc’s for internet and printer for printing.• Rooms were cleaned everyday although I don’t think sheets were changed every day. • We had a closet in our room which was a bonus, we utilised this space to store our luggage. • Safe was available in room • An ipod docking station was also available so we could play tunes but we mostly used it to recharge our iphone• Free breakfast was included with stay. Comfort Inn provided different types of breads, pastries and cereal as well as coffee and juices.• There was a small gym area which was accessible 24hrs. There was a treadmill, bike and stepper but their equipment and was old.• There was a group of kids staying next door and were mucking around the hall way knocking on each other’s door. We called and complained to the front desk and believe they resolved issue as noise and children ceased slamming doors soon after.• Room was very quiet could not hear street noise.• Flat screen tv with cable was available• The staff and service we experience was very good. During our stay we also experienced (at different times) a broken smoke alarm which kept beeping every couple of seconds and we managed to block our toilet as well. Each time concierge was more than willing to assist us and resolved the issues seamlessly. • The cost of Comfort Inn Time Square was a lot cheaper than other hotels in the area definitely value for money staying here. Negatives• Rooms are small but everyone who has stayed here and posted past reviews we’ve read has mentioned that so it was no surprised. • Room needs a revamp of modern sleek furniture to utilise the limited space more effectively. We had a big wooden dressing table and a big wooden side table in our room which we didn’t use. Changing linen and curtains wouldn’t hurt either.• Room lighting was a dull probably cause of the colour of the walls and lack of natural lighting available. There was a small window in our room which gave us the view of a brick wall.• Room walls are pretty thin can hear neighbour’s music, but then again we did have teenagers next door who liked to play music at 1am when it should be dead quiet.• Radiator needs updating. When on it makes a whistling noise when it is heating or cooling which would wake my husband up at night. When we turned it up it would be too hot once we turned it down it took forever to a point we would turn on the aircon.• Elevators were slow and could only fit probably 4-5 people at a timeI’d stay at Comfort Inn again because of its prime location to Times Square and the competitive cost.",Sydney,96,4.0

They also stored our bags for a few hours after we checked out on our last day. Everything was clean. The room was a bit cramped with 2 double beds but we were comfortable. All of the staff were friendly and professional.I can't say enough about how convenient the location was. We walked to the Gershwin Theatre to see Wicked, which I highly recommend. Very clever story, fabulous special effects. Also within a few blocks, we went shopping up and down 5th and 6th Avenues, visited St. Patrick's Cathedral, the Rockefeller Center, M&M World, the Plaza Hotel lobby, and more.

So I really didn't want to be anywhere dodgy or uncomfortable, but couldn't afford to pay to be anywhere plush. My main concern was cleanliness and security and I was very satisfied on both counts. The decor was actually really nice and I appreciated the widescreen television and the desk with free national calls, free internet and coffee maker. The fact that they must have done a refurb recently was great; no yucky carpet stains, grubby headboard or smelly bedcover. I have certainly been in supposedly posher chain hotels that have been way scruffier and pokier (hello Hilton!) . The bathroom wasn't quite as nice as the bedroom, but still acceptably clean, if not brand new. Bit of a smell of disinfectant, but perfectly ok.Noise was a slight issue; I am very sensitive to noise but was pleased to have a room away from the front of the building and therefore quiet. The only problem was another guest's tv - not my neighbour, but someone down the corridor! It was on soooo loudly...but luckily not for long, or I would have complained. The heating isn't ideal - it was a little clanky, but not enough to bother me - but the room did heat up too much in the night. Not unbearably and I'd rather have that than too cold in January. Breakfast was good value - lots of it, bagels, cereal, juice, pastries. The guys on reception were friendly and efficient and there was a free luggage store on check out which I used.My only major gripe was a smell of cigars/strong cigarettes that I smelt twice at around 5am in my room. I don't think it was anyone on my floor, but I wondered if the smoke was coming in from a lower floor or the alleyway...? It was a mystery. Once again, luckily for me the smell passed within minutes. Maybe it was a ghost?All in all, if I wanted to be so near to Times Square again and couldn't afford to splash out, I would definitely stay here another time.

The rooms were very clean and the staff were excellent and very helpful from the front desk to the very nice cleaning staff and concierge. My room had it's own air con, which you did need in summer and it wasn't too noisy. A light breakfast is included every morning and it was great to have that handy. They have a small gym (not that you will want to look at it after all the walking you'll do around the city - take comfortable shoes!!!!!!) and they also have computers handy for you to check email/internet, free and that was very handy.

We stumbled down to the breakfast room in the am for coffee, tea, juice, fruit, bagels, yogurt or cereal until about 10 am. Same staff for all 3 years and that is something itself! The newly refurbished building, complete with flat screen TVs, wireless access, 2 communal computers with printer, and fitness room is in good shape.I can never figure out why this is the Comfort Inn Midtown as it is a half block from the TKTS park off Times Square, when the Comfort Inn Times Square is nowhere near Times Square. Easy walk to everywhere from 46th Street between Broadway and 6th Avenue. I walked from Penn Station up 6th in about 20 minutes with my wheelie suitcase. It was also easy to go 2 blocks to the subway at Times Square to take the shuttle over to Grand Central and transfer to the line going up the East Side. Taxis are easy to come by in the neighborhood.My only things to improve would be the heat - so warm we didn't use the blankets as it seemed silly to turn on the AC when it was 10 degrees out. Not crazy about the frosted glass bathroom doors and the oversized bureau in the doubles and the one pokey elevator.

Overall, the hotel is clean, comfortable and has a great location. There were two issues that came up during our stay....the elevator and the check-in process.  Our room was located on the 4th floor (there are a total of 9 floors) and the elevator was only functional part of the time. For us, this was not a major problem...since we are relatively fit and travel with carry-on size baggage. However, for guests with mobility issues or large luggage, this could be quite a problem..there are a lot of stairs and it is a narrow stairway.  Next, The check-in process was time consuming and rather involved. We arrived at the hotel around 1:30pm (knowing that check-in was at 3pm), and asked if it was possible to check-in or else be able to store our bags until we could check in. The man at the desk stated that our room was not ready, but that we could certainly store our luggage in a secure storage room, and that our room would be ready at 3pm. Not a problem. We stored our bags, proceeded to walk around Times Square, and returned to the hotel about 2:45 to get off our feet. Much to our surprise, the lobby was full...all the seats in the lobby were occupied with guests waiting to check-in and the only place to sit was in the adjoining breakfast room. Needless to say, we were told that our room was still not ready....along with all the other people waiting. We sat down and waited until 3pm. Precisely at 3pm, everyone lined up (at least a dozen people) and waited to go through the check-in process. The man who had been at the desk during our intial arrival was there, along with one other gentleman, apparently a reservationist that had just recently started his shift. The original reservationist started to help a guest and seemed totally incapable of helping her...she was apparently checking in using ""Rewards Points"" and he told the lady that she would have to come back later and see the other reservationist. This original reservationist then proceeded to go in the back room, get his jacket and was leaving because his shift was now over. The remaining reservationist did an admirable job of getting us checked in and was left to deal with all of the guests....by himself. It then became clear to everyone standing in line that the reason the original reservationist (who went off-duty) told everyone their room wasn't ready was because he didn't want to check them in...he wanted to leave it to the reservationist with the next shift. It appeared that he didn't want to do his job - or simply didn't know how. In any case, it was a poor representation for the Comfort Inn. I should point out that it was just this one original reservationist that seemed to do a poor job, he had no aptitude for customer service and genuinely seemed disinterested in the ""comfort"" of the hotel guests. I sincerely doubt that the rooms weren't ready, because the cleaning staff did an amazing job. They were very thorough and efficient. For example, we had left our room at one point around 10:30am and returned less than a half hour later to retrieve an additional guide book and the room had already been cleaned.  Due to the location, clean room, comfortable bed, and wireless internet access, we will likely give this hotel another chance. We travel frequently to the city and have stayed at a variety of locations. We have stayed at the Novotel and had very good experiences - they seem to have a higher level of service, with slightly higher prices. But, if the Comfort Inn Midtown is able to improve the staff (at least the one bad reservationist) and fix the elevator...then we will certainly be happy to stay there again.",,2,4.0

In the past we've come back from a city break and reviewed our accomodation together and the consensus would always be it was OK but.......! But there were no ""buts"" about this hotel. It is literally yards from Times Square and the first comment we got from the taxi driver that brought us from JFK airport was that our hotel was in a very central location. It was spotlessly clean, the room was an adequate size, very comfortable bed, flat screen TV, extremely quiet considering we were so close to Times Square, the staff were warm, friendly and most helpful and welcoming, the buffet breakfast was substantial and really set us up for the days walking and exploring of this wonderful city. To sum up I would have no problem in recommending this hotel to anyone who wants to be right in the heart of the action and don't want to spend their time travelling in and out of the city.

We accepted this offer, even though it was $5 more than a yellow cab. However, when we got to the Airport, we were charged $60.

I think she was shocked.. she offered to pay for the slices, and I told her I didn't want to waste and was happy to share. ..

I got extremely lucky (I think I may have gotten the last room available when I checked in), but even though I was a solo they gave me a room with 2 double beds - which the bellman said was one of the ""big"" rooms. This greatly added to my personal space to have the extra bed to pile my stuff, but the room was still a very tight squeeze - the foot of the bed is so close to the tv desk that you have to scoot sideways to get by. I'm sure the double room I reserved would have been unbelievably small.I had also requested a quiet room, and the room overlooked the back alley and the backs of other buildings. I heard almost no street noise. The only noise was some bells that clanged every morning at 7:30 am, which to me was the perfect time to get up anyway (I think they were from the church next door).That said, my experience was fantastic. The staff is great - everyone greets you with a smile and hello, answers any questions, is very helpful. The whole place is very clean. Breakfast is adequate. And the location is beyond compare - half a block to Times Square in one direction, close to several different subway lines. I felt safe at all times.Now, some people I think have been disappointed because they see all these 5 star ratings so they think it is a 5 star hotel - it is not - but it IS a 5 star VALUE...the 5 stars here on TA come from answering the question ""Rate your overall experience"" - and to most of us, it was 5 star. I will also post one of the few negatives here - my a/c unit was very noisy, so I couldn't run it all the time. I would turn it on for a short period, it cooled off the room quickly, and then I would shut it off. It might be a problem if the weather is very hot for your entire stay, for me it was not. And one great positive that I didn't expect and didn't know about until I checked in - free US phone calls! Anywhere! I called my husband and daughter on the west coast several times a day, made and cancelled many local reservations, and was charged not one cent for telephone charges! What a great bonus that was!Someone a few posts down said they were asked to write a good review on TA, and therefore the ratings are skewed. NO ONE asked me make mention of the hotel to anyone, this review is written purely based on my personal experience.I know this hotel can be more expensive at different times of the year (I was lucky and got a $197 AAA rate in August), but New York is a very expensive hotel city.

Since the rooms are quite small you sleep near the door and can hear people talking in the hallways. Light sleepers should run the a/c as it helps mask the other sounds. Staff were generally polite; however, one desk clerk wasn't very friendly and when a street person (several sleep next door at the church) followed me in asking for $ he didn't even ask him to leave! Continental breakfast was pretty good and we never had to wait long for a seat. Don't bother taking the elevator down unless you absolutely have to; usually much faster to walk, even from the ninth floor. Two free computers in the lobby were a bonus.","Delta, Canada",2,2.0

We arrived at 8:00 a.m. and they were kind enough to let us change and store our luggage until our room was available. They even invited us to go into the continental breakfast room!!! The food in this room is great and the man in charge is so helpful and friendly. Our room was just the right size, the bathroom perfect for a couple and a flatscreen TV - but hey - how long do you stay in your room when in NYC! The room was very very clean. One day we had a problem with the air conditioner and a very nice Polish man came up and fixed it during the day - he even popped by around 5:00 before he left for the day to make sure it was working!

One oddity with the room was that we stayed here in January so it was obviously very cold outside, however our room was always very hot - meaning we needed the air conditioner on everytime we were in it.The free breakfast at the hotel was a plus and included bagels, doughnuts and cereals. The location is probably the best thing about this hotel as it is about 100 metres from Time Square and convenient for most of the big attractions.

(The hotel hands out hotel info sheets and the suggestion to submit a favorable review to trip advisor is included on the sheet.) So I feel there really is some bias here. If you JUST want a place to sleep for the night, this place fits the bill fine, but I found there were a lot of little things that bothered me. First, the room was tiny. Just enough room to walk around the bed and the desk. The bathroom was small too (had a shower stall, but no tub), but manageable for one person. The window faced a brick wall (literally a few inches away) and therefore got virtually no natural sunlight in the morning. Made it hard to wake up! The hallways outside the rooms were very narrow. There was an air conditioner in the room, and it went as cold as 64 degrees, but that was barely cold enough. It would have been nice to get it colder when I was working out. They provide shampoo, but not conditioner. Again, not a huge deal (it's easy enough to stop by Duane Reed), but when you realize this in the morning when getting up, it's not great.","Queens, New York",3,2.0

It's got a 24 business and fitness center: wireless internet access, exercise room, ability to print Boarding Pass for business travelers and anyone. All the rooms have plasma TV. Free and delicious breakfast with an excellent variety of food and beverages. The room was perfect. The service was excellent, efficient, friendly, and everyone went out of their way to be helpful. The price was right (with a 10% discount if you show your AAA or AARP card upon arrival). Air-conditioning/heat can be adjusted. Whenever we go to NY, we LOVE to stay at this hotel. It's close to everything. At our last stay in July, we surprised at the many improvements to what we considered to be an already great hotel. It was one of the first smoke-free hotels in NY. It's along Restaurant Row. The already helpful and courteous staff was very good about holding our luggage until we had to go to Newark. The gentleman at the desk showed us how to print our Boarding Pass the night we were leaving - and got a very helpful driver to take us to Newark that night. He, and all the staff, were very kind and helpful, as always. There's no charge for New York state calls & toll-free calls. Each room has coffee makers with coffee & tea, an alarm clock radio that's MP3 compatible, and a reduced rate parking. Complimentary continental breakfast (with microwave) is from 7am-10am with plenty of tasty food (best granola we've ever eaten). Besides the usual phone with voicemail and hair dryers, it has computers/copiers/fax machines 24 hrs/day, cable with movies on demand. The rooms are very pleasant-looking, comfortable, and you don't hear any noise down the hall or next door. We consider this to be a first rate hotel and have recommended it to everyone going to NY. It's part of the Apple Core Hotels, so if you don't want to be off of the Theatre district, they have other locations, too. It was GREAT!

The room was small as noted in some of the previous reviews, but we had everything we needed in just the right place. And to top it off the room had been completely re-done from the shower to the very comfortable bed, and had what appeared to be new linens, carpet, paint, even a flat screen television.I felt the breakfast was more than adequate, and the gentleman in charge there was equally as pleasant. Each morning was a selection of cereals, fruits, donuts, bagels, toast, yogurts, juices, coffee, and even Cappuccino.Our room was cleaned everyday whatever time we seemed to get back to our room, almost like someone was watching us leave and then got right down to the business of getting it ready for our next night.The location could not have been better as we realized the first morning when we started to find our way around. It is close to everything from Times Square to Rockefeller Center, We even walked to Central Park and the Empire State Building.And, I also think there is something to be said about management who cares enough to watch the comments on TripAdvisor, and reply to any problems there may have been during a stay.

The bed was large and comfortable. I only had two complaints and I wouldn't even call them complaints. There is only one elevator and it's really slow. Also, the room we were in had a weird bathroom door. The middle of the bathroom door was frosted glass so whenever one of us had to use the bathroom, the other person would have to move to the other side of the room to give them some privacy.

I was able to walk to Central Park (although it is a 30+ minute walk).Since times square was always busy I never really felt I was walking in a quiet strange part of NY alone even though I was by myself.The hotel is better than nice. Very well appointed rooms with LCD TVs, clean bathrooms and very good wireless and wired internet access (with 1.5 Mbps up AND down speeds for those of you technically minded).The room was small but I was only in my room to sleep.The service at the front desk was suburb (especially Jiovanni).There is a small place called cafe @ times square a couple of doors down and it is a great place to grab some food for at a reasonable price ($4 for a burger and fries compared with TGI Fridays which was charging $17+ for the same thing a couple of doors down).This part of 46th St is also known as little Brazil and there are a few South American inspired restaurants on the street.My only complaint was that the air-conditioning was at the same level as the bed. When I turned it on it was continually blowing directly on my face.

So I went on google and searched for hotels nearby and then hit TripAdvisor for the reviews. Comfort Inn Midtown was the only hotel I could not find a single bad review for. Even among the $600+ per night hotels, they all had at least one or two recent bad reviews. Not Comfort Inn Midtown. So I rolled the dice. This was my first trip to NYC, and I was more than a little nervous. I could not have been more pleased. The room was fantastic. Had PLENTY OF SPACE! Hot water for every shower. Almost no noise from the street. No sounds from other rooms. The continental b'fast in the morning is great. Free business center where I was able to make copies of a white paper for meetings and print my boarding passses for return trip home (all FREE). The front desk arranged a $25 shuttle to return to the airport (It cost me $60 to get into town from the airport (Laguardia) WITHOUT the asst. of the hotel.) The hotel is at 6th Ave. and 46th. This is 2 quick blocks from Times Square and a half block from the (summer) Saturday street vendor fair on 6th Ave. It was just a few walking blocks from 30 Rockefeller Plaza (think NBC). Great little English pub across the street. Walking distance to MOMA and Bryant Park and so much more!Very safe, very clean, professional courteous staff. I can't say enough, except I will definitely go back to this hotel. If I had to reach for a negative, I would say that from around 8:30 a.m. to noon, the FREE wireless internet in the room had spotty reception. Other than that, I can't think of a single complaint. Book this hotel! You won't regret it.","Tulsa, OK",0,5.0

I've always booked online and never paid more than $80 a night. For the price and the location, I will continue to stay there!LOCATION: Literally in Times Square! Restaurants surround the hotel - chain and otherwise. It's not a very picturesque street, it's crowded with tourists during the day, what with the proximity of Times Square, but it is sooo convenient to the subway, eating, tourist attractions and shopping!THE HOTEL: Is clean and very small. The staff has always been helpful - not always 'warm', but for sure always helpful. The business center is a closet with two desktop computers - but serves it's purpose if you're just using it to check in for your flight and printing off your boarding passes. The work out room is larger and has your basic equipment. It may be small, but it is a nice amenity for this hotel. I never tried the continental breakfast, so I don't have an opinion on it.THE ROOM: The rooms that I have stayed in never had windows overlooking the street, but rather, the space between buildings - lol. Needless to say, the curtains were always drawn. The rooms themselves have been small, but surprisingly, the bathrooms have been roomier. The rooms have always been clean. And I have always stayed at this hotel alone - and still felt safe. The room size, in my opinion, would be okay for two people, but forget about anymore than that. Also, since space was an issue, even with my bringing only one rolling suitcase, I could tell if I brought more than two bags, it would not have been a pretty picture - very claustrophobic.OVERALL: I enjoy staying at this hotel. I really love the convenience of being in midtown. The price is affordable, the location is awesome. I never felt like I was too far from anything I wanted to visit, and there is always a place to get food nearby. I would definitely recommend staying here - maybe not for a week straight, as it is very small, but for a short visit, it is perfect.",SF Bay,8,4.0

I will certainly stay here again on future trips to New York.Location is superb, being just half a block away from Times Square, while being down one of the quieter cross-streets, so you're certainly not getting Times Square levels of noise.Reception area was modern, bright, gleamingly clean, and manned by friendly and professional staff. Just off the reception was a small fitness room with some gym equipment, and a business centre with two internet computers and a printer, all of which you could use for free. Complimentary continental breakfast was also included, and there was also a drinks vending machine and a flight check-in kiosk for printing boarding passes for airlines based on the USA.

But this one's location was unbeatable and LESS EXPENSIVE (Why??). Staffs are helpful. The rooms were smallish but ,like others said, clean and well furnished. As we had inside rooms, there was no noise ( but no sun either though. We had nice view of brick wall 3 feet away.) Minor issues: our bathroom door did not close properly.

I grudgingly booked a room at the Comfort Inn Midtown Manhattan (from which I am writing this review).

But the elevator works fine (much faster than the Marriott Marquis across the street, and the room is surprisingly nice.

The a/c is a window unit, which might be bad in summer. The bedding is acceptable and the dark wood furniture is appealingly updated. There's a nice valence above the curtains. There's no view, but I asked for a room at the back of the hotel based on reviews read at TripAdvisor. So far, it's quiet. There's even a (very small) exercise room on the first floor with a treadmill and bike.

I do wish to address the comment from one reviewer who complained that he/she couldn't get their money back within the 24 hour cancellation period because of their cancelled flight. This person stated it was unethical and ""I don't have control over the weather"". Well neither does the hotel. It's only fair for the hotel to charge, at least for one night's stay, since they may be out a room fare for the night until they get another person to take the room.

This was our first trip to NY so I wanted it to be a good experience for us. I was a little concerned about the noise that some of the other reviewers had mentioned, but decided to book this hotel anyway. We had room in the back of the hotel so there was little to no noise that was heard from the street (outside of the police and ambulance sirens). But hey you are in the heart of the city, so no complaints here. The doors as mention in many previous reviews do slam, because people allow them to slam. Our door slammed after the first time we entered the room and once we realized that the door did that, we had enough common sense to not allow the door to slam and to be courteous to our fellow travelers. I would suggest that the hotel invest in some type of mechanism so that door cannot be slammed. The most time that this is noticed is in the morning though when people are leaving. This is my only complaint and the only reason I couldn't give the hotel an ""Excellent"" rating. Now on to the GREAT things about this hotel:Location: Excellent!The location can not be beat. It is situated 1/2 block from Time Square, the Theaters and many fine restaurants. Everything is so close, from major banks ( Bank of America, Wachovia, Chase,etc), and a 24hr pharmacy within a 1 block radius. The street the hotel is on is relatively quite, but lined with restaurants. The sidewalks also were not as congested as they are on the main drag (Broadway).Accommodations: Excellent Value!The Hotel was spotless from the lobby to our room.Our room appeared to have been newly renovated, and the decor was wonderful. It had all of the usually mainstays of an iron, ironing board, coffee maker with tea (decaf & regular) and coffee (decaf & regular). There is no refrigerator or microwave oven though. The only time we wished we had a fridge or microwave was when we wanted to bring some food back from BECCO (which by the way is a must if you love Italian food!!). The bed was very comfortable and everything was very, very clean (I was looking for any type of dirt or grime and there was none to be found.) There is free wireless internet connection, which is great to plot your day out from your room or make reservations if you want. There was a 42"" plasma TV and adequate room for luggage in the closet. The room is very comfortable for 2 people to move around.Our view from our room was of the building next door, which didn't bother us not one bit, because we were out all day and didn't return until it was time to shut our eyes. Hey you come to New York to enjoy the city not watch it go by from your room anyway, right? :)The elevator was small and I didn't really notice that it was super slow. It brought us up and it brought us down. The breakfast was plentiful to start your day. It's nice to be able to go down stairs and a get something to get your day started. The breakfast consisted of a variety of cereal, 2% milk, boiled eggs, waffles, assorted fruit, orange juice, apple juice, coffee (regular & decaf), breakfast muffins and even Red Bull energy drink. All this while reading your complimentary copy of the NY Times and USA Today. This is good way to save a few more dollars for stuff that you really want to spend money on.While we drove to New York instead of flying, there is a little kiosk in the lobby to check on your flight, in addition to the computers in the business center. There is also a small fitness center, which we didn't use as we got plenty of exercise walking all around the city and taking in the sights.Price: Excellent Value!I searched many hotels prior to booking this one, and you cannot beat the price. We paid $248 + tax per night for New Year's weekend! All other hotels were charging nearly twice as much. I am sooo glad that I decided to book here. There is certainly a lot of bang for your buck, and there was no compromise on the accommodations, staff friendliness/helpfulness and location. There is a parking garage located across the street that charges a discounted rate for staying at the hotel of $25 per day. Add $10 on top of the total if you drive an oversized vehicle.The hotel is located directly across the street from the ""Muse"" hotel which has rates twice as much as the Comfort Inn. I have to admit, I laughed each time I walked out of our hotel and looked across the street and people coming out of the Muse and thought ""you have no idea how much money you are throwing away"". This hotel is a little gem right in the heart of the city! I will be back and would recommend this location to a friend without any hesitation.","Virginia Beach, VA",6,4.0

You know what your getting before you go and as for location, well you couldn't ask for more. Firstly the downside, of which there aren't many. If you get a room to the rear of the hotrel the odds are that your 'view' will consist of a brick wall. That said you ae very rarely in your room during daylight hours and the rear rooms are quieter than those at the front on West 35th Street.The rooms aren't cheap, in monetary terms, a 5 night stay cost us around £900. Although there is a continental breafast thrown in !Pluses are many. Desk staff are very helpful, the hotel is in a great location, the rooms are fairly well appointed, if a little dark. There are numerous eating and drinking locations all around you and the shops and sights are virtually on your dooor step.Don't expect the Ritz, if you want that go pay Ritz prices but for the centre of New York city we feel tat it is a fair price for a clean room and bed.",glasgow,92,3.0

It was a late minute booking, as we had found fantastic rates for flights only a few week before we were due to leave! Comfort Inn Midtown was the cheapest hotel we found and included a continental breakfast which was perfect.I was a little scared at what we would find after reading some reviews on here, but we had none of the problems others' found, save for the noise issue, which I'll go into later.• The HotelThe hotel is located less then half a block away from Times Square. From our window we could see Times Square's TGI Friday and all the lights and billboards. It is also very close to train and bus links and we never had a long wait hailing a taxi.If you are coming to NY for the first time, or just want to stay where the atmosphere and livliness is, then I'd definately reccommend this hotel.As it was booked as a suprise for our anniversary I contacted the hotel and asked if something special could be done for our stay, like a complimanary bottle of wine or similar. I was in contact with an amazing member of staff called Anu. He was so helpful with all my questions about the hotel, it was more like 5 star service! When we arrived, it turned out we had be upgraded to a brand new HUGE room!The downstairs features a small gym, the breakfast room, a toilet, luggage hold (which is free) and a computer room (again, free)• The RoomWe stayed in room 902, overlooking the street and the Muse Hotel. Again, the room was amazing. We had plently of room for our suitcases and the bathroom was huge and well appointed, with a shower, bath, loo and sink. The hairdryer was loctaed in the bathroom in it's own unit. I'd heard rooms in NY were teeny, but this was bigger than some rooms I've stayed in in the UK by far.As for the main bedroom, we had two huge windows which let in a lot of light despite the massive buildings outside. The fire escape on the outside of the building looked amazing (a small point I know, but at least it fit in with the character of the room and building!) The bed was huge. WE have a superking size bed at home, and this bed was a little smaller, not by much though. There is also a flat panel TV with about thirty channels (Check out the adverts... so unbelieveably strange!), a dest with powerpoints for your laptop and a chest of drawers to keep clothes in. The coffee make was on top of the chest of drawers.Next to the entrance was a cupboard with the iron and ironing board, a rail with hangers to hang clothes, and a shelf (we didn't use it, but it could be great to keep the suitcase in)It was clean (all except under the bed, don't look under there if you're a clean freak like me!) and tidy and didn't smell at all!• ServiceWe found all the staff to be welcoming and helpful. Check-in was quick and easy, and only took around five minutes. We were always greeted with a smile and a 'Morning!' or 'Afternoon!' which was a pleasant change form the NY'ers brashness!• BreakfastBreakfast was served from 7am til 10:30am. We mainly ate around 8ish. There was a wide variety of food. Cereal: Corn Flakes, Alpen-like nutty cereal and I think Rice Krispies. Bagels in every flavour were available, as well as Dunkin Doughnuts (which was a treat!) There was also toast and waffles too.Coffee, cappucino, tea and herbal teas were on offer, as well as OJ, AJ, Coke and Redbull (perfect for a much needed engery boost!)Everything was well stocked early morning, however on the few days we got up later (about 9ish) it was much harder to find exactly what you wanted, or a place to sit.Papers were available free of charge.• The NoiseWhen I booked this hotel, I was a little anxious about it being loud. I have problems sleeping, acute insomnia means it takes me at least an hour (in silent conditions) to fall asleep, and being a light sleeper means the slightest noise will wake me bolt upright. A little annoying.Bearing the fact we were staying so close to Times Square in mind, I took earplugs and hoped for the best.The first night we were so jet lagged we fell asleep about 7pm (and woke up at 4am) No problems at all. The only thing that woke me was the next room coming in about 9pm after a meal and letting the door slam shut. The doors are quite noisey.The rest of the holiday the only noise we heard from the hotel was the occasional door slam (from the highly inconsiderate neighbours next door).Outside, there was a lorry-loading area which was the main problem. It started about 4am and didn't stop for an hour. Basically, they load metal pipes and things onto the lorries which then drive off. Reversing beeps, the noise of the carriers being loaded and the drivers and workers swearing and laughing at each other kept me awake, however with ear-plugs this wasn't a problem, and I slept like a baby! We also found the window wasn't quite shut properly (despite the fact they shouldn't have been opened) so once we closed it properly that muted the sounds a little.I would definately reccommend earplugs if you're a light sleeper. My bloke is a heavy sleeper and didn't hear a thing!• Pros and ConsPRO'sFantastic locationGreat staffAmazing roomBreakfast choice was brilliantCheap for the location!Any problems we had (Like the next room smoking which made ours smell disgusting) were quickly attended to.CON'sNoise (only if you're a very light sleeper)",Essex,23,4.0

I had previously had a great stay at the Comfort Inn Manhattan but was put off by recent reviews. So the Comfort Inn Midtown. The hotel is being renovated which did not personally cause me any problems, but could be inconvenient to others. I think most of the renovation is finished now anyway. The staff are very helpful, the breakfast is good and a real plus point: bagels, donuts, toast, waffles, pastries yes, but also, fruit, cereal, yogurt, juice, eggs and hot drinks. There are two PC's for internet use, and apat from once when one guest selfishly used the PC for ages, there was always a free PC. The hotel is in an excellent location, literally around the corner from Times Square. This however means that if you have a room at the front of the hotel it is very noisy. If you are a light sleeper, ask for a room in the back. The noise from the street was incredible and constant. This is the only negative aspect. We had room 602, which was a very good size, the bathroom was big and the room was nice and comfy. I think all the rooms ending in 01 / 02 are quite big, but they are at the front.

We got a room with one queen bed and that was all that fit in the room, literally. You really had to squeeze your way around the bed, between it and the desk/chair, to get around. And the other problem was the noise, from loud water pipes in the walls every time a toilet was flushed or shower started, to room doors loudly slamming, to people scrubbing down and painting the hallway walls at 8:00 in the morning.

Every night we walked about 10-15mins up Broadway to Time Square - it was easy and so safe. The rooms, yes are a little dated, but as it is just a base at the end of the day, we weren't too bothered! Big room with small ensuite. TV with cable, hairdyer etc - what you would expect.I advise anyone to plan ahead before going to New York. We pre-booked our tickets for the Statue of Liberty Ferry at home before we left, and therefore didn't have to queue! We did go early in the morning however! Also I advise you to be at the Empire State for 8am - as the queues become huge and I'm sure you don't want to spend half your holiday stuck in one!We also pre-booked a helicopter flight across the city - which was fantastic! Yes, you can take your own cameras - dispite some reviews! The breakfast at the hotel was typically 'American' and sugary! But hey, it was lovely! Different selection of doughnuts, bagels with cream cheese, various cereals, juice, eggs. This was an added bonus, as most NYC hotels don't include breakfast in their tariff. We only had one quibble with the hotel....on our last night we had just come back from Bubba Gump Restaurant on TImes Square (highly reccommend it) and as we entered the room a mouse ran across the floor - understandable in these older buildings. But I was not going to sleep in a room where the mouse had run under the bed!!!We asked at reception to be moved they were fine about it. However the first room they moved us to was a smoking room (it stank) and the beds were unmade. SO they moved us to another room. Still a bit smokey though. It was our last night so we didn't care. Another things was the VERY RUDE bell boy! We encountered him within the 1st 10minutes of or stay - he grabs your bags like a leach!We knew tipping was a big thing in NY, but we only had a dollar bill and a 50! So I gave him the dollar bill....He responded, not wth a kind thankyou - but....I wouldn't even give a Mexcian that!! I thought..How rude and racist! I should have taken it back off him, he was lucky to get anything! We're not stingy, but we didn't think we'd be rudely put upon within our first 10 minutes!! We stayed away form him on our way home, we carried our own bags! Rude Man!!However, I would recommend the hotel, due to its location and value for money.

The hotel is ½ block from Broadway and 1 ½ blocks from Times Square, one block from a subway, and two blocks from “restaurant row.” There is also a stop for the “hop on/hop off” bus tours and city buses at the corner (less than one minute walk). You are within a five minute walk to many of the major attractions (MTV studios, NBC, Rockefeller, all Broadway theatres, 42nd Street, etc). With that said, the hotel is actually very quiet and secluded (though I always felt safe, no matter what time of the day or night), tucked away from the hustle and bustle half a block away.The hotel itself was very nice.

The bed and linens were very clean, and though the mattress was too hard for my personal taste, my travelling companion thought it was perfect.

It was an excellent value at under $150 per night. I planned to stay there again this year; however, when I checked the price for this year's trip, I was astounded to see that the price had doubled, so I looked at other options. I ended up staying at Comfort Inn Midtown, which was just a couple of blocks away and was now practically the same price as the Econo Lodge. (I paid $240-$270 for each of the 3 nights I stayed--Saturday, Sunday, Monday.)I was pleasantly surprised because Comfort Inn's bedrooms were twice as large, as was the bathroom. In addition, unlike the Econo Lodge, the Comfort Inn had an exercise room and an office with 2 computers; it also had a larger lobby and more soda machines. The breakfast was also a bit better. It included cereal, donuts, bagles, bananas, apples, mixed nuts, dried cranberries and white raisins, frozen waffles, yogurt, boiled eggs, coffee, juice, cappuccino, and even Red Bull (regular and sugar free). The location is ideal, as it is just a few blocks from the main activities in Midtown Manhattan, including Broadway, Times Square, 42nd Steet, Rockefeller Center, 5th Ave, and the Museum of Modern Art. Although it is just a few hundred feet from the busiest part of Manhattan (the real core of the Big Apple), it is not excessively loud, because it is half a block off of the main strip. The view is not great. In fact, the only window in our room overlooked a tiny enclosed court; the only thing you could see were the windows of other people's rooms. The staff was generally friendly and helpful. I forgot to bring shaving cream. I inquired at the front desk if they had any. The woman at first said they had none. But, as I was walking away, she took the extra step of asking the man who is apparently in charge of supplies (he supplies the breakfast area, for example) if he knew of any. He not only found me a travel-sized shaving cream but even a couple of razors (which I didn't even ask for). They also went out of their way to help me arrange the receipts for a complicated payment arrangement that I had.Granted, this is not the Marriott Marquis (which is literally right across the street), but, then again, it costs only about half as much as the Marriott. Unless you are planning to spend a lot of time in your room while in Manhattan (who does that anyway?), choose this hotel as a great mid-level hotel. If you are on a tight budget, check the rates at the Econo Lodge first, but, unless it is substantially cheaper (at least $50-$100 cheaper), go ahead and book at the Comfort Inn because it is much roomier and has many more amenities.",North Carolina,42,4.0

A good start to the day!The hotel staff are very friendly and the free internet in the lobby was a great help for when we wanted to look things up.New York is a fantastic place, we loved it but now need a holiday to get over it!!!Take comfortable shoes, you will walk for miles.

Once again, we come away strongly recommending the Comfort Inn.We arrived for a two night stay in late July. We had booked the room at least six months in advance for $166 per night using the Choice Hotels website, under the ""internet users"" special rate. We were placed in one of the newly refurbished rooms on the 9th floor. The good: LOCATION(!), clean, new furnishings, great size (for a NYC hotel room), quiet (with regard to other hotel guests.) The bad: since we were on the front of the hotel, the noise from the garbage trucks seemed to go on all night long, the window air conditioner was quite loud (although, it does help drown out the garbage trucks!), the elevator is (still) quite slow, which was not a real big problem because the hotel was not anywhere near 100% occupied for our two nights.The staff, as before, was fabulous. What amazed me is that I remembered most of the staff from my visit here two years earlier. I did not expect that the same people would be working the front desk, the bellman positions, etc. This is the kind of stability that says something about a little hotel such as this.As before, is it the Marriot Marquis? No, that's one block to the West! It's also $400 bucks a night. I would much rather use the extra $200 per night and go out and DO something in NYC with that money.

The hotel is very close to Times Square, so it is right in the heart of midtown Manhattan. Our room was clean and comfortable. It was small, but considering the location and price, no complaints there. The wireless Internet was easy, fast, and reliable. The only downsides we had were with checkin. We drove in and needed to unload and park. We found the hotel, but the unloading area was full and there's no other parking on the street. We called the front desk to see if we could just park and they said to come to the front to unload anyway. After going around the block (which is a 15-20 minute undertaking in NYC), we were able to park in front. We then found that the hotel was short staffed and rooms were just being cleaned. They said 15 minutes, so I decided we'd park in the garage with the hotel rate and check in after that. Of course, the entrance to the garage was just a bit in the wrong direction on 46th. So around the block again for 20 minutes to the garage. When we got back to the front desk, the room was still not ready (he said 15 minutes again) but offered to take our bags so we could go look around. But before we got a chance to leave, good news, the room was ready so we went up. So really, my only complaint is that the desk should have told us in the first place where to park to avoid the two trips around the block. But beyond all of that, we had a great experience and would gladly stay here again.","Amsterdam, New York",106,4.0

There is a 24-hour exercise room and free continental breakfast available. The front desk staff was exceptionally pleasant -- when I casually mentioned that it was my birthday, the guy at the desk ran to the back office and handed me a promotional package of various samples (gum, lotion, razor, etc.) as a present. The hallways are small and cramped, but the room was a good size (especially for New York) and was clean. Only a few minor complaints - all of the bedding, other than the pillowcases, was stiff and scratchy. Also, the air conditioner (a window unit) was somewhat weak. We turned it on to full blast at nine o'clock at night and the room was still pretty warm 3 hours later, although it was cool by morning. These are pretty minor quibbles, though.

The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly. There are a couple of computers on the ground floor with free internet access which was ace and there is a tiny gym room with a couple of treadmills too which is a nice touch. Though I didn't see anyone using the gym, not surprising with downtown NY just outside. There was free breakfast in mornings in the little dining room off the lobby. I ate so much that I wouldn't get hungry again until about 3pm, and no one cared which is great.

The rooms at Comfort Inn are small, but perfect for one person or for a couple. The best part about this hotel is its location. You look outside the front lobby and you are literally looking right at Times Square less than a block away. It's also within easy walking distance of the north part of Midtown like Rockefeller Center. My first experience upon check-in was not positive, but the experience improved significantly. The TV in my first room did not receive CBS and March Madness was in full swing. They changed me to another room and the air conditioner did not work. It was March and chilly, but I need air to sleep. The maintenance man was ready to send me to another hotel but the manager took care of me. Third time's the charm and the third room was great. Aside from the small room size, the only other drawbacks were that the shower was extremely small -- not to be disrespectful, but an overweight person could not use the shower -- and the hotel seems older with old carpet, etc. But everything did seem clean, which is more important to me than new.The positives far outweight the negatives. The staff seemed friendly (especially by New York standards) and willing to help. The breakfast room offered a free continental breakfast. Two days I sat down and had toast, yogurt, fruit, etc., and two days I grabbed a muffin and coffee and headed out the door. Both ways saved me at least $10 to $15 a day.The other nice freebie is Internet service. There are two computers and a printer. I was able to check my e-mail every day and print my boarding pass for my departing flight. People were friendly and willing to share -- no one hogged a computer for hours. We did our business and moved on. There was also a treadmill but I was too lazy to use it.Overall, you CANNOT GO WRONG with this hotel if you want to be close to the action but not close to the price of most New York hotels.

But once off the lobby area it all went downhill fast.The room we stayed in on the 5th floor was very small and cramped. The TV armoir was so close to the beds and bathroom door it made manuvering around it at night a hazard. The standard mini coffee maker was located in the bathroom - above the toilet no less! Talk about an unappetizing and unsanitary place to be making coffee - by the john.The rug was so stained and soiled I wore my socks or shoes the entire time we were there.The bedspreads were worn to the point of being almost threadbare. The sheets were standard white, with the added bonus of a few ink or who knows what stains on them that had not come out in the wash.As I was in the manager's office complaining, I realized that her office was just as bad! The carpet was stained, her desk a mess and she offered no remedy or compensation. She did say that the upper floors of the hotel were undergoing renovations and that the 5th floor and below really needed it too.Other than the location and pleasant front desk staff, we were not pleased with this Comfort Inn.

Approximately 100 yds. from Times Square-you won't get better location. Also felt very safe although could say this for anywhere we visited.

As University students, we don't exactly have a lot of cash to spend on accomodations or transportation, so we decided to stay somewhere affordable and close to Times Square. Those two aspects of this hotel is pretty much where the positives end.I may be a little bit biased as I am used to travelling with my family, and we tend to stay at luxury hotels when we go away. However, I have stayed with friends at Comfort Inns before, several times actually, and I have never been as unpleasantly surprised as I was with this particular one. The room was small. When I say it was small, I mean small even by New York City standards. The two double beds were practically touching and I couldn't even pull my suitcase from one side of the room to the other. The bathroom was a tub and a sink, and it was freezing cold. The heater was a very noisy window unit and the temperature did not stay consistent.The main hallway was nice, but it is decieving. We stayed on the fourth floor, and the rooms were so close to each other that we could hear everything that was going on in the room next to us VERY clearly. On the last two nights that we were there there was a couple across the hall that seemed to be filming rather innapropriate amateur movies quite unabashadly, and with the door to their room wide open. We called the front desk, but no one did anything and the nonsense went on until about 3AM, when they finally shut their door.Room service was fine. The pillows were quite lumpy, the beds were hard and the sheets were clean, but very old and faded. We didn't have any problems with our maid service. Due to our familiarity with luxury hotels, we often lef cash sitting on the desk and bedside tables by accident, but it was always there when we returned at night.Breakfast was wonderful. it was actually oddly out of place in the otherwise budget hotel. There was fresh coffee, a cappuccino machine, bagels, muffins, several types of cereal, waffles, a toaster and fresh fruit. They also provided Red Bull free of charge every morning, which I found quite nice. I'm not a breakfast eater, but I did find myself waking up specifically so I could go down for some in the mornings.I probably would have returned to stay if I hadn't been so insulted by the manager when we checked out. The staff had, up until this point been very very friendly. The breakfast attendant did not speak any english, but he was always smiling, the maids were friendly and very accomodating, the front desk attendant was very nice and I had a good chat with him almost every night. However, the manager, a woman whose name I can't remember, was very rude. When we were checking out we noticed that there was a long distance phone call on our bill for $10. We looked up the area code and it was a call to Quebec. None of us had made a phonecall from the room, we all used our cell phones. At one point we tried to order pizza, but couldn't even get the room phone to work. Despite our best efforts, we couldn't even get the manager to care or check into it. She just kept shrugging it off and telling us we had to pay. I mean, it was only $10. We insisted on talking to someone else, but she told us there simply was no one else, and then announced that she had to go home as her shift was over.If you want something cheap and in a good location and you don't mind cramped rooms, loud noises and pornographers, you should be fine.

We had searched for a few days to find a hotel that had a good price, a good location, and 2 double beds (most things you book online, you can't request this). I chanced upon this one, and am so glad!It's close enough to Broadway / Times Square that you can walk to all the shows, yet in enough off 6th Ave to be quiet at night. We (Two twenty-something women) felt very safe walking in the area, and to and from the hotel at night. It is also close to the subway, which we also used (though forgot a few times to watch for uptown/downtown direction...whoops!).The hotel was great. All staff were friendly and helpful, and check-in and out was done in a matter of minutes. I called the hotel directly to book and received the exact room I wanted. I then was able to recieve a 10% discount by presenting my AAA card upon arrival. This made it cheaper than anything we found online.  We stayed in room 608--request it if you are also looking for a 2 double bed room. The closet was on the small side, but we had no trouble with having enough space for the 2 of us. People complained in other reviews about having a room in the back, with a view of a building, but honestly, it was fine--we heard no noise outside! Even if you had a room at the front of the hotel, you'd only see the building across the street, and it would probably be noisy at night! You could hear people opening/closing doors in our section of the hall (7 or 8 rooms) but not so much that we were disturbed during the night.I guess if there were more than 2 people there, things could be a little tight, but it's doable. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The free breakfast was great (from 7 to 10 am), bagels, cereal, coffee, juice, yogurt, toast--helped us save a few bucks. The elevator is small, so you might have to wait to go up, but really, who cares? There are two computers, which were handy for checking show prices & mapping places we wanted to go. You might have to wait a few minutes if other guests are there, but no big deal. Hallways are narrow, as they are in many hotels. Really, it was a very decent hotel for a fabulous price. We are highly recommending it to friends and family in the future...Just a side note, if you are going to a broadway show & want cheap tickets: Many shows have last minute ticket lotteries a few hours ahead of show time. These tickets are under $30 each and are usually for the front row. You can hope your name is pulled and get 2 tix per name. However, lotteries are open for up to 30 min...and people come from nowhere to put their name in! Other shows have ""rush"" tickets where the first 30 or so people in line can get up to 2 tix per person. The Disney ones specify that these are for students, but others (Color Purple, Chicago, etc.) are just first come, first served; each person in line gets 2 tix. Just do a round of the ticket offices for shows you want to see; ask them what time to get there for lotteries/RUSH tix and try that first!WORTH IT TO CHECK OUT BEFORE GOING TO TKTS (which cost 60 - 100 dollars (though maybe better seats).","Boston, MA",9,5.0

The breakfast was more than adequate with a selection of bagels, pastries, yogurts, cereal, fruit e.t.cThe location is great and if you want a drink in the evening there was a bar (rosie o'grady) just along the road that had no problem with our 2 sons being allowed in (ages 16 and 13)So all in all a decent room for the fairly inexpensive rate and i would use them again if I ever returned to NYC",London,8,4.0

I would never stay there again because of the noise though. The room doors are heavy and close loud and hard. I tried to respect my neighbors, but they didn't do the same for me. I was awakened constantly during the night. I stayed up until 12:30 a.m., but others around me were up later and every time someone closed their door it woke me up and shook the room. The noise would start up again around 6:30 a.m. as people left their rooms. I have never heard hotel room doors close so loudly. Waking up constantly because of this ruined this hotel for me. There were other negatives such as the room phone that worked the first day, but not the other two days. The weather was very cold while I was there, and at night I about froze in the bed. The blankets were tissue thin. I slept with a sweater over my pajamas. Unless I couldn't find it, I don't think there was any way to control the heat in the room. There was a window air conditioner, but for heat I was at the hotel's mercy. The room seemed clean until I pulled the bedsheets back at midnight on the first night and saw a semen stain. Despite all of this, I have to admit that the location was terrific and the staff that I encountered were delightful. They were all pleasant and very friendly. The bathroom was large and the water pressure great with plenty of hot water. I really liked the people that worked there, but I just wouldn't go back primarily because of the loud room doors.","Independence, MO",14,3.0

We reported this to the manager who indicated our maid was only employed with them one week. The manager did not follow up with us as promised. We spoke with another occupant who had 2 cameras stolen from their room the same day. When they asked the hotel if any other cameras had been reported missing they were told no, which was not true. We were not advised to fill out an incident report and were discouraged from contacting the police. So for the rest of our stay we had no maid service because of concern about additional items being stolen. There is 1 ice machine and it was broken half the time we were there.

Most of our waking hours were spent sight seeing. The room was very clean. The only drawback was that the room faced 46th street and thus was quite noisey. My wife and I are fairly sound sleepers so this did not really bother us that much. Other rooms may be much quieter. The breakfast provided was typical of many hotels. We ate shotly after the breakfast room opened (7:00 am) and found everything satisfactory. The breakfast was as advertised. There was only on small elevator. We did not experience any long waits. We were on the 3rd floor and often walked down the stairs. The location is great. There are many restaurants nearby. Times Square is less than a block away.

When I was planning my first-ever trip to New York City I really did not know where to stay and I admit the reviews that I read in Trip Advisor where the key element in order to choose the Comfort Inn Midtown. After a four-night stay my conclusion is that I agree to previous reviews in the sense that this hotel is a very good option in New York City.I do not have new things to add to the many reviews posted here, but I would like to comment my agreement on the following advantages of the Comfort Inn Midtown:Price.- Very affordable considering the hotel is closely located to Times Square.Room/bathroom cleanliness.- They were spotless in my experience.Room amenities.- No luxuries here but you find adequate space for clothes (corner closet), iron, ironing board, hairdryer, coffee maker, radio alarm & TV. Hotel amenities.- I found the free Internet access (two computers in a “business room”), complimentary breakfast, and free daily newspaper as a plus. There is also a fitness room but I did not use it; it seemed small but adequate.Location.- As it has been repeatedly noted, the hotel is close to Times Square and the Rockefeller subway station; the convenient location gives you the chance to walk and be part of many activities or to take the subway or a bus wherever you want to go.Staff.- In my experience, the maid and the breakfast room attendant were even friendlier than the front desk staff, but in general terms all of the employees are kind and attentive.On the other hand, some travelers have noticed weaknesses and noted them here; I have an opinion on the following:Slamming doors.- Yes, doors do slam, then it is a good idea to be careful when closing them.Elevator.- It is old and small indeed but no big deal; my room was in the sixth floor so I usually took the elevator and its service was functional enough.Room size.- I do not know other New York hotel’s room size, thus I lack a point of comparison; the room seemed small (I got a queen-size bed) but I do not need more space. Perhaps the rooms are too small if you travel with your family, but I did not have the chance to see a two-bed room to have an opinion on that.Temperature.- Other reviews complained of rooms being too hot… no problem in my stay, since tropical storm “Ernesto” brought rainy days to the city.As a side note, throughout the almost 250 TripAdvisor Traveler Reviews about the Comfort Inn Midtown, there are some descriptions that are actually referring to the Comfort Inn Manhattan, which is located in 35th St and has a total of 12 floors; the Comfort Inn Midtown is a smaller hotel, with a total of 9 floors (new readers of these reviews, please take this into account… any descriptions of a 12-floor hotel and two elevators are actually not referring to the Comfort Inn Midtown).Overall, I would stay in this hotel again.","Aguascalientes, Mexico",17,4.0

This one really rose to the top as the best hotel under $200/night.I wanted a clean room for a night after a red-eye and didn't want to pay the $300/night that most name brand hotels were charging.Upon arrival, they weren't able to give us a room. Understandable since it was 8am. We returned after breakfast at a local diner and were again told that we couldn't get a room until 12 or 1. This is better than the standard 3-4 pm check in times, but we figured that they'd have an early check out and be able to get us in sometime sooner.We ended up killing a little time in the lobby and our patience paid off. Probably 15 minutes after 9, they were able to get us a clean room that more than met our expectations. Sure the room was small, but not unreasonably small.

Due to the other comments on this site I rang the day I was checking in to be told byu the hotel they do not have king size beds with a sofabed in the same room. This made for a very uncomfortable stay for my husband, our eight year old and me in one bed. My brother-in-law slept in the other bed. We have not yet had an apology from the hotel, although we booked through Choice Hotels. Anyway, we had a room on the twelth floor and had fantastic views of both the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. We walked the stairs most of the time, and it was great to walk the various staircases and to see the old building, including watching the mail go down the chute. Our room was always clean. The breakfast was very good each morning and the location was great for subways and walking.I would stay here again, but you need to ensure you are getting what you pay for.",,107,4.0

I would agree that the location is one of the main selling points of this establishment. The Inn is situated a mere couple of minutes walk from Times Square and there are lots of local eateries (at various food prices and choices.) As well, it is close to the Hop On - Hop Off buses at Times Square and within walking distance to many of New York's vast sights and subway stations. The room my husband and I were allocated was very small, as was the bathroom (shower stall/toilet/washbasin). The room was clean - but do NOT expect 5 star accommodation. I rate this hotel as 2 1/2 to 3 stars. However, the hotel staff were very friendly and obliging. The room price included breakfast which was sufficient to start the day's activities (tea/coffee/juice + cereals/pastries etc/fruits). We enjoyed a great live theatre matinee show after waiting a relaltive short time for TDKT tickets (2 for the price of 1 !) The ticket selling booth was located closeby Times Square. Value for money, I think this was a most favourable hotel and we have stayed in this city 5 or 6 times previously. P.S. We showed our Australian Automobile Club Membership Card and got 10% off the daily rate. I booked the hotel over the web at hotels-and-discounts.com","Queensland, Australia",63,4.0

For what it's worth, here's my experience. The lobby is nicely lit, lots of shiny brass, and it's clean. The elevator up to the sixth floor was tight, the smallest I've ever ridden. It was a taste of things to come. The bed's headboard was two feet to the right of the doorway. A desk lay six feet straight ahead, then the wall. Walking in anywhere in the room meant circling the bed. But the place was clean, including the small bathroom with shower (no tub). There was ample closet space. I'd guess the room was 10' by 10' (3m x 3m).For November, which was bitterly cold, the room was quite warm. Too warm in fact; we left our window open during the day, as there's no thermostat (the whole hotel is heated to same temp. all winter, per agreement with utility company, front desk said.) Not a biig problem. The room was set back from the street and quiet enough. My sister-in-law, her husband and their 1-year-old shared a room next to us. It was about 1/3 bigger for the same price. The hotel's biggest asset is its location. You can't get much closer to Times Square. If you're a budget tourist, this is the place to stay. The continental breakfast was fine -- cereal, milk, coffee and donuts. (My Aussie in-laws thought this was a hoot, as no one in Australia eats donuts for *breakfast.* They'd only heard of such a thing on ""The Simpsons."") An attendant lingered in the breakfast room, making sure we had ample milk, coffee etc. He works on tips -- a buck is appreciated.Overall, I'd stay here again if I was on a budget. It's not luxurious. But it's modern and it's clean and it's in Times Square. If you don't plan on spending much time in your room, you'll be fine.","Washington, DC",7,4.0

I agree with everybody. Almost everything was perfect about this hotel (location, cleanliness, friendly staff, small but workable room, decent breakfast, storage room). We got there at lunch time and our room was ready. Perfect! The only, but very important, problem is that I could hardly sleep in our room. The cause: the rooms are not soundproofed at all. We could hear the TV and the children speak in the room next to ours and everything that was going on in the hallway (a family was sharing multiple rooms and was constantly going from one room to the others, screaming, laughing and slamming doors; it was awful…). In addition, it’s New York City; people were coming in and out at all hours, slamming doors and screaming in the small hallway. I had problems falling asleep because of all the noise and was constantly waken up afterwards. In the middle of the night, after 3 or 4, I was finally able to sleep. If you are like me a light sleeper, you better select another hotel. Since we are more experienced with the subway system now, next time we plan to stay away from Times Square.

Total price per night including taxes was $200. We usually stay at 3 or 4 star hotels but tried out a 2-star for a change (and price was much better). The hotel was small (in size and number of rooms) which was nice for a change. The elevator was big enough for about 8 people (or 3 with luggage). Warning - watch out for the elevator door! It slams FAST and HARD and I still have the bruise on my hand to prove it. The halls were very narrow. Our room was the smallest I have ever stayed in but was adequate. I called it a ""one-way room"" because only one person could walk around at a time! The window air conditioner was great and not loud at all - just a quiet hum. We were on the back facing the church next door and heard the church bells a lot which was nice. Actually, that was the only noise we heard the whole trip from our room. The bathroom was larger than I had expected. It even had a large frosted window in it and a large ledge to sit your stuff on. We only had the breakfast 2 mornings and it was fine - bagels, toast, boiled eggs, cereal, donuts, fruit, coffee, orange and apple juice, cappucino, coffee and tea. One person said there were only 4 tables in there, but there were 8 (I think). We did have to wait a couple of minutes one day. I think it would have been nice if the people who were finished would have left and given up their table instead of sitting there planning the day's itinerary while we stood there. The computer room (2 computers, free internet) was a nice plus because we could check on a few things while we were there. All the employees were friendly. One other thing - the doors really do SLAM when you leave your room. They usually started around 7 a.m. All you have to do is keep your hand on the handle and pull it shut and it won't slam. We couldn't figure out why people let them slam so much. Rude, I guess. Anyway, bottom line is this hotel was great for the money and location, I would highly recommend it if you wanted a nice place to sleep and shower, and we would definitely stay there again.",Southeast Texas,9,4.0

We had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel. Given its Times Square location and its relatively inexpensive price, I was a bit apprehensive about what we would get. Our room, however, much surpassed our expectations. Although small, it was nicely furnished and the bathroom was clean and relatively spacious. In fact, the hotel looks as if it was recently refurbished. The entire staff were very accommodating and pleasant to boot! Parking is also a real bargain - just across the street and only $20 per 24 hours, about half of what the other hotels charge. The continental breakfast included bagels, doughnuts, coffee and milk, which is all one really needs. If you're adventurous and want something more for breakfast, try the Cuban restaurant immediately across the street - cheap eats and very good. A real experience.

There is an added savings in the complimentary breakfast. The rooms are small, but adequate. The bed was comfortable and clean. The bath had a combination tub shower. Everything was very clean and was refreshed each day while we were out. The front desk was very cordial and helpful with any questions. I purchased the tickets for the ""Red Bus"" (Greylines) from the front desk clerk and was told that they could give me a discount. Another savings!

A Continental breakfast is offered and was very convenient. The hotel was very clean, even the basement where the ice machine is located.

Now don't get me wrong, for a quick one night or just 1 person, it was fine. I couldn't imagine spending a few days in the room with my wife. There just isn't enough room, especially the bathroom. The bathroom was nice and it seems to be recently redone so it is not one of those 30 year old NY bathrooms. The good part is you can do everything by standing in one place :) I could touch all the walls from standing in the middle of the bathroom. Cruise ships have bigger cabins and showers, no kidding.  As others have mentioned, the room was very hot even while it was cool outside. The have signs saying do not open the window so I turned on the window AC and it never got the room cold. The view was of a brick wall 2 feet away :) My friends were staying at the Pennsylvania on 34th street and I went down to meet them. Compared to the Comfort Inn the hotel was very dirty. The hallways were drab and in need of repair as was the room. I would never stay there. I take that back, I might stay there, but not with my wife. I can put up with a lot, including dirty, but she would have problems with it. The the room was twice the size of the room at the Comfort Inn but the room at the Comfort Inn wins hands down! I added this in just for comparison. Oh yea, the line to check in was about 30 minutes. The longest line I saw at the Comfort Inn was 1 person. Would I stay there again, you bet!

We stayed at the Milford Plaza 2 years ago and found it OK, but just decided to try somewhere different. However, we were slightly disappointed with this one. Yes it was clean and you really can't fault it for it's excellent location - literally just steps away from practically everything. So in that respect, the value for money was really good. And I'm not one of those people who whinges about ridiculous things like the air con being too loud, but I just found this hotel a bit shoddy. The staff weren't all that helpful and if you wanted something booking then you had to go and ring them yourself which was unusual for a hotel (after visiting hundreds) and little things like that just help you with your trip. The rooms were also unbearably hot and the only way to cool yourself was to use the fan which when we turned it on smelt like a mens urinal (and I'm really not exaggerating) so it made it uncomfortable to sleep (which is all we did in the room).The fabulous breakfast included that everyone talks about is just average - if that. You eat off of paper plates and with plastic knives and forks, which again I know may sound snobby but it just felt shabby. The man in the tiny breakfast room, which we had to wait outside for space at least 2 mornings (it only seated 4 tables) was good and kept the area clean though.All in all we had a good stay but it's nice to feel a bit special when visitng somewhere as great as New York, and this hotel just didn't do that. We travelled on a budget and never stay in posh hotels - as long as they're clean and in a good location I'm pleased enough. However, the strange bellman at this hotel didn't even help with our bags and when you pass all those lovely hotels and see what goes on in them it just makes you see how the Comfort Inn is a bit run down and needs better mannered staff.",,4,3.0

The main problem was the temperature of the room. It was uncomfortably warm and there was no way to turn the heat down. We voiced our concerns at the desk and the said that they would look intoit. Obviously there was ot much that anyone could do, since the heating system seems to be automatic. Even though there was a sign that said not to open the window, we did anyway. Unfortunately this did not help the temperature of the room. I'm not sure what the answer to the problem was. The morning breakfast was quite adequate and the location could not be beat.

I got a great midweek rate with my Auto Club discount, $98.99. I arrived about 2 1/2 hours prior to check-in but was given a room anyway. Check-in was lengthy because I arrived on March 1st, the day a new computer system was introduced, so there were some glitches with it, but that was to be expected and I didn't mind, since I was early anyway. The room I had this time, while still a queen-size, was a bit larger than the last time I stayed there, as was the bathroom. However, it seemed a bit more worn down than before: the bedspread had seen better days, the carpet was shredded where it met the bathroom, the telephone cord was frayed, the phone books were outdated, and there was a strange dent in the wall. I was on the sixth floor on the church side (the hotel is adjacent to a Catholic Church) so I did hear the church bells regularly. The room was very hot. When I asked the cleaning lady how to adjust the heat she simply opened the window, in the middle of a snowstorm! And there's still the problem with the doors that close themselves and slam loudly while doing so. If you're a business traveler and needing to get up in the morning this might not bother you, but I was there on pleasure and didn't enjoy the slams at 6:30 in the morning. Overall, however, this is still a good deal and the location can't be beat. You're right between subway stops at Times Square and Rockefeller Center, and my favorite Cuban restaurant, Havana Central, is just down the street. (Check out their dulce de leche martinis.)

It did state on the fax that if we were going to check-in after 10 pm to let the hotel know in advance. As our flight wasn't due to land until around 11 pm, I sent the hotel an e-mail a month ago to let them know. I never received an acknowledgement even though I requested one. The week before we went, I sent another e-mail, this time directly to Applecore Hotels, also requesting that they acknowledge this, but again, no response.When we finally arrived at the hotel, it was 1am & as soon as we stepped into the lobby, the clerk looked up, knew our names but then proceeded to say that a slight problem had occurred & that due to a 'medical emergency', the last guests who were in our room had to stay on for another night & that he had made arrangements for us to stay at a hotel down the road for the same price for 1 night only. The other hotel was Super 8, again owned by Applecore. We didn't have a lot of choice at that time in the morning, especially as we knew that they already had our credit card details. We were bundled into a taxi & given $5 to pay the fare, and we literally drove about 200 yards up the road to the other hotel.We didn't want to bother unpacking for 1 night & thought about staying there for the rest of our trip, a further 3 nights, but it was around $50 more expensive per night. It was a good job we didn't! Our room was overlooking the street, & the noise was unbearable all night long. The curtains didn't close & the blinds were all tattered & ripped, the lighting in both the bedroom & the bathroom was dismal.The next morning we checked out, & walked back to the Comfort Inn. I was pleasantly surprised at our rooms. They were so peaceful! No noise at all (no view either) but at least we could sleep OK. The bed was kingsize & very comfortable. There was loads of space for clothes, iron, hairdryer, coffee making & a large TV.The bedroom/bathroom was so much better than the other hotel, also very clean.There was also FREE internet access in the lobbyThe breakfast was the usual, cereal, toast, bagels & choice of pastries & fruit. They even had Tetley T-Bags! Couldn't complain about the facilities there.The main thing about this hotel is the location. You simply walk out of the lobby, turn right & within 1 minute, you are standing outside TGI Fridays, right in Times Square. By the way, look out for the web cam directly outside of TGI's-It's great fun having a morning wave into the camera & lots of people obviously had family/friends at home on the internet looking at www.earthcam.com where it's real time.On the way back to the hotel every night, we stopped at a Cuban bar a few doors up from the hotel for a nightcap. Brilliant atmosphere, great music & lovely Cubre Libres!All in all, yes, it was great shame about the beginning of this trip, but once settled in, we were all happy to have chosen this hotel & it would be my first choice when we return to New York.(We paid $109 Fri night $139 Sat & Sun, this rate was per room & included breakfast, but not taxes)Please feel free to ask any questions.",United Kingdom,100,5.0

Unfortunately, don't expect your room to be there if you are coming in late at night.

We had to walk around times square and find a small hotel for the night and had to come back the next day to deal with the manager. Not a good way to start your trip! Once the manager cleared everything up and apologized (we were still out an extra $300), things seemed to be looking up. On our 2nd night there, my friend caught one of the desk people going into our room to look for ""tape""- we had not been told or called and so he went in and watched them while they moved a couple of things around and left.As much as it was a great deal initially, sometimes it's true that you get what you pay for.","Oakville, Ontario",33,1.0

The carpeting and colorfully bordered wallpaper are unblemished. There is also subtle recessed ceiling lighting and a small but adequate corner closet. We were on the top floor in room 904 with a queen sized bed. We were on the side of the building and didn`t hear a sound from the street or from neighboring guests. Rooms ending in 01 and 02 are directly on the 46th street side and will probably have street noise.

There is also a very good free expanded continental breakfast in the compact, but pleasant breakfast room off the lobby. This includes, pastries, bagels, breads, juices, yogurts, fruit, cereal, coffee and even cappucino. For all this we paid an unbelievable $89 per night. Housekeeping keeps everything spotless here and maintenance is also impressive. I challenge anyone to find a better rate for this kind of quality in New York.

We wanted to extend our trip, but The Hampton was booked, so we chose the Comfort Inn Midtown for our second night. We chose this hotel because the price could not be beat, and the reviews on this website were favorable. We paid under $300 (total with tax)for one night ,while all the other rooms we had looked up online were $400 plus. The hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly, but the rooms are very small. The window in our room had a wall air conditioner in it, and the blinds above the AC were closed. When I peeked out the window, all I pretty much saw was another building or wall, very close. The room was a little dark because of this lack of outside light. The heating system is old; we had a radiator in our room, which had to be manually turned on.I was concerned that the room would get too hot, but it didn't.( There was cold air coming in the room from the window air condioner.) The radiator was enclosed behind a door (with a panel on it that allowed for the heat to escape.)Behind this door, in front of the radiator, was the largest rat trap I have ever seen.(I think it was maybe the only rat trap I have ever seen!) I suppose this is common in New York, but I would have preferred not to have seen it. Also, two of the pillows in our room were torn; you could see the stuffing inside of them. Maybe our expectations were a little high because we had just come from a hotel that had been recently upgraded, and had larger rooms. We're thankful that the price was right, and that everyone was friendly.(The bellhop was especially helpful, and kind to my kids.)However, we don't think this hotel will be our first choice when we return to New York.",Philadelphia,11,3.0

(By the way, one of the other recent reviews here said that you can have a view of the Empire State Building: not true, they must have confused this Comfort Inn with a different one). One peculiarity was that it seemed that the radiator-type heat was always on, which is good because it was very cold in NYC, but the only way to reduce the heat to a comfortable level was to turn on the air conditioner. It worked, so no problem. The people at the front desk were extremely helpful and attentive.

The room was very small, however, and the mattress on our bed had seen better days - saggy in the middle. The bedspread was clean but very tired. The biggest problem was the noise from the hallway. Any time someone closed a door on the hall it reverberated in our room loudly enough to startle you out of a deep sleep. We turned on the AC fan to try and drown out the noise but it was not enough.

The hotel is not new, nor is it ""The Ritz"", but it is very clean and the location is perfect. Times Square is such an exciting place to be, and we were steps away from it. We basically walked everywhere, as the hotel is centrally located. The room was small, but we were gone right after breakfast and didn't return until late in the evening, so it wasn't a big deal.

We said this would be OK, but only if we were charged the rate that was advertised the previous evening on ChoiceHotels for this room type and date ($55 less per room than the rate we were quoted for our double rooms). He said he could only offer us a 10% discount ($14 less per room). He offered to walk us down the street to another hotel if we didn't want these rooms. We said this was unacceptable since we had to get ready to go see a show in a couple of hours. We then called Choice Hotels Customer Service (CHCS) using the front desk phone.I told the CHCS clerk about what had happened. He asked me if the hotel had offered to pay for our rooms at the other hotel. I told him that they hadn't. He then put my call on hold and contacted the hotel to get more information. The office manager told him that they had one double room available and that they had told us this. When the CHCS clerk came back to my call, he told me this and I informed him that this was not true. I told him I was fine with having only one double room, but only if the single room was at the same discounted rate as listed on the web site the previous evening. He put me on hold and contacted the hotel again and discussed this with the office manager. She spoke loudly and sounded very agitated. After their call, my call with the CHCS clerk was cut off. The office manager said it didn't matter, since the CHCS clerk would just tell me that there was only one double room available and the other room would be only $14 less.Again, I said this was unacceptable and asked her to reconnect me to CHCS. She then told me that they had two double rooms available. She said that we would need to pay $12 extra per person though. We said that we would not pay any extra charges than those on the printed copy of our reservation. She did not seem happy this response, but proceeded to check us in. She said something like ""I thought you would have been more understanding, but I guess you don't want to work with me"". I thought it was very unprofessional for an office manager to behave this way while other customers were in the lobby, overhearing this entire fiasco.Because our check-in process was so disastrous (about 20 minutes), none of us enjoyed our stay at the hotel. We would definitely warn others not to stay at this hotel, based on our experience, plus other reviews we've read since then. Make sure to check out other reviews with low ratings. Several of them describe very similar stories. There are several other nice hotels in the same area and price range, so make sure to choose your hotel wisely.When we filed a formal complaint with CHCS, we were told that someone in upper management of the hotel would contact us within 7 days. It has been 2 weeks now and we still haven't received a call from anyone at the hotel.","Oakdale, Connecticut",14,1.0

Being students we didn't have a great deal to spend on a hotel so we thought that the Comfort Inn sounded reasonable. I wasn't sure what to expect, but as we entered our room we were really pleased with what we saw. The room was sparkling and was cleaned everyday. The staff were really friendly and couldn't do enough to help. The situation of the hotel couldn't be better. Just a stones throw from Times Square, Empire State Building, Macy's and 5th Avenue all within short walking distance. Once we left I realised I had left my wash bag at the hotel, full of brand new and unused Clinique products and MAC makeup, which I never thought I would see again. The next day my cousin went to the hotel on my behalf to enquire about my bag, to our surprise had been handed in by the maid, containing the full contents. This alone is a reason to stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown. It really put the icing on the cake for my boyfriend and I and made our trip to the city a happy memory.","London, England",6,5.0

We spent three nights here and the place was far and away the best value you will find within miles of Times Square. We (me, wife, 19 y.o., 17 y.o.) stayed in one of their eight double-double rooms. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet, if you don't count the occasional bells of the beautiful church next door! The bathroom was much bigger than expected and the towels were great, despite some previous postings to the contrary. The staff was nothing short of fabulous, especially Dioris and Jovanni behind the counter, and Sidibi and Kenneth, the bellmen. We got there far too early to be checked in, so they took our luggage and stored it securely for us, while we went out and explored. They even pointed out that a festival was going on down on 6th Avenue (away from Times Square) and we should check it out. I know big hotels will do things such as this, but a budget hotel on Times Square? They also knew lots of little secrets and are more than willing to share with you, if you ask.The hallways are incredibly narrow, but also very well-lit. You never once felt as though the place was old and dingy. The elevator was indeed slower than it should be, but with only 80 rooms, we never waited more than a minute or two, and that was rarely. Be careful, though. The elevator door closes so fast that it can smack into you pretty hard if you are not paying attention. Make sure you are holding it with your hand or that someone has the button pushed for you. They have free continental breakfast, which was simply muffins, donuts, cereal, and fruit. But seriously, how much more do you need in NYC? You don't go there to have great breakfasts. We ate quickly and then went out and did what we wanted. The only thing that I will ask them to change when I send in my review to them is to adjust the pressure on the door closers in each room. If you are trying to sleep and the neighbors are not considerate when entering/exiting their room, the door slams shut loudly. The good news is that each hall is divided in half by the elevator shaft, so you really only have about six rooms in your half of the hallway to be disturbed by. They have a computer with internet access in the business center so that those of us who don't want to haul around one on vacation can still check email and weather reports, etc. You can even print out (for free) maps of todays destinations, subways, whatever. Parking was a relative bargain at $20 per day. It is just across the street, about 1/4 block away.I'll sum up by saying this: I will stay in this hotel again the next time I am in NYC. I will not look for a better deal because there is not one to be had.",Battle Creek MI,11,5.0

I chose this hotel based on the reviews on this site and write-ups in a couple of travel books. Everyone's comments proved to be very accurate. The hotel is 1/2 block east of Times Square directly across the street from the very hip looking Muse Hotel. The street is quiet and we did not have any problems with security. In short, the location can't be beat. Great access to several subway stations gets you wherever you want to go in minutes, theater district is just a few blocks away, Radio City right around the corner, MOMA a couple of blocks past that. Many restaurants are within walking distance. You could walk to Grand Central if you weren't lugging bags. The hotel is very clean, the staff quite pleasant. The wi-fi worked perfectly. Breakfast is included, served in a small room off the lobby, and it is simple (bagels, doughnuts, dry cereals, fruit), but plenty to get you on your way in the morning. This is a small homey-type hotel, the photos on the web site make it look larger than it is. There is a small sitting area and window seat in the lobby, the front desk, a small exercise room, computer room and meeting room. The lobby is very clean and nicely renovated. I believe there are only 8 guest floors, with maybe 12 or so rooms on each floor. There is only one elevator, but we did not experience the excessively long waits that other reviewers have described. Our room was on the 5th floor, and it was an easy walk to take the stairs instead if we wanted. The room itself was quite small, maybe 10x12 feet? with a Queen bed, nightstand, small desk, small armoire with TV. The view out the window was of the brick wall of the next building, it would probably be nicer to choose one of the front rooms if you can. Each room has a window-mounted A/C unit - and this was our biggest complaint, it was very loud when on hi speed, somewhat less noisy when on its lowest setting. The bathroom was relatively large considering the bedroom size, and very nice, tiled all around with a pedestal sink, toilet, tub/shower. The towels are rather thin. Soap and shampoo/conditioner combo are provided, other than that, you'll need to bring your own toiletries.At the end of our stay, we checked out in the morning and checked our bags with the doorman until we were ready to leave later in the afternoon. When we returned to collect the bags, one of the people at the front desk called to me and told me I had left something in my room. I was very pleasantly surprised that she knew me by sight and room number as she handed my camera charger to me.I am normally a more luxury-oriented traveler, so I was concerned about choosing a ""value"" hotel. If you're the same way, but are willing to forego some of the amenities, this is a great choice. When it came right down to it, we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. The breakfast was a nice bonus, the location was fantastic and you can't beat the price -- we were able to happily spend our money instead on fun things like show tickets, etc. -- all in all, it worked great for us. P.S. If you are a AAA member, show your card when you check in. We were given $10 additional off the rate I had already booked with a AAA discount.","Phoenix, Arizona",37,4.0

We were a little concerned that an inexpensive Manhattan hotel ($143 plus tax) might not be clean or well maintained but our concerns were swept away. The bathroom was spacious and modernized with a great shower/tub with good pressure, tile floors, upgraded faucets, hair dryer, and cleaned immaculately every day with fresh towels, soap, etc. The queen bed was comfortable, sheets changed daily, had a large TV but no time to watch, and an effective air conditioner. Large walkin closet and ample drawers. Small quibble-only one side of bed had a reading lamp. Window looked out onto a wall which was OK because who goes to NY to look out hotel window? Advantage as it also meant very quiet. I am a light sleeper but had no trouble having full night's sleep every night. Included breakfast featured bagels, donuts, two cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, two juices, toast, coffee, tea and even machine brewed espresso. This saved time and money finding a breakfast restaurant in expensive NYC. I thought I would use the small exercise room (treadmills, exercise bicycle), but because of the central location, we walked most places and didn't need the extra exercise.

I booked this hotel based on the reviews on this site and I'm happy that I did. This hotel is the best kept secret in Manhattan. The location is perfect as it's on a side street away from the hustle & bustle of Times Square but close enough and within walking distance to everything. If you're traveling alone or with a partner this is a great hotel to stay. However, if you're traveling with children or large groups I would recommend staying at a hotel with much bigger rooms as the rooms are small here and they do not offer rollaways. The front desk staff were courteous and friendly and the bellman was terrific. Although there is only one elevator I never had to wait long. My room had a queen size bed and bath/shower so I must have lucked out and got one of the bigger rooms. The room was always neat and tidy. Although breakfast is offered between 7-10 if you miss it there are plenty of eateries close to the hotel. If you're arriving from JFK I would recommend taking one of the shuttles to the hotel this way you can see a little of NY and will only cost $17 instead of the $45 for a taxicab ride. Also, when I left for the airport I used the car service that the hotel provides. For about the same amount of money to take a cab I opted for the ride to JFK in a nice A/C luxury vehicle and it was worth every cent. Just ask the bellman or the front desk and they will set it up for you. I have to say my stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown was the best and I would highly recommend this to family and friends.

By staying at the Comfort Inn, my wife and I had more money in our pocket to go out and enjoy the city - which after all, is what it is all about! Our 7-night stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown in May, while having no outstanding features, was comfortable and trouble-free; in other words, it did the job we wanted of it, and it did it admirably!Our expectations of the hotel - and our reasons for choosing it - were based on the reviews here. I guess we expected something a little run-down (but not too much), somewhat noisy at the front, perhaps occasional problems with the cleanliness of the bathrooms or linen. A few reviews suggested that some people found staff to be a little unfriendly or brusque, and that the breakfast provided ""ran out"" if you weren't there early enough. So we figured that at worst the hotel may be a little unpleasant, but for $130 a night we could live with that.It was a pleasant surprise then, when even our minor apprehensions were proven to be dead wrong. The room was clean and seemed quite new. Despite the fact that we had a 5th floor room at the front (after a check-in request for ""something quieter"" than the 2nd floor room at the front we were booked in to), we slept soundly through each night without any problems. The towels and bathroom were clean and fresh each day. The breakfast, while a little bland by the 7th morning, was plentiful (though glazed doughnuts for breakfast?!) And most importantly, the staff were out-going and helpful at all times.Best Points:* THE PRICE!* The location - although given the efficiency of the subway, next time I'd be tempted to take an even-cheaper outer boroughs hotel that was next to a subway station.* Room size was much larger than expected - a good 80cm on either side of the queen bed, and at least 1.5m between the foot of the bed and the TV cabinet.* Free internet access - a nice bonus.* Free newspapers at breakfast (if early enough)Not so good points:* No fridge in the room - I guess we assumed there would be one, and had plans to get groceries for lunch and some of our dinners. A fridge can be arranged, but costs an extra $10 per night. No thanks: we ate out.* Slow lift - unless the lift was already at our floor, the only time we waited for it was for luggage. When going down 4 floors, the steps were often faster than the lift.* Toilet often required a couple of flushes, and even blocked once; but was promptly fixed after we asked at reception.But really, these are minor quibbles. None of them produced more than transitory annoyances. For where it was (and compared to the reviews of other Manhattan hotels in the price range), the Comfort Inn Midtown was wonderful.The bottom line: would I stay there again? As I mentioned earlier, better-than-expected public transport would have us looking a little further out next time; but if we stay in Manhattan in future (even when we have a little more to spend) we will be staying at the Comfort Inn Midtown!","Brisbane, Australia",14,4.0

We wanted to stay close to Times Square and not pay too much, so we chose the comfort inn. Location was good. However, when we arrived, they had booked us with only 2 people, instead of 3, and informed us that there were only single/full size beds available and that they have no roll-away-beds! So, one of us had to sleep on the hard-as-a-rock floor in a tiny little room. We were informed that we would get extra blankets for the person sleeping on the floor, although we only received 2 extra (not enough to make the foor even somewhat comfortable!) Also, there is only one tiny elevator in the whole hotel making it somewhat difficult and long to get up or down, as sometimes you had to wait for several trips before you could get on the elevator. On a good note, the continental breakfast was great.As we were leaving to go back to the airport, we asked the concierge to call us a taxi, as we were waiting in the lobby, they told us our cab was ""here"" as they literally pushed us out the street and made us walk up to times square with our suit cases to hail a cab ourselves!

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. rooms were extremely clean. The 1st night we had a room with a view of the brick building next door. The room was relatively small but we expected that. the only downfall was no bathtub. On our way out that evening I asked if all the rooms only contained a shower. I was told no only 2 of them. I asked if it was possible to switch rooms as i knew the hotel was sold out. I also asked about a corner room as I had requested it originally. They offered to move me to one in a.m. With warning that it would be noisy as it was on the street side. my daughter prefeered it as she loves the noise of NY.

We took the 2nd option and yes, you could hear the noise from the street (even at 4am) but we thought the room itself was such a great size we were reluctant to move. I guess, we must be sound sleepers because the noise didn't bother us at all in the end although I'm sure it could really bother others. Everything else was great.

After reading reviews on the more expensive hotels I was not ready to spend extra money on a hotel that I was barely going to stay in. Some of the reviews on the 3 stars were actually scary. I down graded to a two star with excellent ratings. We seemed to spend a little more than most people here at $160. a night. What I really enjoyed about this hotel was that it was a non-smoking hotel. So many times even if you stay in a non-smoking room the lobby and halls of older hotels have an off odor to them. This was not noted at this hotel, I think, because of this policy. We were located in the back on the 7th floor corner room. Did not notice any noise except when it rained one night it came down onto the air condition unit and was kind of loud. Not unbearable. The couch in the lobby was tattered. I think it was an antique. I wasn't sure what I would find in the rooms but found everything said on this forum to be true. Clean rooms. Clean white towels. Maid service everyday. Family used the breakfast room and was satisfied until lunch came. We were out of our rooms by 9 am every morning and back shortly after dinner to get ready to go out again for the evening. Everything was always put back together after our rush of showers.We had a room that had the bathroom tiled. It was a small 3 inch step that all of us tripped over a couple of times. Bathroom was clean, no mold visible and new soap put out everyday. Rooms weren't especially pretty, but location was great. Would stay here again. My sixteen year old could watch all the TV he wanted and they seemed to have the sports channels for games available.I used the down stairs computer to print out our boarding passes the night before we left. Also, the morning of I checked our flight to make sure it was on time. Some hotels will charge for this service at this hotel it was free.

Be careful of the prices they charge! When I made my reservation, I was quoted a price and then when I arrived they charged me $15 a night more because they claimed my discount was no good! After taxes, I ended up paying an extra $75 for the three nights. My room was on the 4th floor. It was tiny but clean when I arrived. The second day I was given towels with make-up on them. It was also noisy. I never had a good night's sleep. You can hear doors slamming all over and also personal hygiene noises from other rooms. The doorman was the only friendly staff member I encountered. I never ate the breakfast so I can't comment on that area. Elevators ran fine---I never had an issue with them---and location is nice. I don't need a fancy or upscale hotel, but I do like cleanliness and quiet.All in all----if you don't care about prices, room size and cleaniness---it would be a good place to stay.

I booked this hotel 3 months ago for a 3 night stay (march 17-20). I got a rate of $107 a night with AAA. I constantly looked at the site for new reviews to see how this hotel measured up as I thought at $107 a night, how nice could it really be. But after reading consistent good reviews, I decided to give it a shot. And let me say that I am glad that I did.My mother and I went to NYC and just wanted a place that was clean and in a safe neighborhood. We wanted something centrally located and this hotel couldn't have been in a better location. Just yards away from the heart of Times Square and located near theaters and subways, it couldn't have been better. I requested a room with 2 twin beds and on a corner since I heard they were bigger. I was told that they didn't have corner rooms with twin beds, but when we checked in our room seemed significantly bigger than the other rooms on our floor. We were in room 307 which was in the back side of the building. It was a bit hot in the room and we didn't want the heat on or that noisy ac unit, so we opened the window a crack which let in a cool breeze. Let me say that it was like we were in the country. No noise whatsoever...you would never imagine we were only yards from Times Square. The room was kept clean and tidy during our 3 days and everyone was super friendly, especially the breakfast man. (Don't forget to bring some money to tip him). We were lucky and got a table each morning for breakfast, but it seemed to be quite full at the busier times in the morning. There is only one elevator..the only problem I see. But being on the 3rd floor we often walked down the stairs which weren't too bad.All in all this hotel was great and I would definatley recommend it to anyone who is looking to be in the heart of the city, have a clean room, breakfast included and save the money on a room you are never in for the finer things NYC has to offer.

Its a good hotel, clean and comfy beds. Goo breakfast, bagels, doughuts, toast, bananas, yoghurts, OJ etc and the man who looks after the breakfast room is so helpful, so dont forget to tip him!If you are unfortunute enough to get a room at the front, allthough it may be roomy, you will need earplugs.The noise at night is horrendous horrendous horrendous. At times I was woken in the night terrified of this loud thunderous noise! But this is also because the hotel is on Times Square which is a NY version of Leister Sqaure - tacky busy and awful. Avoid at all cost Bubb gump Shrimp on Times Square, the service is the worst, the food is in edible and you cant see out the windows for the dirt. A must however is a drink at the Marriot Marquis. The bar/restaurant ""The View"" is on the 48th Floor and the views are fantatsic. Do not have dinner here though. Its a buffet with the smallest plates and apalling service.The best restaurant is opposite the comfort inn called Le Tre Veneizie. Its the best Italian with excellent customer service - a very rare thing in NY.Sights:Empire State: A busy gift shop with a view. Huge let down.Sky ride: Dont do it. Statue of Liberty: Worth a lookCentral Park: Wonderful if sunny, the Zoo is brilliant, avoid the horse drawn ride, you get 20 mins around the front bit of park for $40, disapointing.Pier 17 & South Street Sea Port: Stop and a have some clam chowder.Brooklyn bridge: A walk with a view - brilliant.New York public Library: Good for 10 mins to kill.Grand central: Loved it. A good affordable place for lunch.Macys: Busy and hot but good bargians: Go to the Visitor counter, show a passport and you get a card giving 11% everything in the store including sale items.For dinner get a cab to Greenwich Village or Little Italy.

We went there because of price and the positive reviews on this site. I knew that I wanted to minimize my costs in NY while staying at a decent hotel, so this place fit the bill. So, let's get on with this review, and I'll try to detail it as well as possible, since I just got back from there today (it's still fresh in my mind).The lobby area is elegant enough. Nice marble floors give way to the concierge and the dining room, which is used for the abundant breakfast items (nothing fancy, but there are bagels, doughnuts, apples, bananas, various cereals, strawberry yoghurt, and coffee... I'm not sure if I'm missing anything, since I ate there 2 of the 5 nights there only...) There is a small exercise room up the hall a bit, with a treadmill, a bicycle machine, and I believe a stairmaster. Overall, good lobby amenities. Nothing out of the ordinary, but what is there, it's done well.We stayed on the second floor in the back. The view was nothing to write home about, simply facing a brick wall. Beware, as very little light comes through the black-out curtains and the brick walls. We wanted to wake up early and go sight-seeing, but since no real amounts of light made it into the room, we had a hard time getting up, since we were so comfortable and lazy in our cozy bed. Of course, that does ensure that you get a good night's rest, as there is very little noise and light that comes into your room!The room ameneties are excellent for what they are. Quite a large, decent TV, with about 35 channels. A comfortable, queen-size bed. A nice chair and table. Drawers. A beautiful painting hung over the bed. Just little things that you can find in every hotel, and done well here as well. The furniture, as far as I can tell however, was not run down or did not seem that it would break in an instant, a good sign. The bathroom was excellent, having a shower stall and a modern-looking basin. There is a hair dryer in there as well. Water from the shower was good, cold and hot, and the pressure was good.The rooms were kept spotless, which I was thankful for. Clean towels every day. Clean sheets every day. Amenities replaced as needed, such as new soap bars. Vacuumed every day. It was wonderful, because I cannot live without cleanliness. I've heard horror stories about some other hotels, and I'm glad this isn't one of them.The cleaning lady was one of the sweetest lady I've ever met. You'll know her when you see her. She is so sweet, in that little accent of hers, telling us when our room would be ready again, and always greeting us warmly whenever she saw us. This was a nice touch, especially when you meet lots of people in the city who are too rushed or care too little for niceties. This warmthness also extended to some of the staff members, but she was definitely the person that stuck out in my head. Oh, and so is the guy who encourages you to eat breakfast heartily. He just keeps encouraging to take food! He was also a nice guy.Staff at the front were friendly and helpful for the one time I asked for help, and that was how to take the subway to get to the airport. So I can't really comment on that. They seemed generally friendly though, always ready to answer questions that you had.Overall, a great value hotel. Clean rooms are important to me, and this had them. Oh yes, and there was plenty of space to move freely around the room. It's not a big room, but it's a big-enough room to be comfortable enough. I loved it here, and will most definitely stay here again. Highly recommended.","Rochester, New York",17,5.0

The location is perfect - a 20 yard stroll and you're in Times Square. It's in a great position for all of the main attractions (Empire State, Guggenheim, Central Park and all the main shopping districts are within 10 minutes walk) and conveniently placed for the subway to other areas. There's an excellent choice of Deli's and restaraunts around the hotel (Check out the Guinness in the Irish bar next door!)As for the hotel....well, It's pretty good, even aside from the location. Yes, the rooms are small. But what do you expect for $99 per night - a butler?! The bed was very comfortable, the shower was hot and it was clean, tidy and pleasant. Internet access was free downstairs and there was a small selection of exercise machines downstairs (No-one mentioned this!!!)The breakfast is a big bonus. There are doughnuts, bagels, rolls, fruit, yogurt, cereals and tea\coffee, apple and orange juice. I don't know what people are complaining about - there's loads, I found the service friendly and it was the perfect way to start the day. Not many New York hotels offer breakfast, it's a real benefit.Staff are friendly, helpful and polite. We were able to check in an hour early, and they kept our bags for us on the day we checked out.Look, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel. If you want the lap of luxury - sure, there's much better hotels. But you will pay for them - and how!!! For the price, this is perfect, you will not go wrong.I scoured every review on here before I booked, and was naturally suspicious of all the praise being heaped on what was a very cheap hotel. There is no need to be. Everything people say is true, and you cannot go wrong with this place if you are budgeting!!!!Save $100 per night and spend it on shopping!!!!!!",England,16,5.0

The bathroom was spacious for two and always clean towels, fresh soap, etc.Internet worked fine, no problems there. Television was great. The heat was somewhat warm but all you had to do was turn down the radiator.Desk staff were great. Rojo always had a smile and was willing to help.

Not only for the location, but the hotel itself. I had read some nice reviews here on tripadvisor, so I expected it to be a good place to stay, but even so I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the hotel is really clean and with nice furniture, colors, nicely decorated etc. Looks very fresh and I believe its renovated not so long ago. We had a corner room which is a bit larger than the others so we we're lucky. The TV was a big one and right in front of the beds. The room was on 7th floor and not facing the street, so the noice was a minimum and sleeping was excellent (nice firm beds too). The room was big enough and also the bathroom. Even in cold february the room was warm, and we just put the (noisy) a/c machine on for a few minutes every morning to get some fresh (New York...) air. The cleaningwomen and the man in the breakfast room were very friendly to us, some of the staff at the desk could be more helpful though (we had to complain a few times about the Internet not working and the reaction was barely visible...)Breakfast was great, with bagels, cereals, donuts and lots of fresh fruit. Free coffee whenever we wanted all day. All in all, I think this hotel gives great value for the money (which for us was 100 dollar per night plus taxes) with of course unbeatable location really close to Times Square. I really can recommend this hotel to anyone coming to New York. I have stayed in other hotels in New York but this was by far the best value for money.",,8,5.0

Well, I like fresh air, so I gave it a try, and it would fully open. I asked at the front desk about the sticker, and was told it is because pigeons tend to fly into the rooms with open windows, as there is no screening.About 99% of what has been written in other reviews is accurate...the breakfast, doors closing, etc. I will add that I was on the 7th floor, west side, which is right next to a church. For whatever reason, the church bells would go off during the day at strange times. Not as if it was an hourly event, but I could never understand why the bells were ringing....it was not a function of time. Perhaps church services or something, but never a problem.It is a 15 minute walk to the hotel from the airport express bus drop at Grand Central Station (the best way to get in from LGA or JFK).

Overall, we found it to be a good place to stay in midtown Manhattan. Its major benefits were: a great location (only half a block from 7th Avenue and Times Square on one side and just three blocks from Rockefeller Center on the other), very clean rooms and bathrooms, an excellent price (we paid $80.99 a night before the myriad of taxes were added) and a good, free continental breakfast (including, cold cereals, bagels, toast, yogourt, donuts, coffee, milk and juice). The breakfast alone could easily cost you $10.00 each in a local eatery. (Try to get the breakfast table by the window to watch the action across the street on W. 46th St., including the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School and people coming and going from The Muse Hotel, where they are paying two or three times the amount you are. It makes the breakfast taste that much better.) There is only one elevator in this nine-floor building, which can be slow. But, if you are on one of the lower floors, the stairs are easy to navigate. Our only complaints related to: noise (surprisingly, from inside the hotel, not from the outside action - the rooms are not very well soundproofed and the room doors bang very loudly, especially at 2 a.m. when the nightclubbers return) and the layout of our room (as it was small, the television was against a side wall, resulting in a literal pain in the neck). Is this a five-star hotel? No. Did we find it to be excellent value in a city where you likely won't spend much time in your room? A definite yes.

Room 704 was larger but more noisy because it was in the front of the hotel. 702 - the bathroom only had a shower stall and was cleaner than 704 which had a tub. It had a little mold here and there.

The hotel is pleasant enough, in a perfect location, but I found my front-facing room looking on to 46th Street extremely noisy. At all hours of the day and night, garbage trucks would pull up a few doors down the street and stand there for up to an hour, grinding refuse. Fortunately I'd brought ear plugs, which came in very handy when I was regularly woken at 3 or 4 in the morning. There was also a permanent roaring, whooshing sound coming from outside - possibly from a big airconditioning unit on a building opposite. On the plus side, the room was spacious, and definitely nicer than the quieter but smaller and stuffier rooms at the back of the hotel, which look directly on to a brick wall, so I decided to rather put up with the noise.The breakfast that was included in the price was also a plus, as was the unlimited internet access available in the little computer room off the lobby. I also enjoyed having a coffee-maker and hairdryer in the room.However, on my next visit to NYC, I'll probably go back to the Portland Square Hotel where I've always stayed before. It's round the corner on 47th Street, so the location is just as perfect, and the price is far less - $105 for a standard double ensuite, compared with $162 at the Comfort Inn. I've always asked for a street-facing room there and have never had a probem with noise, and at least you can open the windows and get a breath of fresh air, which you can't do at the Comfort Inn. The rooms might be a bit more worn-looking, but are spotlessly clean with towels and linen being changed daily, and the bathroom pristine, with all the usual toiletries provided. There is also air-conditioning, cable TV and an in-room safe - very handy. No, breakfast is not included, but one can get a cheap, delicious breakfast at the Evergreen Diner right across the street, so that's not a problem. There is also no in-room coffee-maker, but I always carry my own little immersion heater, so once again, not a problem. All in all, I have yet to discover a better deal in New York City, than the Portland Square Hotel, for value for money","Cape Town, South Africa",7,3.0

Excellent location - Just two minutes to the TKTS booth. Get there early Thursday to Sunday - LONG lines even at 2.20. Monday to Wedensday lines are short and better choice of shows. We saw The Producers on one night but being Irish it wasn't really our cup of tea - different humour! Lots of people said they enjoyed it and it has great reviews so maybe it's just us. Went to see Slava's Snow Show on our last night - absolutely brilliant! It's really different and if anyone has seen any of the Cirque du Soliel productions, this show is all about the 'clowns' in those shows. It's a real 'feel good show' and I was smiling for hours afterwards. GO SEE IT. It's off braodway (14th and Broadway Union Sq.) and is every bit as good if not better than some of the Broadway shows. Try to get tickets which are on the ground floor and not under the mezanine (you'll see why when you go!!!)- Subway just a couple of blocks away. Two stops to Macy's (came in EXTREMELY handy) and Toys R us etc. USE THE SUBWAY and buy a day travel ticket for $7 (compared to $2/ride). 2. Great breakfast.- No need to waste time looking for somewhere to eat early in the morning. It DOES get a bit busy just before 9am but it isn't a problem. We always got seats and the guy setting it up is VERY helpful. However, if you do feel like a fry-up or a big breakfast there is a great place on 47th st (It's called Evergreen or something like that). Also GREAT Indian place - Bombay something on 49th st.3. Clean roomsOK there a bit small but who cares. There not cramped or anything and I have stayed in smaller. If anything it made us keep everything tidy and theres a closet which has shelves where you can put all your purchases. Room was really hot but there is air- conditioning (just turn it to 10 for maximum NOT 1). The fan does make a little noise but it's nothing to really worry about.YES towels are fairly thin and small but they are fine.4. Other.We didn't ask for a corner room and maybe if we had the room might have been a bit bigger with a view (we were looking at a brick wall). The bonus of the brick wall - no noise!

I found the bathroom in particular to be sub-par. Maybe if you book at a special low rate (like I did), you will get one of the ""inferior"" rooms. Other than the price and the location, there is nothing particularly special about this hotel. If you are on a tight budget, I would recommend this place.

We called Choice Hotels again for help as we were not able to travel. They (we spoke to two different people) said they called the hotel (or Kapil_ and had no success, then when questioned they said they have a list of hotels which have no refund ever policies (okay, so why not just state that and not pretend to call the hotel to help???).

My sheets were as white as snow and crisp. The bathroom was spotless. Oh, and our showerhead broke and was fixed immediately, the staff was very helpful with this glitch. This hotel is close to all the sights. We walked to The Empire State Blg., the shows, NBC, Fox and Friends, Rockafeller Center, Stores, St. Patrick's Cathederal.

I was with my 13 year old daughter and the room was sufficent in size for us (1 Q bed) but would not be for someone traveling with a family. I am not sure if they have larger accomodations in the hotel but what we had would not work for a family. Only two people would be comfortable in this size room. I would also suggest to any sight-seers to spend the money for the Hop on Hop Off Grayline New York Sight Seeing Double Decker Bus tours. We spent $72 for The Essential New York which gets you in to The Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, The Seaport Museum (where the Concord is on display), Ticket to the United Nations, and a night tour of Brooklyn via a safe bus ride. This was the best decision I have made. We went to the front of the line for all sites and we were able to SEE everything from a great vantage point on top of the double decker bus. The tour guides are very knowledgeable about NY from the Revolutionary War time to present. Jumping off when you want to visit Battery Park or grab a slice of pizza pie was wonderful. Another bus picks you up from the same dropoff point in twenty minutes to go somewhere else!I would stay at Midtown Comfort Inn again if I visited NY, the price was more than reasonable, the rooms were very, very clean, breakfast was great and we were in the heart of everything that makes NYC, New York!

On check-in we asked for a quiet room and were told that if we wanted a quiet room it would be small. It certainly was small, but as we were only 2 it was bearable. And it was quiet as long as you didn’t switch on the air conditioning. I thought I might get used to it, but after 3 nights I still couldn’t sleep well because of the noise. Luckily it wasn’t too hot after that, so we just left it switched off at night. Otherwise the room was clean and the bed was comfortable.

The hotel is very small and has few amenities but its location more than makes up for it. It's a perfect launching pad for exploring the city, especially if you’re up for walking and taking buses and trains. It’s a 2-minute walk from Times square, a 10-minute walk from Rockefeller Center and about the same to the 42nd Street subway. (By the way, be prepared for a variety of added NYC taxes on your final hotel bill!)I was on my guard regarding what the hotel would be like, after reading all the various reviews of NYC hotels. But it’s all about expectations. Expect less and you’ll be satisfied with less. Check-in was fine. Hotel lobby was quite nice. Asked about a bigger room at the back and was given 606. Smallish elevator and only one. Room was smaller than most hotels we’ve stayed in North America, but was larger than the discount rooms we had in Rome and Venice. Bathroom was very small, shower quite small, and very limited counter space at sink. View? Brick walls, pigeons, air conditioners and an alley. (Only rooms on floors 7-9 get an actual view of any kind.) Room included TV, nice firm queen bed, desk, side table, small closet with some hangers, iron, ironing board, and bathroom hair dryer. There were a couple of cigarette burns on the bedspread/blanket. Air conditioner worked great for us with temps around 28C every day. No bugs, room was cleaned every morning, room service supplied extra towels when we asked. Room was very quiet at night.One computer available for free internet usage on main floor. Supposedly Wi-Fi was available in room as well as the high-speed line, but I wasn’t able to make it work for my older Mac laptop and the staff weren't able to help. Ice is only available in basement, the biggest inconvenience we faced (which really wasn’t a huge deal).Staff were relatively helpful. If you want to be pampered, this is not the hotel for you. They will help take care of you but they generally make guests feel independent. That part of it made me think of a hostel. The bellmen weren't highly enthusiastic but did their job.Simple but very sufficient free breakfast included bagels, donuts, toast, buns, yogurt, fruit, coffee, tea, milk, juice.Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it for budget-conscious couples who will spend most of their day away from the hotel.","Kitchener, Ontario",5,5.0

Only a block from the middle of Times Square, but on a quieter street so it wasn't in the middle of everything, an excellent location! The business center and workout facilities were a nice touch for the room as well. We got the best rate by going straight to Comfort Inn's website. Parking was across the street. We kept our vehicle there for 72 hours, and it only cost a total of $60 with a hotel stamp. The room was small, but clean. And the bathroom was a great size compared to the size of the room.

I wanted a room close to Times Square that was reasonably priced and clean. I booked through the hotel website and found a rate of $125.00. This is the max I would have wanted to pay for this room. The room is very small (as most New York hotel rooms are) and very basic. Nothing fancy about the rooms at all. The location was excellent. Couldn't have been any better. Had a small issue with the toilet not being as clean as it should have been which pretty much ruined the confidence I had in the hotel. The disgusting picture never left my mind throughout the whole trip. I do understand that the housekeeping staff can not be PERFECT and I don't expect them to be BUT...........The staff are absolutely wonderful. Front desk and door people tried to be very helpful. Previously I stayed at the Super 8 which I later found out that this hotel is part of the same ACCOR hotel group. I met nice people here and would I stay again???? I'm not quite sure. I think I would say no UNLESS the rate is very low. There is no view as might be expected. I would say that the best part of the the Comfort Inn Midtown is the staff and the what needs improvement is the quality of the furniture, bedding, carpet etc. It would seem to me that because the rooms are small it would be not as expensive to furnish the rooms with some quality items. I think that people would not mind ""small"" if it was small but classy and decorated with a somewhat quality items. It would give the place a whole different air of quality which regrettfully it does not have. I'll mention housekeeping may need a little improvement but my toilet situation may have been an isolated thing. Hey, I'm not perfect on my job either but constructive criticism does not hurt.Please do NOT let me discourage you from trying this property. It's probably fine for some but I'm telling the experience I had. All in all...two days was enough for me. I was ready to leave. Was it awful - ""NO"".

This is a great value for a hotel in NYC. We paid $107 per night, which included a fairly substantial continental breakfast. First - the room was a decent size. We did not feel cramped. Second - the bed was comfortable, as was the temperature of the room. Third - we barely heard any noise from neighboring rooms even though the hotel was sold out. Fourth - breakfast included coffee, capaccino, juice, cereal, good fresh donuts and bagels, apples, bananas, yogurt and jellies, cream cheese, etc. Many days we only snacked in the afternoon and ate our next full meal for dinner. Fifth - room was done beautifully each day, asked for extra pillows and they were there when we returned. Sixth - you could not ask for a better location - 1/2 block off of Times Square. Seventh - we felt safe in the neighborhood and in the hotel. Eighth - staff was very friendly and helpful.Only negative - our room faced 46th street. Needed ear plugs to block out the garbage truck noise each morning around 5 am. Believe me, it was loud. Ask for a room away from the street.We will definitely go back to this hotel.","Coon Rapids, Minnesota",1,5.0

I'd never travelled to the New York area overnight before and was travelling with my mother; therefore, it was imparative to locate a decent and convenient hotel. I searched high and low at every hotel site attempting to find the best I could find at a reasonable rate and with availability. Of course every hotel ever reviewed has a bad review but when I read all of the reviews for this hotel, I felt that the overall comments weren't that bad. (And of course two people can stay at the same hotel at the same time and have two entirely different experiences or I could go to the same place twice and have two totally different experiences, but....)Anyway, we stayed there and it was excellent. We had the room with 2 twin beds which was larger than we expected. There was plenty of room to move around, nice and moderate bathroom and bedroom furniture. Our room was on one side of the hotel; therefore, we did not have the noisey elevator problems. The complementary continental breakfast was very nice along with the attendant that serviced it. The staff was quite helpful with turkey day dinner suggestions with connections so that we didn't have to wait in line, supplying coupons for local attractions, etc. It is an excellent location on 46th street and nice to be off the main street. Only had to walk to the end of our block to view the parade! Our experience was lovely and we plan to stay again this year with the hope and expectation that experience is just the same or better. For our experience, I think we got MORE than we paid for at $135/night with the room, service, location, and the breakfast. It is a 2-star hotel, what do you expect. But we were very pleasantly surprised. AND, yes, the one small, slow elevator took some patience as we once walked up to our 8th floor room!","Suitland, MD",1,4.0

In addition the room seemed tired and worn.Worst of all, the elevator (one only) was breaking down and my wife (needing a cane) had to climb four flights of stairs. When discussed with hotel management, they stated ""Sorry, but live with it."" As this was unacceptable, we had to move to another hotel.We should have known that, for the rates advertised and the hotel's location near Times Square, that we would be getting this type of room and ambiance but I did not get that feeling from reading the other reviews here.
