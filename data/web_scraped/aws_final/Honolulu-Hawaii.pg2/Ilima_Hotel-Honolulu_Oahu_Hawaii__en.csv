I think it’s one of few if any hotels in that area which offers free parking . It works on first come first serve basis, however we never had a problem to find a spot. We enjoyed pool and sauna after long day around the island. Hotel personnel was very nice and friendly. We had cleaning service daily, and they did a good job, although we are not that messy.

We were meeting friends for a cruise. I was not too crazy about the destination because I dont really like ""beach"" places. I prefer Europe. I had no idea, even after reading reviews after reviews, what type of accomodation we would find. I was very pleasently surprised. We were there 3 days before the cruise and 3 days after. The building is and older property but it is located right in Waikiki close to everything. For those who know the place it is right the next street from Seaside, between Kuhio and Ala Wai. Many shop and restaurants in the area.The hotel staff greeted us extremely well after that awful loooong flight and we learned that we would be on the 6th floor (606). I was afraid about the noise due to the proximity to the main streets, it wasnt too bad with the AC on. The room (efficiency) was really big. The kitchen area is well placed and the bathroom is the old style of bathroom with bath and shower together but it is very practical. There are minimal dishes, cutlery, pot, pan,stove, fridge, toaster and a small coffee maker. All was clean and in working order. The only minus I could see is that the fan in the bathroom is extremely noisy and it works with the light switch, so no way to leave it off. The other minus is that the Air Conditionning is of the old window type and although it work well, it is also very noisy. The hotel parking in an Inside parking, it is free and is first come-first serve basis. We never had a problem. I dont know how many suites they have but considering the amount of parking spaces, I see it as excellent. The staff is very friendly, helpful and makes sure that you are satisfied. The hotel offers some classes of different things, like lei making classes, hula classes.Unfortunately, we were not there on a Tuesday when the Lei making classes take place. When I told the reception agent, she told me that since we were back after the cruise, she would make us one, and, we got them. That is special!After the cruise we were assigned room 506, so , just below the one we had on our 3 first days. Exactly the same set up.I would definitely recommend this place.It is excellent value for money. Our friends stayed in another hotel, close by, which was supposed to be upscale but they had less than half the size of what we had and not as many facilities for much more than what we payed.Should I ever go back to Honolulu, they would definitely be my first choice.","Saint Jerome, Canada",161,5.0

The location is great. It's not too close to the beach where you have to deal with the noise. But it's close enough to the beach to walk. The hotel is also just a block from Duke's Lane Market and Eatery which is a nice place to grab some breakfast and coffee in the morning and bottled drinks in the evenings. The hotel also has a small kitchen in each room where you can cook small meals rather than go out to eat every meal which costs money. The employees of the hotel are just lovely! They are always friendly and try to be accommodating. Their communal computer was down and I needed to print a ticket for Peal Harbor that was in my email. They were nice enough to print it for me. They also had a free nut lei making class one morning. The ladies who taught that class were just delightful! They were a lot of fun. They even took a picture of me and my sister and my husband wearing our leis.Here's the but... parking is an issue and I'm not quite sure what the hotel can do about it. The parking stalls are far too narrow. Just about everyone parks over the line which will sometimes garner phone calls from the staff asking you to repark because you're over the line. When we were there, they were painting the parking garage. So, we had to move our vehicles constantly and because of the paining a handful of parking spaces were unavailable. There is a small lot across the street but it's not cheap. My advice... get a small rental car. They are easier to park between the lines.I am willing to stay there again because the positives at the hotel far outway the negative of the parking situation.

We like clean and safe, and this fit the bill. The room had a separate bedroom and a sofabed in the living room. Both were very comfortable, and the linens were very nice. It was nice to be able to spread out a little in a living room rather than just a bedroom. There were many windows, so we skipped the AC and let the breezes through. Our big balcony had a view of both the canal/hillside and the ocean, as well as a sliver of Diamond Head. It was so nice to sit on the balcony and have a drink. As mentioned in many reviews, the hotel is older, but this was fine with us because it was immaculate and reasonably priced. The location was great - Kuhio Avenue was at the other end of the block, and there are many restaurants and stores along it. The beach was only 2 blocks away, and the entire downtown Waikiki is walkable. Take the time to walk along the canal on Ala Wai Blvd, and look back at the great view of Diamond Head crater. For some fabulous food and a good time with other people, walk to the food trucks (left out the door, left onto Kuhio, and 3 blocks to Ka'iulani Ave). It's delicious, cheap, and fun, especially at night when the lights are on. Try the Kalua Pork at the first truck on the right, and the Pork Patty about 4 trucks on the left. We also had amazing fish and vegetarian tacos from a truck about halfway down on the right.

Now we’re staying in a 2 bedroom until our house is ready. The place is big enough that we could stay here indefinitely and not go stir-crazy.The “full kitchen” has saved us a lot of money on food, but it leaves something to be desired. The small single basin sink is barely adequate for washing dishes for a family of four. We’re using paper plates to cut down on dishes. It was fine when I was by myself. They provide plenty of dishes, but cookware is a bit sparse. The refrigerator and freezer are pretty big, almost full size. The mattresses and pillows aren’t great, but this isn’t the Royal Hawaiian, so I wasn’t expecting much. I did buy a pillow, since we’ll be here a while. There isn’t a lot of room to unpack your clothes, and it seems like there are extra blankets and pillows in every drawer. We just piled them up in a closet. The bathroom is fine. The water pressure won’t knock your socks off, but the towels are good and the water is hot. Parking is free, that’s pretty awesome in Waikiki. They issue every guest who has a car a parking pass, and it’s first come, first served. The garage doesn’t always fill up, and you’re virtually guaranteed to get a spot if you’re in before 8. There are washers and dryers on the third floor, $2.50 to wash and $2.50 to dry. The pool is small, but great for kids. It’s kind of stashed between tall buildings, so rarely in direct sunlight (that’s good). The water temperature is inconsistent. Sometimes it’s just slightly chilly, more often it’s icy. There are sun decks on the 10th floor and the penthouse floor. Those are locked at 8pm. One small annoyance is the street that the hotel is on. There are a lot of one way streets in Waikiki. Nohonani is not one. But you can’t make a left onto it from Kuhio Avenue, forcing you to circle the block. Getting out of Waikiki is easy, it’s half a block to Ala Wai BLVD, and then a straight shot out. Waikiki beach is a couple blocks west, and there’s a grocery store, lots of high end shopping, and tons of restaurants and bars within two blocks. If you plan to get real use out of the kitchen, though, I recommend buying your groceries at the Target on Ala Moana BLVD, it’s 8 minutes by car and half the cost. The staff is amazing.

My main criteria for hotels are clean, healthy, safe (and good wifi), all met easily here. If your tastes are for ultra crisp Hyatts and similar it won't do the job for you, but that wasn't a problem for us. It could probably do with a multimillion dollar refurbishment to replace older surfaces that have been repainted too many times, older furniture and carpets though they are still clean and comfortable. The front desk is very friendly and helpful,had some experience with the back office which was the same. There is a free internet, computer, printer set up in the lobby that I probably overused, and the room wifi is strong. Our two bed room was very large with a dining table and chairs, kind of older fashioned kitchen set up, stuffed chair and a lanai (pictured) which though caught a lot of wind and wasn't as usable as I would have liked. If you rent a car in HNL - which I recommend, driving is not difficult and the rolling refrigerators of the bus system could kill you if you're not used to Arctic exploration (see my review elsewhere) - the parking here is free, although when we arrived at 11PM we got the last space available and it was a real squeeze (there is available public pay parking across the street). That's a considerable saving over the other hotels. Basically $200 a night with taxes compared to sometimes twice that nearby. A great value, good folks, highly recommended.","Portsmouth, Virginia",62,4.0

In Feb , we stayed there for 7 nights before our cruise and 2 nights after (really 1 night and an extra day).Our Deluxe studio gave us a great mountain view and was plenty big enough for 3 adults (one King and one Queen Bed). We had a full kitchen which we used mainly for breakfast and snacks. Everything worked just fine. There is ample storage space.The beds were comfortable. Extra pillows were promptly and cheerfully supplied when requested. Lots of towels. Towels are supplied for the beach and pool, as are beach mats. Free coffee for the coffee maker.Hotel - General comments: This is an older and smaller but well-kept hotel. It is located about 1/2 block from Kuhio (all the major bus routes run along Kuhio - so it is especially convenient if you plan to use local transit) and about a 10 minute walk from Waikiki beach. This is a very good hotel for budget minded people who don't mind not being at a big resort on the beach.Housekeeping deserves a special mention. The room was spotless when we arrived and was very well-cleaned every day.Facilities we used:The small laundromat is very convenient and we used it twice. The front desk will sell you quarters and laundry detergent.Free WiFi - we used this a lot!Pool - the pool is small but was quite adequate to cool off in.Front Desk Staff - always helpful. Plenty of tourist brochures around and they will give you a local (Waikiki) map.What impressed us the most: When we returned from our cruise for our short pre flight home stay, our room was ready for us even though it was only about 10AM (They normally don't guarantee rooms until the afternoon - so this was such a pleasant surprise!) Kudos to housekeeping for having the room ready! To me this is a perfect example of the thoughtful, personalized service you get at this hotel.","Toronto, Canada",1,5.0

The kitchenette was a nice convenience but had the feel of a cabin-in-the-woods type kitchen with the old mini electric stove and very old cabinets but everything worked. It was also interesting that each room has a consumer type window AC unit retrofitted into the old louvered windows on the sides of the sliding glass door to the large balcony. It took the AC a while to cool the big room and while the balcony is a nice size, the roaring AC unit in the corner robs from relaxing and enjoying the view a bit. The bed was big and comfortable, the bathroom was clean with plenty of water pressure and hot water. The neighborhood was no worse than what I've dealt with elsewhere but I could see where it might make some a little uncomfortable. The walk to Waikiki Beach wasn't bad and there was a McDonalds about two blocks away where we like to go for breakfast. We walked or used Lyft to get around so I didn't have to deal with parking. Other people mentioned the elevators being slow which they were but not to the point of inconvenience. Staff was very friendly. Overall, I'd say our needs were adequately met.","Waterford, Michigan",1,3.0

It was okay - pretty dated but mostly clean. I gave it 3 stars for a couple of reasons: Firstly, I was told I had paid in full before arriving and was hit with a $15 a day amenities fee. This was not in any correspondence I received. I was told this was for the WiFi and the tea and coffee. How I am charged for the 'free' WiFi they advertise is a puzzle to me, especially when the connection dropped out every few minutes. Secondly, the parking is a bit of a nightmare. There was a couple of spare parks, but inconsiderate parkers had put their car into two spaces with no other parks being free. I know this isn't the hotels fault. What is, though, is when we told the male desk attendant who was checking the car parking tags and his reply was, 'Well, if you hadn't already parked I would probably try to do something'. I thought this was pretty poor form considering he had just watched my husband struggle into the park for 5 minutes, could see the other car well over the line and watched my husband have to get out of the car through the passenger door, not to mention there was another car there over 2 car parks. They have everyone's registration and room number. On a positive note, the mountain view from our room was lovely and most of the hotel staff were very friendly. The desk staff when we checked in and the male attendant were all pretty ordinary. Overall, the hotel was okay for the price we paid and compared to the cost of other hotels but I really hate being hit with additional fees upon check in. I would have been even more ticked off if we hadn't been able to get a park because of the careless attitude of the desk attendant.","Townsville, Australia",8,3.0

The position suited us very well - just off the Ala Wai Blvd, a block away from the seething crowd of beachside hotels and the bustling Kalakaua Ave, our room overlooked the Ala Wai canal and golf course and had a fantastic postcard view of the hillside and Manoa valley. No huge buildings blocking our sight, the view of the lights on the hillside at night was simply magical. And the breeze, oh the breeze, it's probably one of our best memories of Hawaii - so lovely and cooling, we never had to use the airconditioning at all, and we could dry our our swimming gear easily on the balcony. This hotel may not be everyone's cup of tea especially those who want posh and plush hotels with designer toiletries and fancy accoutrements - and pay the exorbitant rates for it! This hotel is small and has an old, lived-in feeling and the charm, decor and ambience of a 60's style hotel, complete with pink carpets, bamboo chairs and wooden kitchen cupboards - it's certainly got character!We had a deluxe studio on the 15th floor and boy, it was huge! We have been to so many hotels all over the world and this one was definitely the most spacious we've stayed in. It had a king size bed and a double bed and a large open lounge area where we could spread out. And then of course, a fully equipped kitchenette with a big fridge, microwave, filter coffee maker, toaster and a full size electric stove (4 cooking rings and an oven). We even had a small dining table with chairs. These were all a godsend as we could start our day at a relaxed pace, eating breakfast at leisure (and knowing that we didn't have to fork out for a hotel buffet breakfast which are often too much and of poor value or walk the streets to find a cafe serving decent food). We saved heaps (and probably ate healthier) by going to the Food Pantry in the next block to stock up on fruits and yoghurts. The wifi signal in our room was consistently strong which meant we could regularly check our emails and even chat to our kids across the world. There is also a self-serve laundry on Level 3, full size washers and driers and good value at $2.50 a load. And oh, did I mention how comfortable the beds were? With the breeze, the view and a comfy bed, my husband said ""this place is just perfect for relaxing!"" - exactly what a holiday is all about! I must also mention how nice all the staff were in this hotel. I was bowled over by their friendly disposition, we were welcomed like old friends and in the end, like family. The ladies in the front office: Emily and Remy, deserve bouquets for accommodating our simple requests, nothing is too hard, all accomplished with a smile. Overall, when it comes to value, location, service and comfort, I'd say this hotel ticks all the boxes, I'd recommend it to many except that it may get too popular that it won't have room for us the next time. I really hope it doesn't change, this is just my kind of hotel.(I was delighted to discover that this hotel is just a 4-minute walk around the corner to Ross Dress for Less, my idea of fashion shopping heaven, cheap and cheerful!).","Queensland, Australia",213,5.0

Theres' a decent sized balcony but ours too windy and blocked in by buildings to enjoy - so ask for a room on floor 8 or above. There's a tiny pool on the ground floor and a seperate sun deck on a higher level (but why sit there when you have the beach!) It is set 3 blocks back from the Royal Hawaiian with the canal right behind - which is good for running along in the mornings. It is only about 5 mins walk to the beach but the street has a few low-rate hotels in it so is a bit shabby and you have to walk through the Holiday Inn alleyway - or Duke's open marketplace (cheap trinkets) to get to and from the beach. It is close to a v popular Japanese restaurant and Hola Hola mini market which is handy. Waikiki is very crowded and expensive so this place is a good find to save a bit of money and get away from the crowds. Ask for a room above level 8 (there's 16 floors) as we were on level 4 and stared at car parks and shabby buildings. It is clean and serviced daily so would recommend for those planning to spend most of their time on the beach or out shopping!,"Melbourne, Australia",99,4.0

Staff were friendly and helpful.The only issue we had was with the sliding door to the lanai which could not be fully shut and locked. The front desk said they would arrange for housekeeping to check it but we heard no more about it - so it stayed unlocked during our stay.

We booked this hotel for 6 nights primarily because it did not have a daily parking fee and the reviews on Trip Advisor seemed favorable for the most part. At first glance, the exterior is looking a bit rundown but nostalgic looking. The lobby was pleasant and the lady who checked us in was very friendly, however she was unable to accommodate my request for a canal facing room on a higher floor. Based on reviews on this site, we weren't expecting a 5-star hotel. However, upon entering our ""superior studio suite"" it was obvious that this property had not been updated in decades. I don't even know where to begin! The cupboards and cabinetry were so old I think my Grandfather had the same ones in his garage for tools. The stove was straight out of the 1960's with tinfoil under the burners. There was a single sink and small counter with chips in the top. The carpet/linoleum was worn and stained. The bathroom did not have a vanity - just a skinny metal shelf above a pedestal sink. The furniture was dated and worn. There was a newer flat screen television but it was only maybe a 32"". In one corner, there was an old safe with a sign taped to it that said ""Do not use - there is another safe in the closet"". There were three ""deadbolts"" on the door - none of which worked properly. The bright pink and peeling balcony contained two plastic chairs and overlooked what appeared to be the ""ghetto: of Waikiki. Our view consisted of low income rental properties and their balconies loaded with junk and laundry hanging on railings. We observed a dude scratching his belly and sorting his bottles. The air conditioning unit had moldy foam stuffed around it. To top it all off, the distinct smell of pot wafted through the ventilation system at one point. That was the icing on the cake for us! After not being able to access their free wi-fi and having to phone the local internet provider to remedy this problem, we were able to secure another room at a much better property (4.5 star) with a view of the ocean and Diamond Head and overlooking a beautiful park for the same price per night!! Yes, we did have to pay a daily parking fee at the new property but it was so worth it in the end. We never would have enjoyed a minute had we stayed at the Ilima! The front desk lady at the Ilima was very nice when we explained we were not going to be staying. She was apologetic but unfortunately there was nothing she could have done to entice us to stay. It was that bad! In the end, we were charged for one night as well as a day of their ""resort fee"" to cancel but we did not care. My suggestion to anyone looking to stay in Waikiki area is to really do your homework. It is an expensive destination and most hotels do charge for parking. However, room rates in better properties can be comparable and sometimes even cheaper than the Ilima. Do not try to cut corners to avoid paying the parking at a better place - it is not worth your peace of mind and will make for a much more comfortable and enjoyable vacation in the end.",Edmonton,11,2.0

Down the street on Kuhio is the Food Pantry grocery store. The Bus stops are just steps away on Kuhio The Ilima is one of the few hotels offering a touch of Hawaiiana. Guests can sign up for lei-making, listening to the hotel staff sing Hawaiian songs in lobby on Fridays, and offering complimentary parking. There are complimentary beach mats and beach towels for your day on the beach. The only criticism would be that the rooms are usually made up much later in the afternoon.

The full kitchen means you can save money on food and drinks and can pack picnics when you go to the beach.Being a girls' week away, we needed lots of mirrors - check, lots of towels - check, good water pressure to wash our hair - check, and plenty of hanging space - check. Added to this was the fantastic view from the balcony (lanai), the pool and sunbathing areas, loads of windows for natural light, plus lots of lights/lamps in the rooms.I had read some reviews that weren't too favourable, but seriously don't understand how anyone could not like this place. The decor is a bit dated, but this adds to the charm of a vacation, and everything was spotless with excellent housekeeping (I've stayed in supposedly better hotels and found them grotty).There is a car rental across the street. you are literally two minutes from the heart of the tourist district straight down Duke's Lane. There is a Food Pantry the next block over for stocking the kitchen, but the little 7/11 style shop two doors down is well stocked and cheap. There is a bar two doors down where the people were very friendly and respectful (I don't understand the negative comments I had read about the the neighbourhood, every night my girlfriend and I walked past the bar and not once were we heckled). And the kitchen had all the utensils, glasses, plates etc you could possibly need.But enough about the room, you go to Waikiki for the beach, sites and culture. Ilima has ample free beach towels and beach mats - you just grab fresh ones on your way out each day. The hotel is an easy walk to all the local beaches. There is a tour information desk in the lobby and the reception staff will bend over backwards to help you. There is ample undercover parking and a full guest laundry. I'd suggest saving the money on using the dryers and just hang your clothes on the balcony over night. The hotel offers guest events too, like singalongs and lei making. They also have a luggage scale so you don't get stung by fees at the airport.All in all, I was very impressed with the 'Ilima. I've stayed at other 'budget' hotels in Waikiki and this one is definitely the best. Considering the room size, full kitchen and excellent staff, I would rate 'Ilima above a lot of the more expensive four star hotels.Being Australian, I'm not so fussy about having a breakfast restaurant in the hotel. But I know my American friends are big on their breakfasts. Don't fear, if you don't want to use your own kitchen there is an IHOP down the street, a Starbucks on the corner, and hundreds of other excellent cheap breakfast option you can pick up on you way back from an early morning swim or run on the beach. I can recommend the Seaside Cafe for super cheap but good quality food.Oh, almost forgot, Good free wifi and no resort fees!!! And did I mention, the rooms are HUGE!Seriously, for the price, this place was great. It also has so much character - everyone knows the 'Ilima - ""it's the pink one, right?"" Getting a taxi back from a big day shopping or a big night out, all the drivers knew where to go!","Canberra, Australia",23,5.0

Sure it is a bit outdated but it is a good price for the location. Having a kitchen in the room is very convenient. The room is big and it was wonderful to wake up with the views of the canal and the golf course.What was very remarkable during our stay is their great customer service.After checking out,my husband realized that he misplaced his wedding band.We called the hotel and asked if they can double check the room for us.Somebody else was already staying in the room so they couldn't do a thorough search but as soon as the guest left,they moved furnitures to search for the ring and they found it! I could tell that the hotel staff worked together to make this happen.

There is a self service laundry on the 3rd floor.Parking is free on a first come, first served basis. There are not enough parking spaces if all the gests have a car. Plus, the spaces are very tight, so if you have anything larger than a Smart car, you will have a tight squeeze.The Wi-Fi is free and worked very well - even on an upper floor. There is a very small pool and a tiny fitness center. I think there were two pieces of equipment. Better to get your exercise walking on the beach, which is a few blocks away.

Had a corner room each time. All staff at reception and service staff really lovely. Both rooms are getting old but very clean, quiet and quite large. We had a king and double bed in our room. Our bed was super comfy and loved my pillow. Loved having a kitchen, has a good sized refrigerator, full stove and microwave, coffee machine. Yes the crockery is a bit of a miss match, but so what, it does the job. Good sized wardrobe and set 6 drawers. Plus a cupboard with shelves so quite a bit of storage for your clothes.. There is a desk in the room. And how good 2 suitcase stands. The laundry ($1.25) was great. Was so nice after a big day out have a swim in the pool, (it isn't a huge pool but more than adequate) then relax on our balcony (lanai) with a cool drink overlooking the canal and golf course.There is a great grocery store about 1 block away, called the Food Pantry. (Kuhio Avenue) They sell everything (we bought a BBQ chicken one night $8.99) and well priced. They also sell alcohol which was handy. A huge department store called Ross Dress for Less (Seaside Street) is just around the corner, wow never seen so many clothes for sale, including many brand named clothes, very good prices, they also sell suitcases and other bits and pieces, This hotel is a couple blocks from the beach but a very easy walk. We were given a lovely shell necklace on departure.

The sun came flooding into our room and lanai in the afternoon and this made bar time extra special. The foyer staff were so friendly and helpful as well. The pool area was small but we spent hours there. With a full kitchen and refrigerator we only dined out once as supplies from the Food Pantry nearby made this easy.

My first thought was ""this is a dump"", but, I was mistaken. Yes, the decor was dated, but, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable, and that was what matters most to me. We had a corner room, and although there was some late night pool noise from the hotel next door, we still left our large balcony doors open to enjoy the fresh air and city noise all night! (I did get up in the early morning to shut the door and turn on the a/c - I never sleep soundly.) Our room also faced the canal and golf course, which, was actually a very decent view. We walked and jogged on the sidewalk beside the canal. We guessed it was approx. 2 miles round trip. The Illima was also a short walking distance to the only two places we dined in Honolulu, Dukes (breakfast buffet) and Hula Grill (mac nut crusted Mahi Mahi, Hula Pie), which I can highly recommended. There were street vendors along the route we took to the restaurants, reminded me of Nassau marketplace. We parked in the provided hotel parking - very tight fit. ",Carthage,36,4.0

Location was perfect - an easy stroll to the main drag. Wifi in the room was excellent, capable of streaming Neflix. Stayed two nights and easily found parking spaces in the hotel's small garage, but that might just have been luck. Very friendly front desk and you get a lei on check-out. That was a nice touch.

We booked a two bedroom which was perfect for our family of five for two weeks. Most hotels in Waikiki won't accept more than 4 in a hotel room so our options are limited. Plus with the kitchen, free parking and internet this was a great deal. The best part of Ilima though is the staff. They are always super-friendly and helpful. Even though it's like a 3 star hotel, they provide 5 star service. It's only a short walk to the best (less crowded) part of Waikiki beach and there are tons of food and shopping options within a short walk. The only suggestion i have is Ilima needs to start refreshing the rooms. The wallpaper in our room (504) had water stains on the wall probably from condensation. Not a big deal and the room was very clean, but it looked unattractive. There's also a pretty rowdy bar right next to Ilima. We never had any problems, but i saw cop cars there several times during our stay. I'd be worried about teenagers walking around there at night alone. That's more of a general Waikiki complaint though and not really specific to Ilima.Overall we were very happy with our stay at Ilima and we'll most likely stay there again when we go back to Waikiki!","Guangzhou, China",34,4.0

The hotel is not on the beach, but it is a short walk to the beach, shopping and eateries. The only reason I gave the hotel a four star is because the decor/furniture are outdated and our shower didn't have a lot of power. The hotel could use a good renovation, but we were not there to stay all day in the room, was there to explore Hawaii and I can't say enough about the staff.

My husband, daughter, and I felt we found a home away from home with the Ilima Hotel. Our room was a simple studio with a kitchenette, not a lot of extras, but it worked for us! Though a breakfast is not offered, this hotel is much less expensive than those that do. The Food Pantry is about a quarter mile away with reasonable prices compared to the ABC stores so this is where we got our breakfast and sometimes dinner supplies. Every time you walk into the lobby, you are greeted with a friendly ""Aloha!"" and a much welcome blast of air conditioning! The staff couldn't be kinder. Every Wednesday, the staff offeres complimentary lei making with kukui nuts for hotel guests from 10-11 a.m.. Our daughter's 13th birthday was on a Wednesday, but we were unavailable to take advantage of it, so I asked the folks at the front desk if they could set aside some supplies for my daughter so she could make one on her own. I was told they'd check and get back to me. When my husband returned from a trip to the post office, the front desk person gave him a small baggie full of everything my daughter needed to make her own lei. Also, two days later, when we were checking out, our daughter was given a shell lei, unlike the ones you get at other attractions at the area.

The trade-off is a large spacious room with a full working kitchen and lanai, free parking, pool (although small), sauna (again small but great to have), good location, good bathroom and terrific staff all at an attractive price. A few months earlier we stayed at the Parc Wakiki (lovely but $$$$) but I have to say overall this was a more enjoyable (and practical) stay. Although a little funkier, I like the area better. It felt more ""local"". The beds were comfortable with very good pillows. The only negative was the major construction going on directly in front of the ocean view side: a new large hotel and a new 4 story market place set to open sometime in 2016. (There is major construction going on all over Wakiki: be warned). If you expect to sit out on your lanai between 9-4pm you will hear a lot of jackhammering and construction noise. We got up early and spent most of the day out. The beach is a short walk away and there are some very good Japanese restaurants nearby. A full-size supermarket is just a few blocks away.

Our family made it fine. We stayed our first and last nights here. We were at Disney's Aulani for 6 nights in between. Although the teens almost died after being at Aulani, we know the value of a dollar and this was a good value. The biggest complaint my teen had was the smell. Maybe the staff could try some other kind of air freshener or cleaner. It did have a little crazy smell. The last night we were given a 14th floor room and could see a sliver of the ocean between the buildings. We had the mountain canal view at the beginning of our stay. I would chose the canal view. Hands down if you aren't real ticky, this is a great value. We are really careful about where we stay, but had no problem staying here for a couple of nights.

By day you wouldn't comment on the view but it was pretty at night with all the surrounding building lit up. I wasn't there to sit on the lanai all day so the view wasn't a factor for me.This hotel is only 2 blocks from the beach and all that the Waikiki strip has to offer but by being those couple of blocks back it was far enough away to be quiet and out of the rat race.The rooms are really large, mine had 2 double beds and a very spacious lounge area, as well as a kitchenette, full size fridge, oven, dining table and occasional furniture, easy roomy enough for longer stays. The furniture was a bit tired and dated but it was clean and in good condition, the beds were perfectly fine, not saggy or in poor condition.

It's worth going to, you get to take home your lei and it's an excellent souvenir.The reception staff were always friendly and attentive and were genuinely there to help, beach mats and towels are complementary. I have stayed in an ocean front room on a previous visit at a different hotel and now here at the Ilima and I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.

It is about 3 blocks from the Ocean, but an easy walk. The rooms are very very dated (think florescent lights, CFLs, old carpet & kitchen counter, paint chipped & falling off ceiling of bathroom, etc.) But then again, you're not paying the exorbitant prices commanded by the Waikiki beach hotels that are 3 times this price. There is a full kitchen for saving $$ on the morning bfast. (Refrig, Stove, toaster, dishes, etc.) The staff are very friendly & welcoming. Free morning Paper & 2 cups of coffee in the room.Complaints? There was only 1 working Elevator & the staff tended to commandeer them daily as they moved supplies (linens, etc) between floors. There were periods of waiting literally 10 mins only to have a full elevator arrive. (They are re-doing the 2nd elevator - so no idea when that one will be functioning.) The adjacent window in our room (809) was a slatted glass window. It LEAKED noise & wind during the night. So was kind of noisy for sleeping. The views are nothing special, really. Ours was a view of the mountain & the canal across the street. the hotel is surrounded on 2 sides by very high hotels (looking down on the balcony). Sort of a fish bowl if you like to hang on the balcony. Speaking of which, the furniture in the room & balcony is very very old, chipped, cracked tables. So again, not paying for ""luxury"" at this place - just a bargain price. (you get what you pay for). Oh, and the ""Free WiFi"" kinda sucked for my cell phone. Only was able to get like 1 bar in our room so it was not usable at all.

I was greeted with genuine smiles and was attended to immediately. The reassuring staff went the extra mile answering my questions and gave us a lot of personal attention. I had originally reserved a room for 3 nights, but asked if they could accommodate us for a longer period of time. I knew it wasn’t going to be easy during the high season, but they found a room for me and it even was a better price!They really did go out of their way to make me feel at home. I attended the “sing-along” on Friday morning. The staff handed out binders of Hawaiian song lyrics so guests could sing along (or just watch and enjoy). The staff sang beautifully and were accompanied by live bass fiddle, guitar and ukulele. It was lovely and fun!I signed up for their free craft class, held on Wednesday mornings. It was just an hour, and we all made lei’s from kakui nuts and shells. You have your choice of many different colored kakui nuts. I highly recommend it.Every room, other than the penthouse units, are the same. They are quite spacious (approx. 1000 sf (93 m2) including the bathroom area). Each room has a balcony and some kind of view. Our view faced the ocean, but was mostly blocked by taller hotels. There was a major building construction project going on (and will continue until about March 2016) and we actually enjoyed watching them work. We made a time-lapse movie of the trucks, dozers and cranes at work all day long. On Friday nights, Waikiki puts on a fireworks show. We could see it from our lanai. There are also viewing decks on the 10th and Penthouse levels. There is a small, outdoor, heated pool, sauna, coin-operated washers and dryers and other amenities. Every room has a kitchenette. My rooms (1604 and 907) had very basic kitchen equipment and no dishwasher. There are pots and pans, dishes, glasses, silverware, a tiny coffee maker and toaster. The hotel does not stock plastic wrap, foil, paper towels, coffee filters, salt, pepper, sugar or anything else consumable. If you like making your own coffee, buy it ground. If you think you might want to use a measuring cup, measuring spoons, a vegetable peeler, grater, or a baking pan, you will have to provide them yourself.Our rooms were perfectly clean. Bed linens were high quality and seemed new. Towels were extremely plush. The hotel provides beach towels and beach mats (tatami) to guests as well.The WIFI was very good. We were able to stream videos without a hiccup. The room was equipped with a large flat screen TV that had HDMI cables (we used it as a computer monitor).If you like a room that gets warm, ask for one that faces south. If it gets hot from the sunshine pouring in your room, you can open the large sliding doors or run the air conditioning.The downside is the loud city noise. This is not the hotel’s fault; in fact, every hotel in the city is surrounded by the same noise, 24/7. This is Honolulu, after all. It was a bit louder on the ninth floor than it was on the sixteenth floor. We closed the doors and ran the air conditioner which greatly reduced the noise. This was the only way we could sleep.This hotel is in a great location, only 2 ½ blocks from Waikiki Beach, 2 blocks from Food Pantry for groceries, and 1 or 2 blocks from bus-stops that take you all over the island for far less money than the tours charge. Consider ditching the car rental and exploring the area via TheBus.If you do drive a car here, you’ll be pleased to know that the hotel has a free parking garage for guests, which most hotels do not have.We saw no insects in the hotel the entire 2 weeks we were there.I recommend this hotel for visitors who don't mind somewhat dated decor and reasonable prices.

We needed a minimum of two bedrooms and preferably three and would not consider a place that listed the living room with sofa bed as one of the bedrooms. We began our search in early July and already the options were few and far between. Hawaii has been having a problem with short term lets and has been trying to clamp down on the casual rental business, without a lot of success. Minimum rental periods of one month were the most legitimate on offer and there was only a limited supply of these. Reports of scams where people paid deposits on properties that were never on the market in the first place were not encouraging. The Ilima Hotel has penthouse apartments and we started to look at this option seriously. Penthouse A (PHA) and Penthouse B could be linked to provide two plus one bedrooms, with a separate living and dining room and full kitchen. There would be sufficient beds to sleep eight. more if you used the living room. There was one full sized bathroom in each section as well as one washing machine and free standing dryer. Each apartment had its own WiFi router with free access. A big plus was free on-site parking although it was on a daily first-come first-served basis. Also a weekday newspaper was delivered each morning. It was a pity that they charge $3 a day for the use of the room safe, it seemed a mean-spirited charge when WIFI was free. We locked passports inside one of our bags. The Ilima Hotel is not one of the big names on the Waikiki scene and the property has been around for a good while. It is a sixteen story block and the Penthouses are on floor seventeen. Level thirteen seemed to have got lost. It is located only two blocks behind the main Waikiki street, Kalakaua Avenue, that could be reached in an easy five minute walk. Even closer was Kuhio Avenue with bus stops for The Bus, the efficient Hawaii transit system, and other shuttle transport. The apartments face the ocean that could be glimpsed between various tall buildings. Directly in front was a massive construction site where the International Market once stood. All the work going on there was still at ground level but if a tall building is to go up it will limit the views more. Construction noise was heard on and off, as was early morning garbage collection. The linked apartments turned out to be a great find. For four people it was spacious and supremely comfortable and would have been so for six. PHB could be easily isolated temporarily in the evening and would be ideal for up to four children if they could all sleep in two very large beds while their parents could have a double room each as well as a generous living room. The kitchen had a large refrigerator, full sized stove, microwave oven and a waste disposal unit. The cutlery, crockery, glassware and kitchen utensils were rather sparsely supplied. Four guests stretched what was available and we made do by buying paper plates to eke out the mismatched crockery and drank our wine from tumblers. Some matched crockery and well chosen glassware would be classy and work wonders.Each of the rooms was individually air conditioned. The units were silent and efficient. December is the Hawaiian winter so we needed air conditioning only infrequently, mostly in the late afternoon when there was full sun on the balcony windows. There was a small balcony with furnishings outside each room and it was a pleasant location to take drinks in the late afternoon or evening. The penthouse level also had a large terrace carpeted with green astroturf and furnished with sun loungers. There was a good supermarket five minutes away and a huge Safeway a few stops away on The Bus from our corner. The Penthouses are let as Hotel rooms, with daily service including Christmas Day. They were generous with towels, clearing garbage, and frequent linen changes.All sixteen floors are serviced by two lifts and except in the early morning around check-out time there were never delays. Guests joining and leaving the lifts included lots of families sometimes with a surf board or other beach gear. Our experience was good. The hotel is quiet except for some modest external noise and it is well run with friendly helpful staff. Its location could not be better.",London,152,4.0

It was spacious! From the livingroom you had to strain to hear my infant son crying in the master bedroom, so his crying and my husband's snoring didn't bother the other couples in our suite. The in suite washer and dryer are tiny (fits two pairs of jeans and four t-shirts in a load), but don't require coins. Both of our washrooms had very deep jetted tubs. The only downside is that my preschooler had to be lifted high to get in and out, I can imagine that someone shorter than my 5.5 feet or not so nimble might find it difficult but there are hand holds on the shower walls.The top floor hallway (and maybe all floors, I don't know) is open to the outdoors with wide spaced metal bars to keep you in. The same wide spaced bars were on each lanai. My child stuck her head between the bars to have a better look and that was the end of our using the lanai as none of us wanted her to plummet to her death. We kept the doors locked and told her the lanai were haunted and it was never an issue with her going out there.The kukui nut lei making class was better than expected and was fun for all of us. We left with gorgeous leis made with glossy painted kukui nuts and coloured shells.Decorating the lobby are obscenely ridiculous paintings of nearly nude men and women in quasi erotic poses which made us giggle every time we came and left the hotel. It made the hotel memorable!The outdoor pool is small and doesn't appear to see much use, but why would it? The beach is a short walk away. The gym hardly deserves to be called a gym as it is really just a low ceilinged converted storage closet with two beat up old exercise machines inside. Some of that might sound awful, but it really wasn't. I liked the older decor in my room, I felt like I was staying at an auntie's beach house instead of a hotel. The hotel staff were kind and responsive to our needs. The check in and check out processes were simple and fast. The maintenance and housekeeping staff were thorough and friendly. The parking was free and the lot wasn't as frighteningly tight as I had anticipated and we parked our Dodge Caravan without trouble every night.We will be returning to the Ilima for our next Hawaiian vacation and telling anyone who will listen about how great our stay was.

When I stayed at this hotel for a week in October, they charged no resort fee. They have a garage with a certain amount of free onsite parking (but be aware that only the smallest of cars will fit comfortably in this garage). The resort fees and parking fees charged by other hotels in Waikiki can easily add up to $40 or $50 per day, plus I saved even more by renting an ""economy"" model car, which fit easily in the garage. The staff was friendly and pleasant, and our room was very large and clean, and had everything we needed. It was not luxurious, and was decorated in ""80's"" style and colors. It was a 12th floor, ocean view room, but we had to keep the blackout curtains of our room drawn during the day so the air conditioner would have a chance to overcome the sun's glare and heat.

I know this is going to be a long review, but please take the time to read it as I have nothing but praise for the hotel and staff. We stayed there for 2 weeks and had a great time. The hotel was just lovely, clean and very comfortable. Our room was so spacious and having kitchen facilities helped with the occasional breakfast/ dinner. We booked our room directly through the hotel website, and as such, the price was more competitive. In doing so, I was able to be in contact with the booking staff and specified that we would like a room on the 16th floor - with canal/mountain views. The lady was so accommodating and answered every question that I had, and this was months before our actual trip. When we arrived, our room was so spacious, clean, comfortable. Staff were so friendly, everyone of them from reception to housekeeping - we were always greeted cheerfully and everyone was willing to stop and have a word. Any question regarding transport, getting around, shopping etc was answered patiently and we were provided with maps, directions etc. Our first day at the hotel, we couldn't get the microwave to start and contacted reception early in the morning. Within minutes someone was sent up to have a look and fix it. At the time, our fridge started making a loud noise - they replaced the fridge!!! The service we got was just sensational. They have free lei making classes every Wednesday which i would highly recommend. The hotel staff also have a choir that sings every Friday; this was really special and again, if you stay at the Ilima, you must watch them. There have been a few negative reviews on the hotel, but when we were there, none of them seemed valid. Yes, there is a pub a few doors down from the hotel, and you might be a bit wary about walking past it at night, but you can easily get around this issue by coming to the hotel from the Ala Wai end of Nohonani street rather than the Kuhio end. That is what we did, we walked up one of the other streets eg. Seaside avenue. There have also been negative comments re the room decor, colour. Again, these just did not appear valid to us. The views from the room were just spectacular and we spent every morning having breakfast on the 'lanai', looking out on to the canal and mountains.A few tips: eating out in waikiki can be expensive till we discovered restaurants on Kapahulu street. It is a bit of a walk from the Ilima (30mins), but so worth it. To name a few, uncle Bo's pupu bar and grill, the blue water shrimp and seafood truck - we had amazing food there. It is just a blue truck (opposite Lennard's bakery). They have just 5 items that you can order, but the shrimps were delicious and food was so cheap. Another must is the Malasadas from Lennard's Bakery. I've never tasted doughnuts like that before. Another place is Side Street Inn. Just walk down Kapahulu and you will find lots of lovely places to eat. And don't forget to eat at Marukame Udon - a Japanese restaurant just round the corner from Ilima. The long queues will give it away. Get there early - around 5.15pm. Having said that, the queue moves very quickly.And finally, there is free entertainment almost every evening from 6-7pm at the Royal Hawaiian Grove at the Royal Hawaiian Centre. The Friday evening performance is especially good and you can buy the CD after the show for $15. Get there early to get a good seating spot if you would like to record the performance. Don't forget to attend the Rock a Hula show and Fourever Fab. These are paid performances, but well worth it.A big thank you to all the staff at Ilima - we had a wonderful holiday !",,17,5.0

So I can/will equally give 5 stars to a ""budget"" hotel as I would a fancy resort. OK onto the review.Disclosure: our friend is good friends with the GM so we got a ""friends and family"" rate, much less advertised than any website etc. during their 2nd busiest month of the year. While that made our vacation an even greater value, I don't think it affected service, meaning, I believe they treat EVERYONE as VIP (although, I'd like to think we're special lol ;)Location 4.5 stars: approx 3 blocks/10 min walk to Waikiki beach (if it was beachfront, it'd get 5 stars, but guess what? You'll pay much more!). For us it was a practical location: 2 blocks from Food Pantry, within walking distance of all shops/restaurants and across the sreet the little ""alley swap meet"" where I got a whole bunch of souveniers at a fraction of the cost of ABC stores/Walmart etc. Also across the street is a store (can't remember the name) that sells shirts 8 for $19.99.Since we didn't have a rental car, the location was great for us b/c we walked everywhere and all places conveniently located.Hotel/Service 5 stars: It is an older hotel, as you can see from their website/other reviewers, but it was comfortable, very clean and kept up nicely. Our room was a superior King (see their website for pics) which included a King & double beds and a full kitchenette (full sized fridge, stovetop and microwave) complete w/ dining table. This kitchenette was for us, an important feature for our 1 week stay. We wanted a good value to save money (I'd rather spend less on a hotel/food and use the savings for healthier eating, shopping/excursions etc.). It was very clean, no bugs or anything like that. Also comes with utensils, cooking utensils, plates/cups etc.). We saved $$$ by stocking our fridge.The AC is a wall unit and it kept our entire studio room nice and cool. 2 big closets/plenty of hangers, shelves, etc.Bathroom: has a bathtub, it's clean, basic. Comes with toiletries (shampoo, soap, face wipes, shower caps). Comfortable temperature even though no AC in bathroom.We requested the highest floor possible (got 15th floor) that was quiet and facing canal (see pic of view of balcony, very nice). You can hear sirens of driving by but other than that, very quiet.Beds: firm mattress (which I like), comfy and clean :)Service: BEST housekeeping, we just called when ready to leave to request the time we wanted our room refreshed. They always provided extra towels and toiletries per our request. Sometimes if I needed something in the evening, they'd send someone up right away (unlike other hotels where their housekeeping takes forever, or sometimes don't even show up). Made me feel like we were the only guests they were catering to :)Front desk, we got to know some workers more than others but all were extremely friendly. We just loved Nicole, who on our last morning said she wanted to invite us to her place for breakfast (but we had to go to airport). I let her know we'd host her when she visits So Cal :) She felt like family.Courtni reservations: Awesome in booking our room and providing all of our requests for quiet, highest floor, non smoking etc. Super friendly (in fact, just spoke w/ her this week to book our next visit there...which reminded me that I needed to post my review :)General Manager: Phil Sammer, GREAT GM, you can tell he does a great job in how his employees treat guests. They seem more like a family/team, than ""workers"". Very impressive. Again, he knew we were friends of his friend, but based on other reviews, I think this is how they treat everyone. I love the friendliness and service at Ilima.For value minded travellers who aren't in the hotel much, and do not mind that it's not ""on the beach"", it is a great way to have an affordable trip in the heart of Waikiki. This hotel had EVERYTHING we specifically wanted/needed in our hotel room. We didn't experience any problems whatsoever during our 8 day stay. Other amenities/perks: - Free lei making class (which I need to partake in next time :)- Free parking (we didn't use b/c no rental car)- Partner w/ Ilima Shuttle (800-713-0146) we got airport shuttle for $11 per person HNL to hotel and $10 per person hotel to HNL airport. You can probably get it a few bucks cheaper elsewhere, but this was a recommended company from the hotel so we used them for reliability. They were great/on time etc.- Coin operated laundry (didn't use)- Litlte fitness center (didn't use)- Beach mats at front desk- Free WI-FI in the roomsOverall, a great value, EXCELLENT service and for us, we couldn't ask for more. Having said that, there's no such thing as perfect and what would make them even better (based on other reviewers comments too), few tiny little things:- Fresh coat of paint to ""modernize"" the rooms. I think this would make a big difference to reviewers commenting on the rooms being ""dated""- Eliminate the daily safe fee. It's an item already in the room that bears the hotel no cost in allowing guest usage so I think people who don't like to feel ""nickel & dimed"" would give them higher ratings if this $2.75/day were removed. This was mentioned alot by other reviewers. For us, we avoided the charge by simply bringing a lock for our luggage to lock up our iPad & passports.- Provide free coffee packs in rooms like all hotels do (for us, we didn't care b/c we aren't coffee drinkers but I saw alot of comments on this one too)- Allow free printing of boarding passes (most hotels do this)Whether an overnight stay or an extended vacation, the Ilima hotel will suit your needs. We can't wait to go back in 6 months. They are awesome and I'll be bringing them goodies from So Cal :)Aloha & Mahalo :)",Southern California,364,5.0

The staff is very friendly and helpful. Check in/out was easy and quick. All the times I've stayed here, it was quiet. The hotel has studios, 1-3 bedrooms and a penthouse I think comes with four bedrooms, but not sure, check the website. I stayed in a deluxe studio that had both a king and double size beds. The room is very comfortable and clean. There is a nice size refrigerator with freezer top. Also has a stove and there is cooking and eating utensils in the room, so you can save some money and make your own food instead of eating out that could be pricey. If you like seeing the ocean from your balcony, then this is not the place for you. The only views it offers is a mountain or Waikiki city (basically surrounding buildings) views, depending on which side of the building you stay in ( the best is the mauka or mountain view), but that's why a room is just to relax and refresh yourself, not to view Hawaii from inside. Keep in mind, if you want a room with a ocean view, its more expensive. There is a sundeck on the 10th floor and if you go there on a Friday night, you can see the Hilton Hawaiian Village fireworks show (check with the hotel staff for start time). Overall, this hotel is great if you want good value, quiet atmosphere, great staff, FREE wi-fi, no resort fees and if you don't mind the view.",waipahu,1,4.0

We never passed in or our without receiving a cheery smile and an ‘Aloha’. They are a credit to the hotel.We stayed for a week in June, and booked a Deluxe Studio room at just $130 a night, which is excellent value for Waikiki. They offer standard, superior and deluxe studio rooms (as well as one and two bedroom suites) and I think that there is no real difference in room size between any of the studios – I think the additional cost is simply dependent on how high you are in the hotel, and hence which view you get.We chose the Deluxe Studio and specifically requested a high floor with a view of the mountains. The other side of the hotel would pretty much only look over other (taller) buildings. We got floor 16 (out of 17), and had a wonderful view over the canal, the golf course, and the mountains in the distance from our own private balcony (with a table and two chairs).As we knew in advance, the hotel is an older property, and a little rough round the edges here and there if you are being particularly picky. However, we thought it was superb for value, amenities and location.Our studio was a large room with two separate beds – one huge king size and one queen. It also had an arm chair, various lamps, a chest of drawers, a desk and chair, separate dining table with two more chairs, and a kitchen area with oven, coffee maker, toaster, sink, microwave and large fridge/freezer. There were sufficient utensils, plates, cutlery, etc, for four people. The furniture was generally made of wood, wicker or bamboo.The beds were really comfortable – sheets (rather than duvets), under the cover, but blankets and extra pillows were available if needed. There was plenty of storage space around the room in various cupboards, including a large wardrobe which included a safe (strangely charged at $2.75 per day, so we didn’t bother using it) and an ironing board and iron.The bathroom was basic, but nice and clean, and offered a few toiletries such as soap and shampoo and a modest selection of towels and a hair dryer. It only had one shelf, which was just about big enough for our range of toiletries.The location is excellent, being just less than two blocks away from the main Kalakaua Avenue, where all the shops, restaurants, fancy hotels and beach front is found. It really was just a five to ten minute walk to everywhere. Beach towels and mats were freely available at reception if you were headed out to the beaches.The room was sometimes a bit noisy during the night. We could hear occasional water noises (tap or fridge) plus wind blowing and traffic outside, even though we were 16 floors up. But this wasn’t excessive, and didn’t keep us awake or otherwise bother us.We had a hire car, so parking was important to us. We were aware that the hotel offered limited free parking, which is an amazing benefit for Waikiki, and it turned out that at least half a dozen spaces were free every time we came back to the hotel. Some of the parking spaces were tight, but we never had to worry about finding somewhere else to park the whole week.Twice during the week we picked up a Korean take-away from the nearby Me BBQ and ate it back at the hotel. This is where the plates, cups, cutlery, etc, all proved such a benefit. We ate breakfast in the room (or out on our balcony) each morning, too, saving the expense of eating out.The hotel offered a guest laundry. Washers and dryers were just $2 each, and soap powder available for just $1 at reception.In all, we had an excellent stay at the Ilima. Yes, there are loads of bigger, posher and vastly more expensive hotels in Waikiki. Some even have direct views of the ocean. But all these come at a price. We look for value for money, but still expect high standards from our hotel choices. This is the second time my OH has stayed here; the first time for me. But if we ever come back to Oahu, the Ilima will once again be the first (and possibly only) place we look to stay.","Redditch, United Kingdom",292,5.0

After our long flight, our bitter disappointment, and our desperate search in a McDonald's parking lot on our phones, we were able to find the last two rooms in the Ilima Hotel in Waikiki (www.ilima.com, 808.923.1877). The Ilima was very nice, the staff was warm and welcoming, and they had free internet and parking. We found the Ilima on Booking.com, but were so gun shy by this point to pay upfront, that I called the hotel and they gave us directions, told us to come on in, and they took us up to see the rooms, before they even asked us to pay!

Staff was always pleasant and very helpful whenever we had any questions. At first glance the room seemed outdated with pink carpeting but aside from that, our room was very clean and very spacious. It was also great having a kitchen so we could cook our own meals when we felt like it. There is a grocery store (Food Pantry) steps away and lots of restaurants close by. We got a room facing Waikiki beach side although we couldn't see the beach. It overlooked the construction site of the new shops although we never heard much of construction noise since we were out most of the day. One of the highlights of this hotel is the free parking. You can't get that anywhere around here so this was a big plus since we rented a van for two weeks. The bus transportation is also very convenient just down the street and takes you everywhere. We probably wouldn't rent a car next time. The free wifi was fabulous since our family of four was always hooked up to some sort of tech device when we returned to the hotel. Another highlight of our stay here was that they offered free lei making classes every Wednesday. It was a wonderful experience that was enjoyed by everyone including teenagers and we left with a pretty souvenir that we made ourselves. I must add that if you stay here you must visit the Japanese restaurant close by (Marukame Udon). You can't miss it. There is always a line up and no wonder, the food was excellent and cheap. Waikiki beach is about a 10 min walk away so it was fabulous for the kids and they thoroughly enjoyed taking surf lessons on the beach. The hotel supplied towels and beach mats which was bonus! Another highlight was that we got to watch the filming of Hawaii Five-O right on Waikiki beach. We even got to take some pics with the actors when they were on break. I definitely recommend this hotel and would return again. Thank you for making our stay such a pleasant one.","Toronto, Ontario, Canada",6,4.0

The downside was only 1 tv for a family of 5, but the upside was free wi-fi!! The room was clean, and every one of the staff we encountered was very friendly and helpful.

We didn't take advantage of the pool, fitness or rooftop sunning area since we wanted to be at the beach but it was nice to have the option to sunbathe or take a quick dip on the premises.There were two pricing items that sealed the deal. The first was the free parking although not guaranteed which can average $25/day at other hotels. We did easily find convenient free street parking when we returned after 10pm one night then we moved the car before 7 AM the next morning back to the hotel. The second was no resort fee (avg $20/day). The kitchen was adequately equipped with a dated stove and microwave for cooking quick meals for budget-minded families. Newspapers, beach towels & straw mats were available for free at the front desk daily. We had a wonderful unobstructed view of the lush mountains due to neighboring low-rise buildings. I would definitely recommend & return to this hotel in the future.Extra perk was the location to the extremely popular Marukame Udon restaurant at the end of the block on Kuhio for breakfast from 7-9AM with NO LINE compared to their lunch & dinner crowd!

It was a package deal with the trip I purchased via a travel agency. I expected more from the various reviews I had seen. However, once in Waikiki I had already paid for the package and simply stayed at the hotel. While the room is spacious, I did not feel comfortable with being in the room at all. The floor was dirty and I found myself wearing socks whenever in the room. I was also glad that I had brought my own pillowcase as the ones that were provided were a bit dingy as well as the sheets. The bed was rock hard and in the morning I found that the kitchen had small ants present. I called the front desk and they said they would take care of the ants while I was out. When I got back I did not see ants but saw them again the very next morning. The location was close to the canal and restaurants however, beware at night as there is a bar down the street where shady people just hang. I did not feel safe coming back to the hotel.

The hotel rooms are spacious and truly a home away from home with an en suite kitchenette (dishes, pots, utensils, sink, stove/oven, fridge/freezer, dish soap), coin laundry, and free parking. We rented a car to get around Oahu easily so the free parking for hotel guests was a big selling feature.The room decor is retro (circa 1980's?), but the rooms are in pretty good shape and overall clean. We had one issue with the cleanliness of the sheets when we first checked in, but upon notifying the front desk there was a staff member within minutes in our room replacing our linens and double checking the room. I loved how close the hotel was to the beach and some of the more expensive hotels in Waikiki. We were able to enjoy the nightlife and shopping of Waikiki without spending an arm and a leg for one of the beachfront hotels. About 2 blocks from the Ilima is a small grocery store and about a 10 minute drive away is a Safeway grocery store.Overall I would recommend the Ilima to anyone looking to stay in the Waikiki area for a budget price.","Toronto, Canada",35,3.0

The only minor problem was the beach towels (that you had to get from the front desk) were actually just regular bath towels (white and not much. if any larger than the bath towels in our room). The pool is also a bit small and there is no hot tub (but I think there was a sauna and a 2 machine work out room, although we did not use these).  This hotel is about two blocks from Waikiki Beach.

I was acting as ‘tourist agent’ for our party of four and we needed at least a two bedroom apartment.

I was able to specify one bedroom having a double bed and the other bedroom having two singles.No matter where you are on Waikiki Beach it is quite a long trip from the airport. We arrived late one evening and took our chances with one of the many spruikers offering transport to Waikiki Beach. On arrival the hotel staff were very friendly and efficiently saw us into our apartment. The apartment was on the 7th floor facing the front of the building. It had a large lounge area, functional kitchen, the two bedrooms, bathroom and lanai (balcony). The apartment was serviced every day. While the furnishings were dated they fulfilled their purpose. Internet access was provided (we arrived on the day it became wireless accessible). There were 3 older style air conditioners.The main problem with this particular apartment was in the main bedroom. For the first few days I couldn’t work out why the air conditioner just couldn’t get the room down to a comfortable temperature. The ones in the living area and the second bedroom performed well. On close inspection I discovered that the louvre windows above the air conditioner were not closing properly no matter how much force was put into the handle that controlled them. As a consequence the hot air from the rear of the air conditioner was funnelling up through the louvres back into the room! While I could have notified staff about the problem I didn’t want workmen in our room, particularly if we were away (as we were most of the time).The Ilima Hotel has some interesting organised events that occur in the lobby. My wife took part in a couple of them. One was a lei making lesson where she created some beautiful leis. The second was a performance by a choir.Waikiki Beach is only about a 10 min walk and there are tons of shops around where you can get supplies. There is no restaurant on site. There is a small pool out the back.On our last day there we happened across the tour desk that has been manned by Alan for many many years. He is 88 years old.

The toilet was a good flusher which can make or break a hotel stay for me.Location was close to shopping and is you have rented a car you can enter and exit Waikiki from the back side instead of fighting all the traffic on the main road.If you are interested in a good, solid , functional hotel for a fair price - leaving you more money to spend on daily activities, then The Ilima is a great choice .","Kailua, Hawaii",9,4.0

Another block or 2 to the beach, so definitely convenient without paying astronomical beach-side prices. Bathroom looked recently updated & was clean. Room wasn't anything special but was spacious and clean and having kitchen was a plus for doing your own breakfast and reheating left-overs from a restaurant, etc. AC worked adequately, and this room also caught trade winds well. We didn't have any trouble getting a parking place in their garage but might have had we taken it out at night (both times we parked we were in place by late aft.). All the desk clerks were very friendly & helpful; they have menus for local restaurants & a map of the local area which were both appreciated by us.

The area was very safe, extremely close to everything, quiet....well, what else can I say? Loved it! Was it luxurious? Not exactly. The paint job and the wallpaper could potentially bother you if you are picky about that kind of thing as it showed it's age a bit and the kitchenette was dated but who cares? The full sized fridge and the conveniences of home triumphed over any minor asthetic shortfall. Everything felt clean, including the carpets.

He was wearing a tweed jacket and it looked adorable. I loved it. It was like being transported to 1960s. Our 3 days there and nights there went without a hitch.

Rooms were very large, it had a kitchen area, a nice table for sitting, bamboo furniture (which I thought was very cool), and a nice balcony.

I stayed at Ilima Hotel with my family from May 24-June 1, 2013. We arrived to the hotel with a full parking lot. Apparently, the parking is full due to locals taking advantage of the free and limited parking spaces. Anyway, after circling around forever, we checked into our rooms. We booked a 2 bedrooms with a kitchenette. This was ok for a family of 5. The room was a bit smelly; but it was livable. The couch that turns into a bed was a bit revolting. The mattress had black spots, which possibly could be molds. The air conditioner in the living room had some molds growing out of it too. My parents room near the balcony had duct tape as a way to keep the cool air in. As for bed that I slept in, the bed pulls down from the wall unit. I noticed on my bed sheet- there was a yellow beige spot on the right side during the last night. It was the size of a golf ball. This definitely shows the quality of housekeeping service. Overall, the service of cleanliness is very questionable. Each day we would go out to enjoy our activities. One day we noticed that our towels in the bathroom were not cleared out. I had to contact the front desk to ask for the housekeeping to come. This happened 2 times. The housekeepers came one day around 3 pm. The reason why I remember the time is because I called to ask when they will be arriving to clean our room and give us fresh and clean towels.On the last day,late in the evening, I started packing and found that my jewelry was stolen including my white gold ring with diamonds!I went downstairs to report the incident and then called the police. The front desk lady debated for a while to call the police. She asked her colleague for help on this situation.The front desk lady told me to speak with the morning front desk lady. Finally, I had her call the police and they came at 1245 am. I reported the case to the police. I informed them that the jewelry where it was stored. The police was given of the time frame when the housekeeper could come into the room. After the report, the next day, the rude front desk- Eme would not help out on the situation. She knew more information about the jewelry than me. She informed me to contact Jay ( assistant manager). All the staff were dodging questions. The housekeeping supervisors would not handle the situation-- Davina and Nana ( supervisors of Housekeeping) would not give me the housekeeper's name and stated that it was written policies . I asked to see written policies , and Eme would not give it to me. Obviously, they are protecting the thief.I found out that the night front desk lady spoke with the specific housekeeper. Apparently, the housekeeper knew what it looked like. This was the same housekeeper that has been cleaning our room for the week. Jay ( Assistant manager) returned my phone call in a couple of days. He states he interrogated the housekeeper... I am not sure why he will not let me speak with the Head manager,Please be advised-- Ilima is located in sketchy area and the housekeeping staff are thieves!! Ilima hires thieves!",Austin,14,1.0

It is not on the beach but is only a 10 minute walk. The walk takes you through the very interesting Duke's Lane which is basically part of the International Market. Transit stops are a five minute walk, and it will take about 25 minutes to walk to Kapiolani Park with its zoo and aquarium.The hotel itself is not new, in fact it is over 40 years old and like many hotels of that era has very large rooms. We always have stayed in a studio but one-bedroom and two-bedroom units and penthouse suites are also available.All units include full kitchen facilities with the only thing missing being a dishwasher. The studios have two Queen size beds, a 32-inch HDTV connected to a satellite service and, dining table and chairs, dish and cutlery service for four, good storage room and a pay safe.Nothing can be said about the front desk staff except that they have to be among the most friendly and anxious to please people in the hotel industry anywhere. Maid service is of a normal level and maintenance are quick to respond to requests for service. The hotel also has limited free parking, a rarity in Waikiki. Free WiFi was being installed while we were there.There is a down side. If you want a hotel with a full service business center, a large pool and great gym facilities this is not the hotel for you. Additionally, this year we found that the south-facing rooms were quite noisy on Friday and Saturday nights because of the presence next door of a hotel favored by the younger crowd and a bar just up the street. These had not been a problem in previous years. There is no restaurant on site.The bottom line is: Would we go back to the Ilima? The answer is a very strong yes.",Gloucester,21,5.0

Yes, this is an older hotel, but it's very clean, has a lovely staff, and free limited parking. It's limited because there are only about half the number of spaces as there are rooms. If the lot is full, you can park across the street for about $20. We never had to do that though even when we came back late but May isn't considered high season so during high season, you might have to either get back a little earlier before the garage fills up, or pay. With parking costing anywhere from about $20 to $35 at all other hotels, this is a great plus for the Ilima, even if you have to pay somewhere else a couple of times. Also it's located right off the Ali Canal which has free street parking and you might luck out finding a spot there. Just remember to move your car in the morning as there are I thing about 3 hours that you can't park for street cleaning, so see the signs. Basically, all the rooms are the same except the higher up you go, rates and bed sizes are different Before staying there our first time, we read a review or two about roaches. In both of our stays, we never saw this. In fact, having worked as a telephone repairman for 40 years and entered thousands of homes and apartments, I'm able to tell if there are any telltale signs of insect problems and I say disregard any old reviews stating that. LOL, in May of 2011, we stayed at the Ilikai and guess what we saw? Not an infestation, but a couple here and there. The rooms are kept very clean but the furniture is somewhat dated, but plenty of space for your clothes. Beds are comfy and we were so impressed with their pillows, we looked at the tags and ordered some for home, which we just got today. There's free wired or WIFI in every room and this year a large flat screen HDTV (can't remember if we had that last year). There are either two double beds or a double and a king. There's a kitchenette with a full size fridge, stove with oven, micro, pots, pans, dishes and utensils so if you want to cook in, you have everything you need, along with a dining table and chairs. A desk for your laptop with a slot to plug in your Ethernet cord. Bathrooms are nice and they supply soap, tissues, shampoo, etc. Balconies are big with two chairs and a small table. This is one of just a few hotels in Honolulu that has smoking rooms which are isolated to just two floors, so if you're a smoker, another plus. If you're not, you won't smell it anywhere else per my wife who doesn't smoke. The pool is very small but on both trips when we used it, it felt like it was our private pool cause it's not used much. Location? Perfect! Less than a block from the International Shopping Center, two blocks from Waikiki beach, easy to get to all highways. Plenty of the most popular restaurants within 2 blocks. Grocery store less than 3 blocks (Food Pantry). What else can I say? This is a little gem that doesn't get the ratings it really deserves, but if you want a nice affordable hotel to stay in, you'll be wasting money going elsewhere (unless you have a bundle and want to stay right on the beach).

Bathroom had a combined bath and shower, cable TV, balcony, although the 2 beds in the room were only doubles. The pool is a touch small although is ok if your family is the only one in it, although the hotel does provide pool towels.One major positive is free car parking (requires a ticket for your car at reception) - while some of the spots were pretty tight, it is worth noting the motel next door charged car parking at $25 per night. Wifi also had a decent strength in the room.You are about a 5 minute walk from Waikiki beach. Reception staff were very friendly and very helpful when I needed to amend my booking. The cleaners also did a good job. There is a coin laundry on level 3 at $1.50 per wash and a small gym next to the pool with an exercise bike and running machine where you need the key from reception.At the budget end I was also considering the Royal Grove and after walking past it, I was glad I chose Ilima.If you want to save money, I also found the A8 Airport Shuttle good at $30 (toll free 1800 387 1831) for up to 4 people, and Enterprise at 1221 Kapiolani Blvd (30 minute walk) had $9.99 per day weekend special picking up the car on Friday and returning on Monday - although it appears this has now gone up to $19.99 per day. By comparison, the Enterprise across the road from Ilima at 445 Seaside charges $62.99 per day for the same compact car.

After staying at this hotel for 10 days I now wonder how many of these reviews are actually legitimately written by guests!? I was prepared for a budget hotel but this was far below what we were expecting. Lets start with the good:-Great staff (front desk and housekeeping). Friendly, efficient and helpful and willing to find answers for your questions if they didn't know.-Kitchenette is handy for preparing the occasional meal at the hotel (although in the end we only used it for several breakfasts and one dinner as we found going out to eat to be moderately comparable to the price of grocery store dinners - food is expensive in general)-Large room but mostly wasted space. The room could easily have accommodated a sofabed or similar.-Centrally located in Waikiki close to the international marketplace, buses, restaurants and Waikiki beach-Free parking (it is a bonus even if it is first come first serve and very tiny spaces)The bad:- We were charged the FULL amount of our stay upon check in. I have worked in the Hotel industry for ten years and have traveled the world and never have I had to pay upfront in a reputable hotel when they have a credit card on file!!! - The 4 cup coffee maker included in the room did not come with a pouch of coffee; front desk staff informed us that they charged $1 per hotel sample sized pouch of coffee. *Also took 1/2 hour for the 4 cup coffee maker to brew the little pot (kinda like watching paint dry).-We were charged $2.75 a day for use of the in room safe; however, nowhere is it posted that there is a charge for use of safe. Management has housekeeping check to see if the safe is being used daily; I find this practice EXTREMELY creepy and treading on a violation of my privacy whereas I am keeping my personal belongings in the closet as well.-Advertised wifi in the rooms before it was actually available. Will actually be available in the next 2 weeks.-Beds were uncomfortable, HARD as a rock and had very flat pillows. - Located in a sketchy part of the street. The bar in the building 2 doors down attracts some very seedy characters. I felt uncomfortable walking alone at night on this section of street, and was uncomfortable about the security of the parking lot at night. But if you are looking to purchase a date for the evening, we saw a few ladies of the night working it.The ugly:-Carpet stained- Stained up quilt-Corningware dishes from 1970's?- Ugly and outdated rattan furnishings.- Musty smell in room (yes I'm aware this comes with tropical destinations but a little fabreeze would do wonders)- ""sun deck"" on 10th floor is a rooftop with artificial turf that has guest rooms facing onto it. A less than appealing place to hang out.- small heated outdoor salt water pool is in the shade most of the day.I regret not cancelling the reservation as there were comparable deals for only $20-$30 more per night at beachfront much more reputable hotels on both travelzoo and bookit.com.

Yes...the hotel rooms need updating. But...if they did the updates, the prices would be unaffordable for most of us. As they are now, they are extremely clean and each day, the maids leave shampoo, soap, face cleaner and other goodies...amenities you would expect in a five star hotel. We had a one bedroom suite which came with a full kitchen, breakfast bar, two 32-inch flat screen HDTV's (in living room and bedroom), a stereo, two telephones and all the amenities we needed for our 10-day stay. The hotel itself is positioned right in the thick of it in Waikiki...just a couple of blocks from the beach and the room was just $198 per night with FREE PARKING...which is unheard of in a hotel in Waikiki!So when you're judging the worn places on the sofa and chairs, you just have to keep in mind that if you were looking at brand new furniture, you'd be paying over $350 per night. We flew first class in to Honolulu on Hawaiian Air....and the dated furniture didn't bother us in the least. Actually, we thought the room was quite charming....rattan and floral patterns suited us just fine. The most important thing I can convey, however, is about the food in Waikiki. If you want value in dining...get out of Waikiki. Be sure to find your way to Lobster King on King Street. Unfortunately, we only heard about it on our final day...but it was incredible. It's where the locals eat. In fact, I think we were the only non-Asians there. I ordered the roast duck for $11.95 and, as a lover of roast duck, I can say it was the best I've ever eaten. My husband loved his Mongolian Beef as well. I just wished we'd found the place early in our stay. It's only about 3 miles from the hotel and worth the bus or taxi trip (we had a rent car). Go around 2:30pm. Otherwise you'll have to wait an hour to get seated....it's that good. As for the Ilima Hotel....don't be afraid. If you're not on a limited budget and the sky's the limit....stay at the Royal Hawaiian or the Moana Hotel...the two oldest, most glorious hotels in Waikiki. But, if you're on a budget...stay at the Ilima like we did, then go to those two hotels and enjoy them for dinner. On our final night, we dropped $200 at the Royal Hawaiian for dinner and it was worth every penny as we dined on the lanai by the beach. Saving money at the Ilima allowed us this final night splurge. It also allowed us to play golf at Turtle Bay and Ko'Oalau. I guess it depends on where you place your priorities. FYI - we also had a smoking room...Ilima is one of the few hotels in Honolulu which still has a smoking floor.",Tyler,2,4.0

We had reserved a studio for four nights and were happy to see we were on the eighth floor overlooking the canal and the mountains. What a fantastic view! The room, being over 500 sq.ft, seemed enormous compared to standard hotels, and we had plenty of space to spread out. Perhaps because we overlooked the canal, we heard very little noise late at night, although at times the wind howled, but it wasn't enough to disturb us. Nonetheless, the room, somewhat dated (who cares?) was spotless and had everything we needed, i.e. appliances, utensils, internet connection (no wi-fi yet) and so on. I had read earlier reviews so I brought coffee filters so I didn't have to buy a new batch. Having rented a car, the staff told us where to find the Safeway supermarket, around a 15 minute drive, and we loaded up on breakfast and snack items. It's a five minute walk to the International Market which has a lot of great choices for a variety of inexpensive food. Also, there's a great noodle place (I believe east on Kuhio Ave) just a few blocks away...you'll know it when you see the long lines. It's well worth the wait. Although the parking at the hotel seemed to be limited, we never had a problem getting a space. It takes less than 15 minutes to walk to the beach and there are numerous restaurants all quite near, again a very diverse selection, from Thai to Chili's, depending on your whim. So, if you're looking for a spectacular deal in a great location, this is the place to stay. Reserve online directly with the hotel to get a a special rate - look specials.",Orlando,26,4.0

It was clean, but a little worse for wear. It needed a paint job and new furniture in the rooms.

They had a computer that guests could use near the lobby, but they charged by the minute and for printing pages, which seemed a little cheap. The parking was limited and there was no wifi (there were connections for computers) in the rooms. It did have a small outdoor pool.

Beautiful view from lanai of mtns & lites of city & canal. The full kitchen came in handy as we bought food at Food Pantry (2-3 blks) for breakfasts & lunches even dinner one night. Yes, the hotel is 'dated' but who cares if it is a clean & very spacious room.We rented a car for 2 days to see the north end beaches & then also to go to Hanauma Bay where the snorkeling was fun (don't expect spectacular). It was cheaper to rent a car in Waikiki than at HNL airport even with a shuttle cost of $10pp to hotel & later back to airport. (Ilima will give you the ph number - reserve 24 hrs). Parking for free at hotel was a plus! Stay away from the H-1 freeway as much as possible - ridiculous traffic.

We didn’t have any problems finding a parking spot, but, I could see how that could be challenging at night.One room was facing Waikiki beach, however, you really can’t see the water from the balcony, even on the upper floor of the hotel. The view is pretty much, the tops of buildings. The second room overlooked the Ala Wai canal and golf course. You could see the beautiful hills from the balcony. The view is much better on the east side, but the traffic noise seems to be louder. We walked to the beach daily, its about two blocks. Sunset from the beach is not to be missed. There are small shops every where in the beach area that range from extremely expensive to very reasonable. When visiting tourist sites in downtown Honolulu we took the bus as parking is non existent or very expensive. We used the car to visit the rest of the island. The room pictures included in many reviews is very accurate as to what the rooms are actually like. All in all I have no complaints about our stay at the Ilima hotel and I would definitely stay there again when I revisit.","Camillus, New York",97,5.0

I have to say I am disappointed and was expecting more. Ilima Hotel is not rundown but all it really need is cosmetic updating of the room and bathroom. The rooms are spacious with a kitchen, table and chairs so it is good for a couple or small family of three. The hotel does have free parking for guests but don't rent a large vehicle because the parking space is tight and it is not easy to maneuver around. In addition, parking is limited and don't be surprised if you end up having to park on the street. There is an outdoor pool but it is really for sitting and relaxing so don't expect to do laps. From the hotel, you can pretty much walk to a lot of the attractions in the area.

Only thing that I notice that has been updated since then is the lobby. It's a budget hotel in the hub of it all. For those commenting on the noise. It's Waikiki... It's a city with a famous beach. It's full of tourists shopping, creating garbage and noise. The noise pollution is just a fact of life, as with any other urban centre. The staff were all helpful and courteous. But a extra special shout out to Dayna and Robin!! (Dayna will you marry me?) ;) You can save money on food due to the fact the Ilima provides a full kitchen. Otherwise you're looking at somewhere near $10 per person, per meal when eating out. That adds up quickly if you're with a family. That being said, you will be a little taken aback by the grocery prices at nearby Foodland and ABC. I suggest bringing from home some ""to go"" packets of salt, pepper, mayo, catsup. Whatever various seasonings and condiments you enjoy, as there were none in the room. A tiny bottle of mayo set me back over $4. (But it was Thanksgiving weekend, so very few deals on anything.) There's a safe in the room, for a $2.50 per day charge. I brought my own beach towel. They do offer free towels and roll-out bamboo mats. But I found the towels supplied to be quite small. It made for a good beach pillow though. :) At tip to save over 40% on your room rate. Book directly through the hotels website. Pick your dates. Click the drop-down where it says ""Rack,"" and click on ""Hot Deals."" My rate went from $178 to $100 p/night. You're not going to beat that in Waikiki. I paid more to stay at the Ohana East last year, and I would definitely recommend the Ilima over the OE for room size, cooking facilities and bed comfort alone. (OE had the worst bed I've ever slept in.) You're not going to find glitz n glamour. But it's clean. It's roomy. It's reasonable. It's just a couple blocks from the beach, and right near the thick of things. As long as you're not expecting some posh accommodation... I totally recommend it!",Maple Ridge BC,11,4.0

It is in Hawaii's busiest tourist area, yet the hotel employees are all friendly and act like the Ilima is a great place to work (one told me some staff have been here over 20 years). The building is looking dated, but it is comfortable and reasonably well-maintained: everything works and there are no smells of mildew, mold, or deodorizers. The photos on Ilima's website show the rooms accurately. We learned to get a 1-bedroom suite because the premium gets us extra space, a sleeper-sofa (so we can sit someplace other than a bed), and windows on 3 sides for excellent ventilation (not to mention some nice views). The king bed was comfortable, and the A/C cooled the bedroom well for sleeping.For in-room Internet, bring your laptop for the free hard-wired CAT5 connection; only the lobby has wifi.

The Aloha at the Ilima is strong. We added an extra week on to the 4 wks already spent there. Only peeve--not having enough parking spaces so guests feel they can come and go as they please without losing the ability to park in the hotel garage. Having to drive around in circles and then walk 2 or 3 blocks can put a damper on the evening. Paying guests should have ASSIGNED stalls for their use only.

You have to becareful though because the doors are quite heavy and if the sliding windows open you can really hurt yourself! So becareful! There is no Wifi in the rooms so you have to go down to the lobby..you get use to it after awhile but your really not there to play with your iPad. There is Internet connections in the rooms though. What was also nice is free parking! Kind of tight especially with mini van but if your a good driver like my hubby you should be ok..to be warned try to park early. If you get there after 9:00pm you maybe out of luck. You were close to the International market, Main strip and a great udon noodle place just around the corner. The staff was awesome! Especially the people at the front desk...they where so helpful and friendly and we had great conversations! The pool was quite small but that being said, my 17&14 loved it. You can't do laps but it was nice for a quick dip. We also went to a free lei making class which they provided on Wednesday am. They talked about where the nuts come from and you make necklaces. It was alot of fun and you get to take them home. How awesome is that. Please note, this is not a fancy hotel...if you want something fancy this is not the hotel for you. If you want a clean hotel with a full kitchen, free parking and close to the strip this is it but don't expect anything else. We had no regrets staying at the Ilima and we would definetly go back!

This hotel is very well located in Waikiki with the supermarket (Food Pantry) just two blocks away and easy access to The Bus and trolley stops.

The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the hotel has a Hawaiian sing-along and necklace making to give you a little taste of Hawaiian culture. Free on site parking saves a lot of money, although the parking spots are very small. We asked for a room that faced the Ala Wai Canal and had room 701. If I had to say anything negative, it would be that I don't like the strong smelling, perfume-y spray they spray in the room.

So it's just as well I stayed more than one night as things improved dramatically after an initial cool 'welcome' to the Ilima.I'd made the mistake of walking about 30mins to the hotel with a heavy bag in the 2pm sun, and -- although I didn't realise till later -- I was suffering a touch of heat exhaustion and/or dehydration when I arrived. I felt like I might faint and I needed water, which I mentioned to the reception lady when I arrived. But the staff on reception didn't seem to give a toss. I had a guaranteed reservation and there was no rush to check me in, so you'd think people in the hospitality business in a tropical place like Hawaii would have invited a guest who was feeling overwhelmed by the heat to take a seat (there are sofas in the lobby) and drink some water until she felt better. Instead I was hassled to provide my credit card and ID instantly, and when I didn't respond fast enough (because I was searching desperately for my bottle of water, feeling quite flushed and woozy), I was hassled again for my credit card as if there was some desperate urgency -- which there clearly wasn't. Some training in basic humanity would be a good idea for the staff who were on duty that afternoon!!Fortunately the initial terrible customer service seems to have been an aberration, as all my later dealings with the staff in this hotel were fabulous. All the other staff on reception were overwhelmingly helpful (eg. helping me to log into the free wifi in the lobby; confirming my shuttle transfer to the airport) and one staff member deserves a medal for her assistance that went way beyond the call of duty. When I realised I'd left a bag of shopping at a store, Eme offered to drive me over to collect it in her own time, having just worked a full night shift, and then she dropped me back at the hotel. This sort of caring, personal customer service can't be surpassed, and more than made up for the cold 'welcome' to the hotel a couple of days earlier. The Ilima Hotel should clone Eme!!The rooms were OK: nothing special, but quite satisfactory. They were 1960s-1970s style ""motel"" standard with a useful kitchenette, small but pleasant balcony, smallish flat screen TV, good crisp linen on so-so beds, air con, plenty of space. Although tired-looking, everything was nice and clean. I had one of the more expensive rooms on a high level, so the outlook was good though I didn't feel the room was great value for money. There's wired internet but sadly no wifi in the rooms (free wifi is available in the lobby, as is an expensive pay-per-use computer). I was very unimpressed to find a hotel still charging per day to use the in-room safe!! Hotels should be encouraging guests to keep their valuables secure, not gouging them by charging for a basic travel essential like somewhere safe to leave a passport, ipad or camera when going to the beach.The hotel's location is excellent. It's right by the canal, with a lovely outlook over the golf course and volcano in one direction. Going the other way, it's a block to tacky Kuhio Avenue with its nightclubs and souvenir shops (sadly this meant there was also a bit of a party crowd in the hotel on the long holiday weekend, though staff told me that was unusual). It's two blocks to walk to classy Kalakaua Ave, with its nice shops, arcades, and the beach. Overall, I was happy with my stay at the Ilima Hotel and I'd stay here again. I wouldn't recommend it to people who are looking for mod cons or style, but for those wanting a good, basic place to stay with cooking facilities, an excellent location, and a family-run feel, it's highly recommended.","Greater London, United Kingdom",145,4.0

I knew this was a budget hotel and I had read various reviews on Trip Advisor. Although the prices were decent and the location was within walking distances from everything I was expecting a lot more. The free parking is a nice plus but the spots are tiny and thankfully it was empty so we had no issues parking our minivan. The lobby to the hotel is nice but the immediate area is grubby and I wouldn't walk out there at night. We arrived at 2:30 pm with a baby and I was informed that my room was not ready but the crib was in there. The lady at the desk was polite but not overly concerned that I was ready to check in and out my baby down for a nap. I waited until after 3 pm (yes check in is at 3 pm) and I had to hound them to get my room ready. At approx. 3:15 pm, I was allowed into my room which limited further my short stay on Oahu. The room itself was disgusting to say the least. We had a studio style room with full kitchen. There was a coffee maker but no coffee? Also our view was over a scary looking apartment type building and we stared directly at them. The pale pink colour of the hotel was also grubby and the whole hotel needs an update. To be honest, I wouldn't of stayed there for another night as it was that bad. The crib which cost us over 10 bucks a night was also crappy and I felt bad for putting my baby in it but what can you do. The room also has a strange smell coming from it. The beds are tiny and the pillows are paper thin. Neither of us slept very well in this room. If you want area but are on a tight budget then this hotel may be for you but I would upgrade and go somewhere else.","Kelowna, B.C.",9,2.0

There is a lot of room in the hotel, but it's not really usable unless you plan on having a rollaway bed. In fact, it was a bit of a drawback because it meant the tv was about 12 feet from the foot of the bed. The view was really unattractive, even for a city view. It's about two blocks back from the main strip in Waikiki and that 2nd block really makes a difference in the feeling of the surrounding area. Also, the free wifi is only in the lobby. We took one look around and knew that we weren't going to be happy with this at all. We went to talk to the front desk.

We had only two significant complaints. The first was that, when the hot water was turned on—even low, it made a loud shuddering noise. My partner said this wasprobably due to an air lock in the pipes. We were in a hurry checking out so we didn't have a chance to alert the front desk to this problem.( Hopefully, it's been addressed.) The second concerned the metal tray under the air conditioning unit on the lanai. We sat out there on a few occasions, but this thing didn't look like it had been cleaned in a very long time.

When I've been here before, I've stayed on the Beach Walk. This property was a change of pace. Situated on a quiet street facing the Ala Wai Canal, it is so much quieter than staying on the ""strip."" I requested a room on a high floor and away from children if possible. They gave me 1207. Great view of the canal! The room was large with a king bed and a double. Since it was just me, I slept on the firm king. Extra pillows and blankets were in the dresser. The furniture is dated, rattan and tropical looking. The AC was on when I got to the room, and it was a little loud, but the weather during this time of the year is so pleasant, so I kept it off the four days I stayed here and just opened the sliding door to the lanai. GREAT breeze! I barely heard any of the other guests on my floor and above me, except for the ventilation shaft near the kitchenette. I only used the small 4-cup coffee machine and microwave for breakfast every morning. But the unit contained the basics you'd need if you were inclined to cook.The room could use a renovation. It's so different from the Wyndham which I usually stay at. I'm sure when it first opened, it was considered the place to go. There was a flat screen tv which was the only modern item, free internet access (data cable), and lots of storage. If you plan on staying in your room to admire it's beauty, why are you visiting Hawaii? I only came back to the room to shower, change, and/or sleep. I bet if they renovated each floor, this would be the place to stay, but then again, those frills cost money, and they'd have to raise their rates. I love the ""home away from home"" feel here. The staff is GREAT! Helpful and friendly! After I came back from the beach, I noticed a crate of beach mats near the entrance that are available for guests. There is an onsite laundry facility, and my only issue was that you couldn't buy detergent there. Parking is FREE! However, it is limited, and one night, I had to find street parking. My advice is to explore early in the day, come back for the beach in the afternoon, and you're guaranteed a spot. Oh, and FREE daily newspapers!

Every sort of pot, pan and bowl was available too, along with plates and cutlery. All spotlessly clean. The only gripe on this front was that the stove was very slow to heat up.Be warned though that groceries in Hawaii are expensive, and it's not that much cheaper to make your own food, if it's a filling meal you are after. There is a supermarket a couple of blocks away if you do want to cook, but the food court at the nearby international marketplace serves up a large plateful of just about anything you want to eat for about $10.I'd recommend the free lei making classes at the hotel for everone - all sexes and ages will become engrossed.There is a small pool at the hotel that's good for a late or early dip. There's also a small gym and sauna.

The pool area was quite inviting only small but very relaxing after a big day out shopping,sightseeing or whatever and the pool was refreshing on those very hot days and in the evening when the temperature drops slightly and the wind picks up the pool then starts to heat itself with warm water being pumped in and one of the good things we found is that we had the pool pretty much to ourselves where we noticed other hotels pools were packed to the brim with people,maybe we just got lucky everyday?plenty parking but be quick because you snooze you loose. The location of the hotel we found was ideal because it was away from the main strip of Waikiki and not as loud and full on but if you wanted to get in amongst it you were only a 5 minute walk if that away from it all.When booking tours such as Pearl Harbour or Whale watching cruises e.t.c you can't go pass the tour desk in the hotel lobby thats run by a very friendly and accommodating fine gentleman by the name of Alan, he will hook you up with the best tour companies that are very informative and very reasonable price wise also The Ilima offers free Lei making classes run by a very beautiful woman by the name of June, this class is a must unless you wanna go up the road and buy one for 15 bucks?

We had two queen beds, flat screen TV, window AC (which was on 24/7 and never quite cooled down the room) and plenty of closets and drawers. Pros: The location was great. We could walk 2 blocks to International Marketplace, 3 blocks to high-end shopping and 4 blocks to Waikiki Beach. The price was cheap at $115 per nt. for a huge room. Free parking and the Enterprise Car Rental office is right across the street. They provide beach mats and towels.Cons: Street noise. We were on the 5th floor and were woken up early each morning by the garbage trucks. Not much of a view from our side of the building although the other side had view of the canal.

We brought our 2 teenagers - aren't we nice?! Our original reservation was with another hotel / condo nearby but after reading mixed reviews I canceled and found Ilima, thanks to ""Oahu Revealed"". We found a special deal on their website - a room with guaranteed view and 5th night free - so it turned out to be a better deal than our original hotel, plus the guaranteed view, plus FREE parking and free internet.The Ilima had what we were looking for: a kitchenette, close to the beach and shopping, a nice view, a good deal. The room was very spacious and had a ton of storage space. We had coffee each morning on our private lanai, watching the kayakers on the canal, with the golf course and mountains behind it. Beautiful! The room and all areas of the hotel were sparkling clean. Decor wasn't terribly outdated - just the wallpaper. The furniture was rattan, good quality. Beds were comfortable. Our room was cleaned every day (to our kids' dismay, they cleaned everything but the dishes....lol). The things that put Ilima over the top are the special touches and the way they go above and beyond. They have a connected parking garage that is free to hotel guests. The internet in room is free. (Many other hotels in Waikiki charge for these items.) They offer beach towels and bamboo mats to borrow for the beach, laundry facilities (AND a laundry basket in the room for us to use). A pitcher of cold water was waiting for us in the fridge. Somewhere in making our reservation, I must have mentioned our anniversary. When we got to our room we were surprised by a gift basket and a card signed by the staff, and not just signatures but messages wishing us well and congratulating us on our 20 years! It was a personal touch that we will never forget.While it was technically only 2 blocks from the beach, it was challenging to find beach access from the street through the buildings, shops and hotels. We did like being only 1 block from the International Marketplace and there is a grocery store within walking distance.

We dont have 1 complaint. I would like to do a special Mahalo (thank you) to Courtni in Reservations for getting us a smoking room and also getting us the mountain and canal view on the 9th floor, it DEFINATELY made out trip more enjoyable for we spent alot of time on our lanai in the morning and evening and enjoyed the tranquil view and watched all the outrigger canoes and walkers and joggers along go along the canal. ALL the staff were absolutely WONDERFUL and VERY helpful. The hotel is older, yes, but very very clean, very safe feeling and walking distance to tons of different things in the area. Just keep an eye out on your surroundings at night for it is off the main street and you have to walk by older hotels and a bar on that street (Nanahoni Street).We were there the weekend of the Pro Bowl, so only on the Sat nt we had to walk a bit faster up the side street for there was some undesirables hanging out on the street, otherwise we felt very safe overall. It is in one of the best locations in Waikiki for you are in the middle of the heart of Waikiki. If you can, get a view of the mountains, I HIGHLY recommend it. We did not go into the pool (did not seem to get alot of sun most of the day) or on any of the sundecks (there are 2 on the 10th floor and on top of the penthouse rooftop there is also a large one). The hotels kindly borrow you beach towels (basic white pool towels) and straw beach mats for the beach. You are a 5 min walk to the beach, 5 minute walk to one of the markets (cheap, cheap deals for souveniers) they barter with you like Mexicano, which I found interesting for you are in the US. The hotel is very soundproof for it is made of concrete. The only noise you hear is the garbage trucks at night (but everyone I met along our travels, at different hotels heard them) There is a grocery store 5 min walk for groceries (Foodland), kinda expensive, but does the trick for food for the room. The rooms are HUGE, so would be GREAT for families. They have free lei making classes every Wed at 10am (we missed it for we got in very very late the nt beforeand slept in). Also every Friday at 11am,they have staff that performs in a Hawaiian Chorus, in the lobby and they sing for about half hour, you can sing along too with their songbooks. We got to see it and it was BEAUTIFUL if you appreciate the true culture of the Hawaiians, a DEFINATE must see. I am HIGHLY recommending this hotel for all travellers of all ages. One thing....NOT a party place, which we were happy about that. Very very quiet hotel. It is great also if you are a smoker for there are very FEW hotels you can smoke in Hawaii.

We had a good experience with hotel staff - in fact we never had any trouble with the hotel, getting around, to and from the airport. We stayed 3 nights.There is a shuttle that takes you to and from the hotel, which is specific to iLima but you need to book in advance though since they need to co-ordinate it. When we first arrived we took an airport bus through Roberts Transport which was very reasonable as well. Roberts was about $9, and the iLima shuttle was $10.Our only complaint was that the first two days we had a hire car and need to park it somewhere. We were told that the hotel has free parking for those staying at the hotel. What we didn't anticipate on was that it was first come first served. When we arrived there were no spots left! But lucky for us, as we were checking in, someone has left so we managed to find a park. The service desk gave us some tips on when it was best to obtain a park which was handy - make sure you ask when you get there with a car! The alternative is to park across the road for a fee, or park on the street... overnight it is free up to 7am (I think?) - that's if you can find one first!Overall a very reasonable stay at a reasonable cost, and it a convenient location!

The hotel is conveniently located to many restaurants and shops in Waikiki; you need only walk a short half-block to get to a street full of them.

It was the only one that was constantly highly rated and within my price range. The service was good. We were greeted upon our arrival and taken care of immediately. Booked the room through Expedia and paid for it advance. The room was a studio with 2 beds and a kitchen. It was one step above the cheapest room. The hotel is in good condition but make no mistake, the style is 20-30 years ago. Everything looks old but I don't mind that since the price was much better than the other hotels in the area. The room had all the amenities you could ask for and a new 32 inch lcd TV. Note: the TV they had in our room was a Sharp designed to integrate the hotel video software for PPV and such. They locked out all the inputs to the TV so you CANNOT hook up your laptop to the TV, or a DVD player or a ps3 or anything for that matter. That's a big disappointment for me because I wanted to use Redbox and my laptop to watch movies at night but no go. Had to use my laptop. On the plus you do get free wired internet in the room.

Other than the technology, the room was nice. It had plenty of room and the kitchen made breakfast very easy while on vacation. The AC was a window unit with a remote, there is no central air. The hotel had a pool that was very small but I didn't use it. On to the free parking: it's available but with a few caveats. It gets filled up fast and it's really cramped. It has some of the smallest parking spots I've seen anywhere outside of Europe or Asia. Big surprise for Americans used to plenty of room. I had a convertible which was not that big and it was still a pain to park. Don't even think about bringing a Suburban or Deville in there. Minivans do alright. The lot will fill up around 9pm or so. So plan ahead. Weekends are even worse. We came back from a late dinner on Fri night and the lot was completely full. The staff was helpful and gave us a map showing all the lots available to us. We were able to find 2 that were around $7-8 for overnight. One is a public pay lot across the street and the other was the Waikiki Trade Center that has $7 for 10 hours when prepaid. The latter was about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. But no other hotels have free parking around there and street parking is impossible. All the good spots get filled up by employees working in the area. Good:CleanlinessLocationServiceBad:Small parking lot gets filled up fastTV inputs locked out so you can't watch your own content on their TVOther than that I would say it was an overall good experience. I know I'm being picky about the parking and TV but those were the only flaws in an otherwise perfect stay.","Chicago, Illinois",6,5.0

For a family with small kids it would be ideal. I dealt with Courtni when booking and she was absolutely great, as was the staff on duty when we were there. It's a block off the main shopping street and 2 blocks up from the beach but that is no big deal. It's quiet, safe and if you are lucky enough to get a room facing the canal it has great views.

The staff at the front were always warm and loved to strike up a conversation with us.As I said, the hotel rooms are a little used. They are bland, are not new or newly renovated and the furniture is decent enough. Very mediocre but suit needs very well. There is a small outdoor pool and a work out room that houses treadmills. Did not investigate this any further other than looking in the door.As for the location. It’s about a two block walk south to get to the beach, we went there once because we decided to tour around the area. At night, there were plenty of restaurants to choose from a couple blocks away. We made use of Denny’s, California Pizza, and The Cheesecake Factory (either get there early or plan to wait for a table). We also checked out the International market, King’s Village, and dealt with some pushy sales people on one of the alley markets. A word of caution, if you see anybody trying to sell baby fermented sharks, please do not purchase these or anything from these people and find a more eco friendly person.You may have noted that the sleep quality was a little lacking. Beds were not the problem. The downtown core was the problem, very windy and the shutter type windows didn't exactly block out the breezy noises. I had no problems with this, a sort of white noise, but my fiancee required earplugs.This was also a good central location to visit the East side and West side of the island as well as the Pearl Harbour area.

It is also convenient if you like to avoid having to drive after partying it up downtown and a decent walk back to the hotel. It might be dated, but it is always clean. The A/C works and it also has a lani to sit on and drink coffee, which you'll have to purchase at the store.

It is very nice to be able to walk along the Ala Wai canal in the evening which is only a shot walk from the hotel's door. To me it is more relaxing than the area along Kalakaua Ave nearer the beach.

We found this hotel by simply surfing the net and then discovered their special internet rates that provided much larger savings than their normal rack rate. Of course what does one do when you have no real idea about the hotel except for the other reviews we have read. Luckily for us our friend Frank came to the rescue. He happened to be on holidays at Waikiki and he checked out the hotel for us. Although he couldn't check out the rooms his report was simple......... ""if you can get this for $75USD per night you are laughing"". We quickly sent an email to the hotel and within 48 hours we had confirmation the room was booked. Unfortunately at that price we did not have a choice of the room and we ended up with a view looking over the hotel roof next door. The only other complaint we had were the rock hard beds however the room was very large, with a ample kitchenette. The Lanai was adequate in size and we faced the sunshine during the day and with something like 30 TV stations (and free internet) this room was great. The decor was a bit dated but is was certainly clean and comfortable. The stroll to the beach was about 10 minutes via the gauntlet of cheap jewelry and souvenirs sellers. Despite this the hotel is close to all the action and restaurants. The staff were very helpful and friendly. They provide towels and beach mats and the small swimming pool is great to wash off the sand and salt.

What we got was, to us, a 5 star experience based on what we were looking for.Even though this was our honeymoon, we are not the kind of people to spend a lot of money on a fancy hotel room with all sorts of amenities ... we planned on being out and about on the island, and just needed a place to crash. Eventually, it was even better than that, with the comfortable bed, nice TV, kitchenette, and balcony. Our view wasn't the best (city view), but it seemed like there was a very nice view of the Ala Wai Canal if you wanted to pay a little more. We enjoyed eating, talking, and reading the Honolulu Advertiser (delivered every morning!) out on our ""lanai"". The bathroom wasn't stocked to the nines, but it had your basic toiletries. The bathroom was a good comfortable size and didn't feel tight at all. The shower ran nicely as well. No complaints there.Our kitchenette had a microwave, mini stove, BIG refrigerator, and plenty of cabinet space - which to my surprise was stocked with dishes of every size and plenty of utensils. I don't know why this surprised me, but it was very cool to have everything right there. The sink was also a trash compactor, which I didn't know how to use, so I didn't bother it.The room had two double beds, a desk with chair, a dining table with chairs, and a nice dresser to put our clothes in. Plenty of closet space if we had needed it. One morning, I went down to ask a question about where I might find a certain celebrity fitness trainer (Gilad Janklowicz) ... if anyone knew his gym. The clerk looked up the address on the internet, pointed me in the right direction, and I met him that very same day. I would've had no idea without the desk clerk - he was so helpful and nice!So the best part about Ilima is definitely the customer service. Not only do they greet you everytime you come in and out - and we did A LOT - they really seem to mean it. On Friday mornings in the lobby, the serenade the guests with real Hawaiian music courtesy the staff and the Ilima Chorus, with a ukelele to boot! It really brought Hawaii home for me, as we hadn't really done any cultural things yet. It was beautiful music and even now I can't get it out of my head.The location is pretty great - it's off the main roads towards the back of the Waikiki area, near the Ala Wai Canal. But it's the perfect setting if you like the sightseeing and shopping of Waikiki but don't want to be smack in the middle of it - because the area can get pretty loud at night, especially on the weekends. The road may look a little sketchy because it's not on the main strip, but we loved how it was off in the corner, next to a nice, neighborhood bar - no rambunctious drinkers were out.The hotel pool is nice, although on the small side. It's not too chlorinated, and while it's not heated, it'll feel relaxing in the heat of Hawaii. On that note, the air conditioning in the room is great; temperature control is a cinch. Although you need the a/c over there, a nice thing about the island was it never felt humid. As soon as you stepped into the shade, it felt better. Back home in Ohio, it's so muggy and gravity just feels heavier here. Not so on Oahu.The only people I would not recommend this hotel to are people that want luxury - these rooms are a little outdated, but clean. They are not frilly and I don't know if they have a jacuzzi suite or not. You can order delivery from pizza places and the like, but there is no room service. But if you and your family (they have large suites) just need a headquarters in Waikiki, look no further than Ilima!Oh, and P.S.!

There was also plenty of storage, and a laundry basket for washing clothes. The washers were only $1 - cheaper than at home - and soap was avail at the front desk for another $1. :) It was ocean-view, but I could only see a smidge of the ocean. It was OK though, because at night the lights of the hotels nearby was quite mezmerizing. I slept with the shades open every night. See my photos for the view. The room was clean, the water was hot - the water heater was just in the closet - and the staff was very helpful. Because the hotel is 2 blocks from the beach, it was quiet enough to sleep, but not so far away that you felt removed from the life happening on the beach. Free parking, free internet, full kitchen, and a safe. Also, there was a great bar just outside that served $2.50 mai tais, and an awesome bakery 1 block over where we ate breakfast every morning.

We asked the front staff and they told us exactly where to find it.The rooms are very large, and the lanai is nice to sit on every morning with the complimentary paper and a cup of coffee. The bedding itself was soft and clean and inviting, but the mattresses were quite hard! I started the week with a sore back, and my husband ended the week with a sore back, but, overall, it wasn't a big issue for us.We loved our shower, and the bathrooms were spotless. I actually found the towels to be thick, very clean and fairly soft. The location is very good. Close to the beach and shopping, and just off the main street you catch the public bus to visit sights. The street behind the Ilima borders the canal and is nice for a stroll. I just can't imagine paying double or triple more to be at the beach front when we all use the same beach....but I suppose different people want different things out of a vacation. The beach front locations do have lovely pool areas that you can lounge around, which I might have liked...but definitely not for the price!I don't think I'll personally ever stay in Waikiki again (just personal preference) but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to others!

However, the hotel was quick to respond and very helpful in dealing with all of my e-mails and when we arrived (midnight) the staff were all very helpful and throughout our holiday they contributed to the fantastic time we had in Hawaii. If you want an expensive hotel on the beachfront accommodating hundreds of guests, most of which who don't want children around, and with services on offer which you hardly ever use, then don't book the Ilima. However, if you want a nice friendly hotel with large rooms, good location (albeit not beach front), and all of the basic facilities which you need from a hotel, go to the Ilima. We had a superior twin room (803) and whilst this was on the side of the hotel we did have a good view of the Canal, Golf Course and mountains behind to our right (the view was other hotels looking straight ahead on the lanai, but Waikiki is a large city afterall). As there were 5 of us (myself, my wife and seven year old Triplet's) it was very difficult to find somewhere in Oahu to accommodate all of us. However, the Ilima had two bedrooms, one with a double bed and one with twin beds, plus a large pull down double bed in the living room (conveniently stored in a wardrobe), plus a further sofa-bed in the living room, which were more than enough to accommodate us all. The room had full kitchen facilities, which were dated, but it was convenient for breakfast and snacks. (we ate out every night so didn't really need the kitchen facilities). There were laundry facilites on the third floor and the room had a TV, (which we didn't use) and free internet connection, plus free wi-fi connection in the lobby, if you can't leave your computer at home. The pool was small and a bit shaded on occasions, but my three children loved it as it was big enough for them to swim in and also safe for us to supervise them (no life guard) and very warm. The hotels location was two blocks from the beach (about a 5-6 minute walk) and convenient for all of the restaurants which are close to hand.

Yes, the rooms are large, but they are also old. The kitchenette seemed grimy and had much-used appliances. The most telltale sign was the bathroom towels - they were stringy, hard, and much-washed. They reminded me of hospital towels (their appearance makes you question what they were used for in the past). In fairness, the staff was pleasant and the Ilima's location was good. They had free internet and the rooms all have a small balcony. There is a pool, but it is extremely small and uninviting. It would be a good place to stay if you were in Honolulu for one night only.

The staff is invariably accomodating, the rooms clean and very spacious--if a little dated--and of course the location is great, off the main drag but near enough to walk just about anywhere in Waikiki. The kitchen is nice to have if you're staying more than a couple of days, and the free parking is a real value--but limited spaces may make parking difficult after early evening. It'd be nice to see room decor updated, bigger television sets, a couple of other things, but as this is one of Hawaii's last family-owned hotels, so I understand if it takes them longer to be able to afford to make such improvements.The property's biggest plus is its people, who almost without exception are friendly, helpful, and knowledgeble. The general manager has been with the hotel for more than 20 years and seems to have a knack for attracting motivated staff who genuinely enjoy their jobs--not an easy task given all the flashy competition and the difficult economy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for value over luxury, convenience over brand name, and a truly Hawiian experience over a generic resort atmosphere. Book a room facing the mountains for the best breezes and views.Note that the hotel has only a tiny pool that gets more shade than sun, and there is no in-house restaurant. However, two large sun decks on the 10th floor get great exposure in the afternoon, and Kuhio Avenue, with its restaurants, coffee shops, and access to public transportation, is only a block away.

The only issue I ever had was with parking (if you don't park before 7pm most nights, parking will run out) and some minor cat calling. I was packing up my vehicle on day when we found a place to live and two gentleman on break were smoking in the garage and cat called me. I did contact the hotel manager who attempted to return my calls, but always called when I specifically told him I was at work or unavailable. So we never actually spoke about the incident. I am still minorly upset about this issue b/c I felt he did not care to remedy the situation. My husband (who works in law enforcement) even went down to the front desk in his uniform to complain and nothing was ever done about it to our knowledge.Aside from the lack of parking after 7 p.m., the parking slots are also VERY tiny so if you rent a car, do not get a bigger vehicle or a Sebring Convertible.

However, a two block walk took us right to the water, so this didn’t seem like much of an inconvenience. For us, a big selling point was the free parking offered by the hotel. Parking costs upwards of $20 a day at most hotels, so this was an excellent opportunity to save that money for something fun. I would caution that there are limited free spots in the garage & that it may be more full during peak times. We never had a problem, even when we came in late at night.

The extras like the chocolate-covered macadamia nuts for check-in and the shell leis at check-out were nice. When we arrived Friday morning during the sing-along, we were still able to check in, and although our room wasn't ready yet, we were still able to get towels from the desk and go to the beach. The free parking in the small garage was never a problem, although we did make it a point to be there by late afternoon and do our evenings on foot. The safe was big enough for the laptop. The only minor disappointment was that the pool was closed for repairs when we were there, but these things happen. I would go back again, and heartily recommend it to anyone with kids.

I have to say the entire experience was wonderful, from booking to check out. We booked the room on their website while they were running a special, $125/night for the Deluxe room. The room was huge, with a King sized bed AND an additional double bed, along with the kitchen, desk, and plenty of closet space.We requested a corner room on the 12th floor on the advice of another reviewer, and I received an email from the girl that does reservations asking me what kind of view I wanted (street view or canal view). I told her I wasn't sure, since I've never been there, but mentioned it was for our honeymoon. She was extremely friendly with her advice, and ended up giving us an amazing corner room with a mountain view. When we walked into our room after an excrutiating 10 hour flight, all I can say is it instantly erased our jet lag. The view was absolutely breathtaking. One whole side of the room was floor to ceiling glass. You can see the canal, the mountains, and at night, the beautiful twinkling lights of the city. Besides the great view and rock bottom prices, the hotel offers several amenities that ended up costing us dearly at the other 2 hotels we stayed at during our trip: free parking and free internet access. Not only that, but we didn't realize how handy it was to have a full kitchen. We were able to keep a full case of bottled water and some milk and cereal on hand for early mornings. It's just little ways to save money that really add up in the end. The on-site laundry facilities were very helpful as well. The location is extremely convenient, within walking distance of practically everything.As honeymooners, we picked 3 different locations for the duration of our trip: the Ilima to start, followed by a mid-range resort on the Big Island, then a high-end resort for our last 2 days in Oahu. We actually enjoyed the Ilima the best out of all of them. It's very private and quiet, which was great for us. We always had the pool to ourselves, which was nice because we really enjoyed taking dips at night after spending the day site seeing.

The property's pool is small and was a bit disappointing. The pool area is also shaded and drafty so a hot tub would have been nice.

We upgraded our room from a studio to a one bedroom and were happy with what we were given. It was clean and well presented and had most things we needed during our stay. The daily maid service was great too. Its located just off the main Kuhio Road which means that getting on The Bus is really easy if you want to access other parts of the island. You do have to cross a couple of main roads to get to the beach - one of them being a main shopping street so you may feel odd walking there with all your beach stuff, but there are lots of others doing the same so its no big deal. The place does look like it needs updating but its purely cosmetic - its not dirty or anything. The backout blinds were helpful for us as we were travlling with an infant. The only donwside I would say is the very slow check in - after 20 hours travelling from the UK, it took ages!! It was 11.30pm by the time we got there and we would have just liked to have gone to our room but it was probably because there was some confusion over whether we wanted a cot or not. We also had to take our own luggage up - which was fine but some people might get annoyed at that. We took our own cot but they do have them but I think $10 a day is very steep where most other places this is free!The only other downer was that they suggested we use Ilima tours for airport pick up and drop off - not linked to them but reccomended. Pick up from the airport was ok - we did have to wait a while, but the drop off was a nightmare. We waited for 40 mins and they did not come and we got v stressed about getting our connection. The lady at reception was very helpful and called them many times but we ended up getting a cab at huge expense!. Im not sure why they reccomend them as it caused us alot of stress in getting our connection onwards.

Both units are fully aircon, but if you like fresh air, ilima’s strategic location gets excellent cross-breezes and so is well ventilated and fresh.Our 2 bedrooms unit has a large kitchenette, fridge, sitting/TV and lanai area. The kitchenette was fully stocked; kettle, coffee maker, pots, pans, toaster, plates and utensils. Everything was very clean. We used the stove to make breakfast and it was nice that bottled water was provided as well. Rooms are ok but the room doors had a bit of problems – one did not close properly or if you do so, it would required you to use quite a bit of strength to pull it open; the other closes easily but as the bathroom doors opens/closes next to it, the bedroom door will come unlatch from the vibrations. Also it was sometimes noisy for the room facing back of the hotel, as the windows was louvered type (noise is not from the regular traffic as the hotel is along a side street), I was awoken couple of times by the garbage truck making its rounds around the neighbourhood during the early morning wee hours. For my little girl this had no affect and she slept on quite well.My uncle/aunt’s studio was a very large unit too; I would say it was approximately the same size as our two-bedroom suite but minus the 2 bedrooms. Overall, everything was nice, clean and friendly. Next time, based on the room view and noise, I’ll go for 2 one-studio unit on the mountain side.Oh, if there are more than 2 people going to the airport, consider using the regular taxi/cab this hotel uses. I did for my family of 4, the taxi was a classy white limo driven by the Vietnamese boss; he was very friendly and charged like the regular taxi rates but unfortunately I’d lost his name card.","Singapore, Singapore",8,4.0

(there was a building partially blocking our view straight out). It was a very large, bright room with large lanai. Everything was very clean. The bathroom looked like it had recently been redone. Family travelling with us stayed in a two-bedroom suite (703). The view on that side overlooked the street, so you might want to try getting a 2 bedroom on the canal side. The staff was excellent, from front desk to housekeeping to the maintenance man who fixed my in-laws door because it shut too quickly for them!

However, when I went to the actual hotel I was in for a big surprise...I arrived at 4pm (1 hour after the guaranteed check in time at 3pm). Upon checking in at the reception counter, I was informed that our room was not ready and would not be so for an hour. I was not bothered too much by this as I am sure it may happen everywhere but I was a little put off that they didn't offer an explanation or an apology just a ""oh, it's not ready, come back in an hour or so"". A nice little bit of unprofessionalism to start off my stay! So. My wife and I decided to just go walk around Waikiki in the meantime. We arrive back at the Ilima almost a full two hours later figuring we'd be able to get into our room. The answer? ""It's still not ready. Just have a seat and we'll tell you"". I was starting to get very irritated at the fact that it was like 6pm and we were stranded in their lobby. Finally, a full 30 minutes later we are informed the room is ready.We booked for a deluxe one bedroom suite (for $283 a night) and when we got up there, we were appalled. The bathtub was rusty and stained and the whole entire bathroom was obviously not kept up. The bed sheets had stains....STAINS of I don't even want to know. The comforter (if you can call it that) on our lumpy bed had small cigarettes wholes all over it and our room smelled like cigarette as well. Overall, the room, furniture, carpet and curtains were very outdated, rundown and NOT CLEAN. This place was a nightmare! We had booked the DELUXE one bedroom suite because we did not want to make the mistake of booking a regular studio room and having a rundown little room. Apparently at this hotel it didn't matter. We immediatly contacted the front desk and politely informed them of our concerns and asked if they may another a different room of the same category they may have. The girl on the other end was very rude and said that since we ""checked in so late"" that there was only one other room in our category we could look at. This ""new"" room was more of the same!! My wife and I immediatly set out to look for a new hotel because we were not going suffer for the next 9 nights!After about 2 hours of searching we finally found a much nicer place with new, clean and beautiful rooms at the Aqua Palms. The kicker? We were only going to be paying $150 a night for a much much nicer room at the Aqua Palms.The next morning when we were checking, the girl working at the reception desk made the remark that if we wanted a ""quality room we should have booked the penthouse""!!!!! Based on my stay here, I am under the impression that the staff must be writing the reviews to this site because I honestly have no idea how this hotel has a good reputation!!

We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms (studio), but the room was very spacious and airy. The staff is friendly, and I recognized the same people who we met during our last stay.There were a couple elements of our stay that were not as good:1. Noise: If you are not used to the city and city sounds, it may not be easy for you to drill out the sounds that many city dwellers are used to (traffic, the ""beep beep"" backup sounds of dumpsters being emptied, and so on. In addition, the airiness of the open-air hallways create a strong draft which causes doors to slam if you're not careful. During our stay, we had some very inconsiderate neighbors who continually went in and out of their door, letting it slam very hard behind them. (At 8AM on vacation, that was annoying).2. Parking: The parking garage fills up quickly when the hotel is busy, but there is overflow parking. The spaces are very tight, and it is extremely easy for your car to get dinged (or worse) by another. If you're not used to small city parking garages, be aware of this. The parking is free, though, which is a great plus!On the positive side:1. You get excellent value for the money2. The older gentleman at the tour desk (when we saw him in the past) was very kind and knowledgeable enough3. The desk staff is very friendly and hospitable, particularly the ones who have worked there longer4. Our housekeeper was very sweet and thorough5. The hotel is an easy walk to the International Market (a bit farther to the beach, though)6. The room was very clean with a newer air conditioner (which we used very little). The kitchenette was fine for a short stay.I detected no funny smells that were referred to in a previous review. In fact, I would take the stairs instead of the elevator down, and it was clean all the way to the lobby. I would not call the Ilima luxurious, but it was clean, safe, comfortable, and reasonably priced, especially for Waikiki. We would definitely return there again.","East Coast, USA",15,4.0

On my first stay, and indeed late at night after a long day of travelling I hadnt been very pleased with my first impressions of the hotel rooms which looked less contemporary than the holiday inn type hotels I was used to. If you are looking for a holiday inn type of hotel, you probably will find this to be a slight disappointment. However, after a few days it was obvious that there were many advantages to this hotel. It is not very far from the beach and the shops, but yet far enough that it is quiet and never overly crowded. This is extremely beneficial when you do deal with the front desk or want to swim in the pool as you never need worry about it being too busy which in my books is an absolute treasure on a holiday. As some of the other reviews have pointed out, the pool is smaller than others you will see at surronding hotels, but the fact that you may well end up having the whole pool to yourself seems to much outweigh having a small section of a large one. The staff is friendly and helpful and we have never had any complaints with that area of the hotel. The one thing that I would warn anyone considering this hotel about, is that if you are planning on taking many bus tours, or shuttle services - prepare to be the first hotel of many to be picked up and the last to be dropped off. We learned very quickly that by staying at a smaller less known hotel, that you are low priority for pickups and drop offs, which needless to say can be extremely inconvienient after a long day and has led on occassion to us simply getting off 5 or 6 blocks away at another hotel just to be able to get back faster by walking. Otherwise, we definitely never even consider another hotel when we continue to visit Hawaii as we find the benefits to this hotel definitely outweigh the negatives.","Manitoba, Canada",88,4.0

The rooms are big and the kitchenette was fully equipped.However, we experienced some unexpected ""unpleasantness"" with the hotel.First, there was no porter. After traveling on a plane for 18 hours, we were exhausted (especially since we have a toddler with us). It was a shock to see that there was no one to help us with the luggages. My poor husband who has a slipped disc had to carry all 6 luggages to the lobby, put them in a cart, then bring them up to our room. Then he has to bring back the cart to the lobby. I've had my share of 2 to 3 star hotels, but this is the first time I experienced this. No one among the staff offered to help my husband.Second, there are no designated non-smoking rooms. What they have are ""smoke-cleared"" rooms. I specifically mentioned in my booking that I have asthma and to please make sure that the room that was assigned to us doesn't smell of smoke. The room that was given to us smelled like an ashtray. Of course I complained to the front desk and to be fair, they were accommodating and transferred us to a nicer smelling room. But we had to wait for like an hour in the old room since they were still prepping up the new room.Third, the stairway smells of urine. We used the stairs to go one floor up to my brother's room and it stank of urine.

Later on ( long after check out ) they apologized for something the computer did that put those calls from a year ago onto my room. I suggested to them that in the future they should slip the statement under the door the night before check out so guests have a chance to review rather than being caught by surprise at check out while a taxi is waiting.Overall, I am happy with this hotel and will go back again, but will pay attention to the A/C unit at check-in and take time before check-out to go over the statement.

Our family of three stayed at the Ilima for 7 nights in August, 2005. The final cost including Taxes was less than $1000.00 (AAA discount). We had a spacious condo-style unit on the 16th floor. There were two large beds, a round dining table with four chairs, a fully equiped kitchen, full sized refrigerator, good closet and drawer space, and a beautiful view. Be sure to request a high floor facing the Ala Wai canal. Our room was quiet and private. The whole end of the room is glass windows with a very large sliding glass door that opens onto the Lanai. We slept every night with the door and slider open and rose with the Sun. There is air conditioning and heavy black-out drapes if you prefer.There is alot of floor space--easily 7 or 8 feet between the foot of the bed ane the dresser. Other reviewers have critisized the Ilima of being sparsly decorated, having bugs and snotty staff. We found none of this to be true. The room was fine, I saw two bugs (both dead) in the stairwell. The staff was very helpful and friendly.FREE PARKING! We rented a Jeep for the week (less than $300), There was only one evening that I could not find a space in the garage. Within about 15 minutes I found an on-street space on the Ala Wai. I could the jeep from our lanai. Hint: if you are renting a car, get a small one--all the spaces on the whole island are small. We had the best time there, Although the purpose for the visit was for my Father's memorial service. I had family come in from Maui, Molokai and Kauai--and several of them stayed at the Ilima also. The Ilima is well known to the locals as having a good location, clean rooms and is (relatively) chaep.There is a small pool--possibly the smallest pool I have ever seen. My 10-year-old son swam in it briefly. There is an out door shower we used several times. The lobby is small, but very nicely appointed with a lot of hawaiian Koa wood. The lobby has several couches/chairs. many daily newspapers that you can read there. The staff will provide you with clean beach towels and loaner beach mats. There are two elevators--very fast, no long waits. There is a luandry room on the 2nd or 3rd floor.Waikiki beach is a short 5-10 min walk. If you walk directly toward the beach, you will come out near the Royal Hawaiian Hotel(this is the BIg Pink hotel you see in advertisments--one of the original hotels). Nearby is ""Duke's"" (Kohanmoku)-- good food and drinks with live entertainment.If you need groceries, There are several choices. If you take a right out of the lobby on Nohonani Street there is a small market almost next door--but they are not open early or late. Going the same direction (towards the beach), about a block up you'll find a 7-11 store and an ABC store(similar to 7-11). These are both on Kuhio street near Nohonani. About 2 blocks down Kuhio (to the left, Diamond Head direction)you will find a full-fledged grocery store.There are pleny of restaurants in Waikiki to fit every budget. There is more shopping than you can imagine: very high-end clothing/jewelry/art boutiqes on Kalakaua Ave to souvineer kiosks in the International Marketplace (which I hear will be demolished soon to make way for bigger development).There is plenty to keep you busy on the Island. We went Catamaran sailing right off Waikiki Beach. you can rent surfboards and get surfing lessons there also. If you rent a car, the Island is yours. Hike to the top of Diamond head. Drive to the other side of the island. there are great beaches everywhere. On the windward side go to Kaneohe, Kailua and Lanikai. Get the best Teriaki Steak in the world at Buzz's Lanikai (sit at Bill Clintons table). Check out Sealife Park. Drive over the Nuuani Pali and stop at the look out for a great view of the windward side. Go snorkeling at Hanauma Bay--get there early, the parking fills up quickly--and make sure they are open the day you want to go, they may close a few days /week for environmental reasons. Drive to the North Shore and check out Sunset Beach--see surfers on the monster waves in the winter. See Waimea Falls. Try the grilled shrimp at the Grass Skirt Cafe in Hale'eva (I think).While you are out that way visit the Polynesian Cultural Center and the Mormaon Temple and the Macadamia Nut farm.Enjoy!","Albany, NY",28,5.0

Perfect location, perfect view, perfect everything! The staff was excellent - ALWAYS had a smile on their face, no matter what time of day or night it was. Our room was quiet, clean and large.

As everyone has mentioned, it is a great value one block away from the International Market and close to the beaches, restaurants and stores. This is a quiet building with a very accomodating staff, free parking and a small (but enjoyable) pool. We used the sundeck on the 10th floor a few times because the pool area was shady and our lanai was huge with a wonderful view. Our two-bedroom was old with faded carpet, wallpaper & paint. It had seen better days and the upholstery was pretty threadbare. Even though bugs don't bother me in the least, I must admit I was a bit unerved when I saw a couple of cockroaches crawl behind the desk, so be warned. If you want a two bedroom, make sure that you ask for the room that isn't wheelchair accessible - the shower is a ""pull in"" shower and when you turn the water on, it tends to flow all over the bathroom - yuck. The hotel was very accomodating when we asked to change rooms and we moved into a gorgeous 1 bedroom with a pull-out couch on the 10th floor with in-room internet access and two tv's - one in the bedroom and 1 in the livingroom. A lovely Jacuzzi bathtub and high-end stereo system in the livingroom was such a delightful surprise!

The hotel was very comfortable, quiet (even during Christmas and New Year's) and a very friendly staff. My husband, 11 year old son and I stayed in a deluxe studio on the 15th floor. The room was very spacious with a king size bed and a full size. The kitchen was small, but adequate for a quick breakfast and soft drinks. The air conditioner worked great. It did not cycle on and off which is great. The maid was always early and never forgot to leave us what we needed. There was ample storage space. The balcony overlooking the canal and mountains was very nice. We parked every night in the free lot. Only once was it full and Jade a front desk clerk moved a sign so we could park for free. A small car definitely is better because the parking spots are small all over Waikiki. The Ilima is located right in the middle of Waikiki a few easy blocks from the beach. We were able to walk to many dinner destinations easily. The International Marketplace is just a hop away. If you want a quiet, comfortable reasonably priced place to stay the Ilima is great.

The rooms are older/dated, but our room and my girlfriend's parents' room were very clean. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. They gave us directions and maps every day. Waikiki Beach is about 3 blocks away. Ask at the front desk for towels and straw mats (no charge) to take to the beach. I think that we paid $101 for the parents' room on the 5th floor. They had the same view that we did, but a little bit obstructed by the neighboring buildings. Our room was $110/night (prices listed are before taxes). The Ilima has free parking. The other hotels we were considering charged from $15 to $20/day. The buses that take people to the docking area for the dinner cruises has a pick up point at the Trade Center just a block away, very convenient! If you don't bring your own computer, you will have to use an internet cafe to check your email, etc. There is one around the block next to the Mexican restaurant, La Cucharacha. The pool is very small, but we had no interest in using a swimming pool, regardless of size.My biggest complaint was the bathroom light switch. The noisy bathroom fan is connected to the light switch. I hate it when there is not a separate switch for the fan. Also room cooling is from an in the wall a/c unit.

I arrived at the hotel around 5pm (yes, 5pm!) and my room was not ready!! Now, I had a long flight and was very tired, but I was still ready to forgive this as I am sure it happens to every hotel. However, instead of a simple apology, the front desk person was VERY rude and said that if I didn't like the 30 minute wait for my room I could cancel my reservation without penalty!! How dare they! Finally, I was able to check into my room thinking the worst of this experience was behind me. How wrong was I? As soon as I entered my room, my jaw dropped! Bed: unmade from last guest. Bathroom: dirtier than a pig sty! Scent of the room you say? An overpowering presence of garbage with a hint of BO! This was the room I had waited for 30 minutes to be cleaned? I promptly returned to the front desk and, politely mind you, asked if that was the correct room as I was sure it was a mistake. Yes was the answer I recieved, again without apology. I was to wait in the lobby another 30 minutes while my room was remade as there were no other rooms to move me to. I wasn't asking for compensation or anything like that. However, not once did anyone, including the manager on duty offer any sort of explanation or apology. How was the rest of my stay? More of the same. Maid service, if even received, was not until around 4pm or sometimes even 5pm. Front desk does not pick up their phone after 8pm. My wake up calls (requested nightly) were never made. However, there are a few pros about this hotel. 1. The location is ok (but EVERY hotel in waikiki is at a good location, so it didn't matter). 2. Check time was very speedy (under 5 minutes). Overall, if the rooms would have been clean I would not have had a problem. The quality was nothing to be desired (rooms looked old and run down), but that did not bother me as long as the rooms were clean (For the price, I didnt expect Sheraton-quality rooms). They were not clean. If this was a clean hotel, maybe my stay would have been more enjoyable. This hotel was a joke. My suggestion? A new staff and a thorough scrubbing.","Chicago, Ill",18,1.0

As others here have, I requested a ""deluxe mountain view studio"" at $110/nite, the internet special. Pluses: The room was just huge (!) and had a lot of breathing room and a great kitchenette, sizeable lanai. The view on the 14th floor (I requested the corner also, from another reviewer's suggestion) was gorgeous and just wonderful to wake up to every morning. Not too noisy. Looking out onto the mountains and the golf course, no other buildings in the way. (see the pic someone posted, except even less obsructed). Our wedding party friends stayed at the Ohana West a building over and I am so glad we did not - their room was TINY! They had to pay around a dollar for every local call(ouch they add up after a week) wheareas they are free at the Ilima. - My husband had to work for a few hours in the mornings and the high speed internet was a BIG deciding factor, so that he did not have to go to an internet cafe at 3:30 am or down to a lobby. It worked perfectly. I was holding my breath on that one.- The location is great FANTASTIC for the price - as others say it's only a 7 or so minute walk and a fun walk to the beach. Goes by very quickly thru the Marketplace. Minuses: The pool is ridiculous, I didn't even bother. It never had sun on it when I went by because it is shaded by buildings. That was the biggest drawback but not enough to not stay again, I prefer the beach anyhow. Would have been nice though to have that alternative. No hottub either.- There was construction in the lobby the week we were there which slowed the elavators a couple of days, frustrating at times.- The hotel is older and needs some new paint and spackle etc. but I don't care as long as it is clean which it was. No bugs.- The fitness room is a very old treadmill and bike in a room with a tv and a nasty sauna off to one side. However I DID use it 4 days so it wasn't that bad! Better than paying TWENTY DOLLARS to use the fancy 24 Hour Fitness private gym for an hour(insane). The fitness room was another deciding factor, I have to get a quick morning cardio session in. The Ohana West did not have one. So it's not technically a minus...- There is no restraunt or room service, but we got a groceries at the Food Pantry a block away. Do not buy anything at the adjacent little store it is so expensive. Next time I will bring my soft collapsible cooler from home to take to the beach. La Cucharacas Mexican just down the street about two minutes is great by the way. **I highly recommend this hotel for people not looking for luxury, but big rooms, great location, cleanliness, value. We had a really good feeling staying there and plan to go again next year. I stayed at the Pacific Beach 3 years ago right across from the beach and the extra money, all the extra charges, was not worth it at all. Check out the Ilima!

There are many restuarants, ranging from cheaps eats to expensive within easy walking distance, as are the shops and beaches that make Waikiki famous. We looked at hiring a car but $2 per person on the trolley bus (catch it at the bus stop in front of the statue of The Duke on the main road - that's the Hawaiian surfer, not John Wayne) gets you the huge Ala Moana shopping centre 10 minutes away. The front office staff were very helpful with ideas for day trips, local entertainment and so on.We'd cheerfully return to the Ilima for an extended stay - great value for money, close to the action, friendly staff, clean and spacious - but yes, as mentioned on a previous post, beware if you have little ones, the balcony railings are quite wide.Incidentally, after checking out the reviews and internet rates on the Tripadvisor site prior to the trip, we rang the hotel and actually got a better rate (US$175 per night, including taxes) so that may be worth trying, plus one can detail specific requests ; wheelchair access etc.",Western Australia,34,5.0

The staff is definitely the Ilima's gem. They were so friendly, gracious and helpful. We incidentally left a suitcase and they tracked us down in Kona on the next leg of our trip and arranged for a Fed Ex pick up and delivery! Above and beyond the call of duty!! The free parking is defnitely a value added perk! It's nice to have such easy access in and out of the hotel.The hotel rooms are very simply decorated and could use some updating. My only concern was the balcony railings. The spindles were spaced far enough apart it was a grave concern for me so we did not let our two year old daughter out there at all!

Loved the way it has a microwave and sets of cutlery & plates/cups for 4 people. They also provide a small dishwashing detergent bottle (though strangely no washing sponge). I bought a cheap disposal sponge for $1.50 from the Foodland store 2 blocks east. Foodland also sells a wider variety of food & groceries at prices less than the ABC stores (very handy!). I put my large fridge to good use keeping many drinks and veges cool. The pool is small but ok for kids. The fitness centre... well lets just say you're better off joining the joggers along the river (Ala Moana Blvd). I found the outdoor tanning deck on the 10th floor a great place to relax & escape the crowds at Waikiki beach. I've posted a pic of the view from my 10th floor balcony (a deluxe studio). Balcony was nice to have breakfast on! Ilima also lend beachmats and towels. When booking, check Ilima's website for great deals... I got my deluxe studio over a weekend of the summer school holidays for $124.50 per nite! Try scoring any self contained room for that price in downtown Waikiki! The deluxe also has a plug for free high speed internet... so bring your laptop.

I paid $110 a night (internet special on the hotel's own website, which was still running the date of this review) for the deluxe studio in room 1107, which had a nice view of the mountains and golf course (there are no beach view rooms at the Ilima). However, it is certainly not a luxury resort. If you want the resort experience, skip the Ilima and spend the extra money. Even better, stay on another Island, like Kuai or Maui. If, on the other hand, you plan on being busy hiking, shopping, fine dining, and touring the island, I definitely recommend saving the money for your activities and staying at the Ilima. It's centrally located (lots of resaurants, bars, and clubs nearby), has VERY spacious, clean rooms with lots of storage space, and offers free parking. We heard that the lot fills up at night, but we came back to the hotel between 6:00 and 8:00 every night and had no problem getting a space. I stayed for 8 days with my boyfriend, and it was really nice to have the space (530 square feet) to unpack everything, and to comfortably lounge around the room when we were feeling lazy.Even though we didn't cook anything, having the kitchen was great for stocking beverages and reheating leftovers.The pool definitely sucks, and the gym is a joke, but I wasn't planning on spending any time at them anyway.

The restaurants around this area are truly fabulous. The staff at the Ilima were very nice and helpful and there is even a concierge there if you need one. The Ilima was a true bargain and I would recommend this to anyone not wanting to spend $300 for the same type of room elsewhere in the city. We had a car there but transportation is easy to get around on. We were told there might be a lack of parking spaces at the Ilima but we got a space in front of the office every night.

There is daily maid service.The free phone (local and 1-800 calls) and access to phone books was handy, as was the free daily newspaper.Although we were right alongside the elevator, the room is well soundproofed, so we heard little noise from the elevator or its lobby.The air conditioning worked well and quietly. We kept it running on low, 24 hours. It was not a bother at night, and we heard no street noise... only the odd ambulance siren.Good Tip... use small pieces of duct tape to seal the heavy lightproof curtains together each night. The sun rises before 6am, and the tape keeps out the narrow, bright sunbeams that can otherwise shine in through the gaps and wake a sleeper too early!The hotel has a sundeck on the roof (16th floor) and on the 10th. These provide for sunbathing anytime you like. There are lounger chairs.The pool was our big disappointment. It is small, and located behind the hotel on the ground floor. It has little deck around it, and is in shade much of the day. The high buildings around it create a wind-tunnel effect, so without sun it is quite cold and unpleasant.There are lots of good eating places close by, and of these we most enjoyed the newish Legend Chinese Restaurant just up the street on Kuhio. Reasonable price and very good food.The beach is only about three blocks away but when we were there that part (in front of Royal Hawaiian etc) was very crowded.

The room has pots, pans, dishes, dish soap, and utensils, so we were able to do a quick breakfast very easily. You can also go to the seaside grill in the morning and get pancakes and eggs as a take out for only $2.99. The hotel provided towels and beach mats at the desk daily. We rented an intermediate size car and were able to always find a parking spot.I would suggest a lite foldup stroller with a strap so you can carry it on the beach over your shoulder. Also pack a fold up beach ummbrella as they cost $30 at the stores or you can rent one in front of the hotels for $15 a day. The Ilima hotel pool is very nice. It is extremely windy so take the kids in the afternoon to the pool. The elevators are very fast. Also the carpets are very clean in the room so little babies stay clean. The guard railings appear safe and sturdy but I never let my kids near them. We got a better rate using our AAA discount and paying the extra $10 per kid per day. It was roughly $155 per day which included all the taxes and misc fees. They also have room safes bolted into the floor of your room which was very helpful as Waikiki has there share of beach comer pick pockets.To get to the beach walk down the street throught the International Market Place, then across the street through Dukes Restaurant located inside the Hotel.

On the side, the other hotels will lure you with their work out facilities and pool (which are both small at the Ilima) but as for myself, I came to the Ilima for a place to sleep in a resort to vacation- not work out or swim in a pool. If I want to swim or work out, there's a rather large ocean in which to snorkle, swim, surf, kayak, etc. The two of us originally planned to stay only 7 days, but found that we had the money to stay 5 days longer- because of the Ilima's Best Price in the Top 10. Look at the bottom line: $1,320 for 12 days at the Ilima vs. $2,976-$4,980 average for the same hours of sleep at the others!

(To actually stay in a hotel ON the beach would have cost even more.)I chose the Ilima and it was an excellent choice.Based upon advice from the hotel which I received in response to an e-mail inquiry, I also requested a room with a ""mountain view"" rather than facing the ocean, which is hardly visible from the hotel. They call it the ""city roof"" view rather than ocean view.Others have written about the convenient location, near restaurants, a food store, etc., but few have mentioned being near a free shuttle pick up point for Hilo Hatties. The reason that this is significant is that the free shuttle also gives you the option of drop off at the Aloha Tower market and the Ala Moana shopping center. The Aloha Tower location is, in effect, downtown Honolulu - near Chinatown and other attractions. Ala Moana shopping center is kind of mid-way between downtown and Waikiki beach.In addition, the Waikiki shuttle and the city bus are also frequent and inexpensive. I rented a car for my (pre-cruise) three days in Honolulu, but hardly used it once I learned of the convenience of the shuttles and buses. We did make a brief trip to the Pali overlook and other points on the island, but if making the trip again I would not rent a car. Rather, I would spend the money on a packaged tour to the other parts of the island. We met a Canadian couple in the hotel who were doing precisely that and using the shuttles and buses for other movement in the city.By going to the Ilima web site I found an Internet special which was a savings over AAA or other special rates. I did chose to spend a little more money for a room higher in the hotel, for the view. The Canadian couple we met were in an identical room at a lower (no view) level which cost them considerably less money. I intend to include a photo of the view from our balcony with this review.Parking is very tight in the hotel. I rented a ""full size"" Buick and found myself wishing I had rented a compact whenever I parked. Parking is free and there are about 35 spots. Paid parking is available across the street, but I never had to use it - even when Waikiki was jammed with people on the ""Spam Day"" celebration. I may have a Spam Day photo to post as well.It is a short one-block walk from the hotel to the back side of the International Market Place. The Market Place is a long block deep and when you get to the front side you merely cross the street and go down a walkway beside the Royal Hawaiian Hotel to find yourself on the beach. You can use the beach. By law, all beaches in Hawaii are public. The Ilima provides free beach mats and beach towels for guests going to the beach.The Ilima has small but adequate kitchenettes. We used ours primarily for cold cereal breakfasts and coffee and ate out the rest of the time. The kitchenette does not have a dishwasher.For me the very firm beds were excellent. I'm sure that some people will find them too firm, but I got a good nights sleep every night. Aside from the occasional emergency vehicle siren or loud motorcycle on the street beside the canal behind the hotel, I heard no city noises which would have kept me from sleeping.The exercise room has only a treadmill and exercise bike in a very small space. The swimming pool is too small to really swim in. As I said in the title of this review, the Ilima hotel was perfect for my needs, which were comfort, convenience and economy.If returning to Waikiki, I would certainly stay there again.","Tampa, Florida",373,5.0

This is not one of those pretentious, expensive hotels right on the beach—it is just a comfortable, clean, friendly and quiet hotel that is within easy walking distance to all that Waikiki has to offer. We opted for the 1 bedroom unit, which included a living room with pull out queen sofa bed, a full kitchen, a bathroom with Jacuzzi tub, and a good sized bedroom with a king bed. The room we stayed in (508) faced away from the street, so it was surprisingly quiet. We also ran the two air conditioners in the unit pretty much constantly, which drowned out any noise. From the lanai, we could look to the right toward the beach (but note that there is no view of the water from any of the rooms. However, you can go up to the hotel roof and see a little ocean) or to the left at the Ala Wai Canal and the mountains.As far as location, the Ilima’s is excellent! The hotel is just off busy Kuhio Avenue and immediately adjacent to Duke’s Lane and the International Market Place. Walk down Duke’s Lane, cross Kalakaua Avenue, jog a little to the left, and there you are at the public beach access to world-famous Waikiki Beach (about a 5 minute walk). You are also a short walk away from numerous shopping centers, the beautiful Kuhio Park, and other well known hotels such as the Outrigger Waikiki, Royal Hawaiian, Sheraton Waikiki, and Halekulani.There is a medium-sized grocery store 2 blocks away on Kuhio Ave (Foodland), a pharmacy about 1 block away, and numerous restaurants and fast food places in every direction. One word of advice: bring traveler’s checks or cash with you. A surprising number of places are reluctant to take credit cards, and virtually no one takes debit cards (i.e., no option to get cash back). Consequently, we made many trips to the ATM for cash, and got slammed with fees every time!My only two complaints about the Ilima are the king bed and the parking. Although the king mattress was a Serta Perfect Sleeper, it was very hard and uncomfortable. I generally like firm mattresses, but this one did not give at all and resulted in some pretty significant hip pain for me off and on during our stay. Perhaps the mattresses in other rooms are better, though. And despite what other reviewers said, we did have trouble finding parking a few times and parking spots are really tight.

When the air conditioning unit in our room quit working it was promptly replaced with a brand new one. It was great having a full kitchen, although we didn't use the stove. The shelf for toiletries in the bathroom is small, but there is a closet with shelves just outside the bathroom door to keep larger things in. The parking garage is tight, but we never had a problem. What a bonus - there aren't many places in Honolulu where parking is free. Our only complaint (minor) is that the small heated pool was too warm! All in all, a wonderful place to stay! We highly recommend it and would return to the Ilima in a heartbeat.",Michigan,43,5.0

We had a studio deluxe unit facing Waikiki. The view was of surrounding buildings and streets. We could see the ocean between the buildings. The lanai was pretty large, with enough room for two chairs and a small table. But ours faced the ocean, so it got really hot in the afternoon. Our room was very clean and the maid service was great. The location can't be beat. It's a short walk to the beach, and there are lots of great restaurants nearby. Even the big park is close enough to walk to.Our room featured the typical rattan/tropical decor and everything was in good condition. The kitchen includes a toaster, tiny coffee maker, microwave, dishes for 4, a few pots and pans, some utensils. We took our own wine opener, but I think there was one in the room. We also took coffee filters and a few zip-lock sandwich bags so we wouldn't have to purchase them. We didn't use the stove at all, but I assume it worked fine. The fridge was spotless and had full ice cube trays and a full pitcher of cold water when we arrived. The fridge worked OK, but leaked water periodically (I guess when the freezer defrosts), which ran down the inside of the back of the fridge, under the crisper drawer, and eventually leaked out onto the floor. I just put a folded dish cloth inside the door to catch the water. I'm sure if I had told them about it they would have fixed it.The room also had a small desk, a large dresser, nightstands, clock radio, and two large closets. They provide a laundry basket too, so you can carry your laundry to the coin-op machines on the third floor. The bathroom had a bathtub/shower combo, tile floor, hairdryer, and a metal shelf above the sink and toilet for toiletries. The shelf was just barely big enough for our stuff (make sure you keep the toilet lid down in case your things slide off the shelf!).Because the Ilima is in a city environment, there is a lot of noise. We didn't sleep well the first night because of people shouting on the street, sirens, and garbage pick-up at dawn. I'm a very light sleeper, so I also heard the elevator beeping, as it was right outside our door. The rest of our stay we left the air conditioner on the fan setting all night to drown out the noise. It worked great, and I slept better at the Ilima than I have in any other hotel. The bed was very comfortable (one king and one full size in our studio), and they provide extra pillows and blankets. There was absolutely no noise from other rooms, except for the occasional door slamming. We rented a car so we could explore the island, but you don't really need one. If you do rent a car, get a small compact, as the parking garage is very tight. Even though the hotel was completely full during our stay, we always found a parking space. But we never came back late at night either because we always walked to dinner. I suppose you may have to park across the street if you come back late.We paid a AAA rate of $123 for our studio deluxe room on the 12th floor. Considering that includes Internet access, a daily local newspaper, local phone calls, parking, and a great location, the Ilima Hotel is an excellent value. I would definitely stay there again.",Washington,29,4.0

We paid about 140.00/nt (internet rate from Ilima website)for the large bedroom, living room and kitchen (plus a jacuzzi bathtub). The room had free internet access as well. I would rather save the 100.00+++ a night more it would have cost to stay in a beachfront hotel room and have a little walk to the beach.

Compared to the Hyatt - it is only minimal and average, so if you have $300 a night to blow go to the Hyatt or Marriott. If you are looking for a great bargin and a nice place to stay, this is the hotel for you. The hotel does not offer much as far as extras - but their friendly helpful attitude and clean, large spacious rooms are great. They have a pool, though it is very small, but when in Waikiki who wants to swim in a pool? Our room was 909, a corner overlooking the mountains and canal and was super. We had our own fridge, oven, mircrowave, coffee pot and basic kitchen dishes and such. We used these a few times and found the fridge especially handy for water and drinks. The room was cleaned daily and I didn't think twice about sleeping in the bed or using the bathroom (and I can be kind of picky). The carpet could have used a cleaning (not too bad though, I still didn't mind walking arouind in bare feet) and the furniture and decor was a bit dated. For the price though it was a bargin. We used their internet special and paid only $95 per night, and our 5th night was free! Try and beat that in Waikiki, even higher rated hotels that cost more can't compare to the quality for the price paid.We found the location very good with many things close. It is off the main strip so it was quiet (a big complaint for many other hotels in the area) and we were not disturbed by traffic or other noise. It is still centrally located enough though that we could walk to everything. The Int'l Market Place is only a block away and the beach is just past that. We could walk to either end of the strip and not be wore out by the time we got there.They also are great about accomidating you for late departures/early arrivals. We were not flying out until 9pm, so they held our luggage for us (securely) and we had the whole day to shop, eat lunch and everything before we left.I would stay here again in a minute and recommend it to all the cost minded people out there that realize $300 a night is crazy for a place you only spend your time sleeping in.","Michigan, USA",46,4.0

Walked-in without reservations but had done research and knew the Ilima had received rave reviews. Front desk person was extremely nice and let us preview the rooms before we committed. The hotel was only about 3/4 full this time of the year. We were happy with what we saw, and booked a corner studio unit on the 11th flr with a great view of the mountains, Ala Wai Canal and golfcourse for a great AAA rate of $105. All the studios face the mountain side; the 1 and 2-bdrm units have a more ""city"" view. The unit was indeed comfortable and very spacious with a kitchenette (full fridge, electric stove, sink, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, utensils and dishware/cutlery), king bed, full bed and a very spacious lanai. The bathroom was basic, but modern and clean. The hotel is on a quiet street, only about 2-3 blocks from Waikiki beach. The free parking is a real rarity in Waikiki, and a great deal. It is however, ""limited"" so there's no guarantee, especially if they're full and in high season...in which case you might have to pay $10 for parking across the street. However, throughout our stay, we never had a problem and always found a space. The Iliima also offers free local calls and free high-speed internet access.The bed was comfortable and everything was in good working order. We were very pleased overall with the value for our money and we would not only recommend this hotel, but stay again. However, a few minor things I'd like to point out, although these should not be construed as criticisms. Firstly, the pool is small and there's no workout facility if this is important to you. Secondly, the hotel is condominium-like so while there is daily maid service, don't expect room service or anything fancy. They clean daily and leave a paper at your door. Anything further, you shouldn't expect. There is a full-service tour desk in the lobby. The front desk staff is very friendly but unobtrusive. We rarely ran into other guests during our stay, and heard nothing from neighboring units, which, if like us you value your privacy and freedom, is great! Their laundry facility is really convenient (they have 4 coin-operated washers/dryers, all very reasonable) and it was almost always empty. They also offer free beach towels and bamboo mats in the lobby. A few very minor comments, and by mention I don't intend that they should be taken as deterrants if you're considering a stay. It would be nice if they could provided more, and bigger and thicker bath towels. The ones we got (2) were lower-end motel quality. It would be great if they provided free daily coffee packets. We got one ""complimentary"" pack on our first day, then had to go out and buy coffee filters and ground coffee for the rest of our stay. A small thing, but not insignificant. We were provided dishwashing liquid, but no sponge to do our dishwashing. A corkscrew would've been nice. We ended up having to make-shift wrestle with a can opener to even pry open a bottle of beer. Again, small gestures, but just something we would've appreciated having. The shower pressure was decent, but the shower head sprayed all over in a fine mist. They should consider purchasing better showerheads. I think this is important to guests that have to shower there everyday for numerous days. Also, there's insufficient counterspace for toiletries in the bathroom (a narrow strip of stainless steel over the sink).Lastly, while many on this site have raved about housekeeping, I'm sorry to say that I only personally observed an adequate level of service on this point. We found that on multiple days in a row, housekeeping did not perform anything but basic restocking in our room. We noticed that bathroom mirrors and counters/sinks were very obviously not cleaned nor wiped down, despite having left generous tips to housekeeping. I was a bit disappointed since we stayed at the Ilima duiring ""International Housekeeping Week"" where they were supposedly going the extra mile. I'm not a picky traveler, but there are basic services to expect. While adequate, I cannot agree that housekeeping cleaned to a very high standard. Aside from this, our overall experience at the Ilima was extremely good, and I would have no qualms about recommending it to the next value-minded traveler. The Iliima offers unbeatable honest great value compared to other moderate hotels in Waikiki. Even if they didn't fix any of the things I mentioned, I would still stay there again.",San Francisco Bay Area,134,4.0

We were on the 10th floor in room 1006 and had a window facing the mountains and the Ali Wai Canal in the living area. The balconey was roomy enough for a table and two chairs. The view forward did face another hotel, one that was only 2 floors and made the view look very open, and 1 that was the same height, but it was turned parallel so once again the view seemed open. From the side of the balconey we again faced the mountains and canal. We watched the long canoes, and birds would actually lite on the rail. We found the one bedroom suite to be roomy and nice, and clean! It is obviously not brand new, the furniture showed a little wear, and the kitchen is informally stocked, but we had everything we needed. We did have a problem with the air conditioner but the staff was very attentive, and came even at night. They have a book collection where you can check out books about Hawaii. We found the pool to be well maintained, and large enough to enjoy the few times we needed to use it. The tour desk is staffed with a very nice gentleman who is glad to help you with information and reservations. The people from the front desk, and especially the household and maintenance staff were so kind, they all wanted our stay to be a pleasant experience. The free parking was great. We were there 14 nights and only had to park across the street and pay twice. The hotel was totally full, and we were usually back late, so I thought we were lucky. They don't guarantee free parking because it is limited, but what a nice plus. The location was excellent. Just a block or two from Kuhio where there was plenty of night life, if that's what you want, but back enough to be quiet. The neighborhood was peaceful, if you went to Kuhio there were a few shady clubs, but they were mixed in with all the nice shops, and we never felt unsafe in any way, even late at night. The walk to the beach is great. I checked out the Hilton Hawaiian, the Sheraton Mona Surfrider, and most of the other hotels on the beach. The Hilton was nice, but way too crowded and busy for me, all of the hotels on the beach were, remember they still face the street. We had 2 televisions, 3 phones and a stereo system, if you have time for them. There was very little wait for the elevators. The laundry room was nice and usually available immediately. There were 4 washers and 4 dryers. It was in a good location to go out to the North Shore, Polynesian Cultural Center (use the tour desk and a bus), other beaches, everywhere. I can't say enough good things about the Ilima, and very few negative things. We will defintely stay at the Ilima again, and look forward to the next time.","Beckville, TX",18,4.0

The high speed internet did work well, but bring an ethernet cable or adapter because there is only a jack to plug in to. The rooms are quaint, clean and spacious. The hotel is very quiet in terms of people traffic and the staff are very friendly. The cleaning staff are honest and hard-working. The pool is small -- but if you go to Hawaii, why do you need a pool - stay in your back yard. The air conditioners work very well, and they do cover the noise from the street which is significant.

It was quiet and we slept with the windows open every night. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They also have beach mats and towels you can take to the beach. I don't know of another hotel in Waikiki offering free parking and free local calls. ,"Roseville, CA",9,5.0

We stayed in a Studio Unit. Biggest complaint is that we requested a mountian view room, they took that request, then we got there we got a city/roof view. We questioned them, but they never made good on our initial request, though they said it was noted. They just told us to check each day. After two times asking, we gave up. I plan to send in a complaint to them. They do have free parking, which is rare in Honolulu, but it is limited. We always had a spot to park, but one time it came very close....only one left, right at the office area. They said when parking is full, the option was to park in the garage across the street at a discount rate of $8 per day. They didn't offer this info, we had to ask. It is still better than what other hotels offer.Each unit is equipped with kitchens and lanais. It is against the Ala Wai canal and close walking distance to all necessities. It is a block from the International Marketplace (a good place to bargain & shop), and a couple more blocks beyond to the beaches and other resort areas.",Northern California,26,4.0

First of all let me say that if you want a flash hotel with a fancy pool and bars then don't stay at the Ilima- but if you want a nice quiet hotel with very large rooms, clean bathrooms and helpful friendly staff then this hotel is just great!. We really enjoyed being off the main street and away from all the traffic noise and yet we were right opposite Duke's Lane and the International Market-shoppers heaven!!!! This meant that if we didn't feel like cooking in the kitchenette we could eat very cheaply right across the road. The staff were always more than helpful and when we went on a side trip and didn't want to take all our luggage they happily stored our bags for four days at no extra cost. Our room was cleaned every day to a very high standard and we had a magnificent view across the canal to the valley. The only down side was that the pool was really small in a cramped courtyard but everything else made up for that. I would definitely stay there again.",Perth WA,15,4.0

Our first 5 days were at the Ilima Hotel. We found the hotel not only reasonably priced, but also very clean and roomy. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We found the beach mats, beach towels and even umbrellas were provided to us when needed. The free parking was also a bonus. It is very conveniently located to everything in Waikiki and we could walk everywhere in the area. It is a hotel I would return to in the future.","Toronto, Ontario",10,5.0
