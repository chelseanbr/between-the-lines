The rooms were super clean as well as the bathroom. I have to say that the sink could a longer faucet because it was hard to wash our hands. Our room had a nice balcony were we could rest and our room offered a kitchen and a fridge really convenient in case you want to cook and also just to mingle a bit together. It has a small swimming pool which is convenient if you do not want to go to the really close Waikiki beach. But if you prefer to go to the beach it is less than 2 minutes walking. Staff at the hotel were really nice and helpful too. Besides being super close to the beach is near many Waikiki attractions as well as a shopping area. I believe for the prices they offer if you only need a place to sleep this is the prefect place.,"Norman, Oklahoma",13,5.0

You could see it from the street, in the hallways, etc. I find it dirty (not in a sense of not cleaning it up, but just very old, who knows how old are the stains on the spring boxes). The building sits at the very busy Kuhio avenue and it is low-rise, so you can hear all the noise, so if you have a weak sleep - you will have a bad time. There is a eat-out/in place downstairs as well as convenience store (with alcohol). Apart from street noise, this area is known for homeless people, so you could hear screams outside. Also, there is notice on the wall - do not leave valuables in room, safety box at front desk. Security seems to be an issue. Advertised as a non-smoking hotel, but cigarette butt almost hit my head while it was dropped from the hotel balcony. This is a walk-up building, easily accessible from street, particularly during daytime. Some positives - there is a daily housekeeping for making up beds, refreshing towels. Our unit had a fridge, stove, hot plate, toaster, microwave and coffee maker and some utensils, pots, glasses. It is also in the hearth of Waikiki, 5 minutes from the beach, with plenty shops and restaurants within walking distance. Front desk borrows beach towels and staff is friendly. Based on other visitors I could see in this hotel it seems that some (senior) like to return. A/C in room worked. But paying almost $200/night (with taxes) for 3 people (high season) for a very run-down hotel, it is not worth staying. I feel sorry not only for guests but also for housekeepers and the staff working in here, who really tried to keep it running.","Cambridge, Massachusetts",38,2.0

This is an older hotel that could use some upgrades and there are no frills. We had a basic room with a small kitchenette stocked with dishes, pots, pans, silverware, cleaning supplies and a small (full) size refridgerator. The room was decent size for 2 adults, a family of 4 may need more space. The bed was ok, bedding was clean. The bathroom was basic sink, toilet and tub. Overall, the place is clean, no bugs of any kind were spotted. However, the cleaning staff had overlooked dusting some areas for awhile. Our room was on the ground floor near the pool, but we heard very little noise. The pool is very small and in need of some maintenance, but clean and functional, and Waikiki Beach is only 1 block away!! WiFi is only available in the lobby/reception area. A designated unsheltered smoking area is located about 25 ft. from the side entrance along the street. As there is no smoking in all of Hawaii you're at the mercy of what area is available. We don't smoke, but even we thought it was inconvenient. The front desk staff was very nice. Beach accessories are available to the quests at no charge; chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards even a surf board! A public parking garage is across the street for a fee ($30/day).

If you want to learn to Surf, then at the beach turn right and walk a few yards down and ask for Dave. This man does cheaper surf lessons than the ones next to him and a real good teacher. So room was clean but smelt a bit musky or damp, we sprayed some perfume around to make it better. Staff seem friendly and helpful.They phoned taxi for us to airport, Cost is around $30 -$40 each way, dependant on traffic.

We understood it was a lower end hotel. But, upon arriving, it was much worse. First, the room had rust colored mold along the electrical wiring covers (see photos). Second, the locks on the door were a issue. We were handed a physical brass key and the room had three locks on the inside. We had a chain lock, a door knob lock, and a door stopper that we felt the need to secure on the backside. There was two signs in our room, one near the door and one above the bathroom that read ""DO NOT LEAVE ANY VALUABLES IN ROOM SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES AT FRONT DESK"". Which is not inspiring to safety. The bathroom was tiny, without a vanity and a broken toilet. After one use the toilet would not flush and the chain was still attached inside the tank. We then sat down and started looking for a new hotel. When we went downstairs to cancel our reservation, the staff was not phased at all. Which leads me to assume, this happens all the time.

The staff are some of the friendliest we have met in our travels and really contributed to this being our favourite trip yet. The hotel is very kitschy and has lots of character. If you are looking for the blandness of corporate hotels then you may not be as happy as we are with this lodging. The Royal Grove fosters a strong sense of community - one we have not experienced in our travels to date. There is a music night (think it was Wednesday) that is a lot of fun. We just missed the American Thanksgiving potluck that was taking place on Sunday night, but looked like a good time. The hotel is spotless - the cleaning staff are among the best there is, and friendly. The rooms are quite big - they are the old style rooms, reminiscent of a time gone by. The lanais are nice size with a full kitchen in most of them. The water pressure in the shower is great - really strong, and the bed is comfortable. Wi-fi is available in the lobby, which is a bonus because when you are in the lobby on your laptop or phone, you are also interacting with the residents of the hotel. Even the laundry room is a social space and connected to the pool/social area. It is so much fun it is hard to describe. Support this small, independent business and book early. This place is not a hidden gem; it is well discovered so you need to plan ahead if you want to stay here. We will also point out you are 2 blocks from one of the best parts of Waikiki Beach, and there are many restaurants and places for coffee near by, including an ABC store 1/2 block from the entrance.

We visited Hawaii the second week of September and stayed for a full 7 days. I would not recommend anyone stay anywhere but here. The two main factors were location and price, however everything else about our stay was excellent as well.If you’re the kind of person who plans to spend most of their vacation on Waikiki Beach and at the hotel itself, you may want to look elsewhere. However, for our purposes, this hotel was perfect. We had a large, clean room with a full kitchenette (oven, stove, microwave, toaster, full fridge, and plenty of cooking and eating utensils) and a balcony with a view of the ocean for under $650 for the week, which is ridiculous compared to other hotels in the area. We easily made breakfast in the mornings and ate on the balcony before heading out for the day. Royal Grove is just a two-block walk from Waikiki Beach, and very close to plenty of shopping, convenience stores, and restaurants. The hotel is also just a couple blocks from bus stop. To add further convenience, there are beach towels and accessories (floaties, noodles, chairs, etc.) you are able to use for the day and return (at no additional charge). Our sleep quality was good; there is a little bit of noise from the street, but you are in a city so it’s to be expected. The air conditioning worked well. The staff was helpful and polite, and other guests were pleasant as well. The only downside might be the lack of WiFi except for in the lobby, but who comes to Hawaii to sit on their computer/phone? The hotel is a little older, but we found it more charming than anything, the pink building reminiscent of old Hawaii. I feel like my review really can’t do this hotel justice, as it was exactly what we were looking for and turned out to be such a hidden gem. If we ever visit Honolulu in the future, we will definitely stay again!As an extra tip, if you are renting a vehicle, look for free overnight parking (after 6PM and before 7AM) at the metered streets over near the Honolulu Zoo.

Returning earlier this month (for one week) was like coming home. The Royal Grove, in our view, is still the best deal in Honolulu--the prices haven't changed since we were last there and the rooms are just as clean and neat as we left them two years ago.Part of that is has to do with their clientele, who tend to be older and not inclined to partying. And part of it is because of the exceptional housekeeping service by people like Besita, who, like everything else at the Royal Grove, is reliable, dependable, and always courteous to guests who need an extra bar of soap or roll of toilet paper! We were lucky to have the same room we had during our original visit in 2016--Room 506--and it was just as neat and clean this time around. The lanai (patio) still provides both great tropical bird sightings and views of Waikiki (both street side and ocean). Now for a reality check re: amenities: There are few. And the bathroom is small--very small. There is no fan, so the humidity tends to build-up and leave clothing hung in the adjacent closet a bit damp. The bathroom fixtures are small--do not expect a huge shower (although since we were last there, they have installed a handheld shower head which is convenient for those want to shampoo their hair or just rinse off sand) or sink area. Water pressure leaves a bit to be desired--but given there are probably close to 100,000 people showering every morning in the hotels that line Waikiki, that may be more typical than specific to the Royal Grove. The beds were basic, but comfortable And the kitchenette is great for dining in after shopping at the nearby Farmer's Market (M-W-F-Sat, 4-9 p.m.) or grabbing carry-out from one of the many neighborhood eateries.The air conditioner tended to shut off automatically, which was a bit of a problem because noisy garbage trucks roll down Waikiki around 6:30 a.m., and without any white noise to block out the trucks--well, consider the garbage caravan your alarm clock and make the most of the day!

We had a street facing room on the 5th floor with an L shaped balcony that had a large table and 2 chairs. We used it every day to have coffee in the morning and a cold drink at night to review our day. It had a view all the way down to the beach.

It did keep the room comfortable for sleeping.There was a kitchenette, with large fridge and utensils that we used several times. The pool area is convenient, and even the pool itself was perfect to cool off as you sun yourself in one of the many seats around the pool.Wi-fi is available, but only in the lobby/pool area. I do wish it was usable in the room.The only real negative is no room safe. They use an archaic bank safety deposit box which doesn't hold much.

The mattress was pretty soft so I had some problems sleeping as I prefer harder mattresses and the air in my room was pretty stuffy and warm as soon as I turned of the AC, but for the price compared to other hotels in Waikiki that was acceptable to me.

Where do I start, well, you get what you pay for and buyer beware. $70.00 a night rooms should have been my first clue. But I was assured that the people were ""really nice"". No, not at all. In fact we were told to go to bed at 9 pm, yes I am telling you the truth. So, we upgraded after taking a lot of sleep aids the first night so we could sleep in our room. It was going to cost $100.00 more a week. Why you ask, I'm guessing to cover the costs of me requesting the room be cleaned and the tub and toilet be un plugged, the grease, dirt and grime be cleaned out of the vents and toilet paper. As for friendly, if it's being based on the lady that I asked some questions in regards to navigating the area, that's just plain BS, she had a hard time giving information because she ""bought the place 40 years ago and had no need for information"". OK, well you also haven't used a paint brush, passed an health code or updated the technical services in 40 years either. And did I tell you that they told us to go to bed, twice, at 9pm. No lie. But on the plus side, there is no shortage of Drug Dealers within an arms throw, bikers making sure the business across the street is running well, sirens, yelling (not happy vacationers coming home kind) and screaming right out your window. The cleaning and sheets are a joke, I guess they don't know about black mold and assume it is just another foliage in the room. The beds are not beds, they are pads with metal support clearly visible so you know that they are there. And did I mention the managers/owners/front desk attendants, no, because you get a better reception from the Dealers and Homeless that are right out front. Don't bother with a laptop the signal is weak at best. TV is a ""reto"" tv with lots of News stations. No toiletries, the hand soap is a throw back to the white bars that were hip before the hotel was built and be prepared to ask for toilet paper. The staff were quite annoyed to have anyone there. Except the return guests that have been returning since woodstock and go to bed regularly at 9pm. So, take your $70.00 per night parlay it into a few more bucks and go the the Outrigger down the road and really enjoy the Hawaiian experience. That place is worth every penny.","Vancouver, Canada",8,1.0

A good microwave also. A glass table with a couple of chairs to chill out. I was in room 222 and it was fine. No air conditioner in my room which I had a choice to save some money and the fan was fine for me since I like the warm weather myself. The shower was good and there was a closet in the bathroom and hangers to put clothes on. The TV was on a dresser with extra pillows and blankets and plenty of space to put your clothes. There is an elevator and a big lobby with couches to chill out and the wifi works in the lobby only not in the room but I only was in the room to sleep and shower since there is SO MUCH to do on this island. I have been to 4 islands in Hawaii and each one has its own personality. Waikiki is very nice but you can explore the island by car or bus and if you do some research you can find some good bargains on car rentals. there is no parking lot but they will refer you to the Waikiki banyan which the price is 20 a day or 180 a month but to get the monthly rate you must do that at the office on a weekday 9-5 and Saturday is tricky since the office closes by 11am and on that day sometimes they close early or the one person who works that day might step out of the office, so I recommend doing it Monday thru Friday. anyway the hotel is an older hotel and smaller then most in this city but its well worth it to stay here. A great neighborhood and so much to do in this city and the north shore is an hour away and its so pretty there. Explore the east coast with Hanauma bay for great snorkeling & makapuu beach for fun waves in the winter which is about 20-25 minutes away and is one of the most beautiful beaches on the island and Waimanalo beach is just amazing also and is ten minutes north of makapuu. just remember there is traffic at rush hour most days. .

Third, it's family owned which I feel gives it more of a personal touch. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that my room had a kitchenette with a stove, full sized refrigerator, microwave, toaster and a coffee maker.

The staff at the desk were very friendly and helpful in giving me directions to several places, since I didn't know my way around the area at all. The hotel is only about 2-3 blocks from Waikiki Beach and also within walking distance to the zoo and the aquarium. It's also a few blocks away from a supermarket. On Monday nights, the hotel has a music jam with local musicians, and hula dancers. I do have one piece of advice though, ask for a room with a/c. My room had a ceiling fan and another fan that sat on a table and I was still hot much of the time. But other than that, I enjoyed my stay.

We have just arrived back home to Australia after spending 12 wonderful days in Hawaii staying at this hidden gem. No it is not the Royal Hawaiian or The Trump Hotel and if that is what you are expecting for the price the Royal Grove charges you are delusional. This hotel oozes and delivers old fashioned Hawaiian hospitality 200 metres from Waikiki beach. Many of the guests seem to know each other and visit year after year, the desk is manned 24 hours a day, nothing is too much bother and the welcome received is warm and genuine. Everyone knows the staff at reception by their first names and returning guests are greeted like old friends. Yes the place is shabby but it is clean, tidy and very serviceable. You do have a small kitchenette and it is nice to have the option to prepare something to eat in your own room sometimes. The air conditioning was perfectly fine and there was not one cockroach to be seen. Cockroaches however are present in most countries especially those with warmer climates and you need to toughen up if you think seeing one is likely to offend you or stay at home. Every Monday night Hawaiian music and dance is performed for free on the ground floor which is well worth seeing. Wifi is only available in the lobby and while initially I thought that was a problem it grew on me. As a person with a very busy career who normally goes through withdrawal symptoms if I can't check and respond to emails this did me the world of good. Also does young adults who have lost the art of conversation even on holidays as they are continually on social media the same. We also found going down to the lobby to use the wifi created opportunities to say hello and speak with other guests. We have visited Hawaii for four years now and stayed at very expensive hotels but stumbled across this hotel last year on a walk. My husband went in and asked if he could look around and have a look at a room which naturally for the staff was no bother. We decided then to stay there this year and have booked to return next year. It is easy to see why people return year after year. The Royal Grove is for those who have travelled in the Pacific very similar to how Aggie Grey's Hotel in Apia, Samoa used to be. Clean, tidy, warm and hospitable. Both great examples of Polynesian hospitality. I initially had to think twice about writing this review in case others got to hear about this ""hidden gem"" and it became even more difficult to book but I think I am too late anyway. This grand old lady as I like to think of this hotel is surrounded by newer hotels that probably appeal to the majority but for us and many like us she is representative of a past era that I hope is around for many years to come. Mahalo and we will be back next year!","Berry, Australia",14,5.0

But I was disappointed with this one. The need for paint made it feel unclean and uncared for. Some of the towels and washcloths were very thin and threadbare, the kind I would relegate to cleaning the car. The random collection of items in the lobby area felt tacky rather than eclectic. There was an additional refrigerator on our lanai (balcony) and I'm not sure why. The doors have vents in them, making it hard to keep out noise from other guests. We were lucky the first two nights - it was quiet - but the third night there was a very noisy family with an uncontrollable child yelling even until 11:30 pm. After I reported this, someone did respond and the noise ended. Parking was reasonably priced for Waikiki ($20/day) but it was a couple of blocks away, which wasn't a problem for us but could be for some people. On the plus side, the a/c worked well, the room was a good size, and it was an overall excellent location. We had a view of the ocean in the distance from our lanai, and there were many restaurants nearby. The staff was quite friendly, making dinner suggestions, giving directions, and even helping me glue my broken sunglasses. It would take so little to spruce up the place - a thorough paint job, new towels, updated bedspreads, and solid doors. They could cover those costs by increasing their rates a small amount and still appeal to the budget-minded traveler who enjoys a friendly atmosphere.","Harrisburg, NC",35,2.0

They stayed here for 15 years running, same six weeks in April and May, same room, same group of friends, “The April Crowd” they called themselves.Back then, I walked through the door and found a hotel that could have been the setting for a Hemingway short story, a set for a Bogart movie, or a dream home away from home for the dozens of regulars who come here every year to experience the best of what Hawaii has to offer, simple hospitality. Retuning this year I found only one minor change. They have free wifi in the lobby now. It’s okay though. Wifi does not interfere with the pervasive sense of community here. Folks still talk to each other between emails. The staff is helpful as ever. And the owner, Dear Mr. Fong, still organizes a weekly evening of music and homemade food for his guests. Everyone stands for last number and holds hands. I don’t now about you, but when I fall asleep at night, I am completely unaware of my environment, not matter how many stars it has.

And you pay $1.00 for dish soap, if you need to wash any dishes. It's the little bottle of Palmolive. There are not a lot of utensils supplied in the kitchen, but we didn't do much more than cut up cheese and boil water! Eating out in Waikiki is inexpensive, and we enjoyed different places in Waikiki for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on our two full days there. Bathroom was small. Very dark, but it does get brighter in time, because of those light bulbs that I hate! The bathroom door sticks a bit, at the bottom. I made the mistake of shutting it all the way the first time I used it, and I could not get out! I had to call for my friend to push the door in, from the other side, so I could get out. It is only at the bottom that the door is tight, because of a piece of wood across the bottom of the door. A good laugh was had about this.Lots of towels are available downstairs by the pool. And make sure you find the room with all the beach chairs as well. Plenty to choose from, and you can take them to the beach. Mats and other ""toys"" are also there for your use. Front desk staff was GREAT! I could not find the keys to open up the little TSA lock on my suitcase. A very nice gentleman came up to the room with a hack saw and was able to get the lock off for me. Thanks again, for doing that!We had AC in our room, and it worked very well. I had a separate control in the one bedroom, and another control was for the living area.

Due to the shuttle we booked not being there (that is another review), it was eventually 3 am when we arrived. The owner was as charming as ever, and we felt bad having kept him up so late. Hope they let him sleep in the next morning.We also wanted a sleep in the next morning, so having cleaning staff banging on the door at 8.30am was not very welcome. And when I yelled out we didn't need anything, they continued to bang, until I got out of bed and opened the door to send them away. We quickly learnt to put the do not disturb sign out every night, to ensure we could slumber as long as we wanted to.Once again, we found the hotel clean, and really appreciate the cooking facilities. We found our way back to the food pantry, just a couple of blocks awy, and stocked up for our 2 week stay. the pantry allowed us to take a trolley back to the hotel, by holding a credit card. This was greatly appreciated, as our initial purchase included whole water melons, rockmelons and honeydew melons, amongst other things.We did have an incident, which at the time was a bit heartstopping, but in hind sight is really hilarious.It was evening , and we were enjoying the sunset, and watching people passing by from the balcony. I went in and showered, and the joined my dh on the balcony, clad only in a towel. He went to go in and fill my wine glass up, and said, ""you've locked the door."" I said , no I didn't , I just closed it. But it was locked. Ended up having to catch the attention of a passerby,(finding an English speaking one wasn't easy), and getting them to go into reception and ask for someone to come up and unlock our balcony door. The man said they had some trouble with it before. So we were delighted the next day, when we returned from our bus tour, to find the whole door lock mechanism had been replaced.We loved our stay again(cept for the early morning door knocking)) and have recommended it to our daughter and her friends who are visiting in May this year.The location is premium, and the fact that you can do your own meals makes it a really affordable holiday.","Marlborough Region, New Zealand",62,5.0

The rooms are super cheap and unselfconsciously retro in the best way. Don't expect 5 star amenities, decor or room service, but if you like quirky, relaxed and a bit of time travel, this is your perfect spot.

I have posted many topics in the forum and have done hours of research. I debated about hotels for a long time. In the end, I chose the Royal Grove based on the price and the positive reviews. Admittedly, when we walked in I thought ""oh no:("" We got up to the room and the door hit the fridge and I thought ""oh, no."" while wondering what other accommodations we may be able to find. The room was clean and faced the pool on the fifth floor. I decided to give it a chance. There are cracks in the shower, the caulking needs to be redone, etc. The place does show it's age. However, what is also shows is character and the Hawaii you envision in your head. It is not for those who are looking for five star accommodations or for those who want to party and make noise till 2 am. The folks who come here have been doing so for 20+ years. They know each other and you get a feeling of ""aloha"". The Royal Grove is an incredible value. It is two blocks from the beach. It has a small pool (with hardly anyone in it) that does the job. We did not come to Hawaii to sit in the room or the hotel. If this is your plan, you may want to look somewhere else. This isn't the ""resort like"" kind of place. We used their beach mats, boogie boards, sand umbrellas, and tubes during our stay. All of this stuff is of no charge to guests. This hotel felt like home after a long tiring day. The folks at the front desk were always helpful and offered us a late check out for free!

The male desk clerk gave a quick point to the back wall and said, "" out that direction"". We asked if they has a safety pin, they gave us a tiny little pin. We just avoided communication as much as possible after that.The swimming pool experience was very poor. They were doing maintenance and construction work the entire week, so we sat around the pool listening to pounding nails and drills loudly buzzing for hours.

We SEE everything you do"" How would that make you feel regarding hotel customer service and feeling at home?

We thought, if you can sleep without an aircon, it should probably be doable. Don't do it!! The first room we entered, looked very shabby and had sliding windows (the ones that cut fingers when they fall) and two pretty huge plastic fans. We had 5 nights ahead of us with 90F at daytime and 75 plus at night, we quickly decided that we 'needed' aircon as a standard! So back to the desk and we got another one, without having to switch later that week. Kudos!That room was still being cleaned, it was the first and last time that week. The other days, they just changed the towels and did the beds. No more vacuuming after that moment. The room itself is nice, not shabby if you don't touch the furniture, as it is close to falling apart! It feels like walking into the seventies and not knowing better, one could think the room has not been touched ever since! The aircon works continously, so no switching on and off during the night and it keeps the room cold enough all the time. Then again, there are no windows you can open in the room, just the balcony door. The wifi is only available for free in the lobby, maybe the owner likes to see his guests every now and then, but in our room, next to the elevator, we just didn't have a signal. The tv was small by the way and shampoo only comes once a week. So buy it yourself!There are pans and glasses in the cabinets and there is a large fridge and microwave. Next door you have a great Korean place and a Denny's (with golden sign, other than red) for a fair price and the shopping centres are around the corner. Markets are there too, very cosy!Parking can be done two blocks away in a hotel, for 15 dollars per night. Don't gamble on street parking, there is hardly any and everything is one way traffic, killing!With the beach at the end of the street and surfboards to take in the lobby, what is the reason to really complain? You're in Waikiki for less than 100 dollars a night!! Just look through the old stuff, take this advice and save an awful lot.

I made a mistake in my booking (had the dates wrong, having forgotten about the International Date Line), but they were able to give us a room for the first night, and then moved us to another one the next day.The accommodation as stated in other reviews was a bit ""retro"", but comfortable & well-equipped for a self-catering room. The pool was a nice treat, and the wifi access in the lobby & breezeway was very handy. The location was only a short walk to the beach & all the popular Waikiki spots.From the moment we checked in, we could tell that many ""regulars"" stayed there & had been doing so for some time. That's always a sign of a good place.What impressed us ore than anything was the care and common sense displayed by the staff during the tsunami scare that occurred during our stay. They were quick to relocate all the guests to the 4th & 5th floors during the warning period, and kept everyone well informed of the situation at all times. Throughout this, they remained calm & kept the rest of us from worrying too much.

It was hot in the room and AC was working but made a heck of a noise. Well tierd after 14 hour flight from YYZ i fell asleep. Next morning I woke up and had a nice swim. During this time I put on the AC at max. speed. Well when I got back to my room 1h later i noticed carpet was wet. The AC had broken down. Well No worries, went to speak with the nice lady In desk. She offerd me another room, wich I kindly declined cus I really liked room othervise. So Instead they gave ma a rough 50usd discount for the incident and a big fan wich more then enough keep room cold during next night. Day after the came and Installed a New AC that worked without problems druing the rest of my stay.So why would I give this Hotel a 4 star rating all this said:Well: The location is exellent. 200m or about 1 block from downtown Waikiki.From my room I could even see the ocean. Nice to sit out on the Balcony and eat some fresh fruits from the farmers market closeby watching the sun rise over Waikiki.The staff at the hotel is just so lovley.

Nice to have a chat late at night.The cosy lobby is a great place to meet fellow travelers from all over the world. I even met some pep from Norway.

Most hotels in same area will set you back much much more.In Total I paid 647usd incl tax. for my nine nights (after the discount and some other smaller changes).This hotel is a great place to stay for anybody who really dont think they can afford an holliday In Hawaii. Well you are wrong. With some planning you can. Lots of good flighdeals from Mainland USA and Canada. BA also has a direct line from LHR with fuel stop in LAX.

We got there at 10.00 am, and they let us have our room as it was available, I work in a hotel, and I know that sometimes, staff can be mean, and don't let you in, even if your room is already free and clean.We were on the 6th floor, and room was great, brand new! huge fridge, which did not smell bad like other review says!Room was twice big as the one in the Ohanas hotel.Bathroom was a bit old and small, but who sleeps in it anyway!No problem with missing stuff when we came back from shopping. Good price, good location, good room and excellent staff. The only thing is that the parking is located 2 blocks away, at the Waikiki Banyan, it's 10$ per day, but it's really safe, security really checks people entering and exiting.I wish they could have a parking close by, but for sure, it's better to pay 10$ than 20$ at the Pacific Monarch. I read that some of you say you had to pay for internet, but I got it free in the lobby last time, and there was none in room??!!!If I may suggest something to the owner of the Royal Grove Hotel, change the elevator! lol , we were late for getting to the airport, and that was the time, the elevator decided not to work anymore, so from the 6th floor to the lobby, that was a long way for my hubby to carry our 6 suitcases.Lucky for us, there was the other elevator located on the 5th floor, on the other side of the building, so that helped my husband . But otherwise, that was not a big deal, as it was at the end of our stay.I really recommend that hotel to anyone, who doesn't want to pay high prices, for a room they will not be staying in all day long.Thank you again Royal Grove for the wonderful time we had with you.","Tahiti, French Polynesia",19,5.0

Although it's a hotel without amenities, it makes up for it in location and price. We would not hesitate to stay here again.I will say, there are two reasons I gave the hotel 4 'circles' instead of 5. For one, the maid was very insistent about cleaning our room (we don't like to have our room cleaned while staying at a hotel). We had only been there 3 days and she said that we have to take off our do not disturb sign because she must clean our room. This bothered me so I called the front desk and they informed me that our room does not have to be cleaned. I don't know why the maid was so persistent on this but she did not bother us again after front desk spoke with her. Maybe they are paid per room?Second, the mattress was hard as a rock.

Not worth the cheap price. I booked a room months in advance which was for a queen bed and a/c. When I checked in, I was told my reservation was for two single beds and not a queen, but they would upgrade me to a room with a double-bed and balcony for no extra cost. I wasn't expecting the Ritz, but I at least expected the room to be clean and not run down. The balcony was covered in pigeon poop and the ""a/c"" was nothing more than a sad looking box fan in the corner of the room. The main lighting was a single, bare florescent light bulb in the middle of the ceiling. The hotel website also boasted a parking lot nearby. The parking lot was 4 blocks away at the Waikiki Banyan. That's not nearby. Despite all these displeasing things, I decided to stay since I didn't want to spend my precious vacation time booking a room at a different hotel last minute and paying an arm and a leg for last minute bookings. I figured that I would only be sleeping and showering at the hotel and not spending a lot of time there. Big mistake. My 4th night there, I come back to the hotel around the usual time of after midnight to find the doors locked to the lobby and the lights off. I didn't have this issue the 3 previous nights, so it took me by surprise. The night auditor came to the door and was instantly confrontational. I asked why the door was locked and he said those were the rules. I informed him that they weren't locked for the last 3 nights and he started yelling that if I didn't like it, I should have gone to the Hyatt. He continued yelling at us all the way to the elevator and when I mentioned that he was being cocky for no reason, he started yelling that if I wanted good customer service, I should have gone to the Hyatt and that I can just get out and go somewhere else. Mind you, this was around 1am. His behavior was threatening and unprofessional. I took his remarks to mean that I didn't deserve good customer service because I didn't pay more for a hotel room and he kick me out in the middle of the night if I didn't like it.As soon as I got to my room, I spent two hours searching for a hotel that could accommodate me with a room on the fly. The next morning I went to the desk to check out from this dump. The clerk said that the night auditor accused me of swearing at him for the doors being locked. As I tried to explain to her what really happened, she picked up the phone and pretended to make a call. During her fake call, she printed up the check out bill and ran my card. I commented that I shouldn't have to pay for the day of check out since it was the night auditor's behavior that made me check out early. She just gave me a blank look and an insincere half-baked apology for what had happened.When I got back home, I filed a complaint with the BBB. That was a waste of time. The hotel manager's response was drivel. He even proved himself a liar by stating that it was a matter of fact that the parking lot was 2 blocks away. Any paper map or even Google Maps will show that the Waikiki Banyan is 4 blocks away. You go a 1/2 block NE on Uluniu Ave to Kuhio Ave, then 3 1/2 blocks E to the Waikiki Banyan. He claimed that the doors are locked for security measure. Bull! The night auditor didn't even check if we were actual guests of the hotel before letting us in. And how is turning off the lights part of security measures? Plus, if you're going to lock the doors, someone should have mentioned that at check in or at least post a note on the door. I've stayed at a lot of hotels in Waikiki over the years and NONE of them lock their lobby doors. I was under the belief that I was staying in a hotel, not a dorm!I was born and raised in Honolulu and the Royal Grove is shameful. No aloha whatsoever.

The money I save staying here, means I can shop my little heart out!Being from Australia, EVERYTHING, is sooo much cheaper, so I come ready to shop.This hotel, is not modern, it does not have photos, in the latest Vogue, home mags, but it is Home, when we are in Hawaii. it is clean, tidy, and fresh, with a warm family atmosphere.... I've bought many friends here over the years, and they've all loved it.We are not looking for a big fancy hotel, we're looking for a small in expensive hotel, that we can cook a meal in when we don't want to go out, it is perfect.We always land early from Australia, never have a drama checking in early, and the girls at front desk, always more than accommodating.The pool is enough to cool off in, and hang around, but waikiki beach, is just a 2min walk awaythere are ABC (corner stores) across the road, the 24hr Food Pantry just down the road, you have a computer with internet access for a small fee, in reception, and there's free wifi in reception/by the pool.Fast food is close, it's clean and friendly and seriously, who wants to spend millions on a hotel room you're never in?? once a week, they have a guest get together, and sing along, which again, just makes it all the more homely, family friendly...

I make several short visits each year. I always get the warmest of welcomes and I am always happy with the room. As others have said, the furniture is a bit worn, the hallways are clean but faded (although they do have security cameras, as an earlier reviewer had requested), and the paint on the lanai could use some touch-up. But the whole place has a homey, comfortable feeling, which is the reason that I keep returning. There definitely is a time warp feeling when you enter - many of the guests are folks who have been staying here for years - sometimes renting rooms for months at a time. Next to the lobby is a larger room with a piano, computer for internet access, and a large table. The table is often used for card games in the evenings. The place can be described as ""cluttered"" but spending a few moments to look over a lot of the souvenirs and collected memorabilia can be entertaining.As an earlier reviewer said, this place attracts ""regular folks"" and I agree that this is not everyone's preference (especially someone coming to Waikiki especially for the upscale experience or for a special occasion). For me, I enjoy taking the Roberts bus from the airport ($15 round trip per person) and not dealing with a car - most of Waikiki is within easy walking distance, and there are bus stops a few steps away that will take you to more distant destinations.I am sure that Honolulu used to have plenty of places like this - and many were torn down to make room for the high-rises.

We had a one bedroom suite on the 6th floor, and x-mas rates were $90 a night, a block from the beach - a price non-existent in Waikiki. There was a full kitchen with 4 burner electric stove, oven, sink, dishes, utensils, coffee maker, toaster, microwave, a full size refrigerator. In the first room there was also a dining table with chairs and two single beds with night stands. The bedroom had full size bed, a TV, dresser, a night stand, a full bathroom with tub, and a closet inside the bathroom. The lanai (balcony) overlooking Uluniu Street, was the length of both rooms, with two doors, you could comfortable seat a dozen people on it. Lanai had a table and three chairs. Looking towards the beach, you could see the ocean. Each room had a separate air conditioner, brand new and working perfectly and silently, with remotes. The carpet in both rooms was is good shape, the paint was in good shape as well. Furniture was older, but matched fine. Bathroom was clean, except the air vent.Beds had soft clean mattress pads, and clean sheets. The towels ranged from very new to very old, the oldest being offered at the pool. If you would like good service (we did), leave a few bucks on the pillows and in the bathroom and get good towels and fresh sheets every day (we did LOL).I chopped, fried, and baked in the kitchen, it was great. Gave some business to the store in the building. The big grocery store is down the street, and on that first jet-leg early morning, get an empty carry-on and load a gallon of milk, a pineapple, other provisions, some shucked oysters and wine (I did:) Thursdays 4-8 pm farmers come to the Waikiki market place, and it is easy to load with freshest produce and flowers for a week (we did).If you have kids, get a $25 annual family pass to the zoo ( a ten minute walk).Royal grove saves the beach paraphernalia left behind by the previous guests, and we had daily choices of straw mats, floaties (mats, donuts, boogie boards) that are stored by the pool. My daughter used the pool and enjoyed it.When we arrived on Dec.23, there was a concert in the small lobby, and as we have walked in, the band greeted us and sang us a Hawaiian song. I was assigned a long narrow lock box (like the ones at the bank) in the lobby, and stored valuables there when at the beach. The lobby staff was friendly and patient, they also were on the lookout for safety, trying to remember their guests.Overall, if you are OK with the retro furniture, there is not much else to gripe about. I should also mention better quality Duke posters decorating our room walls - nice touch of Hawaiiana.",Alaska,45,5.0

We booked 5 months early, & had a nice 5th floor room facing Uluniu Ave. Perfect for what we wanted - a great location with a good view from the nice lanai (literally 3 minute walk to the beach). The cost was very low compared to all other decent lodging in Waikiki, & the owners & staff treated us (and every guest) like cousins from the Mainland! Of course, this pint-sized gem is not for everybody. Those that require grand entrances, breathtaking architecture, and gleaming marble columns should ante up the $200-500 per night for those places. If all you need is a place to sleep in clean beds, have a well-equipped kitchenette (with plates & dinnerware!), shower with great water pressure (and hot water!), feel welcomed every time you cross the warmly decorated lobby, and enjoy the company of like-minded regular folks - this is the best bet on Oahu. For perfect convenience, there's a nice corner sundry & liquor store actually in the building on Uluniu, along with Me's Korean BBQ (great food) and the Coconut Cafe for fruit smoothies & much other good stuff. Music night was Monday Dec 14, and it was almost 2 hours of fun, listening & singing along with the cadre of wonderfully talented ""Kamaaina"" musicians that volunteer their talent every week. This night the musician lineup included a guest from Japan playing her ukulele and the hotel's long-time owner, Mr. Fong and his lovely wife. I'm telling you - that kind of simple (no cost) fun & shared experience isn't likely to happen to a tourist anywhere else in Waikiki! Queen Lililuokalani's famous ""Aloha O' E"" song that ended the show was heartfelt, and much appreciated by all guests - some Europeans, some from Japan, Australia, New Zealand and of course - the Mainland.

It was a good value for the price and location. I think I found it from Lonely Planet. It is within 1 block or so from the beach, and the zoo. It's typical Hawaiian, laid back style. I remember it being clean, a little worn, but that didn't bother me. It was nice to have a frig., coffee pot, and the like. It had a TV with all the channels. Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, so whenever that unfortunate tragedy happend, was the time I was there. There was a good Hawaiian plate take-out restaurant about one door over. And, a tourist/convenience store about 2 doors over which was nice to buy iced coffee and the such and put it in the frig. I didn't try the pool. I did feel a little uncomfortable with the security, or lack thereof. I don't remember A/C. It seemed the windows cranked open. I think there was an outside walkway to the rooms, but I may be wrong. A nice hotel would have security cameras in the hallways, and that would have made me feel better. However, when I was in Honolulu there was something in the paper about female tourists, I believe, Japanese girls, who were robbed in their hotel rooms. The one girl opened the hotel door thinking it was her friend, and got tied up. I remember it being in a nice hotel. Unnerving for anyone. After reading that, I obviously had different thoughts about Honolulu, that verged on being a little paranoid, watching my back, and keeping my wits about me at all times, especially since I was traveling alone. Please don't get so intoxicated with the beauty of the island that you're not aware of the potential for crime. When I took my rental car back, the agency said someone got into my car. I couldn't believe it! Whenever I went to the beach, I parked where I had full view of the car at all times. I figured someone got into it in the parking garage that I used near this hotel. Just like the hotel, they had no cameras in the garage. The rental car company said the door lock was messed up, and when they showed me, it was an obvious attempt at someone who tried to get in it. Nothing was missing, because I didn't keep anything in the car. It might be a good idea to not keep bags or anything in your rental car which might tempt thieves wondering what's in it. It was so long ago that I stayed at this hotel, that it might have become really shabby. However, I remember being happy with it, as it was cheap and in a good location. If you're just looking for an inexpensive place to lay your head, then this could be a good bet. However, if you want something nice, and the real Hawaiian experience, I would look elsewhere.","Kodiak Island, Alaska",50,3.0

The other thing that put us off Waikiki was the agressive people trying to get us to take a tour, the blantent commercialism, and such high end shops... and so many people and noise everywhere.

We were in Waikiki twenty years ago, and noticed how many homeless vagrants seemed to be sleeping in the parks... so sad....We didn't rent a car as we didn't want to add to the pollution, and found that this town that could be bike friendly (so flat) didn't really accomodate renting bikes for a reasonable price or have bike lanes etc...Thank you to the Royal Grove for the lovely music provided Monday night by a group of very talented Hawaiin musicians, and the staff for their kindness.","Whiterock, B.C.",18,4.0

We had room 407 which had a great little kitchenette, a queen and a single bed, and a balcony facing the adorable little pool. It was relatively quiet, but if your a sensitive sleeper you may want to opt for a lower inside room as they will likely block out the sound better.

Parking was convenient, right across the street, and $12 bucks a day which might seem expensive until you look around the area. They advised me of a $10 rate, two blocks away, but the extra $2 was worth the convenience. And the parking is in-out parking so come and go as you please.

You simply can't beat the price. We booked our room nearly a year in advance which may have contributed to having a great room. 5th floor, corner with an ocean view. We enjoyed the balcony and the table and chairs that was on it. We ran the air conditioner the first night but were too cold and were comfortable with the window open after that. We only stayed a couple of days because we set off on a cruise around the islands. We all wished we could have stayed longer at the Royal Grove. It's not fancy but it's homey and comfortable and the folks hanging out in the lobby were friendly and made us feel welcome. I asked about a Royal Grove t-shirt that I saw someone else wearing. The t-shirts are as good a deal as the hotel. $5. but you have to ask them to pull them out of the closet! Kids were happy that they could tap into free wireless internet from another hotel. Could see if you didn't get an inside or upper level floor room where it might be noisy but we didn't have any trouble at all. Found the beds comfortable and slept well.  The Blazing Steaks place down the street at $6 a person for 8 oz. steak, rice and salad is too good to pass up (ignore the stark decor. or get it to go) Upstairs mexican restaurant (from Blazing Steaks) is good but much more expensive. I hope to return to the Royal Grove someday for a much longer stay.","Arcola, Indiana",19,5.0

It is also the noisiest place on earth, and I've lived in New York my entire life. The windows are glass slats from sometime in the 1970's and as such, they never completely close. I was advised by a fellow trip advisor to stay on an upper floor to get away from street noise. We stayed in the old wing on the top floor in a gigantic suite (that hasn't seen an update since 1971) with a shower made for those 4'9"" and smaller. We did not have a single complaint, as our Waikiki beachfront palace cost only $71 a night and was, indeed, comical. That is until we tried to get some shut-eye. I cannot express in words the noise level from the street below. It was amplified, I'm not sure why, and we heard every horn, every bus hydraulic, every drunk idiot on the street, and everything inbetween. I imagine sleeping at a 42nd street bus stop on a Friday night might be a close runner up.By all means, stay here if you plan on enjoying downtown Honolulu for its nightlife and are on a limited budget but please for goodness sake, put down several maitais with your dinner and drink heavily before bed if you plan on even an hour of restful sleep.

Thanks to the Royal Grove I was able to enjoy a 10 night stay from the UK. Please read the reviews carefully, this place may appeal to many and at the same time not. The best thing about the accomodation is the location. Waikiki beach is a mere 2 mins stroll away, those who complain about the hotel need to spend a a wad more and head to the Hyatt Regency nearby. The rooms are worn but fine and there is paid for internet in reception as well as items you can use to borrow for a day at the beach (deck chairs and cool boxes etc) tell me another hotel that does that? There is also a self service laundry that uses quarters.I ate at the Korean takeaway (about $8 a meal) frequently as their plate lunch meals were divine. I didn't cook much as the number of restaurants around Waikiki was plentiful and cheap. As a single female tourist I never once felt intimidated in the evenings, in fact you felt safe as there were so many other holiday makers around.Get yourself a bus pass form the ABC stores and start exploring , the nearest bus stop is located about 30 metres behind the hotel. You'll never get lost, just look out for the Hyatt and the Pink Lady will not be far behind. I also travelled around the islands using a travel agency located next to the hotel, all the tours were on time and were of a good quality.If you are staying long term of wish to cook real meals which I did on the odd occasion, you will not find many supermarkets - head to the Ala Moana Centre for that!I wont go into the negatives of the hotel as I feel that it would be really unfair to, the positives far outweigh it.

For most of our trip, we heard this never ending beeping all night long. Come to find out that it was an alarm for the pool. It wasn't getting enough chlorine or something. The receptionist commented how management never does anything to fix up the place and that the beeping would continue for a while.This has been one of the only places where my wife has not felt safe and/or clean.

I stayed in Rm 404 which was airconditioned and I had a king size bed. Yes there was lint stuff in the wall vent, however, it is not used since you use the a/c in the wall anyway, so big deal. I recommend you have the a/c going full blast all day while you are out and the room will be comfortable by the time you get back in.The room was very clean and there was maid service everyday. I chose the Cat#1 room for $67. Look, all I need is a/c, a tv, clean bed and room and shower and I'm happy. I got up and left the room about 9am and didnt come back until after 4 or 5pm, then only for a short while, to relax and then go out and eat and then less than 5min. walk to the beach to watch the sun go down among hundreds of others.I utilzied the fridge by buying some local fruit at the fruit stands on the other side of the island and brought my own coffee with me. So all that was part of my breakfast in the morning.There is a small Korean take-out restaurant down stairs located on the corner in the same building. They serve breakfast; Portugese sausage or spam, two eggs and an ice cream scoop of rice plus toast for $4. Cant beat it. I saw long lines in Dennys for breakfast who wanted to spend more money and didnt trust the food quality from the small local eateries. Dont know why.If you have a car, you can park about two blocks away for $10 for 24hrs. at the Waikiki Banyan. The hotel has a loading zone which you can unload luggage and stuff and bring it up to your room then you can park the car or just take off.I wanted to use the computer when i woke up early but I was told you can used it from 830am until???. Dont know why 830am is the magical time.I've been to Oahu many times on vacation and with the military and for me, I'm not fancy, this will be the place I will stay from now on.

However, running the AC and keeping the curtains closed kept the room comfortable and had the added advantage of 'drowning out' the sound of civilization outside. (You are in Waikiki afterall). Bed was comfy and EVERYTHING in the room worked & was clean. Probably would have prefered the TV in the 'living area' rather than the bedroom, but I'm not in Waikiki to watch television.Spent the rest of the four weeks in 309 - a corner room with wrap around lanai (Balcony). This room actually seemed to be bigger that the one bedroom suite, but that is because the suites have two rooms. No major issues were experienced with this room and although I did not cook during my stay (hey, I'm on vacation after all!!) there was everything one would need right there - all you need to do is provide the food.. I also had two fully working refrigerators, and I made the most of the coffee percolator, even though there was also a drip filter coffee maker, complete with filter papers.Look, this place is not a dump. It's honest and great value. The staff greet you by first name from day one. The pool and surrounding area is nice and clean, plus you get all the added extras. Books to read, magazines and free newspapers daily, free coffee in the foyer and much more stuff you can borrow. Hell they even made dumbells available to me, so I could exercise in my room.  As for people complaining about fluff on exhaust fans - have you checked the one in YOUR bathroom at home lately? And sand on the Lanai? - hows about rinsing your feet at the beach before tramping back to the hotel? Found a DEAD bug in the bathroom? flush it down the toilet or toss it in the trash. (Bugs probably go to the Hilton as well you know....) These are petty complaints and a call to the front desk will have your ""issue"" sorted quickly.You know, there are Hyatt people and there are happy people. I like to think of myself as part of the latter group, (and I bet the front desk gang are part of it too). Big special Mahalo to Donna, for making me feel like part of a family. Thanks also to the Fongs for the great entertainment and a great place to call home, when I'm in Waikiki.Couple of points for those of you wanting to book:1/ Call the hotel directly for confirmation as email replies can be a bit slow.2/ Want a quiet room? - ask for poolside off the ground floor.3/ Pay the few extra bucks for an AC room if you're gonna have issues with warmth or noise etc.4/ Make use of the hotels facilities - borrow the body boards, fins, snorkels, towels, airbeds etc. (You won't find this offered in other hotels)5/ Finally, if you're demanding or pretentious - do us all a favor and book at the Halekulani instead.Mahalo.",Gosford (Sydney) Australia,28,5.0

It was a bit embarassing to tell people where we were staying but I spoke to another couple who were paying twice as much and their hotel was just as dated/shabby so the price is certainly right. We paid under $800 plus $120 for parking for 10 days. Really cannot beat that. Parking is not convenient but everything else is. There is a market downstairs and a good restaurant. Shave ice on the corner and across the street is another market which is open earlier than the other. My kids enjoyed the convenience of borrowing flippers, toys, beach mats, snorkles, (near the front door) boogie boards (behind the pool) etc and we walked to the beach nearly every day and had a shave ice every evening. They have surf boards to loan as well. There is a coin operated laundrymat open until 11pm in the hotel and in the laundry room there are coolers and lawn chairs you can borrow. We took a cooler to the North shore and had a nice picnic. They will also give you towels to use at the beach. They have hairdryers and irons to loan out. Laundry soap is 50 cents and dish soap is a dollar at the front desk (cheaper than in the market). Front desk staff are indeed helpful and polite. You can pack pretty light. Everything you need is right in that building. The closet is fairly large with lots of hangers. There were 13 drawers in our room (double with two single beds) so storage was no problem. For some reason our room had a multitude of mirrors which I thought was funny. Mirrors above each bed, back of bathroom door and in bathroom. Guess they saved on art work?The dominos pizza man comes around every evening around 6pm with small pepperoni pizzas for six bucks and he will bring you something else if you ask. One evening our kids swam at the hotel pool and ate pizza while we did laundry and checked our email. The bathroom was not up to my standards of cleanliness and I am not a picky person. I didn't like the mold around the bath tub fixtures and the dirty air intake. The maids were supposed to come in twice a week but as one of the previous reviews said it was hit and miss as far as cleanliness went. They never did sweep the lanai floor so we had sand everywhere. My pillow had a foul odor so I got a new one. Bed was ok to sleep in. We had to keep the a/c on all the time and turn on the fan or the room got too warm. Be careful, even local phone calls are 50 cents apiece from the room.The neighborhood has a fare share of vocal mentally ill people hanging around but there were always lots of other people there, even at night, so we never felt threatened.

It was odd walking throuhg the back of the restaurant next door to get to the stairs, but if that sort of thing offends you, take the elevator!We split our first 5-night stay over two rooms because of a mix-up in the booking that was about 75% our fault, but which the hotel sorted pretty quickly, and had a different room on our one-night return visit, so had a chance to see more rooms than most guests. (If you're in the main block, ask for a corner room - much bigger lanai.)All three rooms were pretty shabby and would benefit from redecoration, but I'd rather have shabby and cheap and save the money for eating out. As well as a microwave and full oven there were, somewhat bizarrely, two fridges. We were able not just to make our own breakfasts but to cook full meals a couple of nights, which also helps keep costs down. The pool was smallish but big enough to swim in, with plenty of tables and chairs around it. Internet in the lobby was good value at ten minutes for a buck, and you can print as well. As well as beach towels there are beach mats and other useful things you can borrow.Because we're cheap we walked two blocks to the parking lot that charged $10 per 24 hours, but if that's too far to walk you can park across the road for $12 a day.If you want spotless and newly painted rooms, go somewhere else and spend a lot more, but if you want basic but perfectly acceptable accommodation for a ridiculously cheap price given the location you will struggle to find anywhere as good value as the Royal grove.",St Albans,104,5.0

We had one of the Cat. 2 room for $90 per night. It was one that had a bedroom with a queen bed and a separate room with two twins and a kitchenette. Check in was fairly easy. The place is very old and really needs a major refurb. I was aware of the bare bones accommodations ahead of time, but was expecting something cleaner and better than what we experienced based on past reviews. I'm usually not this hard on a property in my reviews, but this place does not deserve its high Trip Advisor rating. I would guess it's because of the price and location. It cannot be for the accommodations. First of all, the pool was being fixed and they were using a jackhammer and some kind of saw late into the night and early in the day. We could hear it in our room very clearly, so that was very annoying. The carpet is in dire need of being replaced (both in the hallways and rooms). When we arrived in the room, the two twins had no pillows on them. We found a couple in the room, but we needed a couple more, as well as some additional towels. I called the front desk to have some delivered and was told to come down and get a key to another room so I could take them out of that room. I was told earlier the hotel was sold out so I guess someone didn't have any pillows or towels that night. The room I went to was even more depressing than our room.We had only one working air conditioner, which was in the bedroom. It was so hot in both rooms upon arrival that it was almost unbearable. It pretty much stayed that way the entire time we were there. We had to leave the door open between the rooms at night and put the fan in the doorway, but that didn't help much. We all felt very dirty the whole time we were staying there. We needed ice and I was told it was in the back, so we walked past the pool area down a old, damp, dirty hall. We opened a refrigerator since we thought that was the ice maker. It had spoiled food and it was disgusting. The adjacent restaurant used it. It was so filthy and smelled horrible. We quickly closed the door. I would not eat anything from that restaurant. We finally found the ice machine a bit further down almost in the restaurant, so we felt funny taking it. What an experience.I called ahead of time to ask if the beds had been replaced recently. I was told they had, but that had to have been untrue. The sheets, blankets and pillows are in dire need of replacement. If you stay here, make sure you bring your own soap, shampoo, etc. since they only provide one small bar of soap. The towels and wash cloths also need to be replaced. The ceiling in the shower had reddish looking matter splattered on it that looked as if someone had died in that room. It really made me ill. I tried to not look up when I showered. The vent in the bathroom had so much mold and dirt clogging it, it was disgusting (see photo). The window air conditioner was also moldy and clogged. There was a refrigerator and a stove, with a few dishes/glasses in the cabinet. You need to purchase dish soap to wash dishes. There was also a ice tray in the freezer, but we didn't use it. The coffee pot was disgusting, so we just didn't use it. There was only one t.v. in the bedroom. The main room with the two twins did not have one, so my father-in-law was not very happy. They didn't sleep well because the room was just too hot. The only bathroom is in the bedroom so they had to move the fan out of the doorway at night and then come into our room. Parking is another issue. You must park several blocks away and it's $10 per day. This was very inconvenient, especially if you have a disability. Finding a place to park while we were dropping bags off and picking them up was a challenge as well. We didn't feel very safe there either. What really bothered me was that both of the doors to the hallway were propped all of the way open all night long just inviting people to come in. There are a lot of homeless people in Honolulu. The doors to the rooms have vents in them (see photos) and you can hear everything on the streets and in the halls. Someone had kicked in the lobby door overnight and broke the glass out. There was a very heated argument between two strangers on the street in front of the hotel as we were standing there waiting for my husband to pick us up. One guy said to us ""what the [--] are you looking at?"" We were just very uncomfortable there. Our stay at the Royal Grove really made a difference in the enjoyment of our trip, or lack thereof. This place is just depressing. They need to spend some money painting and cleaning up this property, or just demolish it. Bottom line, if you are on a very, very tight budget, stay here. Otherwise, spend some extra money and stay elsewhere. We could not wait to check out and get to our cruise ship. The only thing this place really has going for it is the location since it's only a couple of blocks from the beach. If you are a young, single person in town to party, surf or whatever, this place is probably for you. You really do get what you pay for.",South Dakota,161,1.0

Certainly, the Royal Grove is well situated, inexpensive and quite clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. The downstairs sitting area is welcoming and the other guests were pleasant - we encountered mostly younger couples and young families. However, the two rooms I saw could really use some maintenance. In my room, the top of one of the chairs was detached, one of the lampshades was heavily stained, window screens were clogged with dust and the walls were quite scuffed. It seemed like some fairly minor upgrades to this particular room would have made a big difference. It's possible that some of the other rooms are in better shape - I only saw two. Street noise (early morning garbage trucks, etc.) can also be issue, depending on where your room is located. Overall, I am not sure if I'd stay at this particular property again.",Canada,97,3.0

Its location (less than a minute walk to the center of Waikiki beach) allowed us to go surfing every day, walk to shopping and restaurants, or hop The Bus to anywhere. The health food store downstairs (Ruffage) makes killer whole grain turkey sandwiches (for packing on a hike up Diamond Head), and the smoothies shop made us so many yummy taro bobas that we lost count. The room was cleaned daily, we had fresh towels constantly, and the staff was very friendly - holding our bags while we picked up the rental car, lending us beach towels, snorkles, umbrellas etc. The next time we go back, we're going to just stay for a week...","Los Angeles, California",9,4.0

I arrived at the hotel and checked-in at around 3pm; my cousin, with whom I was sharing the room, arrived at around midnight (after his flight was delayed) and had no problems checking into the room after I informed Christy that he'd be arriving later.The really cool part about the stay (aside from the great price and the proximity to the beach) is the jam session that took place on Tuesday night. The owners (the Fongs) invited some of their friends over to jam to some Hawaiian tunes on some ukuleles, an acoustic guitar, an electric guitar, an electric bass guitar, and a set of drums. The music was pretty sweet as was the impromptu hula session given by the (daughter-in-law?). After the jam session, I had the chance to meet the Fongs, who as it turns out, have owned the Royal Grove for about 40 years now. Although they still own the hotel, the Fongs leave the day-to-day management up to one of their sons, Tim, whom I also had the chance to meet. I'm not sure how Tim does it, but the staff he works with was generally really friendly and helpful. Speaking of which, Christy, one of the ladies behind the counter was a total rockstar of friendliness and helpfulness. She wasn't alone in this; I was able to get directions to a good (and inexpensive) salon for a haircut, directions to a place for good eats nearby, etc. throughout my stay.All in all, I had a blast during my stay at the Royal Grove and look forward to another stay there.","Chicago, Illinois",3,5.0

Remember the price and keep everything in perspective.Age/Condition of The Hotel: We were told that a man sitting across from us (in a motorized chair has been coming there since 1968, so the hotel is quite old). It has aged gracefully because of the care it gets from the staff (and the long-term residents who often come from Canada and often stay for 5 months).The hotel is rated as a 1 star budget hotel, but has so much care and Aloha that it really is 5 stars.Some of the bathroom paint (in the closet) was peeling, some of the baseboards are disjoining from the walls, the hall did need a good shampoo and vacuum. But- we thought there was new carpet in our room (a 1 room air conditioned room, with complete small full-service kitchen).Tv channels are not something to spend time in the room for. But, I would not want the hotel to spend any extra money on TV- in fact, save the $ each month that they spend now and take the TV out. Entertainment (Free):Every second night, there was music coming from the lobby. Music from friends of the owners (the Fong family) who care enough to continue to drop by to entertain the guests (for the last couple of decades from what we heard). There was classical piano music coming from the lobby, from an elderly gentleman guest, who wished to share his wonderful talents. New Years Eve- there was music, pot luck food, and lots of Aloha. We really did not participate, but sat on the veranda and listened to the lovely music and fun. I think some of the guests/residents make it a point to come on special occasions. One gentleman told us that he comes yearly, and has several children, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren,.... and he IS AT the Royal Grove. This place has special meaning for people.The staff have been there a long time, and this says a lot about the comfort they feel there. Guests/residents have been coming a long time, and that says a lot about how they feel about the place. We will go back again.Yes, as a reviewer said, bring your own shampoo. The hotel DOES give several bars (small) of soap, kleenex replenished regularly and toilet paper replenished regularly.For a place that supposedly gives cleaning 2ce / week for guests staying 1 week, the maids were really around 4 or 5 times out of our first week, and the same for the second week. ...They start working at 7 AM ! Put the ""do not disturb"" sign on if you want to sleep in.Not one bug! And I hate bugs!!! They regimentally spray monthly!! Cement building (not wood).Nelson, the maintenance man always has a smile on his face, and is always there, every day. Holidays included. He must feel like he is at home there:)Thanks to Steve (night staff), Donna, Debbie, Christie, another lady (sorry my brain is fuzzy), Nelson, Jimmy, and the elder owners Mr. and Mrs. Fong- and everyone there I can't remember the name of. Free coffee and paper in the AM is nice.Pool is cold- your shoulders are warm in the sun, though.Free items in the lobby to borrow (just ask the staff) to meet ALL your beach needs.** 30 seconds to walk to the beach. And we do not walk fast!Security- good because they lock the lobby at 12 midnight, and the hotel is in its own courtyard- very good design.**To book- look at their website and see what room you want first. The hotel staff are busy and don't have time to describe the rooms. Call for info. about availability, once you familiarize yourself with the hotel offerings. We heard staff refer people to their website. Non air conditioned rooms in the older wing are often sold out because of the low-cost... but if you can afford the air-conditioned room (our room had 1 double bed and 1 single bed) it is great because you don't have to have the window open. THE NOISE IN WAIKIKI IS TERRIBLE. A homeless man yelled every 2 AM. Garbage trucks backing up with beeps starting at 4 AM. Loud music from car radios all night. TRY TO GET A ""POOL SIDE"" ROOM. Very much quieter.Long-time returning guests are remembered and appreciated by the staff and management. All are treated with respect.We will go back again. Tip regarding travelling- if you can live without a car rental- do so. The cost is high, the parking is very very limited and adds to the cost of your trip. The Bus is $2 and they give you a transfer (one transfer offered 2 hours another offered 4 1/2 hours) so we got off, did something, and then got back on again. The most we spent in 1 day was $8 for 2 of us. We used The Bus every 2 or 3 days. Save your money. We went around the island on The Bus- even past Hanama Bay (great value for money !!). Waikiki has many well positioned bus lines. They knew what they were doing when they designed Waikiki and its bus system!! If you have a Medicaid card, you only pay $1. We are not American, so I'm not sure what you have to do to get this, but if you have this card, it cuts your bus costs down even further.All the best, happy travels, you will love Oahu- we do.",Canada,230,5.0

It's not some fancy resort, but it offer CLEAN rooms, good beds and a good shower. Those were the important things! The location is grest, two blocks from the beach, close to many restuarants, grocery store, and shuttles. Paid parking ($12 a day) at the hotel across the street. The kitchenette has full-size refrigerator, microwave, coffee pot, and four burner stove, plus all the dishes, pans and silverware. We stayed in room 208 overlooking the pool. Free use of beach mats, snorkel gear and beach toys was a plus. It was nice to get the free paper from the lobby and have my morning coffee while reading it on the lanai. I felt like this hotel conveyed more of the real Hawaiian spirit than the big resort hotels. As long as you aren't expecting a big resort with lots of activities, you won't be disappointed when choosing the Royal Grove!

The kitchen facilities were nothing great, but perfectly adequate for what we needed, especially the large fridge/freezer.The decor is dated, but everything worked properly and nothing was falling to pieces. And if the decor of the room is of major importance to you, then you should pay ten times the price and go to one of the big shot hotels.Our room was overlooking the pool area,which was as I had requested, because we were concerned about road noise, as we come from a very quiet area.The only noise we heard was a rubbish truck empying a skip somewhere in the block each morning, but that is a job that has to be done, and it gave us a chance to fall back to sleep, and feel like we had had a sleep-in.We were particularly happy to have a room facing Easterly. We had lovely morning sun on our balcony for the first few hours each day, and then in the late afternoon when one was hot and tired from the days activities, it was nice and cool and shady. And if we felt like watching the sunset, then Waikiki Beach was only a 3 minute walk away.We have no regrets at all about choosing the Royal Grove for our stay, I cannot imagine better value for money, and am grateful to others who had posted comments on trip advisor which gave me the confidence to book into a low star rated property.

There was a full sized refrig, sink, stove with oven, towels for the kitchen, microwave, coffee maker, all the plates, cups, utensils, pots, and they even had safety deposit boxes!The staff was very friendly and was helping any time we needed them. We checked in late in the day and we didn't fly out until 9 pm, so the staff held our luggage for us. We asked for morning wake up calls, no problem there either.Yes, the rooms are dated, but you know what? My entire stay was under $350 for 6 days and 5 nights. My whole stay was less expensive than some people would pay per night!We had a great Korean restaurant right under us, loved it! More places directly down the street, we were about 2 blocks off Waikiki Beach. The morning traffic was a bit loud, but not enough to bother my husband or I. There are grocery stores close by for breakfast food, which was wonderful. I have zero complaints about the stay. The only way it would have been any better is if there had been juice and bagels for breakfast, but that was not even necessary, it would have just been an added bonus. Like I said, I don't ask for much. We bought it all at the local store.I realized during the stay that many guests are return customers. They knew the names of the staff and they staff knew them. We were asked how we found the best deal in Waikiki by some of those return guests. I told them, ""By luck!""I would never consider staying at any other hotel in Waikiki.

This place is not for those wanting luxury but for those who would rather have a very clean room (they even wash the bed spreads here and there are no mouldy smells and no bugs) with cooking facilities, air conditioning, a relaxed and down to earth Hawaiian experience and exceptional value for money. You can't ask for a better location as this hotel is just a few minutes walk to Waikiki beach and the Grove would have to be the cheapest place around. You could pay double for something and not get a room to this standard. We requested a room to be located on the upper levels facing the pool because I read in other reviews that it can get noisy if you are facing the street. We found it very quiet at night in our Category 1 room on the fifth floor which could sleep three people. There are also larger rooms for families or groups travelling together so the saving is even better. If you stay for a week the maid service is twice a week but we only needed to clean the room once a week (that's how relaxed we felt there). We loved the free entertainment every Wednesday night with ""hoolah time""!!!This was our second trip to Hawaii and on our third trip we will be going back to The Grove. The money we saved on the hotel and with cooking our own breakfast we happily spent at Ala Moana and Waikelie Premium Outlets...our suitcases were so full!!!! If you are travelling from Australia you are allowed 2 suitcases each and 32 kilos maximum each so pack light because the money you save here you will be investing in your wardrobes!! Local shopping is magnificent!!!!

We booked it primarily for the price and the location. We knew going in that it wouldnt be the greatest thing in the world...and we were right. Having said that however, we didnt spend all that much time in the room anyways. There is just too much to see and do on the island to spend your time at the hotel. The location was awesome. Less than a 5 minute walk to the beach and ABC stores. Love the ABC stores!!! Our room was a good size. It had a queen, but it felt more like a full, and a twin bed in it. I will say this though, the bed [--]. It was hard and didnt have hardly any cushion. It felt like it was probably from the 60's. The room had a fridge, microwave and kitchen utensils, which was nice cause we made our own lunches and saved cash this way too. We also had a nice big lanai and would eat breakfast out there everyday. Our biggest problem with the hotel was the AC. The first day we got there it was on but it was cranking out absolutely no cold air. We told the front desk staff and they got us a portable AC unit that was on the floor. This cooled off the room for the most part but it was a real pain in the rear. WE had to empty out the water behind the unit when it got too full and even this wasnt enough because we were gone so much. It always overflowed and our carpet was soaked. That made walking on the floor not so pleasant. There was no parking on site and we had to walk 4 blocks to the Waikiki Banyan where it was 40 bucks for a week to park. It wasnt bad considering we were in paradise but after a while it gets to be a long walk. Other than the AC issue and the bed being too hard it was an alright place to stay. We knew going in that it was nothing spectacular and that is OK. I got a kick out of people who thought this place was supposed to be a 5 star place. However, I do think that the given all of the reviews on this place that it is a bit over rated. If you are looking for a very cheap place to stay (we paid 500 bucks for 8 days) than this is the place for you. Would I stay here again? I would really, really have to think about it.

I had heard about the hotel from some friends who stay there all the time. My first reaction to the cost of the rooms was ""HUH?"" It is as you see it on the website. There are no fancy frills here. Simple honest to goodness family style hotel. The Fong family has done a fantastic job and there are so many of their memories throughout. Surf boards, a quilt done by Mrs. Fong. If you can get a room pool side, it is much quieter. But our AC became the hum we needed to drown out the rest of the noise. Kitchen was fully stocked with cookware and essentials and after a trip to the supermarket, we were all set to go. It was so wonderful to be able to step out on our balcony in the morning with a cup of coffe and sit and watch the sun rise as the tropical tradewinds blew across you. When traffic was quiet, you could hear the rolling surf from up the street. It is literally right up the street to the beach. There is also a wonderful landmark which is the Duke Kahanamoku statue on the beach of Waikiki. You are within walking distance to so many great things from the hotel. The International Market Place, Kapiolani Park, just to name a few. The only downside is there is no parking. SO...if you are renting a car, you will need to do like we did. We parked at the Waikiki Banyan which is about 2 blocks away, and paid the weekly rate to park our car. There are locations closer, but they have a high daily rate to park in their garage. That was a minor inconvienence for the money we saved with our room. They have beach chairs and mats you can use to go to the beach. There is music on Wednesday evenings as the Fong 'Ohana would come and play music with their friends. There was music and dancing, food and laughter had by all. It was great getting to meet some of the other guests that were staying there. I ran in to sooo many who have been to the Royal Grove 4+ times. We'll be joining the return to Royal Grove club. It is simple and basic and a treasure right in the heart of Waikiki. Debbie and Steve were great behind the Front Desk. They were always cheerful and helpful and then there is Emilio. He sits on his perch at the door to the hotel and greets everyone with his chirps and whistles.I am recommending this hotel to all I know and we will definitely be staying there again!

It was in a fantastic location. We could walk to Waikiki, as it was 1.5 blocks away. Therefore we got to experience the nightlife of Honolulu. It was also a fantastic price, considering what other hotels in the area charge.That said, it had some downsides. The woman at the desk was incredibly unhelpful. She spent most of her time on the phone to her friends, and when I disturbed her (by asking a quick question) she made it clear I was a pain. I was not impressed by her level of customer service. The guy on the desk is much more helpful, but unfortunately the woman seems to be on it far more. When I told her that our AC was not working, and neither were the powerpoints on the right hand side of the wall in our room she said ""I'm not surprised, everything in this place is falling apart"". Our AC got fixed but we had to live without the powerpoints. The night without the AC was terrible. I could not sleep with the humidity. This was not helped by the noise. Forget NYC being the city that never sleeps, Honolulu is. The walls do not block out sound, and people seemed to love making noise in the hallway (usually between 1am-4am), which is not the hotels fault but it certainly is frustrating. All up, considering the price I got what I paid for. If I ever returned to Hawaii I would probably find another hotel slightly better. As a tourist I would have loved desk staff who answered my questions readily.","Sydney, Australia",20,2.0

The worst part was the parking situation really as it was hit and miss every day as to whether there would be space in the lot across the street. When there wasn't we had to go to another lot about a 10 minute walk away (through an area which becomes pretty seedy late at night).

The room has a refrigerator and a small kitchen, however we didn't get to use it. The hotel provides a safety deposit box for valuables for free which is good.

Well the hotel is suited for the budget traveller that doesn't really care about major hotel amenities. If you are a stickler with regards to amenities such as a hair blower, large bathroom, modern looking facility etc., then this hotel is not for you. However, if budget is your concern this is the place for you. Even if you can afford any place, this is still a great place to stay if you don't like hanging around the hotel any way.

We recently stayed several nights in Honolulu, on Waikiki Beach, and were utterly charmed by this old style, old Hawaii hotel. Our rate was $62 for an airconditioned room on the second floor overlooking the pool -- just a 4 minute walk to the beach. Amazing, for this location -- when most places are in the $300 and up (way up) per night range!! Thanks Fong family, for offering up such a treasure as your hotel. We sincerely hope this place stays in your family for generations to follow. The room offered a full bed, plus a small twin, a full kitchen and fridge, appointed with everything you'd need to cook a meal, bake a cake, or microwave a quick snack. Cute little balcony, great shower with excellent pressure, and very acceptable, comfortable beds. This place is set up for long term stays as well, with on-site coin laundry, very reasonable internet access and rates- 1 accessible computer in a small room off the lobby ($1 for 10 minutes, you keep track on your own and pay at the desk when finished), a small shelf of books to borrow, and more. In the same building -- right next door was an inexpensive little Asian restaurant that did noodles and such at night, and best of all a great breakfast of eggs, etc, for around $3.50. There's a small grocery right next store, and another across the street -- very convenient. There is a small pool, and the location can NOT be beat. You are within walking distance of so many great spots in Waikiki. You can have drinks like we did at the Sheraton Moana SurfRider, under the famous banyan tree, or watch the sunset at the House Without a Key -- and then leisurely stroll back to your own room knowing you've saved hundreds upon hundreds of dollars by not actually staying at those places. It felt great, we were patting ourselves on the back, I have to say -- thanks all you tripadvisor reviewers who shared your knowledge of this hotel. Our room was very sparsely decorated, with old style 60's/70's decor & furnishings giving it a kitschy feel. Everything was very clean, so though it was older style, it did not feel ""old"". Some of the vintage Pyrex in the cupboards, or the lighting fixtures for example, would bring a mint on eBay! The lobby is a treasure trove of kitschy old Hawaiian items, from surfboards to tourist knick-knacks, to old botanical prints, and an old stereo my husband just loved, plus old bamboo style furniture -- even the requisite mascot bird, cared for by an older woman who said she awoke every morning like clockwork to feed and clean the birdcage. Loved it. For sure, this is not luxury -- it's more ""kitschy motel room"". The room is spare, and the street noise was pretty loud. No one will turn on the A/C prior to your arrival, and no turn down service. It's quite loud on the weekend, actually. (The airconditioner functioned for us as white noise to block out the street below). For this reason, I would not classify this as a 'romantic' place to stay, but, more of a fun step back in time. There is a real sense of community at this hotel, primarily because it is filled with active seniors who stay for long durations. For example, the small table in the lobby has a hand-lettered sign that reads ""reserved"" for 7 pm every night for the ladies poker games. I think being over 70 was a prerequisite for buying in to that game! In our 40's we were most definately the youngest guests at the time. Still, we loved it, and found it very welcoming. This is old style --- : No hairdryers in the rooms, but, we were able to get one at the front desk, use it, and return it. Coffee is available in the mornings in the lobby, with styrofoam cups, and a small sign asking that guests observe the 1 cup per guest rule. Making a long distance call requires the front desk to place it for you (you can call from the privacy of your room, but, you have to ask the front desk staff to place the call for you) It's that kind of place. We were lucky enough to be there for one of the famous pot luck dinners, on Chinese New Year! There was music by Mr Fong on Ukele and friends, two hula dancers, and more food (must have been 50 dishes to pass on that table!) than you can imagine. Hey -- those seniors know how to cook! The only other point I would make was that the long term guests do congregate around the pool to socialize at various points -- from mornings, to the early evening, and since the 1st floor rooms have tables and chairs right up around the pool, the pool area is not 'relaxing' -- as in you wouldn't plan to lay out reading a book by the pool... it's more of a spot to socialize. Still, having a pool on a hot day, when you just want a quick dip in some fresh water, was really great. And you can find a million (it seems) deserted beaches, or otherwise, to relax and read your book somewhere on Oahu. We would love to get a chance to go back to Waikiki, and would without question stay at the Royal Grove. We were charmed by it's style, it's family of owners, the price, the location, and the fun sense of community -- people were ALWAYS in the lobby it seemed, just chatting, talking about thier plans for the day, and socializing.

Spend a few extra bucks and get a room with AC - it helps drown out the outside noises. Buy some groceries and take advantage of the in-room fridge to help cut food costs.

We are an upper middle-class family and could easily afford a more upscale hotel but we truly liked the casual atmosphere there at the Royal Grove.....like ""no worries"" kind of atmosphere. You just stroll in and you can wear exactly what you feel like there (no need to dress up). The room was basic and you definitely have to overlook certain things because fancy it ain't.... :) but our room was fully equipped with everything we needed...we had a stove, full-sized fridge, kitchen sink and it was fully stocked with dish rack, silverware, fry-pan, bowls, mugs, glasses, spatula, and dishtowels, etc., etc. We had our own balcony and you could allmost throw a pebble up to the waterfront. The Hyatt is across the road and up about 50 yds or so and I can guarantee you that those people are paying a heck of alot more than we did and for what? Our room was very clean and the maids did a great job of cleaning up all the sand we dragged in everyday and everyone there just smiles at you and they are all just super friendly. They have lots of things for you to use, such as sand toys for the little ones, boogie boards, they did have a few snorkel equipment also and this is all on an ""honor system"". They have a dining table downstairs and a small pool to use, however I cannot imagine why you would come to Waikiki to use a pool for heaven's sake. Emelio, the cockateil is there in the reception area to great you, however he does go to bed quite early so you need to visit with him early in the day. The foyer area is filled with all kinds of traditional hawaiian memorabilia and surfboards on the walls and a couple around the lounge area...(would you see this at the Hyatt???? I think not!)

In addition to finding someone to talk to, you will find magazines, a computer (with reasonable use rates), newspapers, and a piano. You might just find someone to sing along with your playing.In addition, guests get the use of beach mats and children's beach toys that are kept neear the front door, the lobby. There are fresh towels near the pool, which can also be used there or can be checked out for use at the beach, so you don't use your room towels.The rooms are adequate and kept clean, even with only twice weekly maid service. While a little more attention could be given to cleaning under and behind the beds, even my ""cleanaholic"" wife was satisfied with how well they were maintained. If you just can't live without fresh towels and wash cloths, you can request them from a maid as she cleans another room, or get them in the lobby.Parking IS a little bit of a problem. Parking is at the Royal Monarch, across the street. Their parking garage was built for japanese cars - very tight. But, in a city where parking is at a premium, the $6/day was worth it.This AIN'T the Marriott, the Hyatt, or any of those other overpriced industrial monoliths, where everything is at your beck and call. If you want them, you have to pay their prices. This is just a very charming, very comfortable, family-owned hotel. If you use a vacation hotel for more than to shower, sleep, shave, and change, go to the Hyatt. If you go on vacation to see the sites, lay on the beach, hike Diamondhead, enjoy the nightlife, and do a little souvenier shopping and spend a grand total of 8-10 hours per day in the hotel, this is the place for you. If we return to Oahu, WE SHALL RETURN.","Winston-Salem, NC",26,4.0

Could not agree more with the previous reviewer in that it is a fantastic location for the price of the room. Do not expect luxury at this hotel, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for, but when you are here to see Waikiki and not your hotel room you can do far worse than the Royal Grove. After a week walking up and down Waikiki I think this is the perfect location. Only a 2 minute stroll away from the beach, and that is when the ""Do not walk"" signs are on just before the beach road:-) The hotel is old and the furnishings are not great but this is a happy hotel and the staff do almost anything to oblige. You get towels to take down to the beach, coffee in the morning if you cannot be bothered to use the coffee maker in your room and the owners pot luck dinners to look forward to if you are there at the right time. Safety deposit boxes at reception are free. Street noise can be a problem as the hotel is located near to a busy road.

The staff was particularly helpful and friendly. We always felt welcome, at home and all our requests were handled promptly and with courtesy. The location of this hotel could only be bettered by a beachfront property, and in this price range such a notion would be out of the question.The Royal Grove is a short block from the center of action on Waikiki. We were moments away from the free nightly entertainment at the beach (6:30PM), were able to conveniently and safely take our daily walk south and through the park and zoo area. It would be hard to find a hotel more conveniently located in the Waikiki area.The room was adequate for our needs and very clean. On the down side, the air conditioner could not cool both rooms, so we kept the door closed between the two. The street facing windows required that we keep our drapes closed at all times to avoid putting on a display for the neighbors across the street.All in all, this was a very good value.

Living here in the islands costs enough as it is, so all I was looking for was a clean, cheap place to lay our heads. I spent a good three or more hours going over reviews before deciding to stay here, and I'm so glad I picked it. Not only is it really affordable at $60/night for the type of room we needed, but it was close to EVERYTHING! My family flew in from all over the U.S. because my cousin was playing a football game against U.H. and they all stayed at places like the Hyatt and privatly owned house rentals. For the amount of time we all actually spent in our rooms, we all agreed I made the wisest choice. The staff was great, the rooms were clean and included, fridge, stove, and microwave. They also had avaliable, boogie boards, surf board and other beach stuff, for free! Now I do have to say that if you are looking for luxury, spas, and pampering, this is NOT the place to stay. It is a older small family owned hotel. While I was there, I was waiting next in line to add on an extra night, and the couple who were foriegners, in front of me were complaining that there was a cockroach that someone had ""planted"" in thier room. Well all I have to say to that, is welcome to Hawaii. There are more cockroaches than people in Hawaii. You're lucky you only saw one! Anyway, I just wanted to share that this was one of my better choices in life! The Royal Grove was great, and anyone who says different should pay the extra money it costs to stay at the Marriott or Hyatt. You get what you pay for and I ended up getting a lot more than I expected. The next time my family and I go to Oahu, we will most definatly be staying at the Royal Grove and spending the extra money we saved on ourselves out and about while we are there.

I searched the Internet, read the reviews concerning The Royal Grove Hotel and felt quite comfortable in reserving for a two week stay, which averaged a daily rate of $37.50. Upon arrival I was sceptical of our room, which was in the older wing - clean, but provided neither balcony or air conditioning. While I was made aware of this while I was booking online and felt it unnecessary, I changed my mind when the 85 degrees of heat and 100 % humidity pressed against my body. My husband and I asked at the front desk if we could be upgraded and by the end of the day we were in a room three times the size of the space before. Mind you, the price changed to $59.00 (taxes included) but it was worth every U.S. penny. It had all the comforts of home including a mini bar, stove/oven, microwave, balcony and A/C. Kithchenware was provided but next time I would bring a few plastic beer glasses (for around the pool), a cork screw (one wasn't provided - unless you visit room 202. We forgot ours there!), and a small bottle of dish detergent. The bed was utterly soft and comfortable, and the water pressure in the shower was perfect and we never ran out of hot water. When we asked if it was possible to stay in our room for a few extra hours since our flight wasn't leaving until 6:00 - there wasn't even a moments hesitation. To sum up the hospitality of Mr. Wong and his management was the posting in the elevator a few days before our departure back to Canada. It was an open invitation to all guests to sign up for Thanksgiving supper on November 25th - hosted by the Wong family. Another note to mention is the Oahu Discovery Passport bus pass. It costs $20.00 for 4 consecutive days of unlimited travel. Available at any ABC store. It is recommended to also purchase a Map and Guide Book at the same time ($4.99).

We were really impressed that they would do something like that and felt like part of the family. What was neat to find out was that other people felt like that too. So many couples we met at the potluck were regulars to the hotel that come visit year after year. The hotel is not a resort, so don't be expecting luxury accomodations. However, it was clean, and the location cannot be beat (1 block from Waikiki Beach)! The price is outstanding for the area. Even parking was cheap! Other 'luxury' hotels in that area cost a fortune for the room, and then for parking, so when put in that perspective, you are really getting a deal.

Substance over style. Will be back, will recommend to friends. Request a room w/ AC. Free papers too.","Dillon, CO",17,5.0

When I first walked into the room, I was put off by the ""look"" of the room, (it's definitely older) but after a long day of being tourists, the character of the room grows on you! This Hotel is right in the middle of Waikiki, and how can you beat that! It is 2 blocks from Waikiki Beach, not only that, but the penicle of Waikiki Beach! The action around this area is almost non-stop, but because you are 2 blocks away, you tend to get somewhat less noise. Just MAKE SURE you get directions on how to get there, as well as how to get out of there, the main highways can be a bit difficult to navigate around Honolulu. ","St. Paul, MN",3,4.0

The hotel treated us like family...guest potlucks at the pool, extra TLC, etc. 2 blocks from the beach. We had a suite with a very large kitchen and the price was very reasonable for Hawaii. Loved it and would go back anytime.","Rapid City, SD",5,5.0

It is extremely well maintained and the location is too good to be true. The best thing about the hotel is the incredibly friendly staff. The whole place has a very homey feel because most people who stay there have been coming back for years and years. I think that this speaks very highly of the staff.We've stayed there twice, and have already booked for next year:o)","Victoria, British Columbia",4,5.0

It is clean with no frills, efficiently run, and blessed with genuinely pleasant and helpful staff. It is two blocks from Kuhio Beach, a short walk from the Zoo and the Waikiki Public Library, and right on the bus lines. There are several reaonable local restaurants on the same block, as well as VIP car rental office just around the corner. There's a courtyard with a clean, pleasant pool; a small paperback library; and a modest lobby with comfortable chairs. Air conditioners mask the noise of the street below. It's also painted the same pink color as the Royal Hawaiian, so it's very easy to spot.","Eugene, OR",12,4.0

The hotel is no frills; but clean and comfortable. The owners - the Fong Family and the front desk staff are helpful and make us feel as part of the family when we are there. We like to use our travel dollars on things other than our hotel; so the Royal Grove fits our needs perfectly. We also like that it is very conveniently located to the bus lines, the beach and other hotels. It is just five stories; not a high rise which we also like. The Royal Grove is like our home away from home while in Waikiki. We can be to Kuhio beach in a minute. They have boards, chairs, mats to borrow. There is a small pool. The only down side that we have found is that some of the rooms can be noisy. We have met people from all over the world while staying there.The Royal Grove would not be for people who like luxurious, pampered surroundings. It is for travelers who like a comfortable bed to sleep in after a long day of experiencing Hawai`i.",Florida,18,4.0
