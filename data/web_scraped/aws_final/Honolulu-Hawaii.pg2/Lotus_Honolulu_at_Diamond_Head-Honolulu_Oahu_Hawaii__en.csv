While we could not do anything but walk along the street by the lovely park nearby we had a great view of the ocean from our room - where needless to say we spent most of our time before our flight home. But the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, and the hotel restaurant was doing limited menu dinner “take-out” delivered to your room.

If you can score a corner room facing Diamondhead it is one of the best views in town—ocean to city with Kapiolani Park and Diamondhead right off your balcony. If you enjoy birding, the balcony is a great place to spot the birds of the park. The service is really great. They take the time to know your preferences and accommodate you. Plus, the lobby coffee is delicious (not that weak watery stuff so many hotels serve up). Great place to stay!","Los Angeles, California",4,5.0

Because of the COVID-9 situation, they allowed us to cancel the last 4 nights without penalty even though we were past the refund cutoff...and, they helped us by refunding the original cost deposit and gave us the present ""COVID-9"" pricing, virtually half the original price.Everyone of the staff were very helpful and full of Aloha, in the midst of their own difficulties during this period.We are forever Lotus Fans !!!","Hilton Head, South Carolina",32,5.0

I like that it is away from the crowds--I always walk up to the other hotels and restaurants along Waikiki Beach if I feel the need, and get a taxi back after dark. The hotel is small and basic but very clean, and the views from my room were great. The bed was fantastic. Although it could use some updating in some of the rooms (I heard they might be planning renovations) it is a nice place to stay.

The ONLY complaint I have is that after a long flight, driving in the dark - the sign is very hard to see. We drove by a few times! However, everything else about the Lotus was fantastic. The staff was all very helpful and pleasant. The location is off the main strip so it is a bit more quiet, which we very much enjoyed. It is walking distance from the heart of Waikiki Beach, we walked to and from numerous times a day. There is immediate beach access too. There is an onsite restaurant with a wine down (that means free wine!). They also offer free ocean safe sunscreen which came in great packages that fit in a purse or bag easily. You can sign out beach chairs, blankets, umbrellas and I think even coolers. It was a great perk. There is valet parking at no extra charge. Last but not least - they offer free filtered water and a reusable water bottle (that is super cute and stylish). We really hope to go back again!","Edmonton, Canada",0,5.0

We really enjoyed being within walking distance to the main Waikiki Beach, but removed from the craziness. Would have loved to have a pool and gym, but the beach next door was beautiful and always much calmer/less windy than any other beaches we went to and made up for it. And jogging around the park across the street made up for missing the gym. The lobby/elevator/hallways could use some updating but the rooms and the restaurant were great. We only had happy hour snacks and drinks at the restaurant but everything we had was delicious. Really enjoyed having a balcony in our room, even though it was mostly a view of a parking lot we could still look out at Diamond Head and enjoyed the nice breeze. The staff was also so friendly and helpful all the time.

The rooms are very clean, nicely done and the views of the water, the popular diamond mountain and the beautiful sprawling park are magnificent! I enjoyed all the furnishings and the over-all interior design and set-up of the hotel. You will have no clue from the outside but as soon as you get in the lobby you will be greeted with a very fine, very well put together decor with a very classy taste.The Tbd restaurant by Chef Vikram on the second floor offers superb dining. He cooks not just from the heart but from the soul with so much passion, skills and techniques that translate into these wonderful flavors, textures and quality of every single dish he proudly delivers to the dining table. The bar offers a variety of drinks as well with some very special housemade infusions. Above all, Chef, the owners and their family and all the staff of this hotel are the true gem. Our family were one of the victims of the recent unfortunate fire incident in Honolulu and they took us in, gave us a complimentary room, fed us and showed us an overwhelming support, sympathy and compassion.

Coffee is served in the lobby from 6 to 10 a.m., and it’s several cuts above average. You can borrow bicycles, as well as everything you’d want at the beach. The only downside is the restaurant on the second floor. The food is fine, but the prices are . . . well, several cuts above average. The $8 iced tea was a revelation (nothing wrong with it except that it should have cost $5 less). Fortunately, there are plenty of less expensive (but very nice) restaurants close at hand.

I prefer to not go into Waikiki at all, but the Diamond Head location of the Lotus makes staying in town more enjoyable. Unfortunately, the location is really the best thing that the Lotus has going for it.The good: - The Lotus is clean and the staff is friendly. - The hotel is small and you never feel like you're swimming in a sea of tourists which is something I really look for. - They have beach chairs and mats you can borrow.- Close to the less-crowded Sans Souci beach and walking distance to everything Waikiki has to offer.Things you should know: - Parking is included in the daily ""amenities fee"" ($29 at the time I wrote this).- The term ""ocean view"" is used liberally by the Lotus. We spent extra for the Premium room and you could definitely see the ocean, but only through the gaps of the much larger buildings that are between the Lotus and the beach. - When I book a room for 3 people, I expect for there to be a place for each person to sleep. We had one king bed and when they brought in the roll-away the room felt cramped and we had to climb over it to get to the lanai. Rooms are small.- The bar/restaurant is nice but it's dark and modern. If you want that island vibe, you need to go over to the beachfront New Otani next door. Conclusion: I didn't really feel like the Lotus was a good value and even though we really try to make the best of things and not be big complainers, there were things about it that were constantly making us feel disappointed. Honestly, I feel like the property is misrepresented in the marketing and on the website. I wish I had read more of the 2-3 star reviews here before booking.","Seattle, Washington",4,3.0

Deciding where to stay in or near Waikiki was more challenging than expected. After studying maps and reading tons of reviews and screening targeted hotel ads we chose The Lotus. It was perfection. The location on the far edge of Waikiki next to the park and at the base of Diamond Head was lovely. We could walk bike or Lyft to restaurants easily. The park setting looking over trees and a quiet boulevard removed us from the chaos of the crowded concrete jungle of central Waikiki hotel zone. We walked the park morning and evening. Discovered the community gardens there and met some wonderful people. Lotus is a smaller boutique property that was just right sized and their customer service was personal. Valet parking (free) was an unexpected bonus. Their valets are smart warm and personable and efficient. Because it is smaller there was no wait time for our car. Our partial ocean view king room on the sixth floor faced both Diamond Head and the park to the left and viewed the ocean toward the right. Not a full ocean view but we could see waves. Best part is that the lanai (balcony) was never in full sun. A welcome respite from 7 days of full sun on the Big Island. The rooms are updated beautifully spacious and well appointed. The wall of glass on the lanai were actually two huge glass doors that opened wide. Instead of drapes which can be messy to open there are rolling white shutter doors for privacy and light control. So pretty. The closet was huge. The fridge and microwave were in a big cabinet that enabled us to tuck away our light food stash out of sight. The bathroom was gorgeous with large counter and an extra shelving unit on which we could lay out our personal care items I’ve never seen so much usable bathroom shelf space in a hotel. They provided a complimentary reusable travel water bottle and sunscreen This hotel was quiet because it doesn’t have a million rooms. They provide coffee and tea service in the morning in the lobby which was perfect. We didn’t need a free breakfast buffet and it’s chaos. We bought cereal and yogurt at the nearby convenience store and enjoyed breakfast and coffee on our lanai before heading out each morning. If we wanted a big breakfast restaurants were easily walkable nearby. They provide beach chairs mats towels and bikes to use daily. The semi private beach is just a few steps away through the parking lot. We had an issue with the air conditioning and their technician reset it within 5 minutes of the call. Amazing attention.  Our reservation included a car rental (bonus) since I booked direct with the hotel. It saved us quite a bit and we got a great room at a great price. It is a beautiful classy and wonderful hotel. I recommend it for guests seeking a quiet retreat. I will book here again on future trips to Honolulu.,Cleveland Ohio,60,5.0

First the bad: second night we were enjoying our balcony when we smelled cigar smoke. The smell was very strong and unpleasant. I called the front desk and they said they would do their best to locate it. We went in and closed our doors to avoid it. Next morning, sitting on our balcony having coffee, the smell of cigarettes came our way. Again very strong and unpleasant. I looked over the rail, and directly to our left there were 2 men, one with a cigarette. I said ""excuse me, but this is a no smoking property, even on the balcony"" The smoker took a puff and blew it my way. I said "" Seriously? I will have to call the front desk if you do not put that out."" Both men began verbally abusing us, calling us ""trash Americans"", one guy turning his butt to us and patting it saying ""here, this is for you"" I called the front desk. I went back out and one of the men was telling my almost 70 year old husband that he was going to ""come see"" my husband. We went downstairs and talked to Sarah, the front desk person. She said they said ""sorry"", and they would follow the policy. They were given a warning, but not fined the $450 charge for violating the rule. We said we wanted them moved, because we did not feel comfortable being right next to people who boldly verbally abused us and tried to intimidate us. She said she could not move them because the only open room would have been a downgrade. When I signed the contract it was VERY clear that there was to be no smoking. These customers spoke great English; I am sure they signed the same contract. It does not seem right that they were allowed to abuse other customers, violate rules they agreed to, and they have no consequence. The manager chose to offer us the only other available room- the penthouse suite for our last night. We accepted, though packing up and moving was a hassle. The penthouse is HUGE - way too big for 2, but has a fabulous view. We actually prefered our first room. It was very comfortable and had a very nice view. All staff were friendly, and other than the abusive smokers, we thought the hotel was great. The valet parking was so convenient, with super friendly and helpful attendants. Obviously this property will continue to have people violate their no- smoking policy if they don't actually enforce it. Too bad, because otherwise it is a little gem.",Hood River,0,3.0

The hotel itself is extremely nice, clean and has a very friendly staff. We had a premium room which had a view over the park, walkway, partial ocean view and over the top of a garage (which was beautifully landscaped). Birds visited our balcony daily. It was wonderful to sit out on the balcony in the early a.m. and p.m. If you visit and stay here, please get a premium room or you may be disappointed as the other rooms overlook parking lots. Our room was beautiful!I am rating this hotel with 4 stars and not 5 stars because when we stayed here the restaurant was closed. The Lotus is under new management and they are updating the restaurant. This would not usually be a problem; however, the Lotus is located on the other end of Waikiki and it is a half mile walk down the walkway to restaurants and shops and then another half mile back to the hotel. There are only two (expensive) restaurants located nearby the Lotus: Michel's At the Colony Surf (fine dining dinner only) next door and The Hau Tree Lanai across the parking lot. We suggest that if you book this hotel and don't have access to the hotel's restaurant, you may want to use TheBus service which is available very close to the Lotus and drops off throughout Waikiki. On nice days or in the a.m., the walkway is wonderful for exercise or just enjoying the views up the ocean coast or park. The Lotus is a boutique hotel and has a lot of nice services offered: wine in the late afternoon, turn down service, daily cleaning and boutique quality soaps, shower gels, hair shampoos and conditioners, slippers, and robes. A very nice, quiet hotel that is nearby the beach and walkway to everything Waikiki has to offer. The Lotus does not have a pool but the beach is very close by. Due to the fact that the Lotus is currently under new management, some of the services advertised have been discontinued. Also, staff mentioned that the Lotus is going to be completely updated soon.

We started our trip at the Lotus Honolulu for three nights and had an overall good experience. The ocean view premium room we booked was worth the upgrade, as the room was very spacious and offered an amazing view of Diamond Head. However, there are two buildings between this hotel and the beach, so there was no direct beach view and beach access was through a (somewhat difficult to find) walkway that led out to a small beach area in front of a restaurant (no privacy). You are much better off walking out of the front of the hotel to the sidewalk and to your left around a few buildings to a larger and nicer beach area. Parking was valet only and the valets were very friendly and helpful with all our questions. One of my favorite surprises about this hotel was Wisp Restaurant, really amazing food and happy hour specials but unfortunately it sounds like it is no longer open. AVOID THE COFFEE MAKER IN THE ROOM, it had stagnant water in the tank that gave me a rather bad stomach ache the first morning. Instead, in the lobby area there is good coffee served in the morning and a free wine reception in the evening.

My mother and I return to Honolulu after scoring those coveted $100 roundtrip flights on Southwest from Oakland. I called up Lotus Honolulu because we were definitely going to stay there again. The only thing that gave us pause was that the Lotus was under new management as of January 2019. Since we so thoroughly enjoyed our first stay, we were concerned that the Lotus that we came to know and love would drastically change while under new management.The rooms are well appointed with either a king or two queen-sized beds, flat screen TV, wet bar with mini refrigerator and microwave. They were also balconies that offered picturesque views of Waikiki and Diamond Head. Thankfully our fears were not well founded. We actually fell in love with Lotus all over again and truly came to appreciate the sense of Ohana (family) as expressed from Travis, JR, Dev, Carissa, Sarah just to name a few. You cannot get a better value than the Lotus Honolulu in the Waikiki / Diamond Head area. The resort fee is quite reasonable and huge shock it includes complimentary warm valet parking from the likes of Travis and Dev! The daily resort fee covers the beach towels, beach chairs, and free bicycle rentals.The front desk staff (JR, Carissa, and Sarah) were always courteous and helpful, from making sure that we were comfortable in our rooms, ensuring that we could enjoy the complimentary coffee in the morning as well as the wine happy hour in the evening. They were always glad to assist us in finding the best bars and restaurants on the island.Daily Happy hour between 4:00 pm and 6:00 pm with red and white wine with bar snacks (like popcorn, pretzels, etc.)Daily Hawaiian coffee and tea in the lobby from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm.My mother and I had an amazing 9-day /8-night stay at the Lotus and had a difficult time saying goodbye and eagerly await returning to this special place.","San Francisco, California",2,5.0

It’s nothing much to look at from the street or even from the outside corridors to the rooms. But once you enter, you will find a lovely, cosy and spacious haven which is very clean, bright and comfortable. This hotel is all about attention to detail and attention to the guests’ comfort and needs. Management gave us gifts of a very useful water bottle, and a lockable beach bag for valuables. Free coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided each morning, and free espresso is also available in the room. At happy hour free wine is offered although my wife and I did not partake as we are non drinkers. We did make use of the free bikes with locks to go up to Waikiki for lunch. Since this is a very small hotel there is no pool or gym but two minutes away is a very secluded and beautiful beach good for swimming and snorkelling. Make sure you spend some time here as I think it is much more pleasant than the very congested Waikiki Beach. If you enjoy running, there is an amazing two mile loop around the park next to the hotel which attracts all sorts of runners. And if the weather is good the slow, long walk to Diamond Head is definitely worth it. The resort fee of 29$ is cheap for Honolulu and this fee includes free valet parking and phone calls. We had a car and we believe this will make your plans more flexible and convenient and your overall vacation much more enjoyable, especially since the Lotus is NOT close to the restaurants on the Waikiki strip, about half hour walk away or more. All in all this hotel is an amazing find for expensive Honolulu! I booked my room at a very reasonable price as they offer promotions all the time. I highly recommend the Lotus.

The web advertising pictures are however totally misleading - this is not a luxury boutique hotel. The entrance is near the underground drive-through, it looks like a down market billiard room. Lifts are extremely old and noisy, and walls are so thin .. if you have a room near the lifts like we did, then be ready for clunking and crashing noises at all hours. No breakfast, no uninterrupted view of the ocean despite us paying top category for an ocean room. Be prepared to primarily view the building in front blocking all ambiance.

We arrived very late due to flight delays and we were greeted by a gentleman who surprised us with a room upgrade. Our view from the 11th floor was simply spectacular- an ocean view from one lanai and an unobstructed view of diamond head from the other lanai. The room was everything we could’ve asked for. It was meticulous! I couldn’t believe how clean it was. The bed was very comfortable and I love it when the hotel provides slippers and robes. There was a mini fridge and microwave as well. Loved how environmentally-friendly this hotel was by providing a reuseable water container which can be filled with the water dispenser downstairs; reef-safe sunscreen was also provided for our snorkeling trips. I loved how I got great value out of the $25 daily resort fee which included valet parking, wifi, use of beach chairs and beach towels, coffee, tea and the newspaper each morning. As a frequent traveler the one thing that stood out to me was the friendliness of all the staff- by far the friendliest staff I’ve ever encountered at any hotel. Everyone genuinely seemed like they were happy to be there. The one area for improvement that I could identify was the hotel’s restaurant. We checked it out one night for dinner. The food was mediocre and the music was much too loud- I felt bad for those staying on the 3rd floor as they surely could hear the music throughout the night. With that being said, I wouldn’t hesitate to stay at the Lotus again the next time I’m in Honolulu. Thank you for a memorable stay!","Surrey, Canada",53,5.0

The complimentary coffee/tea, etc in the lobby in the morning, and the great happy hour with nice wines, nibbles and lovely musicians each evening were delightful. While there isn't an on-site pool, it isn't needed, as the quieter, beautiful beach is just 200 steps away (and Louts provides beach chairs, tatami mats and beach towels). The only ""downside"" was that the separately-operated restaurant on the 2nd floor seemed to have erratic times for service and a limited menu.

Just too much moisture locked in the room and the ac was broken and when I went to get ice there was mold on the rim. We tried to switch hotels but our travel agency was being difficult.

At most places, pets are not allowed and bringing one often results in ugly looks and attitude. Not at the Lotus Honolulu. My pooch and I were welcomed and felt like valuable customers.

Given those previous pleasant stays, I booked two nights for a quick pleasure stopover on Oahu on my way to Hilo from San Jose. My first night there I had to go to the hospital for an emergency surgery and ended up waking up the next morning on a ventilator in the ICU at Queens hospital in Honolulu. I knew I was going to be in the hospital for at least two or three more days to recover. I knew no one to help me on the island, and I had my room booked for one more night with all my clothes there at the hotel and a rental car due back the next day that was parked at the valet service at the hotel. That first morning in the hospital I got an email from Ward Almeida, the manager of the Lotus Hotel. He had been informed by his staff of my having to go to the hospital and apparently made some calls and found out I would be in the hospital for a couple more days. The email he sent informed me he had returned the rental car for me and cancelled my reservation for the hotel room for that night so I wouldn't be charged for a stay while I was recovering in the hospital. He also offered to have all my belongings delivered to the hospital. I called him later that day after being taken off the ventilator. I thanked him for his excellent service and asked if he could please store my belongings until I was released from the hospital as my new plan was to book another night at the Lotus once I was discharged. On the morning I was discharged from the hospital, I made a reservation at the Lotus for that night using their website.. Soon after I made the reservation, I received another email from Ward stating he noticed I had made a reservation and that he had also noticed the price was higher than the room rate of my original reservation as it was made with such short notice. He informed me he would be sure I would be charged the original rate of my original booking. I returned to the hotel that day and all my belongings were nicely organized in my room. I also received a bottle of wine, a box of chocolates, and a welcome back card from Ward sent up to my room. I have travelled extensively and have never experienced that kind of above and beyond service at a hotel before. I am very grateful to have received such excellent service.

It also faces Diamond Head crater and is very close to some of the best neighborhood eats in the area (about 1.5 miles to Monserrat Avenue restaurants). I had a government discount (ask for it; though not as good as military discount) that waived the daily activity fees and parking! And parking is by valet which is so convenient and quick. Also, free access to beach towels, chairs, free coffee/tea and wine happy hour!We had a couple of minor issues that the management quickly resolved -- although they continued to have trouble with their electronic keys working when we left on 6/11.There is a restaurant on the 2nd floor, but it's not owned by the hotel and somewhat pricey. So we took our breakfasts at Bogart's on Monserrat Ave most days (get there early and expect to wait online -- worth it.) However, we did do ala carte breakfast on our last day at the restaurant and it was good (and convenient), despite being pricey. They also have laundry facilities, but the dryers were not great. Luckily the rooms are not humid and our stuff dried quickly being hung in the closet.We had a premium room with 2 queen beds (be sure to specify and confirm bed type) and 2 balconies -- one that had a view of Diamond Head mountain, the other of the ocean (partial). I recommend a room on the 8th floor or higher for the best views. It's a small boutique hotel and pretty quiet, another thing we loved. I marked it as ""luxury"" in my review as the rooms are listed as >$240/night + resort fee. Will definitely go back again the next time we are in Honolulu.

The Premium Diamond Head room was clean & modern with a view of Diamond Head. I would recommend a higher view room. Loved the valet parking which was included. The valets were so kind. The resort had Tommy Bahama beach chairs that we could take in our SUV rental . The gentleman at the front desk even helped us take the chairs out of the trunk. So nice & very much appreciated. I loved that they had a free reusable water bottle in the room for us and a water cooler in the lobby to fill it, Nice touch and a small souvenir from our hotel. There was espresso in the room. Coffee in the lobby. The room has a small fridge, a safe, cute robes and slippers. The hotel has a wine reception each night and we did go twice. The wine was pretty good. Didn't love the gold fish crackers. The only complaint would have was the laminate wood floor in our room was buckling in a few spots.

It's about a 10~15 minute walk to the start of the bustle of Waikiki and the city of Honolulu. This ~51-room boutique hotel is not quite on the beach but is set back slightly from it with a couple of hotel/apartment buildings between it and the beach -- the buildings really do not spoil the view much, if at all. We had an Ocean View Premium Room on a high floor with 2 balconies (lanais) with fabulous views of the ocean, of Diamond Head and of the beautiful park behind the hotel. Our room was spacious, modern, very clean and comfortable. The hotel exuded an atmosphere of quiet, understated elegance and tranquility. The staff were incredibly efficient and friendly.If I could do it, I would rate this hotel 6.0 out of 5. I'm almost loathe to write such a glowing review lest this hotel is booked full for my next visit to Oahu. Dear reader, let's keep this place a secret between us -- tell only close friends :-)A few items of information:-Hotel has valet parking only but, unlike many local hotels, parking is included in the ~$25 resort fee.Happy hour in the lobby from 4pm-5:30pm -- (free) red and white wine and nibbles.Restaurant of 2nd floor (a separate business from hotel) is great -- well priced, good food and live music -- happy hour until 7pm.Breakfast:- 5~10min walk towards Waikiki to the Barefoot Cafe right on the promenade above the beach.

This area is much quieter than the bustle of the heart of Waikiki and this was exactly what we wanted. We woke up to the sounds of birds every morning.The $25 daily resort fee was very reasonable considering that it included gear for the beach (towels, pads, umbrella's, chairs), bicycles, coffee in the morning and wine in the afternoon. AND valet parking! Some of the hotels in the heart of Waikiki charge as much as $50/day for parking alone.Wisp, the in-hotel restaurant, was very good and we had a few meals there. It was especially nice to be able to grab dinner there our first night since we were dragging after our 8-hour flight and the 5-hour time difference from Texas.There is a small convenience store (Russell's) right next to the hotel where you can get drinks and snacks at a reasonable (for Waikiki) price. There are also a number of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel if you don't feel like getting the car.The housekeeping staff were unobtrusive and very efficient. We found that if we got the car in the morning for an hour or two, the room would be cleaned when we returned.

I had a feeling she is being personal, so I asked, and she admitted it. Right from the very beginning when we were checking in (it was April 5th) she was giving me an attitude while checking out other guests in more friendly way, those guests were the Americans. She was complaining that she has to do ""extra job"" by giving me a room with twin beds, although I have requested this during my booking. Is this something really that takes an effort? I did not request any upgrade, any special treatment, yet, she kept complaining that she is ""trying her best"", rolling her eyes, in order to give me a room with twin beds, which is obviously a difficult thing at the empty hotel.I didn't want to spoil my vacation and at the beginning I though that it only seems to me that way, but then my friend told me that this lady is being extremely rude. So I asked, why was she talking to me like that? And I couldn't believe what is literally said in a viscous way: ""Yes, I have hard time understanding you. Because you have an accent!""So this basically put a big ""no"" to this whole hotel and my experience with them. I simply do not tolerate rudeness and obviously this kind of place doesn't deserve any income from me.The hotel seems very old, more like for mature travelers, although the location is very good. There is no modern touch, smells like mold, even in the room that I was given to check if I like it, that had a wonderful parking view. It was a rainy day, we arrived at noon, she said the room will not be ready by 3pm, so I canceled my reservation and went to another hotel, which was amazing. I will not give my business to anyone with this attitude and I think those kind of actions should be strictly addressed with consequences. I would really like to receive some explanation from the management regarding this case. I hope that the management will not only provide polite reply, but actually will change their attitude and stop treating people badly. I also believe that people like her should not work in the hospitality industry. To all travelers: please never tolerate those kind of behaviors. You do not deserve to be treated this way in any hotel or anywhere else. Everyone has an accent, skin color and many other things, this is not a way to treat anyone, especially a guest. Never put up with anything like that, do not give those people business and make those cases public.","Riga, Latvia",62,1.0

The $25/day resort fee includes valet parking and a yoga class is offered every morning, usually in the park across the street. I have to say the yoga teachers are excellent. I myself am a certified yoga instructor and was impressed with the quality of the yoga classes, and the instructors ability to teach students of varying levels of experience was evident.

The hotel met and exceeded all of our expectations. To give you an idea of how it is situated with the rest of the hotels on Waikiki Beach, it is about a 15 minute easy walk on the beach to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel . The hotel is located on Kapi'olani Park at the base of Diamond Head, so it is in a park like setting, with lots of trees and is removed from the mass of humanity that you find in the main areas of Waikiki Beach. But as I mentioned, it is a very easy and short walk to all of Waikiki Beach. So you have what I consider the best of both worlds.The hotel staff was excellent. It is a small boutique hotel, so the staff quickly learns your name. All very helpful, friendly and professional. There is a mandatory $25 resort fee, and for once, you really get what you pay for. Valet parking is included in the resort fee and your car is always parked within steps of the door, so it never takes them more than a couple minutes to retrieve your car. The hotel is not on the beach, but it might as well be on the beach. There is a very nice dedicated beach area that was a closer walk from our room than many hotels we have stayed in that are on the beach. The hotel has towels and beach chairs as part of the resort fee. Everything super easy and quick to check out.Our room was fantastic. Corner room on the 7th floor overlooking Diamond Head. Everything in the room was perfect. Great shower, big bathroom, great air conditioning, oversized safe, refrigerator and very fast internet. There is coffee in the room, but the free coffee in the lobby was very good. Nice and strong, but not too strong.","Zionsville, Indiana",23,5.0

The restaurant on the 2nd floor is a little worse for wear, but the food was excellent for both dinner and breakfast. We did not take advantage of the free bikes, beach equipment or yoga classes, but will if we stay longer next trip. The major plus to this little gem is the staff.

Just minutes walking distance to the “main strip” and with a nice uncrowded beach right around the corner, this boutique 12 story hotel offers most of what larger hotels can offer. A big advantage is the quick and easy access to your car. Usually can just walk to your car just outside the entrance without having to wait for valet service - very convenient! Most rooms have partial ocean views and all have nice sized balconies.The rooms are modernly furnished with a relaxed and refined aesthetic, very comfortable. The bathrooms are spacious with lots of counter space and shelving for storage. Tips: There is a restaurant/nightclub on the 2nd floor which can get noisy on Friday and Saturday nights - so being higher up gets you away from the noise. You want a room on the 6th floor or above - definitely avoid the 3rd floor. Rooms that border the main street can also get some street noise, but many offer views of both Diamond Head and the ocean - so upper story rooms get you away from street noise as well.We are frequent guests of the Lotus and have always found the rooms to be clean and the staff friendly and helpful.

It’s a nice 20 min walk when we wanted to get to Waikiki, but we preferred staying close to the hotel in the peace.The hotel is small - only 5 rooms per floor - and the staff friendly.

Not a big deal for us, but there is only one elevator so if something goes wrong you’ll need to adjust. This may be the very first time this ever happened but I wanted to mention it because it may be important to someone. It did not affect my rating in anyway.The lobby is very nicely decorated. The rooms are attractive and serene and we loved our view. There is a resort fee of $25 per day (not a choice) so be prepared for that.

The service was fabulous, very friendly valet and front desk staff. Immediate disappointment when arriving at our Diamond Head view room and finding that we really just overlooked an ugly parking lot and can barely see the top of Diamond Head (through the trees) only if standing right on our balcony and looking to the far left. There was no bath but the shower was a bit awkward and had almost a small bathtub base that pooled water in it. We were excited to stay off of the strip but were planning to rely on the shuttle to still get to Waikiki for meals and touring. Unfortunately the program the hotel advertises to track the shuttles (so you know when they will arrive) was not working so we never knew when they were coming/going. It made it very difficult to make plans without sitting in the lobby waiting 30 minutes for the shuttle. Very frustrating when it could have been a great system. The good things are that the hotel is peaceful, the bike borrowing option is nice as well as the beach chairs for the beach which is small but very close. The rooms were clean and spacious.

The view from the good-sized balcony was spectacular- Diamond Head to the left and the ocean to the right.Valet parking is included in the $25 a day resort fee (along with a free wine happy hour, free morning coffee and newspaper and beach chairs and towels!) so you aren’t being gauged with add-on charges if you have a rental. We had family nearby, so we didn’t have a car. We used the shuttle service to Waikiki a few times, but decided the beaches by the hotel were less crowded and we didn’t want to shop. We also had privileges through family members to the Outrigger Canoe Club, so we were in a perfect location to take advantage of all that had to offer. We took various side trips and all the tour buses were willing to pick us up at the Lotus, so we weren’t penalized for being out of the main Waikiki area. All in all the Lotus is a great choice and one that will help to add many wonderful memories from your stay on Oahu. ","Sanibel Island, Florida",5,5.0

Older building, no fitness but they offer yoga. One elevator, which didn't work one day and that is an issue when you are on floor 12. Valet parking is convenient and pleasant a real plus. Our apologies as we forgot to tip one time for valet. Staff friendly. But the place needs upgrades. We stayed here two years ago, it was more in style then. Now trendy magazines spread out in room are many months old editions. Bedrooms are nice. Baths are how to deal with 60's apartment style. Offers wine in late afternoon and coffee in the morning. Note ocean view means a glimpse of ocean, not the full vista. Probably better to skip the cost for ocean view. Nice balcony with small table and two chairs. Microwave. mini frig, coffee maker.

It took us a few days to figure out the apples in the dish by the elevator were real and to just help yourself! The restaurant on the 2nd floor has taco Tuesday specials. A change from the over priced restaurants further down the beach. We particularly enjoyed using the hotel's tandem bike. It took a few minutes to get the hang of it but eventually got the rhythm and were about to enjoy a ride up and down Waikiki beach. All beaches are public but some are harder to access than others. So Lotus has their ""private"" beach a 100 yards down the path. Ask for beach chairs and snorkelling gear at the front desk. We were able to enjoy a corner suite with a full panoramic view of Diamond Head Park and a bit of the beach. Every morning we sat on the balcony and watched green, blue, yellow birds fly in and around the trees below. So magical.

It's much quieter than Waikiki and you have a feeling of living in a neighborhood (of beachside condo buildings) rather than a touristy area. The hotel has a wonderful small beach shared with a couple of the condo buildings and the Canoe Club. The resort fee includes beach chairs, mats, and towels, valet parking, wine-tasting every afternoon and yoga every morning, and since I take advantage of all of these, it's one place where I don't mind paying the fee. Rooms are large and pretty much identical, so there's not much fuss over which room to take. Higher floors have a slightly better view.The hotel is not for everyone, however. There are few restaurants and amenities in the immediate vicinity, so you can't just walk out your door to a large choice of restaurants, etc.. You will have to walk or bike .7 mile to the beginning of the main Waikiki area and then potentially further to arrive at your restaurant, store, club, take-out, or shopping. The hotel does provide a free shuttle bus into Waikiki and then into downtown Honolulu. Note also that there are three restaurants and one small convenient store within a few feet of the hotel. That said, IMHO the hotel works best with a car, Uber, or biking. The hotel provides free bikes that are quite nice and are well equipped with front and rear lights for riding at night. Also, the beach is small, private, and quiet and not a big scene with lots of bathers, volleyball, concerts, movies, vendors, etc. Just depends what you like.","Seattle, Washington",4,5.0

In a relative sense, that is true. It is located about a mile from the Waikiki ""strip,"" in an area mainly occupied by high-rise condos, across the road from Kapiolani Park in a pleasantly landscaped area.The decor adds to an impression of tranquility: a small lobby seating area with Asian furnishings and fresh orchids. No desks pushing tours, although I imagine the check-in personnel (helpful) can arrange what you are looking for if that's your goal. The guest bedroom we stayed in was on the small side though well appointed and cheerful.But The Lotus doesn't carry through its Zen-like vibe. The present management (which I suspect took the property over from the one that commissioned the design) seems to distrust the appeal of the quietness. In the public areas (including elevators) speakers play reggae and pop music.The Lotus's only restaurant -- and there are few others in the immediate neighborhood -- doubles as a sports bar and live music scene in the evenings. While the food is satisfying (we ate one dinner and every breakfast there) the multiple TV screens showing sports events and the bands shatter any pretensions to relaxation. The Lotus management seems to want to have it all ways for all people.On our second night when we went into the restaurant for dinner a bunch of oafs were setting up the sound equipment for the band and clowning around obnoxiously and loudly. We left and asked at the front desk for an alternative choice, and were directed to Miyako next door in the New Otani. It is very traditional Japanese, and if that suits you, you can be sure of an excellent experience at Miyako (try to get a table near the large window in the evening and watch the sunset). Meanwhile the Lotus's sports bar/restaurant offers, and I quote from their promotional material, ""entertainment nightly which varies between Jazz, Conemporary Hawaiian Dance Music, Rhythm and Blues, Comedy Shows and Special Movie Nights.""There is so much about the Lotus that is worthwhile, it's a shame management feels a need to go down-market and up-market at the same time, promoting a laid-back atmosphere and subverting it significantly.","Northern Virginia, Virginia",4,4.0

It is quiet, close to but not on the beach, has lovely rooms (spacious, nicely furnished, with comfortable beds and a good size shower rooms). The views of Diamond Head are good, but I would have been disappointed if I had particularly wanted a sea view since at best these are between other tower blocks. As far as I could tell, whatever floor you were on, you would be looking over a parking lot, although the higher the room, the less obvious this is.The hotel staff were without exception very pleasant. We requested a microwave oven at check-in, and the staff were already putting it in the room as we arrived. This was very handy, since many island activities start early and would require you to be out and about before breakfast is served. For example, sunrise at Diamond Head is popular; Pearl Harbor visitor center opens at 7 am, and you need to get there early if you like history but only have one day to spare.However, the Lotus Honolulu is not a resort hotel, the eating facilities are limited (and the restaurant was closed several nights of our stay for private functions), and there are not many other non-room-based facilities, which is fine if that is not important to you. We did have a rental car, and found the valet parking a minor nuisance (no fault of the staff, it just means having to remember to take everything from the car that will be required in the room). We were not tempted into eating places within walking distance.In summary, this is a really nice hotel if your main requirement is a good quiet room convenient for getting out and about, but if you are really into resort living, or lounging on a beach that's just outside your room, or very keen on nightlife or entertainment, or love to be waited on hand and foot, you will end up being disappointed. You have to work out some of these things by reading between the lines on the hotel's web-site, or studying TripAdvisor quite carefully, which in my opinion is a shame because it means someone who has not done their research might have unrealistic expectations. Having written that, we would very happily stay at the Lotus Honolulu again because it suited us very well.","Camberley, United Kingdom",96,5.0

Plus, I tried reporting the issues to the front desk when I checked-out; but, the woman at the front desk just shrugged & said, “Oh well, that happens sometimes.”What?! Zero customer service or attempt to rectify the problems! Over $200/night: ridiculous.Let me start by saying I’m local (just checked-out today...writing this immediately to warn others), so I am very familiar with other resort properties here. Comparatively, it deserves about a 5 or 6 max (out of 10; or, 3 out of 5), only if the cleanliness issues & malfunctions had NOT occurred. The property overall is noisy, outdated, and surrounded by parking lots (garbage - or other - trucks come through around sunrise & beep incessantly when backing out of the lot). Further, it is not an enclosed hotel; so, rather than an enclosed hallway insulating noise that echoes from the parking lots, every sound carries under the door & passes through thin walls...reverberating off of hard wood floors.When showering, the basin (like half of a hot tub at the bottom) filled with water rather than draining: disgusting. There were many large noticeable stains on the furniture. Also, the DVD player the front desk attendant talked-up when I checked-in (because the TV is terrible and offers only basic cable channels) is actually a PlayStation and did NOT work.I am out of space.

Your view of Diamond Head makes it seem like you can reach out and touch it! The blue Pacific is even closer. Take advantage of the hotel's yoga class held in Kapiolani Park which is just across the street. The attractions of Waikiki are a five minute stroll away--you won't need your car. The rooms are comfortably appointed with emphasis on the beautiful view past your lanai. The bathrooms are spacious and well designed both for function and aestheitics. I like that the floors are not carpeted but wood floors that look like the real thing but may be laminate. The housekeepers at Lotus do a marvelous job of keeping the rooms spotless! The lobby is very tastefully decorated. I really appreciated that it took less than one minute from the time I handed my car key to the valet to cross the lobby and enter the elevator to our room. It usually took longer than that because the friendly staff always had a smile and a recommendation for other fun activities--and then there's the complimentary wine in the afternoon. A very nice touch indeed! A true test of how well a hotel is managed is the morale of the the staff--do they like working there? I spoke with housekeepers, maintenance men and front desk staff. Not only do they say they like it, the proof is in how long they have worked here--unofficially, I would say an average exceeding ten years! And they don't fake the smiles! With all of the good things I have to say about the Lotus, I'd be remiss if I did not mention that it is a value when compared with other beachfront Waikiki properties.

There were 7 of us total staying at the Lotus, and they were able to book us all on the same floor, with our rooms next to each other, which was really nice and convenient. Unfortunately, when we arrived, the elevator had just stopped working, and we were on the 3rd floor. For most of us, this was just a minor inconvenience, but my mother-in-law suffers from painful arthritic knees, so that was not such a great start to our stay. However, the staff was wonderful and carried our luggage up the stairs and deposited it in one room so we didn't have to lug it up ourselves. Luckily, by the time we were ready to come down again after we were settled in, the elevator was working again, and all was smooth sailing after that. The rooms we had were on the side facing Diamond Head, and we each had a nice lanai outside our rooms with a small table and chairs so we could relax out there and look at the glorious view. You can't possible have a bad day when you wake up to a view of Diamond Head! Another fun bonus was the daily visits from the local colorful birds who were hanging around hoping for crumbs. There were so many different types, it was great just to watch them. My husband and I had the corner room, which also had views of the lovely park across the street. The room itself was very comfortable and spacious, clean and stylishly decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable, which made it easier to fall asleep. The amenities were very nice, good quality coffee, and the local Hawaiian bottled water was provided and replenished every day, which was a huge plus for us. The bathroom was also roomy and very clean, with shelves to hold extra towels and room to place your accessories, which is usually a problem at most hotels. They also provide very nice Japanese cotton robes for your use during your stay, and even slippers, in case you forgot yours. I loved the provided toiletries so much that I ended up using them exclusively, instead of the ones I brought from home! The hotel also features a restaurant, Wisp, which we ate at multiple times during our stay, not only for convenience, but because the food was great, and the staff was very friendly and fun to chat with. I want to especially single out Will, who often waited on our table at breakfast, and provided us with a lot of tips about where to go and what to see, and how to get there. We got to know him a little during our stay, so much so that he almost felt like family by the time we left! Speaking of staff, everyone we dealt with was very friendly, helpful, and kind. No request was greeted as an imposition, and they seemed to genuinely care that we were comfortable and had anything we needed. What a unique experience! As others have mentioned, the location itself was perfect for a relaxing time. Peaceful surroundings, but you could easily walk to all the ""razzmatazz"" of Waikiki and enjoy the shopping and restaurants. The fact that it is also on the beach made it nice for walking in the area. The only minus, which I guess can't be helped: on the last morning of our stay, they had to kick everyone out of their rooms for a while so they could spray for bugs. A necessary evil, I suppose, since really, who wants bugs in the room? However, my mother-in-law didn't want to be exposed to the pesticide afterwards, so they accommodated her by waiting until after we were checked out to spray the room she'd been in, which was thoughtful and appreciated. Although we never took advantage of it, we saw many guests enjoying the wine happy hour in the lobby, and we did enjoy the lemon infused water whenever we returned from an outing. All in all, I found The Lotus to be a lovely place to stay, with personal service, and in fact would be my preferred choice to stay for future trips to Honolulu. I very highly recommend it for both honeymooners and families, as well as business travelers.","Los Angeles, California",5,5.0

It is more of a private beach as well so it wasn't as crowded as other areas, so that was wonderful.Upon checking in we were greeted by nothing but pure friendly service who truly cared about making your stay more pleasant and helping you out.

Room was beautiful and very clean and updated!! view was beautiful with two views looking towards the ocean and Diamond Head. Hotel was located close to the beach (2 minute walk?) and they provided towels and chairs. We were also away from all the Waikiki hustle and bustle but close enough to walk if we really wanted to. Such an ideal location, to our surprise! Hotel staff were extremely nice and welcoming. Would DEFINITELY recommend, especially for those not wanting to be in the heart of the city but close enough to enjoy it. If I ever get back to Hawai‘i I’m booking here again!",,15,5.0

We left that awful accommodation almost immediately and search for more suitable living spaces. We happily stumbled upon the Lotus Honolulu at Diamond Head on HotelTonight (excellent ratings). The Lotus Honolulu at Diamond Head was willing to match and beat the price on HotelTonight and allowed us to book directly with them. Marcie, the front desk agent at the time of our arrival, was so sweet, kind and accommodating. She was the reason that we chose this property). We stayed in room 422 for our first night's stay, a room that featured two queen beds, marble bathroom, mini refrigerator and microwave (available upon request if not already in the unit). Rooms were spacious with a great mountain and ocean views from the balconyMuch to our surprise, we were upgraded upon request by the kindness and generosity of the hotel manager, Dean, the following morning to a higher unit on the corner (825) that featured two balconies (one oceanfront, the other mountain, and oceanview). Like Marcie ensured that we chose the Lotus the evening before, Dean ensured that we had no reason to look elsewhere and stay.... and stay we did!All the staff (valet {Travis, Dev and Yure}, maids, front desk personnel {Marcie, JR ""William""}, the hotel manager {Dean}, etc.) were extremely down-to-earth, kind, courteous and overall quite helpful. They were indispensable in helping erase the initial terrible experience we had at an Airbnb that almost ruined the surprise Hawaii trip for my mother for her birthday.It is without hesitation and definitely without reservation that I highly recommend the Lotus Honolulu at Diamond Head for a smart-upscale, boutique property and a warm, personalized, Aloha! experience.The daily resort fee covers the prompt and courteous valet parking, beach towels, beach chairs, bicycle rentals, as well as the shuttle that takes guests to the main areas in Waikiki.Daily Happy hour between 4:00pm and 6:00pm with red and white wine with bar snacks (like popcorn, pretzels, etc.)Daily Hawaiian coffee and tea in the lobby from 6:00am to 10:00am","San Francisco, California",2,5.0

Before proceeding to the final step, we called the hotel and the staff informed us that resort fee which is 25$/night was included in the rate. The hotel did not charge us prior to the arrival so we believed the final cost.However, during the check out process, we realized that the resort fee was added in addition to the rate that was initially presented to us. We stayed 4-5 days so it made about 100$ difference.The website also advertise about benefits of being an A-list member but seems like it was just words. For example, they say we get 100$ credit to the restaurant in the same building and it did not happen. It also says we get daily bottled water to the room and car. Often times, that did not happened.However, the room is spacious and offers small outdoor space. The view for beach and diamond heads were 80% blocked by the trees. The hotel does not have pool, gym or direct access to beach. We drove to the shopping district and it was about 2 miles but finding fee parking was difficult. The worst part of the hotel was stained / molded bathtub window and it was so gross! I did not even want to take pictures. The some portion of the glass door was black and moldy. Plus free wifi was so slow!! I did not ending up using it at all. I used about 2 G of LTE, which I m not really happy about. They really need to working on the faster wifi. The restaurant on the 2nd floor has very loud music and interfere with sound sleep.Overall, I do not recommend this hotel, you can pay similar money by choosing fancier hotels such as Hilton, Westin and Sharaton and have direct access to the beach and shopping.

Absolutely. If you need to be in the middle of chaos, surrounded by shops, restaurants, and people, and you prefer the busy beaches of central Waikiki, then this hotel is not for you. If, however, you like to be ever-so-slightly off the beaten path (about 1/2 to 3/4 mile) and you don't mind the absence of a pool, then read on....LOCATION:The Lotus Honolulu sits next to Diamond Head Crater and the ocean. You are about 3/4 of a mile into the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, but it's a seriously easy walk AND the hotel provides bikes. Personally, I welcome the walk back after a meal in Waikiki! Across the street is the Kapiolani Park, a large, well-maintained park ideal for runners, walkers, and dog owners (yes, the hotel allows dogs). Overall, you feel like you're just outside of Waikiki and able to perceive the personality of Hawaii, and yet you're a short walk from the eateries and shops.THE HOTEL AMBIENCE:You won't be greeted here in a grandiose lobby with music and sensory overload; rather, it's a serene, if ever-so-slightly dated, lobby complete with orchids and Buddhist influences. It is inviting and calming. The elevator does need an update, as I felt like I was riding a 1970s lift installed at Disney's Polynesian Resort. This was extremely minor, though.THE ROOM:We were in a ""Diamond Head View Premium Room"" on the 12th floor (the top), which I highly recommend. Looking out one large window, you see Kapiolani Park with Diamond Head in the background, meaning your view is of nature and not a lot of buildings. Out the other window is a view of the ocean, which is slightly obstructed but you can still see the water quite well (see photos). With gorgeous views out of two walls in your room, it feels very bright, open, and airy. Unlike many hotels, this room is exceptionally large with ample space and storage. It also has a mini-fridge, microwave, espresso maker with ceramic cups, water glasses, wine glasses, ample plugs/outlets that are accessible, a PS3, and an app on the TV that will allow you to use your Netflix account (the wifi, however, could be A LOT better). The bed and pillows were on the softer side, which I like, but may not be for everyone. The AC worked very well and didn't seem to fall into the trap of clicking off via a motion sensor (like some hotels these days). The room has two balconies, but only one of them is large enough for chairs and a table. THE BATHROOM:This is one of the larger bathrooms, again with ample storage, that I've had in a hotel. There is a table along the wall that enables you to store all of your stuff so it's not sitting on the counter. That table could use a paint job but it allows the bathroom to be uncluttered, and, frankly, I'm picky and its need of paint didn't bother me. The bath/shower is a European design, where it's a square shower with raised sides so it can be turned into a bath -- but not an American, rectangular bathtub (see photos). Overall, the bathroom is well maintained, clean, and large. It comes with a full-size hair dryer and a magnifying mirror that is attached to the wall.EXTRAS:Like all hotels in Waikiki, you'll pay a ""resort"" or ""boutique"" fee. At this particular hotel, that fee also provides you with free valet parking, which was huge for us, a daily morning yoga class, towels and chairs for the beach, complimentary wine each day from 4-5:30, and free bicycle use, among other things.BEACH ACCESS:You are entitled to use the beach that adjoins the Waikiki Canoe Club. It's a small beach, but it was never very crowded.STAFF:If I could give the staff 10 stars, I would, and that is no exaggeration. From the front desk, to the valet, to the cleaning crew, the attention to detail, thoughtfulness, and helpfulness was superb.FOR THE ACTIVE READERS:I'm a serious runner and found this location to be ideal. The proximity to Kapiolani Park, as well as the $1 entry fee to Diamond Head, allowed me to amass at least 4-5 miles each morning without having to run through the chaotic area of Waikiki, stopping at every light and dodging the masses of people.DRAWBACKS:If you need a pool, there isn't one. The hotel isn't right on the beach like many in Waikiki, but its location -- just slightly off the beach -- affords you the unparalleled views of Diamond Head. The wifi could be A LOT better, and the elevator needs an update.",williamsburg,26,5.0

Absolutely fabulous! Since we were on our honeymoon, we wanted a more ""quiet"" hotel, not in downtown with all the hustle and bustle. Lotus is only 1 mile from everything.......walking distance. So if you want quiet at night but able to get to ""everything"" this is the place! EVERYONE employed here were above outstanding. JR at the front desk was amazing as were the ALL the valets. Oh yea, the valet parking is da bomb!!!! You don't pay additional for it and you pull in and they do the rest. The call you by name and give bottled water when you arrive and leave. Room was perfect (1023), we had the ocean view/mountain view. Views were amazing. Did I mention quiet? I never saw another person on our floor the whole time! Now its not ""oceanfront"" but there is one building in front of it but not a big deal. The beach is a little small right there but we enjoyed it. All the same beach as Waikiki, just not all the people. Kind of like your own private beach. Hotel is nicely decorated and very clean! Also very safe.

There were so many options to choose from and I am very happy that I came across the Lotus. After reading many reviews of this hotel and others I decided to give Lotus a try. First of all anyone that has visited the Waikiki area knows that it is an extremely busy section of town with many people and lots of traffic so I was really happy to find out that the Lotus was on the quieter side of Waikiki. Upon arrival we were greeted by the valet with a nice bottle of cold water and then in a flash we were checked-in, all with a warm welcome and smile. Our room had a great view of the ocean (between two buildings) and a lanai with two chairs and a small table that we used in the afternoons to have the complimentary wine and snacks provided by the hotel.

I had initially been very excited to book and stay at the hotel during my recent visit to Hawaii. The reviews were good and I had booked an oceanfront view room as per the website description. When we reached the hotel I was somewhat surprised - the lobby and entire building was tired and in dire need of renovation and the hotel is NOT an oceanfront property - there are 2 other buildings between the beach and the hotel. The ""private"" beach near the hotel belongs to a boat club and had speedboats docked, lots of people playing and sunbathing. It wasn't the private beach which we had envisioned at all. The restaurant looked and felt like a throwback from the 70s although the service was nice and our server was friendly. Our room had been advertised as an oceanfront view room - in reality we had a slither of ocean view from between the view of 2 other hotels, and our balcony looked out onto another buildings parking lot. The one saving grace was the room which had obviously been newly renovated and was modern and stylish - and big! The room decor and atmosphere was vastly different from the rest of the hotel. The hotel also had no swimming pool - I understand we are in Hawaii and we prefer the beach, however, we had also been looking forward to lazing around the pool on some afternoons - although in that case I'll take responsibility for not thoroughly making sure the hotel had a pool before we booked it (I assumed it did, most hotels selling at this room rate would most likely have one). At the room rate we paid, we could have stayed at other very luxurious hotels with much newer and more complete facilities. Like I mentioned, the room was the saving grace - and the only reason I didn't decide to move to another hotel for the remainder of our stay ( we stayed for 4 nights). Sadly I cannot wholeheartedly reccommend this property as I feel the overall experience was not worth the price we paid.",bangkok,3,2.0

I had several days work in Honolulu, and my group was staying right on the main beach in Waikiki. I decided to stay a few extra days on my own and prefer a quiet, less populated area. Lotus in Diamond Head was the perfect choice.I bit funky, but great value. The room was sort of cluttered, with an ironing board propped against the wall in full view...but it was hard to quibble with this when each room also gets its own little patio/balcony, and kimono robes in the bathrooms. Lotus has its own lovely little private beach, which I used for my daily morning swim, beach towels and chairs provided by the hotel (covered by the $25 daily amenity fee.) Bottled water is offered every time guests arrive and leave, and bicycle rentals are included in the amenity fee (I used one...and encourage you to do the same, for the scenic route to Diamond Head!) Beds are very comfortable, and despite being on a lower floor, the room was quiet.Minuses: no pool or room service. You can order food from the on-site restaurant, which I did, and dine at your private little balcony table under the stars (this is a sort of cumbersome workaround, however.) The facility is a little tired in places, and though it's a one minute walk to the beach, the property is not on the beachfront and being on a lower floor, I had a view of the parking lot. If you're used to 4-5 star luxury, Lotus may not cut it for you. But if you appreciate a quieter, boutique hotel run by very nice people, you're in good hands. Daily wine and cheese happy hour, morning coffee and fresh fruit in the lobby all add to the hospitable vibe of this little gem. I appreciated it's quirkiness and would definitely stay here again, should the opportunity arise.","Oakland, California",11,4.0

We chose this hotel because it seemed to be in a quieter area but still within walking distance of everything in Waikiki. We stayed on the 4th floor, which was just high enough to get a glimpse of the ocean from our balcony as well as a nice view of Diamondhead. The room was very comfortable (especially the bed!) and we really appreciated the use of the in-room illy Espresso machine. Nothing like waking up with an espresso on the balcony every morning with the sounds of the ocean and the birds in nearby Kapiolani Park.All of the front desk and valet employees we met throughout with were very helpful and friendly. The staff seemed small enough that we became very familiar with most of the staff by the end of our stay. They made us very much feel at home at their hotel! The resort has a mandatory 25$ a night boutique fee, which covers your parking as well as other perks including: beach chair and towel rentals, bike rentals (locks and helmets included), morning Yoga classes, and a 4-5:30 wine happy hour with light snacks (at no extra cost). Friends we were staying with made use of the valet parking, which was always very fast, and my wife tried to attend the Yoga classes every morning, which she very much enjoyed. We enjoyed coming home in the afternoon to a glass of wine (which you are free to take back to your room). The closest restaurants to the Hotel are along Monsarrat Ave (you can easily cut across the park for a ~15 minute walk), otherwise there is a decent little beach cafe (Barefoot Beach Cafe) just a couple blocks North along Kalakau. If you don't want to walk or would like to venture a little further, you can borrow a bike (lock included) and easily be anywhere in Waikiki in 15 minutes or less. There is a decent bike trail system in the area if you are wary of riding in traffic. Lotus is also part of the AQUA hotel line and offers a free shuttle that comes around every 30 minutes from ~9am to 8pm and travels between the Lotus and the Ala Moana shopping center. This was especially handy for me, given I was attending a conference at the Hawaii Convention Center, and the driver was very helpful, even offering to drop us off closer to our destination. We only ate once at the hotel restaurant, and though I found the food to be good, the atmosphere was not very relaxing and we felt a bit out of place. They had a dance floor set up right next to the bar with live ""Oldies"" music being preformed. This may be attractive to the retired vacationing crowd (of which I acknowledge probably makes up a large amount of the hotel's clientele), but we did not enjoy it. Kind of felt like we were attending a stranger's wedding reception. We would definitely love to stay at the Lotus again if we are lucky enough to find ourselves in Honolulu again and we'd like to extend our sincere thanks to all the staff who helped us out and made us feel welcome during our visit.","White Bear Lake, Minnesota",39,5.0

Location is good as it is away from busy Waikiki, but a fair distance to walk to. Only two restaurant options, one on site and one expensive one nearby. Room size good and relatively clean. The bathroom although roomy enough and with adequate places for toiletries, was dated and the shower recess ordinary, with limited drainage. Only one hotel lift to rooms, was old and took a long time to arrive on floor. The restaurant/bar located on the second floor, Wisp was fine for breakfast and dinner and does have a happy hour every afternoon. Unfortunately, the two times we wanted to eat there (Friday and Tuesday) the space was taken up by elderly dancers, so limited area for guests of the hotel. The hotel also has a shuttle bus service which has a round trip service to other chains of the hotel.

It was recommended to us by my good friend who is a native of Honolulu and knows all the local hotels. The Lotus was everything we expected: a laid back, boutique hotel just around the corner from a quiet beach on the sunny side of Wakiki. We were greeted with a surprise anniversary gift waiting for us in our room -- just one example of the personal attention the Lotus provides and a really special touch which was much appreciated! The location is perfect for folks like us who didn't want to mess around with traffic. The Lotus provides free bicycles which can be checked out, and my wife biked the short route to the top of Diamond Head, to downtown, and along the beaches...she loved it! The nearby beach was wonderful, great for swimming but we had some successful snorkeling time there too. Many days we could see clouds blanketing downtown Honolulu, but it was sunny where we were at the 'Gold Coast'. The Lotus also sits adjacent to one of the largest parks in Hawaii, which we loved. My wife was able to join in an outside yoga group there, and we were able to walk to an oceanside restaurant in the evenings. By the end of our 3-day stay we knew the owner and the folks at the front desk as if they were old friends. The only downside was the wi-fi reception was subpar in both of the rooms we stayed in while there -- it took me awhile to figure out there was good reception in the lobby area, but not the rooms.

Besides there are some nice perks such as the coffee in the morning, free coffee in the room, complimentary wine and cheese from 4 - 6 and some free museum passes. The rooms are good, beds very comfortable and the views of Diamond Head are spectacular - much better than the ocean views which are mostly obstructed. The corner rooms are the best with a great breeze. We had the windows open most of the time and did not use the AC the entire time. Also a great perk is the valet parking which is included in the $25 resort fee. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Free yoga classes each morning. A very good choice of hotel.

Every single hotel employee we encountered during our 3 day stay was welcoming, friendly and very helpful. I don't think we've ever had such outstanding service in all our travels around the world!The location is fantastic. Next to the beach and quite relaxing because its far enough away from the dense/noisy/grabby Waikiki tourist ghetto. Beautiful rooms with dark hardwood floors. Nice views from the hotel in all rooms, particularly of Diamond Head Single line of rooms on each floor yields multiple views and good cross ventilation. Excellent views of Diamond Head. The upper Ocean View rooms are superior. Several very nice restaurants are steps away in the quite nice adjoining properties. Except for one quick breakfast, we did not dine at the hotel's restaurant which had opened just days prior to our arrival. A pleasant, 10-15 minute walk through Sans Souci State Recreational Park gets you to the busy part of Waikiki. Add to the above the FREE wine and light snax happy hour at the bar, unlimited movies and games dispensed from an automat, valet parking, and decent WiFi, and this hotel is a winner.

I'm so glad I chose this place! It is well away from the annoying crowds up the street by the stores and larger hotels. The staff is outrageously warm, friendly, super helpful and just amazing! I can't say enough great things about these people! Marci at the front desk felt like an old friend from minute one, the valet staff is wonderful! Russ, Travis and the other guy (so sorry, can't remember his name!) are so friendly, handing out bottled water each time we left, taking it upon themselves to put beach chairs & towels in our trunk when we talked about going to the North Shore. That was just so thoughtful! This staff is truly top notch! My husband and I took the free yoga class in the park twice and loved it! Great yoga instructors. There is a yoga institute on the second floor as well as the newly opened Wisp restaurant. Quite pricey, an omelet, breakfast potatoes and juice cost my sister $25 plus tip of course. They do have a continental breakfast plan, but I booked this before the restaurant was opened (only opened 2 weeks). Our room was 725, and end room, the best room I've stayed in in a very long time! I will post pics of our view. An insane backdrop of diamond head and partial ocean view. The only thing I did not like about this hotel was there is no direct beach access, you have a tiny and I mean tiny beach to the rear you have to walk between other properties to get to, or go around a building or two on the other side to get to a larger beach. We chose to drive to other beaches due to the fact there were many homeless people sleeping and digging through the garbage cans around the park where the beach is. They also set up camp outside the restroom building. We weren't comfortable with that, so we went to beaches about 20 min away. Overall I LOVE the Lotus!!!","Waretown, New Jersey",55,5.0

The service at the front desk was great.thanks Marcy! Room was nice and clean! Free bicycles for a nice ride across the street ! Free bottle water every time we went out on our tour around the island. After our trip back to the hotel it was nice to relax and unwind during the restaurant on the second floor for wine and cheese. I forgot the name of the place but it was great! Did I mention wine was free!! Ended up staying till dinner time. My husband ordered the jadory chicken and we split a Caesar salad and calamari and waffle fries. The jadory chicken was great! Crispy on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside. My husband only gave me a few bites :(. He didn't want to share. The Caesar salad was the best Caesar salad I've eaten since I been to a famous Michelin 3 star restaurant in Spain 5 years ago. It's not the same as most restaurants. Very unique taste to it.I don't know what it was , not the same like every normal Caesar salad out there. I'm a very picky eater ,trust me! Calamari was great. Nicely seasoned! Bartender was also nice and friendly and talked about all the places we should go and visit on our first trip to Hawaii.This place also gives away complimentary coffee in the morning which was great for my sleepy husband! Upon checkout staff was very friendly and offered to call a taxi for us and tag us bottled water for our taxi ride back to the airport!

At 7:30 morning there were either yoga/tai-chi/zumba (depending on the day) for the guests held at the park right across from the hotel - with mat, towels and a bottle of water provided. A bottle of water would be available for us everyday in our rooms with our consumed coffee capsules replaced. When we can took advantage of the complimentary happy hours for coffee between 6-10am and the wine between 4-6pm, at the newly opened restaurant. The coffee was even given in a large take-away cup, so it made it even easier for us to pick up a coffee and start on our trip for the day.Our room 523 gets a view of Diamond Head, the park, a bit of the ocean view between some buildings and the parking lot :) The only bad thing I have to say about the room was the quilt when the sheets peeled back was a little dirty. We enjoyed the free bike hires, riding to the main stretch of Waikiki and around the park - again they valet parking guys were awesome and attentive to our needs asking if we would like any bottled water. The best thing amongst all this was that everyone was very friendly ... even the bar-dude who put on a stern face to tell people that wine glasses are to stay within the restaurant ;) and then to top it off, as we were on our honeymoon (failed to mention it during our booking) we asked Marci if there were anything the hotel can do for us, she kindly congratulated us and delivered a bottle of champagne and a couple of delicate cupcakes to our room.

I've been told that the Lotus will have a restaurant starting next week and I think that will add a lot. In the meantime, 2 of my nights here, I've just walked next door to the New Otani Kaimana Hotel which has an open air bar/restaurant. I had a nice glass of wine and a couple appetizers which were delicious both nights. Back to the Lotus, the room is very clean, cute decor, bed and pillows very comfortable and the AC cranks! One of my favorite things is their fabulous in room coffee set up with Italian illy espresso! The staff is delightful. There is a $25 daily Resort fee (not sure if that's what they call it), but part of what it covers is valet parking which I appreciated. Every day from 4-6, they have a serve yourself wine and appetizer spread which was very nice with fairly high quality wine (which I didn't expect).

Tea and coffee was complimentary in the mornings; and free wine in the lobby 4-6pm. I believe there will be a restaurant in the near future but it was not open when i was there. No spas, pools etc but that was fine with me as there was plenty to do in the area. Free chairs and towels for the beach, which is quite small at the back of the hotel but more quiet compared to Waikiki.

You get the know the staff and they'll attend to your every need. They provided us with a tandem bike to get to the strip and even helped us get rental surfboards delivered to the hotel. In my opinion, the Lotus is the perfect choice for me and I'm definitely staying here longer next time. The rooms are clean, quiet and moderately priced. Considering the resort fee includes valet parking, it's a great deal. I just moved to the Pink Palace for the second half of my trip and I totally regret it.

The staff were very friendly -- we especially liked Russell, who helped us with restaurants and excursions.The location is indeed off centre -- exactly 15 mins walk through the park and takes you to the edge of Waikiki beach, so a total of 20-30 mins walk to most restaurants/shops in town, which we didn't mind, but not for everyone. They also have bicycles available for use, which is a nice touch as it cuts down the travel time. Renting 2 beach loungers and parasol on Waikiki beach will set you back a cool $50 per day, so you can save yourself a fortune by buying a $10 parasol from ABC stores/Walmart and borrowing the hotel's free beach chairs -- these also come in handy when visiting other beaches like Kailua, Lanakai, Sandy Beach, etc. (assuming you have a car rental).There are only 2 restaurants within 5 mins walk -- the Lau Tree Lanai, which is ok... a bit overpriced, and reservation required to get a table. The other restaurant is French, but we didn't try it. For snacks, there's also a convenience store. Btw, there's a restaurant in the Canoe club next door, but surprisingly only serve food to members. Our favourite restaurants in town were Duke's and Eggs & Things, which we preferred over higher end restaurants such as Orchids and Hy's steakhouse (service was excellent, but a bit snooty -- i.e. covered shoes mandatory).For excursions, we did the Holokai Catamaran, which was excellent and only $60 (booked directly on their website) for snorkelling with the turtles and Diamond Head sail. We also tried to do the Shark Adventures which looked fantastic (they put you in a cage surrounded by sharks) but our trip was cancelled at the last minute due to high winds, so try to get this trip in early if interested.","London, United Kingdom",58,5.0

What we really liked about the hotel was how quiet it was which suited us perfectly. One night we caught the free shuttle bus to the shops at Waikiki. It was awful and took ages. I highly recommend walking to the shops they really aren't that far. I did find the resort charge I bit cheeky as the hotel doesn't have a pool or any chairs on the beach.

As locals, we loved walking to Monsaratt Ave and ate at all of our favorite places... Bogart's Cafe (breakfast), Diamond Head Grill, Diamond Head Health bar(best acai bowls on the island) and even got gelato at a brand new little cafe called Ars Cafe! (Tourists- try the local spots we love! Stay away from the chain restaurants in Waikiki) on our last day, we walked to Barefoot beach Bar Cafe which is really close to the Lotus and had a casual breakfast with the outdoor seating. We loved the little wine happy hour they have in the lobby (Daily from 4-6pm) that we got to pour a nice glass and take it back to our room and sit on the lanai. Although this property doesn't have a pool, it has a great little beach that the locals go to and it's right next door to a private club. So nice that they even give you Tommy Bahama beach chairs, towels, umbrella and even beach toys. We are big coffee drinkers too and liked they had illy coffee in the rooms. For you beauty obsessed travelers, the toiletries are Paul Mitchell Awapuhi. A huge bonus, is that it's dog-friendly and our little furry baby got to come with us and enjoy it too! When we checked in, they had a basket for just her. It came with a bowl, blanket, dog bone and a full bag of bacon treats that she loved. Great that there is the park right across the street too that we could take her. We can't wait to come back. We highly recommend this hotel for travelers wanting a unique Waikiki experience.

I mentioned that in the comments section for every reservation I made. A couple places said ""congratulations"" at check in but here there was a chilled bottle of sparkling wine and glasses waiting in our room when we arrived. There was an issue of some old stains on the bedding which required a late night call to housekeeping but the linens were changed promptly and the staff were all apologetic. We noticed a very loud metallic clunking noise whenever the elevator opened in the lobby, and you needed to swipe your key to go any higher than the restaurant on the 2nd floor. This was inconvenient if you were trying to carry breakfast for two back to your room alone. There was a park nearby which was nice to walk through during the day. A lot of homeless stay there so I wouldn't go alone at night. We did walk through as a couple on our way home from the bars and restaurants along Waikiki and had no problem though. The view of Diamondhead was ok but we were on a middle floor (6th) so there were some trees in the way. I'd recommend a higher floor for a better view. The hotel is not beach front and we could not see the beach from our room.We did not try it but they said they had towels, chairs, bikes etc for a trip to the beach or around town. A really nice touch was they had complimentary cold bottled water available at the front desk.Looking back most of my comments are a little negative but really this was one of the nicer places we stayed. I'll definitely look this place up again if I ever go back to Honolulu.","Lafayette, Indiana, United States",14,5.0

My family with a 2 yr old toddler were meeting with me in Honolulu from Asia while I flew in from East Coast. We booked two Ocean View Premium rooms. The rooms are clean and nice. It is not too brand new, but it is very decent and up to par. The view is amazing - on the left we had a full view of Diamond Head and on the right we saw part of the ocean. It is not a wide open ocean view because the building in the front blocks partial of the view. However it does not affect the beauty of this room. At night, I was able to see the moon rising above Diamond Head. I left the balcony door shade open, so I slept under the moonlight shining into my room. I didn't want to sleep because I wanted to enjoy that beautiful moment!There are no breakfast included, but they have a simple restaurant on the 2nd floor that you can pay, or you can order from any restaurants in Honolulu to deliver to your door. I highly recommend the nearby ""Bogart's Cafe"" for breakfast or lunch. That is the BEST brunch spot - I visited 4 times during my 6 days stay in Lotus. You can ride a bike to the restaurant within 5 mins. The morning Yoga in the nearby park is a must try experience as well as riding the bike around Diamond Head. You will be able to see the beautiful coast line and some really cute local residence. The hotel also provides beach towels and chairs that you can enjoy. The free wine between 4 and 6pm is amazing too. What sets Lotus apart from other big chain hotels with hundreds of rooms is their service. Everyone in the hotel is very nice and warm. Sebastian at the valet service is outstanding by always greeting us with genuine smiles and always offered advice and help for guidance. Parking here is included in the $25 resort fee. It is totally worth it.There were a few glitches during my stay as well:- We booked two Ocean View Premium rooms but the front desk gave us one premium and one regular Ocean View, and realized later that it was a mistake after we already checked in. They gave us credit for the resort fee to waive the difference of prices, but I would wish we could have two premium rooms as requested. - Room 821's WIFI was not working during our entire stay. We had to do some work on laptop but the IT technician couldn't figure out how to fix the WIFI, and did not follow up with us either regarding this issue. We had to use cellphones to do our work. No credits were issued when we mentioned to the front desk upon our check-outs either. - Upon check-outs, one of the room's bill was billed incorrectly for in-room entertainment fee. This was the room which was supposed to be the premium room. The total amount of the bill comes out to be exact as my premium room (with the incorrect entertainment charge). My parents stayed in that room. They didn't watch TV at all but they were charged with this fee. The front desk was able to fix the bill, but I still find it bizarre how this charge occurred.I felt the front desk was not able to answer my questions when I had issue with WIFI and bill. They kind of just want to smooth it over instead of fixing the problem. I wish the management can look into this. Otherwise, all other staff members are doing a fantastic job! I will definitely come back to Lotus again when I visit Honolulu! ","Jersey City, New Jersey",12,5.0

The wine each afternoon was of good standard, and we loved the coffee machine in the room and the fact that on request for more coffee pods, we were given more the next day. The free DVD's were an unexpected bonus and the ability to purchase continental style breakfast items meant we did not need to go back and forth to the ABC shop. The room itself was very roomy and comfortable and we enjoyed the breeze we picked up on the balcony where we had breakfast and enjoyed our wine. The small convenience shop outside the hotel next door was useful and while we did do the walk into the main tourist area for dinner twice, we mostly opted for the beach kiosk in Queen Kapiolani Park enjoying the casual outside seating and live music watching the sunset.

They couldn't have been any nicer or more helpful. Free continental breakfast in the morning, but no protein except for lox and hard boiled eggs for sale, so one star off for that and no working restaurant on site (heard restaurant to reopen later this year), and no pool... They do have a free shuttle to other Aqua Hotels in Waikiki area for shopping, sightseeing, eateries- get a map of pick up spots so you can wander Waikiki and then back free to this quiet refuge. Taxi should be $35 or so from airpirt, about $10 back to hotel from Waikiki. Loved being down at this quiet end of Waikiki...2 miles away. A short walk through front parking area and you are at a gorgeous quiet beach with a beautiful park across the street and next door. They have beach chairs and bikes to borrow and beach towels at lobby for water fun. Closest restaurant is in the New Otani Hotel next door- heard it is the best breakfast in town, but make a reservation. The Outrigger Club and Elks Lodge are just down the street, but are private. Also a small market next door on the street at New Otani with good prices and everything you could possibly need. Catch the city beach bus a few steps down in front of Elks Lodge for the 20 minute ride to Hanauma Bay for amazing snorkeling. $2.50 each way...go early if driving...lot closes up when it is full in the morning...or go in the afternoon. $7.50 to get in. Crowded but worth it. Waikiki is not my idea of a Hawaii vacation. I accompanied a friend. It is very busy and crowded - like going to downtown LA for vaca, but millions of stores and eateries.

Only in the most extreme circumstances will I sit down to draft something (usually if my experience was quite poor or, as in this case, simply wonderful). The Lotus is a boutique hotel about a ten or fifteen minute walk outside of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. So, if you like to be in the center of it all, you may find this hotel a bit quiet (and it hasn't got a pool, if that's important to you). However, if you prefer a more tranquil setting across from Kapiolani Park (perhaps the nicest park in Honolulu), this is a lovely hotel. The best aspect of the hotel, beyond the tranquil setting, is actually the staff. To a person they were extraordinarily kind and thoughtful. From the people at the front desk, to the valet guys helping with the cars and bikes (yes, they offer mountain bikes for guest use, along with nice quality beach chairs and beach towels, and bottled water as you head out for the day), to the restaurant staff and the maid service, and let's not forget the really nice yoga instructors who offer yoga in the park every morning) everyone was professional, patient and attentive. I must say that the entire staff at this hotel may be the best that I've experienced in all of my years of travel, both domestic and international. It may sound strange to say this, but returning to the hotel each day almost felt like going home in the sense that everyone at the hotel made my wife and me feel so comfortable and welcome. I strongly urge the hotel ownership and management to take very good care of the hotel staff. Their professionalism and attentiveness is what sets this hotel apart from your competition.I used to live on Oahu for many years and now live in California (the Bay Area). However, I visit Oahu fairly often each year due to work (my company is headquartered on Oahu) and to visit friends who still live there; and when my wife and I are not actually staying with our friends, the Lotus hotel will be our hotel of choice whenever we are on Oahu. I cannot recommend the Lotus hotel more highly. An easy 5 stars.",Alameda,7,5.0

It's a a good value, compared to other Waikiki hotels. It's quiet and pristine and has a bit of a zen-like feel. In fact, they offer regular yoga classes. It is off the beaten track, however, and restaurants are a bit of a hike. The breakfast was not very appealing and there is no dining room for other meals. I also couldn't quite figure out how one gets to the beach, but I'm sure that it's not an issue as the water is close-by, and they offer beach towels.

The hotel is small, only around 100 rooms, all beautifully furnished and equipped. Mini-fridges and Illy espresso/coffee machines, marble bathrooms, and nice lanais with views of Diamond Head and the Pacific. The Lotus is around ten minute or so walk south of the main Waikiki area, across from Queen Kapiolani Park. Seriously underpopulated Sans Souci Beach is just a few steps away, and the aquarium and zoo are easy walks. And the staff on both trips was warm, welcoming, and way beyond expectations in their helpfulness. The hotel does not have a full service restaurant, but it does offer continental breakfasts and complimentary beverages in its second floor dining room, as well as complimentary wine in the evening. There are several excellent restaurants an easy walk nearby, and of course myriads in central Waikiki. There is also a very nice open air cafe about five minutes up the beach, which is both excellent and very reasonably priced for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and affords a lovely al fresco setting by the ocean. The only potential drawback is that if you are too limited in mobility to get to and from central Waikiki (assuming you want to) on foot, you will need to either hop the hotel's periodic (free) shuttle or a city bus to get there and back, or rent a car. There is no charge for valet parking, by the way. ","San Rafael, California",18,5.0

But as the very kind, professional staff (and my relatives) pointed out, Lotus is not on Waikiki. Rather, it's a mile or more east at the foot of Diamond Head (Leahi), right across the street from the lovely, quiet greenery of Kapiolani Park (itself another 5 star entity). The difference between the Waikiki main drag and the Lotus/Kapiolani Park/Outrigger area is huge--don't mistake one for the other. Lotus, both as a hotel and a location, is like a lovely, green, quiet zen garden, an oasis, a retreat, a safe place with its own lovely little beaches out front. While there are several other tower blocks adjacent to Lotus, the group are all set clearly away from the skyscraper logjam of Waikiki (exception: late night ocean view dining is a Waikiki specialty, so don't miss out). The other reviews here did not mislead or disappoint: Lotus is very clean, quiet and has lovely Asian-Pacific decor in all rooms and lobbies; Room had a superb large bathroom, comfy lanai (balcony), decent free WiFi and perhaps the best hotel mattress I've ever encountered. Free afternoon wine in the lobby? Yup. Complimentary beach gear for all? Check. Warm, engaging staff, who were equally helpful to my family guests? Absolutely. We did not use the valet parking but my relatives did and were greeted with kindness and ice cold bottled water. I even want to put in a good word for that highly addictive in-room espresso machine with its cute little ceramic cups (why yes, Lotus expects adults to be able to use real glassware). Now, many hotels can match such amenities, but Lotus has something others lack: it actually felt warm, welcoming, like coming home, not just resort or chain hotel fakery--the staff are true locals, act like family and proud of their aloha oasis. If I had to say anything negative, Lotus does not have a pool (the beach is way better) and not really a kid-oriented hotel (unless your kids are zen masters), but to each his own. After this experience, I would not stay anywhere else on Oahu and hope Lotus keeps up to their high standards.","Lincoln, Nebraska",10,5.0

The only downside to this place is that it's far from Waikiki beach. A good 15/20 minute walk to all of the action, but it's super quiet. We didn't have any noise issues. It's one of the trade offs.

We stayed at this property in December 2015, and we had a great experience. The hotel is a small boutique hotel at the quiet end of Kalakaua Avenue, and only a short, 15 minute walk to the action, on the way to Waikiki Beach. Being at the base of Diamond Head, our room had a great view of the beautiful landmark to one side, and a view of the beach on the other side. The staff was friendly and helpful, and our room was comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. There is a daily resort fee, which was $25 when we stayed, and it included valet parking and complimentary beach chairs. We were offered bottled water to take along each time we ventured out, and that was a nice touch. The property is not right on the beach, but just a short stroll away is a private beach for hotel guests to share with adjacent properties. Towels and beach chairs can be picked up at the front desk, and they are first-come-first-served. Ask for the beach chairs with backpack straps - they're easier to carry. The beach was very nice, and not crowded at all when we went.The Honolulu Marathon took place on Sunday December 13, and we were right by the Finish Line. We were able to see the runners and cheer them on as they came by the hotel. If you happen to be in town for the Marathon, this is an ideal place to stay!If you're Catholic, St. Augustine By The Sea Catholic Church is less than a mile away. It's a nice walk, and you can stop for breakfast or brunch afterwards.I would not recommend this hotel for children, as there isn't much to interest young kids. Maybe late teens would do ok, but I think this hotel caters more to adults. I would stay here again and again and again!","Oviedo, Florida",6,5.0

We stayed in an Ocean View room and enjoyed its spaciousness, cleanliness and beautiful views of both Diamond Head and the ocean. While it's true that the view also included the parking lot below and a couple of buildings in the foreground, you'd be hard-pressed to find accommodations in Honolulu that combine the spaciousness of the rooms, the amenities of the hotel, the helpfulness of the staff and the peaceful quiet so close to the craziness of Waikiki, especially for the price. We've stayed in other hotels in Waikiki that had a good view of the ocean, but our rooms were the size of postage stamps. However, we loved our room at the Lotus! Every day at 4:30 p.m. we sat on our lanai and watched whales breaching in the distance. We also enjoyed watching the activity in the park below Diamond Head: dog walkers, joggers, kids practicing soccer, etc. In the mornings, we were awakened by the sounds of birds chirping in the palm trees below, which turned out to be parrots (or maybe parakeets?). We took full advantage of the beach, accessed by a very short walk across the hotel lot, which was never very populated and excellent for swimming with no reef. (When you approach the beach, take the stairs to the left, not the right, for the best swimming.) Originally, we ate breakfast closer to Waikiki, but eventually we settled for the hotel breakfast which was reasonably priced and more to our light-breakfast tastes. I can't say enough about the front-desk, breakfast and valet staff who were very accessible and saw to our every need. I want to give a special call-out to JR at the front desk and to each of the valet staff, who made every aspect of our stay comfortable and EASY. FYI: We took advantage of the free Honolulu Art Museum tickets offered by the hotel and were favorably impressed. The museum definitely is worth seeing and the food in the cafe very good. All in all, a perfect stay in Oahu, thanks largely to the Lotus. My husband has frequent business in Honolulu and has decided to abandon his previous hotel for this one. Very much worth the visit.

The room was spacious, comfortable and clean. Each room has an Illy Coffee machine, which I found didn't work so well. But not to worry, the hotel offers free coffee service at the restaurant located on the second floor every morning until 10am. Plus everyday from 4-6pm the hotel offers free wine! The fact that this hotel has its own private beach area, you can even take the wine with you to the beach unlike other hotels. We rented a car, so with the $25/day resort fee ... it covers the valet parking! Pls note: you cannot park your own vehicle, the staff will park the car for you every time you return to the property. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating! If you don't have a car, staying at this resort might be a bit inconvenient - Unlike all the other hotels in the Waikiki area, where everything is walking distance!

Noise from the parking lot was loud, bothersome, and the view was frustrating considering the price of the room. The staff offered no options to upgrade or change rooms. The only option we had was to cancel the reservation and find another place to stay. The location of the Lotus is literally in a parking lot behind three other properties. Their room categories are based only on the height of the room, with ""Diamond Head"" view meaning up to the 7th floor and ""ocean view"" meaning 8th floor and higher.

We had never been to Oahu but I have visited Maui & the Big Island/Hilo side more times than I can count over the last thirty years. (Two sisters live on Maui and Big Island.)We had the best time at the Lotus. First, Robert (valet) greeted us when we arrived. He parked our car, took our luggage to our room, and gave the most wonderful, detailed information about the island and the area. He directed us as to how to get around in spite of the crazy traffic in the Waikiki area. He suggested a great dinner spot in the hotel next door and showed us the private beach we could use while staying at the Lotus. Beach towels and beach chairs were provided too.Before going to our room, we met Jana and JR who checked us in and welcomed us to the hotel. We asked more questions that Jana happily answered. We then asked for a regular coffee maker in our room in addition to the pod coffee maker that was already there. She then invited us to have a glass of wine since it is available in the lobby each evening from 4:00 to 6:00pm. It was about 4:30. We then found out that Jana was the General Manager at the Lotus and knew we had chosen the right place to stay in Oahu. When we got to our room, we found a ""welcome letter"" signed by Jana that said ""we are happy to make the necessary arrangements to satisfy your wishes"" and she meant it. We then went out for dinner and when we got back, the coffee maker we requested was in our room along with the shades closed and lights turned on so we didn't have to enter into a dark room. Very nice and welcoming. Our room was fabulous with two balconies; one overlooking the ocean and the other one facing Diamond ahead. This hotel was peaceful, clean, comfortable, away from the Waikiki crowds and SMOKE-FREE. It was a 10 minute lovely walk to downtown Waikiki and we walked there for dinner one night. It was very crowded and people were smoking everywhere. I was so glad we get away from this and knew our hotel would be fresh, clean and smoke free!!!I also want to mention another valet named Travis. He was incredible and was there each morning as we headed out for the day. He gave us great direction to Pearl Harbor, the museums and the Queen's palace. He told us where to go, what to expect and explained little but important details like the lockers at Pearl Harbor since bags are not allowed at this military base. One of our days we wanted to drive to the North and East sides of the island. He again gave us great direction and made suggestions about what to do and see when we got there. Where the ladies like to shop and the local shrimp trucks too. He made the few days we had there very valuable and we got to see lots of what we wanted to see. We will return to Oahu and we will no doubt, stay at the Lotus again. Try it! You will love it too. Thanks Jana, Travis, Robert for making our trip fabulous. See you next time.

We leave tomorrow and that makes me sad! I figured I should write this review while I am in their comfy bed. We have never been to Waikiki/Honolulu before, but I heard it can be very busy.. And it is! But, this hotel is a bit away from all the hustle and bustle of the busy strip and I LIKE that. I wanted a room that was modern, safe and close enough to the beach. There is a $20ish dollar boutique fee, but let me tell you some of the things that includes 1. Free daily valet service. The valet guys are so nice every single time and always help us load and unload our cars. And they make sure we have waters every morning before we leave2. Free wine in the lobby from 4-6 pm every night. This is SO NICE! They have a comfy lobby you can drink the wine in, or you can take it to the room and drink it on the balcony while overlooking the ocean. 3. Free use of beach towels. Big, new, thick neutral colored beach towels. 4. Free use of beach chairs that they let you take for the day (this was SO NICE)5. Access to small, private beach. Pretty shallow and family friendly. Short walk to Queen's Beach and Waikiki Beach. 6. Bike use (we did not use the bikes, but knew they were there) 7. Free yoga (mat included) in the big park across the street 8. Free movies! There is a Redbox type machine on the second floor. They give you a special card for getting the movies. 9. Bookshelf next to the movie machine for some last minute beach reads. The rooms:1. Dark hardwood floors with a clean, modern rug around the bed. Rooms are so modern and beautiful. It feels like home, not a hotel room.2. PS3 in the room with a flat screen TV3. Big closet with lots of room for organization. 4. Plantation style sliding doors then glass sliding doors for the lanai. 5. Hot water, good pressure. 6. BIG fluffy white towels. Not those small, little hotel towels. 7. Paul Mitchell toiletries 8. K-cup style espresso machine in the room that makes DELICIOUS coffee. 9. Small mini-fridge. 10. Very comfortable beds. 11. Ocean view! You are not Ocean Front, but we still had insane views of the ocean and surfers and sunsets. You also have an absoutley unobstructed view of Diamond Head which is a icon for Oahu, so its very special to see that too. We slept with our lanai open every night. 12. Waikiki view when you walk out of your room. Its breathtaking. Housekeeping was very trustworthy. We accidentally forgot to put away our laptop, DSLR, Go-Pro and my purse while we were out one day. They were on the bed and they stayed there-- they just serviced the rest of the room. Everyone is SO NICE. I did not come across one single rude or annoyed employee. They all smile and wave and are so helpful! That hospitality was so appreciated.Go to Barefoot Beach Cafe or LuLu's for breakfast. There is also a small convenience store at the hotel next door. Just book it! You won't regret it.","Sacramento, California",9,5.0

The rooms: VERY nice. There nicely decorated, with nice dark floors. The bedding and decor are very current. We had room 725 and it was gorgeous. This is one of the few hotels I've stayed in where after looking at the rooms online, they were just as the picture advertised. THAT's what I appreciated most. It wasn't that they only had one updated room that looked this way and that's the one that they posted in their advertisement.We had a corner room with two balconies on the 7th floor. Very nice view of the ocean and diamond head.The Location: Great location away from the hustle and bustle. It's about an 8 minute stroll from the nearest Starbucks. It's at the beginning of the residential area. When I read this, I initially had some concerns. But once we arrived, I saw that it was the perfect area. Across from a park also.The Staff: We are a very friendly couple and will stop and engage ANYONE. And the staff indulged us. We'd stop and chitchat for a bit and they were quite indulging. They offered suggestions for dining and site-seeing. They were the best. The person assigned to cleaning our room was very pleasant and did a wonderful job.I have nothing bad to say about the Lotus. Not one negative. I thought I'd have an issue with them not having a pool. But while I was there, i didn't even miss it. Sitting on the balcony enough for me. No exercise room, you'll walk around the town anyway.OR ride one of the bikes available to the guests.No room service, no problem. You're just a short walk from eateries. While they do offer some breakfast items, I passed as they didn't really have the menu I could appreciate. Want to stay in, you can get free dvds on the second floor.

Having said that...you can walk to the Duke statue in 10 mins. So, it's not far at all.Very quiet & peaceful location. Rooms are spacious. Bedding very comfortable. Control your own AC or let the breezes come in through the big sliding doors. Housekeeping is excellent & friendly. Room was always very clean & cleaned promptly & quickly each day. Linens are above average in quality: plush.Usually plenty of street parking along the park but it is metered during the day. Free at night. Yes, they write plenty of parkign tickets in Honolulu.The check in process is smooth & fast. One elevator = sometimes a wait but not bad.The true stars of this hotel are the valet guys. Yes, I know, how can that be you're asking. Well, there's a mandatory 'boutique fee' of $25.00 per day. Which, let's face it, is a gouge - - but so many hotels are doing this now. So, it is what it is.Well, you have to valet your car if you park on the property. Not enough spaces in tight confines, that sort of thing. Yet, the valet guys really are the face of the hotel. The valet guys work very hard 24/7 to get you whatever you need. Cold bottle of water, beach towels with your ride? Keeping your car up front & readily available? Storing surfboards, kite gear, anything you don't want to trundle to your room?Done, done, done & done. These guys are the stars of the Lotus. Travis, Robert, and several others: all great. Tip them handsomely, they will certainly earn it.I'd say it's worth it to be in an upper floor room. The view of Diamond Head crater is pretty cool. You will also be able to see the ocean, although the view directly off to the right is obstructed by the big hotel between Lotus & the ocean. You can almost see the wind whipping around Diamond Head. Bring binocs & you can check out the surfers over at Tunggs.The free coffee is good. Mornings from 0600-1000.

Yes, it has its quirks--the one elevator and no restaurant, but after being here twice within 4 weeks the place really grew on me. I didn't mind the 10 min. walk to restaurants (LuLu's for breakfast was great, and I ate dinner twice at the bar next door at Otani and once outside for lunch at their restaurant). Saw homeless people on the walks to Waikiki but was never bothered by them--I did take a taxi back if walking after 7:30 at night since I was alone. Lotus staff was very helpful. Booked Diamond Head Premium View Room which was lovely--great views of both DH and the water--yes, there are buildings in view but you can still see the water (I was on 7th and then 11th floor (Ocean View) when they upgraded me 2nd stay). Sat outside on lanai (it says there are two but you can actually only sit on one). Both corner rooms were very clean, sunny, and open. I swam at the beach outside the Otani since it is bigger (you can use any beach in Hawaii). If you want noise, crowds, hustle and bustle, fancy restaurant, and a pool, don't stay here.

It's at the Diamond Head side of Waikiki beach, near some condominiums, across from the park and within walking distance of everything. The lobby has a Zen vibe, with sofas, cushions, fountains, mirrors, candles, etc. It's a comfortable place to hangout with the pre-dinner wine glass. The room was on a corner, with a balcony and windows overlooking the beach and Diamond Head. It was clean and roomy, with a safe and fridge. The staff was friendly and helpful, offering advice and water bottles. We borrowed chairs and towels for the beach. You can go to a quiet beach shared with a canoe club, or walk a little more to a bigger, Waikiki beach. This is located at the end of the bustling Waikiki strip and you have to walk a little to get to the action, but that was fine with us, because we wanted quiet at night. If you're not a ""walker"", you need a car or taxi. Taxis get expensive. We took one to Diamond Head and it came to $16 each way. The breakfast isn't included, but it was reasonably priced, with various options, the restaurant isn't in service right now, which is a shame, because it has great views of the park and Diamond Head. I took a Saturday morning yoga class in the park, which was included and the hotel provided the yoga mat. It was of moderate difficulty and a beautiful practice under the expansive trees. You get more for your boutique fee than we got at a higher priced North Shore resort: unlimited coffee, daily wine, beach towels, chairs, unlimited water bottles, free yoga classes. There is also a shuttle to the other hotels in the chain, that you can use to get around a bit. It stops at the big mall, Ala Moana, too. The staff called the driver to let us know when he'd be coming around, so we didn't have to wait.

My view was ok but part of it was a car park. You had plenty of towels and drink and other complementary items. I mentioned about the food earlier , in a morning there is something but it's little more than a nominal cofee and fruit. I feel this is poor value. Finally for non American customers I must mention that hotels like the Lotus insist on photo identification. This I have totally un heard of and left the hotel $250 out of cash pocket. I'm told this is normal state policy for any credit card transaction and yet later I managed to buy a mobile phone by a major telecommunications company using my card and was not asked for ID.

It's clearly an older hotel that's been renovated to more modern standards. Location is a bit of a bust, views are pretty bad, beach access isn't great, and there's only one elevator for the entire building (used by both guests and staff and it kind of has a mind of it's own) but the staff is super friendly and helpful (we really appreciated the offers for bottles of water whenever we were leaving), and the rooms are clean, modern, and comfortable. Major cons: Location, it's not so far out of Waikiki that you feel like you're escaping the crowds/traffic and yet it's not close enough to Waikiki to be super convenient (shopping, restaurants, and access to the heart of Waikiki beach are about a 10-15 minute walk away). In fact, unless you're familiar with the roads in the area, you'll likely end up having to go all the way through Downtown Waikiki to get to the Lotus anyway (which kind of negates a lot of the benefit of staying outside of the busiest areas).The hotel is in between the street and a couple of other taller buildings so ocean views are practically non-existent (though the view of Diamond Head is nice even though you have to put up with street noise to get it). There's access to a beach one building over though it's not as nice as you'll get towards the heart of Waikiki.Major pros: The staff is excellent, very helpful and friendly and they remember your name. Rooms aren't terribly expensive given the proximity to the beach (cheaper hotels are more inland) and I'm pretty sure that the Lotus is one of the better values in the Waikiki area all things considered.Overall, I'm not sure we would stay here again. It's kind of stuck in a grey area. It's not cheap enough to be a bargain hotel and yet it doesn't have the location or facilities to be high end. It's kind of average overall despite the strength of it's staff. I definitely think you could do worse than stay here but I'm pretty sure you could do better (both in terms of price and/or location). You could make an argument that the hotel is very reasonably priced given that it's on the seaward side of Kalakaua Avenue but a counter argument could be made that it's location at the far southern end of Kalakaua actually makes it harder to get to than some of the more inland places.",New Jersey,42,4.0

The fact that the hotel does not have a restaurant didn't bother us, There are so many great breakfast spots throughout Honolulu. Try Bill's, Kokohead Cafe or Kaila's to name a few. The fact that the hotel does not have a pool also didn't bother us, Kaimana beach has a fraction of the crowds that Waikiki has and the water in our opinion is just as nice (3 minute walk away). The $25 boutique fee not only included parking but also several bottles of water throughout the day and complimentary wine in the evening. Most Waikiki hotels charge $30 or more for parking only. The room itself was very clean and spacious. We requested two double beds that could not be met at check-in so they gave us a King and a roll-away bed with a comfortable (roughly 6 inch mattress) instead at no additional cost. Worked out good for us and the room was easily big enough. Did I mention that this hotel is much quieter than all hotels in Waikiki, and for the people that complained about having a view of a parking lot..... it's better than sitting on your balcony and looking across at the people sitting on their balconies like we have had several times before in Waikiki.

In fact, if lucky enough, as I, you will have a room with a FABULOUS VIEW of the crater! Let me tell you why you 'simply must' try a stay here. First of all, it is 'boutique' so none of this 25 floors etc. It is small, rare to find in Waikiki. Second, staff (although most of the hotels, ALOHA is everywhere!) The amenities though are what separated this property from others. the 'in room' coffee is illy!!! espresso or brew machine, OMG! I love illy coffee!!!The towels are fluffy and generous size. The water is nice and HOT if you want it.I was 'upgraded' to a corner room with two lanai's. One had chairs, the other just for looking out.

The temperature was such that we were able to have our balcony doors slightly open at night to hear the ocean. The hotel does require cars to be valet parked, but the cost is reasonable. There are amenities offered such as bottled water (from valet) and cold water in the lobby. Bicycles are available for use for free. Also, there is a shuttle that runs to all the Aqua hotels and the Ala Moana Center (shopping center) which is nice if you need to run to the mall, or you want to ride to downtown Honolulu locations.The one downside for the hotel is the extremely limited breakfast. There are a few ala cart items available (cereal, muffins, fruit), but the selection is very limited. It would be best if you planned on eating elsewhere for breakfast if possible.

EVERY time we left in the morning, the valet greeted us with our car and two bottles of cold water for our adventures. And when the front desk learned that we intended to try a different beach each day, they gave us beach chairs to keep in the car for the week -- and fresh beach towels daily. At the end of our stay, we decided to do a small load of laundry (they even have coin washers and dryers) before starting our cruise. The maid offered us extra hangers!

I am so glad we went with the Lotus. It was very modern, and very clean. It is situated at the far end of Waikiki so it is quiet and you face a park and Diamond Head. I recommend walking to the beachfront café for breakfast - it is just past the Aquarium along the beachfront sidewalk. There is also a small convenient store next door which has just about everything. We initially were given a room on the 3rd floor, but we ended up spending a bit more to upgrade to the 11th floor after seeing the view. The elevator is a bit noisy, so be sure and select a room that is away from it. The valet parking can seem a bit silly since you can see your car parked right there, but I suppose if it is very crowded they may have to shuffle cars around the lot (when we were there there did not appear to be many cars in the lot).

This boutique hotel fit the bill perfectly for our 5 night stay. We rented a car and so we went all over the island to our favorite haunts and restaurants - we only ate one or two meals in Waikiki and the walk was doable. I loved the valet parking (they guys helped my husband get the surfboard on the car) and they always had water bottles for us to to take with us. We liked the quiet little beach close to the hotel. To me what made this hotel perfect was the staff - always friendly even when busy - coffee in the morning - wine every afternoon. Our kids felt comfortable checking out chairs and boogie boards.

No dinner options: again, there are plenty of options either 15 mins walk or 10 mins bike ride away down Kapahulu, and everything is better than ripoff Waikiki burger joints.

A 15 - 20 minute walk along by the Ocean up to the heart of Waikiki Beach (very busy!) We didn't eat at the hotel, but found a nice cafe - The Barefoot Cafe - about a 10 minute walk from hotel, right by the ocean. It was nice to sit outside by the beach eating breakfast, which was very good value. Wifi was free, there was a fridge in the room and we were given complimentary large bottle of water each day. Staying at this hotel also gives you access to a small nearby beach, which we enjoyed. The hotel provided small beach chairs and towels. It was lovely to swim in the sea.I would have given this hotel 5 stars, but for the lack of resataurant facilities. We arrived at 10pm after a long flight from NZ, but there was nowhere open nearby to get anything to eat or drink. The hotel restaurant does offer a limited breakfast, but is not open at any other time! Strangely, if you look up the restaurant (it's called The Park) on Trip Advisor it has reviews, but when I questioned this at reception they said it closed a while ago due to lack of customers!Also, when I pulled the bedside table out to look for a socket to charge my phone, I was dismayed by the amount of dust and some rubbish behind it!","Skipton, United Kingdom",30,4.0

The location is excellent -- down the strip and away from the madness of Waikiki, but an easy 20 minute along the ocean into the ""thick"" of Waikiki fun. We had a corner suite with two balconies, with a view of Diamond Head to the left and the ocean to the right (though if you go with this option, ask for a floor higher than 5-- we are on the 5th floor, and the tree top partially blocked our view of the ocean). The room was thoughtfully appointed, plenty of towels and toiletries, very quiet, and very comfortable. Our room also had a mini-fridge. I most appreciated that the $25/day resort fee included the amenities of valet parking, WiFi, yoga mats, beach towels, and in-room coffee service (as well as yoga classes three mornings/week), so there were no ""surprise"" additional charges at the end of the stay. (Lots of hotels tack on a $30 valet fee in addition to the resort fee, which is very cheeky, in my opinion.) The hotel also made bikes available, but we did not use them.Beware, however, that there is no pool or restaurant in the hotel. One hotel over (the Lotus is grouped tightly with two other hotels), there is access to a quiet beach, which we never saw crowded (again, unlike Waikiki). The hotel next door (Otani Kaimana) has a restaurant right on the sand (the Hau Tree Lanai). To breakfast at Hau Tree Lanai, make reservations with OpenTable. Alternatively, a five minute walk takes you to the Barefoot Beach Cafe (mediocre food, go for the view) and a fifteen minute walk takes you to Tucker & Bevvy, in the lobby of the Park Shore Waikiki, which has excellent breakfast paninis and breakfast smoothies.","Santa Monica, California",58,5.0

There is also a frequent complimentary shuttle service to the Ala Moana shopping centre. Our room was spacious and immaculately clean. However my wife and I found the staff manning the front desk temporarily absent on occasion.Our chief complaint is with the hotel's confusing pricing structure. We had pre-booked a room with a ""Diamond Head view"" a month in advance of our arrival, and were quoted a daily rate of $296.50, taxes and fees included, for a 5-night stay. The predominant view from the 5th floor room we were initially given was of a rooftop parking lot, and Diamond Head itself was mostly obscured by trees. Once we moved up to a 9th floor room with a full view of Diamond Head we had to pay a surcharge of $40 per night, plus an obligatory $25 per day ""Boutique Fee,"" along with a ""Transient Accommodations Tax"" of 9.25% and a ""General Excise Tax"" of 4.712%. As a result our daily rate then climbed to $342.Whilst there I went online to check the latest rates quoted by the hotel and was surprised to find advertised rates ranging from $176 to $202 per night, which left me wondering whether I had short-changed myself by pre-booking a month in advance. Finally I would question whether it is worth paying a premium for an ""Ocean View"" since the ocean itself is only partially visible between other nearby buildings. That being said, my wife and I would consider staying here again on a subsequent visit, but only after investigating pricing and room availability more carefully.","Ancram, New York",67,4.0

We were explained about all the charges which we were then informed of a charge if we were interested in Valet and wifi internet. My wife then afterwards stated the fact that we were under the impression that wifi is complimentary in the rooms which then he responded it was which was odd.. It seemed as if he was just trying to get more from us but could of possibly been a mistake on his part but doubtful in my eyes.We had a premium room with what was a partial ocean view & a full view of the Diamond Head. The room was really modern with a nice open layout that had wooden shutter doors which widely open up to the patio which was absolutely fantastic!! Every morning we loved opening up the doors and allowing the breeze, sun & chirping of birds to flow right in! Each suite is equipped with a fantastic nespresso style espresso machine that was always fully stocked every morning which was great.The hotel is super quiet & clean. Every day at 6:30pm they have complimentary wine in the lobby which was a super nice touch! The staff was really friendly & helpful thru out our stay.If you're looking for a hotel on the beach the Lotus isn't exactly located on the beach although its just a minute away thru the parking lot and a private walk way between a couple buildings. The beach seems to be apart of a rowing club but no one said anything to us and it was fantastic, quiet and beautiful! The hotel provided complimentary beach towels that you can get at the front desk.Unfortunately we had a mishap at this hotel where I accidentally left a piece of jewellery in the safe that must off been missed by myself when getting ready to leave.. Unfortunately it wasn't found when I called to check if they could look. Apparently there was someone already in the room for a stay and they told the front desk that there was nothing there.

The Lotus is located at the quiet end of Waikiki, right near Diamond Head. There is a small group of hotels and luxury apartments in this area, and though it's a bit removed from the shopping and tourist scene, it's preferable in many ways. You can actually find a place to sit on the beach, there are lots of pretty parks nearby (including Diamond Head), and in general it's a more interesting scene.The Lotus is small and manageable. It's easy to get into the garage if you have a car (no gargantuan parking garages), and to get out of the city fast (much less traffic in this part of town). My room was large, extremely comfortable, and more modern and up-to-date than anywhere else I've stayed in Waikiki, though still lovely and tropical. Though the hotel is not directly on the beach, it's just an easy two-minute walk away. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a more relaxed and laid back Waikiki experience, who doesn't need to be right next to a designer boutique or a shopping mall. It would also be great for business or single travelers. Note that the Kaimana Hotel is right next store, directly on the beach. It's a fixture of this part of Waikiki, with a lovely restaurant and a variety of different room types. I've had nice stays at the Kaimana, but of the two, I'd choose the Lotus; the rooms are nicer, for starters. (Though definitely have a meal at the Hau Tree.)One suggestion: I loved my room facing Diamond Head and the surrounding parks. I have the sense that it's a better view than the one facing the ocean, due to how the hotel is situated. If views are important to you, I'd ask the hotel for their guidance.","Boston, Massachusetts",151,5.0

I appreciate all the small touches, like an attractive urn of water in the lobby during the day, and the cool and intimate lobby with lovely koa wood panels and some seating. The Lotus is nearly all the way down Waikiki to Diamond Head, which is a great thing for quiet and calm; it's also generally the last drop off on Speedi Shuttle. This year I was particularly struck by all the earlier drop offs -- enormous lobbies and crowds at the big chains, long driveways, roundabout traffic patterns in and out of the access roads. Not so at the Lotus. Hop out of the van, say hi to the one person in the small parking lot and you are at the desk -- very simple and appealing.I'd contacted the hotel last year about the elevator doors, from the lobby upwards they are VERY heavy and loud when opening and closing, and the staff honored my request this time that I be as far as possible from the elevator. Excellent service.The entire property is non smoking but there will always be addicts who ignore the rules and pollute the balconies off the pretty, comfortable rooms. I am so sorry about this, but that's up to guests who are so rude, not management; they do all they can to respond to smokers lighting up. I will always call this property home when in Honolulu.","Tacoma, Washington",14,5.0

The Lotus was amazing. We had a room on a low floor with a Diamondhead view - we were pleasantly surprised that we had a small view of the ocean as well (obviously, would have been better higher up, but we hadn't paid for a water view so we were happy with what we got)! The room was clean, modern, and the bathroom was huge. The staff at the hotel was great - everyone was friendly and helpful. Two highlights were the mountain bike and the locals beach right by the hotel. We used the mountain bikes everyday. We rode up to Diamondhead park to go hike, we rode to grab breakfast in downtown Honolulu, and we rode to a lookout for sunrise in the a.m. We didn't even need a car! The beach by the hotel was also perfect - there was a park, there were a few locals there, but it was a quiet, peaceful beach with plenty of space and not too many tourists!If you're looking for a quiet, low key spot for a vacation - but with easy access to the hustle and bustle of Honolulu, book the Lotus!","Seattle, Washington",0,5.0

It was half the price of the extremely expensive hotel chosen by the group down in the busy part of Waikiki. It didn't matter that the Lotus had no restaurant or pool or other amenities. I just wanted a nice place to sleep. Lotus is in a very quiet area by Diamond Head, but close enough to the bustle of Waikiki to either walk or drive in a few minutes. The hotel staff was wonderful. One of the maintenance guys stopped me and asked if I had lost my passport -- they had found it in a bag I left behind and were searching me out. The valet parking was actually sort of cute -- we handed over our car and then the valet drove it 20 feet to park it. But all that was easy to forgive because it was such a good deal and everyone made you feel good.The nightly wine happy hour was fun and relaxed. The ""breakfast"" was coffee plus small bakery items available to purchase. I had an end room which had two sides of windows/balconies.

The room we were allocated was large and had a big comfortable bed. The room was kept immaculate by the housekeeping staff and the towels were the nicest we had on our four week holiday to the US beating bigger, more expensive hotel chains, by a mile. We had lovely views from our large balcony and saw the Green Parrots in the nearby trees. Our room was close to the elevator but we did not get disturbed once whilst staying here. The hotel is a bit outside of Wakiki and this suited us as it was so busy in the main part of town but it is a nice stroll into the centre or main beaches.All members of staff could not do enough for us and always with a smile. A bowl of apples was placed on a shelf at the side of the elevator on the ground floor each morning for guests to take. We had breakfast in the hotel on six of the seven days we stayed and found the prices were just the same as going into town and we did not have to wait or queue to be served. The hotel did not do cooked breakfasts whilst we were staying but the selection of food on offer was good enough for us. We loved the papaya filled with mixed fruit and had this every day along with a selection of other items on the menu.There is a small/nice beach for hotel residents/residents of the near condos, which is safe and if you are lucky you might get to see Rocky the local endangered Monk Seal having a sleep on the beach (see photograph), there are only 1,100 of these left in the world.As has previously been written, there are cycles, chairs etc. for hotel guests to use, a hire car for rental and free wine in reception early evening.We would definitely return to this hotel if visiting Honolulu in the future.","Manchester, United Kingdom",218,5.0

We were offered an upgraded room which afforded us beautiful views of Diamond Head and the ocean. I found the rooms nicely decorated in the Asian style, very comfortable. The staff, including valets, were all very attentive and helpful. Breakfast is limited to continental style with some fruit and granola choices and free coffee. Eric was very good about service, so it still beat going down the beach to a crowded restaurant. There is an amenity fee which includes parking but it's not a bad deal when you have a car considering the cost of parking in the Waikiki area. They offer a free shuttle to and from central Waikiki, making stops at several other Aqua hotels. The major downer is the elevator. Other reviewers have commented on this lately. The elevator went down during our stay, forcing us to use the stairs to reach our 10th floor room. The staff was apologetic but, clearly, this is a major problem when there is only one elevator to serve the 12-story hotel. Overall, I enjoyed the stay. This is a good choice for location and price.

Cons: -Lack of dining/nightlife options in the area (no restaurant on premises). -The elevator was extremely slow (only one elevator for entire hotel) and broke once while we were staying there. We just usually walked down the 5 flights of steps instead of wait. - The 2nd floor was pretty creepy and depressing since it's just an abandoned restaurant. Would I stay here again? Maybe - for us I wish we would have rented a car for the whole week so we could have been more mobile and the Lotus is a great home base if you are going to be exploring the island and just relaxing on the beach in your downtime.

They also offer yoga, wine before the evening, coffee and tea between certain hours and daily newspapers but I cannot comment on these since we didn't take advantage if them. We were also told they rent out cars there for guests but we took advantage of another company which offered convertible smart cars. Yes, it is about a 10-15 walk to the ""main"" strip and beach but given all of our eating out and our desire to not be right smack dab in the middle of tourist-city we welcomed the walk and saw it more as an opportunity to take a stroll rather than an inconvenience. Plus, there is a convenience store literally seconds away if you are hard pressed for alcohol, sunblock, cheese or other random items. Would I stay here again? Yes, if I am with people who don't mind the short walk! The rooms were so large, clean and spacious that it was definitely worth the stay.","Edmonton, AB",7,4.0

The room furniture was shabby, however it was clean. I guess I expected more for a $225/night accommodation. We had a peaceful evening and everything was fine. The issue that was slightly annoying was the surprise 'Boutique Fee' of $25 + tax per night. We booked the room via Priceline, and everything was to be included in the quoted cost. When we checked in, we were required to pay this fee, or we could not stay. If the fee is a requirement, they should simply include it in the rate. They should also instruct their people to better explain or 'sell' the Boutique Fee so certain customers don't feel like they are being taken advantage of. In my opinion, it was an unnecessary hassle that put a damper on the stay. We've never had a fee of this type at any hotel, and in any of the countries we traveled to.",Hawaii,7,3.0

Booked for 5 nights and left early because this hotel is not equipped for a pleasure trip - didn't want to ruin our vacay by spending time at this hotel. Pros: Waikiki beach is just a few steps from the hotel and the hotel provides free beach towels and chairs.Cons: 1. Service - A surly valet who expected us to unload our luggage without offering to help. We were booked for a Diamond head view room - the receptionist sent us to the room on the third floor which faces the multi-storeyed parking lot of neighboring building - no views of the ocean or the volcano whatsoever. It took a ""conversation"" and an extra $60 per night charge to get a decent room with a view (albeit with chipped furniture, tired wallpaper and a lumpy bed) - which was termed as a ""premium"" room.2. Decor - the lobby is passable, but the rest of the hotel is TIRED and needs updated furniture, flooring, wall paper, shower areas in the bathrooms, a fresh coat of paint and non lumpy beds. 3.The dark purple walls and brown chairs and upholstery in the breakfast area is Depressing - first thing in the morning. There is only one person serving the guests at breakfast, limited choices, and you have to stand around the counter waiting till she takes your order and serves you. 3. The hotel has no restaurants or food service except a meagre breakfast spread (for which you have to pay extra). The hotel is also not situated anywhere near walking distance of restaurants. The management of the hotel should take vacation and travel around a bit to understand what constitutes a good boutique hotel and good service for the rest of the world. Stay here if you get a very cheap deal or if you are on a business trip and don't use/need hotel facilities - otherwise, save your money, time and spirit!!!",,10,1.0

Room was modern, great views from balcony, clean, small shower though. Location is away from hustle and bustle, so don't stay here if you want to be in the mix of Waikiki. Since it was a bit away from the more touristy part of town, there are less restaurants and amenities within walking distance. So close to the beach.Breakfast offerings could have been improved. Only pre-made items and things that could be microwaved. Would have been nice to have hot offerings as well.Elevator is painfully slow and feels like a service elevator. In addition, the last day of my stay (of course when I'm leaving and with my luggage), the elevator konks out. Waiting for 10 minutes - nothing. I call down to the front desk and they say that, yes, it's broken, we are calling maintenance, etc. someone will come up to help me with my luggage. Waiting again, no one. So I carry my luggage down myself, in heels, 9 floors. When I get down there, they look puzzled at me. Apparently the elevator got fixed in the time I went down the stairs. Of course.

There are no rooms with unobstructed ocean views at the Lotus like one of the big hotels off Waikiki beach, but you won't have to pay $100 more per night for it.

The rooms are bright and have good views of the ocean and the water, we stayed in 921 which had good elevation. Rooms lower down would not have such good views. Two queen beds were ample for our family and the bathroom was big enough, though not with a full-size bath. It was quiet and had a leafy feel, being opposite the park and at the foot of Diamond Head. It's a 15-20 minute stroll into Waikiki, but if you have young kids in summer you would probably get the courtesy bus or a taxi. You can get towels, beach chairs, snorkels, boogie boards free of charge from the hotel, plus bikes to cruise into town. There are not many restaurants nearby and the breakfast at the hotel is small-scale, not a big buffet. There is not a proper restaurant at the hotel, truth be told. We liked it, it was just what we needed, but I could see how folks wanting the big hotel experience would not like it. The beach is a very short walk away past two other hotels right on the water.

Almost $4 for a beagle with cream cheese. Currently the hotel restaurant is closed for renovations. I’m not sure what they are planning to do and it didn’t seem like they were renovating anything as no work was being done. However on Friday and Saturday nights they have closed special events going until 2am. Originally I was placed on the 3rd floor right above the restaurant and it was extremely loud, basically impossible to sleep. So I had them move me to a room on the 4th floor. It was still really loud but I could at least sleep. The special events were a major nuisance since I was there for work and it sounded like a dance club.

He had friends that had apparently stopped by and he was too busy visiting. One more thing is that we were soo glad that we were not staying on Waikiki beach. What a zoo!

I left the doors open all night and was awakened each morning (around 5:15) to the manu mele (birds song). It was lovely!Just be aware of a few things that have been mentioned by many others ... there isn't a pool or a gym (but who really needs either of those things in Hawaii); the hotel is not right on the beach, but it's very, very close and has access (literally walk through the parking lot) to a great little, private beach that you share with the Outrigger Canoe Club and the Colony Surf Hotel. The hotel will give you beach chairs and towels to use too. I didn't use the free bikes because I didn't have time (was visiting for work), but I would have loved to use them. The location, for me, is perfect. It is close enough to Waikiki to walk there and do whatever you want to do, but it's also far enough away that you can avoid Waikiki. I love being down at the Diamond Head end of Waikiki, but just be aware that the walk along the beach through Kapiolani park to Waikiki is about 10 minutes. Be aware (or check with the hotel) that the hotel restaurant is ""closed for remodeling."" That was kind of a bummer. They did serve a continental style breakfast, which met my needs, but I was hoping for the restaurant.I would recommend Tiki's as a relatively inexpensive place to eat and/or have a drink.

We asked for and got a high, corner room and were not diaappointed, with beautiful views of both the ocean and Diamond Head. We would definitely recommend the Lotus as an excellent value and a quiet alternative to Waikiki's big chain hotels.","Montville, New Jersey",2,5.0

It was a nice way to end the day, with the breeze and the beach nearby at the end of each day. If you do not enjoy walks, then this hotel is probably not for you. We never ate at the restaurant. Breakfast was a selection of cold items - bagels, muffins, fruit, etc. I'm not even sure it was open for dinner, there are way too many great choices in town to even check it out.

I had booked the Lotus because I knew it was was close to Waikiki but away from the noise and chaos. I wished I had stayed here the whole time. I had a ninth floor Ocean View Premium room and it was just fantastic. Two balconies, modern decor, huge flat screen TV and spacious room. It is the little things I liked about this hotel - free bikes, beach chairs and towels, free wine every evening, newspapers, coffee and fruit. Every afternoon a room attendant would call in to replenish the ice bucket, and provide any other items you needed. What a pleasure to be able to sleep,with both balcony doors wide open and cool breezes instead of air conditioning. The staff are great and promptly respond to requests. I didn't use the restaurant so can't comment on it. A limited breakfast is available. The private beach is only a one minute walk with the other public beach beside it. In my view San Souci beach is the best in Waikiki with no coral and soft sand. It's only a one minute walk away. The walk into Waikiki takes about 10-15 mins. The bus to Hanauma Bay stops outside the hotel. I loved is place and will return.I would definitely pay the extra for a high floor room.

During our stay, we stayed in two room types. Both had comfortable beds, quality furnishings with excellent housekeeping. The staff were uniformly friendly, had a great attitude and were knowledgeable about the area. All the vibes are positive. It’s been noted in previous reviews about the breakfasts, so I won’t comment on that.I would like to add our experience with two room categories:Diamond Head View Premium Room. The hotel’s website features a photo and a room description: “Luxurious corner units feature two private lanais offering stunning views of Diamond Head and the Pacific Ocean.” We were assigned room 521 with a tree blocking the view of Diamond Head from one window and from the other window a view of a parking lot and a sliver of ocean. We heard the sound of the elevator when it opened & closed, people talking and children yelling in the hallway, and motor scooters, cars & buses going by on the street. In the morning we are awakened around 6:50AM by the beep-beep of delivery trucks backing up. We asked for a room change away from the street and a higher floor. Here we learn that this category of room is only up to the 6th floor – the top floors of 7-12 are another price category, Ocean View Premium Room. With no availability on these top floors we agreed to an upgrade to an Ocean View Room and hopeful that we’ll get a good nights rest there. Ocean View Room. The hotel’s website features a photo and a room description: “Lotus Honolulu Ocean View rooms feature majestic views of the Pacific Ocean, 380 square feet of space, and a furnished private lanai.” We are assigned 1024, away from the elevator and more towards the ocean side. Take a look at the photos to see what you think of the “majestic views of the Pacific Ocean”. However, the room is quieter. But around 6:50AM those delivery trucks back-up beeping like an alarm clock. So to summarize:Depending upon how light or solid a sleeper you are, you may be perfectly satisfied with any of the rooms.If a view is really important to you, look at the photos that other guests have posted not just the ones posted on the hotel’s website.I suggest discussing your room choice with staff before making reservations.Perhaps these concerns could be rectified with a more modern quiet elevator and heavier duty sound proof windows.","Miami Beach, Fl",253,3.0

That is, the one thing the hotel lacks is a good roadside sign; so we missed it the first time, and had to do a long loop around Queen Kapiolani Park, and try again. And this was in broad daylight; but at least it's a low-speed zone. The entrance to the small parking lot is subtle and easily missed, and the main hotel entrance is off that same parking alleyway, under an overhanging roof.The parking, being tight, is by valet only, but the valets are quick and polite, and they do not expect tips. The service here is young, but polite and helpful. Room service requests are quickly answered. Our spotless high corner room offered a view of Diamond Head and a partial view of the ocean (it's not a wide building, by Waikiki standards). There was a good stiff breeze in the evenings. The WiFi was free, and strong. Wine ""hour"" was from 3-5 and involved one white and one red; self-serve.The ""Pascal Morabito"" toiletries are great - little odor, and no greasy residue. The room has good towels too.The hallways are exterior only, and we did hear a child running nearby on occasion. Why do people spoil their children by bringing them to places like this? Please, folks, leave the kids at home, or take them to the Holiday Inn; this is the kind of hotel best appreciated by mature and sophisticated adults. The hotel is right across the street from Queen Kapiolani Park. This is good, and bad. Bad, because on weekends Hawaiian families gather for barbecues and loud music, which can last all day; but they're gone by 10 pm. Good, because you can walk across the park in the morning to the nearby restaurants and breakfast places on the northwest side of the park, on Montserrat (see our other reviews - Diamond Head Grill, South Shore Grill, and so on). Do this, rather than having the ""continental"" in-hotel breakfast, which is pricey and nothing special. The bed was low (as we like it), and comfortable. The pictures on the website gave an accurate semblance of our room. No problems at all with water or electricity. A small aquarium run by a university is a short walk along the waterfront, and is a worthwhile place to visit.We would stay here again if we were in the Waikiki area.

Had a corner room on an upper floor and appreciated the cross ventilation and territorial view. Only issue was noise coming from the Penthouse unit above us. Made two trips (at 10:30 and 11:30 PM) to the front desk to request that the occupants of the room stop dragging furniture across the floor and to refrain from loud conversations on their balcony. Front Desk agent indicated she would inform the manager of my complaint. I ask for the manager to contact me the next morning. No one contacted me.

We booked a corner room and arrived late at night. We awoke the next morning to a spectacular view of Diamond Head. Everything that has been written about the staff is spot on--helpful, congenial and professional. We had breakfast the first morning in the 2nd floor restaurant seated by the window and taking in the pleasant sights, sounds and aromas from outdoors. The breakfast staff couldn't be more pleasant and helpful. Although food choices were limited, the selections were fresh and tasty. Free coffee, tea and hot chocolate are offered each morning. As the room had a nice mini fridge, we bought breakfast items for the remainder of our stay, but visited the restaurant each day for our coffee and daily newspaper.The rooms are adequately sized and outfitted with plenty of storage for personal items, a desk, chair and ottoman. A table and chair are located on the balcony but the day it rained, we brought them indoors for our breakfast and they fit in perfectly without crowding the room.A Starbucks coffee machine and coffee capsules were provided for that morning wake-up cup.Under the tv is more storage and the mini fridge..One long wall of the bathroom is vanity/mirror with a lot of space on either side of the sink for toiletries. Opposite the vanity is shelving with a large selection of bath towels, hand towels, washcloths, etc. I believe all rooms are equipped with showers, which is fine by me. Often bathrooms with tub and shower seem to be a waste of space and the tub usually goes unused.The only complaint I heard from other guests is that there is only one elevator for the 12 story building causing wait times, but with only 5 units per floor, we didn't see that as a problem. The elevator does open onto a corridor which is open air and, seemingly, some guest seem to forget they are in a hotel and use their ""outdoor"" voices while waiting for the elevator.The location is close to San Souci Beach,close to a bus stop and an easy walk to Waikiki.The clientele is well rounded with young families, couples, seniors and it's evident that manyare frequent visitors.","Minneapolis, Minnesota",130,5.0

The hotel's greatest attribute is the customer service - possibly the best service we have received at any hotel in North America and likely do to the fact that it is a boutique hotel with less than 50 rooms therefore the attention to guest satisfaction is higher than a standard hotel. For this I give them full credit as everyone from the valet to housekeeping do a fine job (the staff here actually run to complete tasks which wasn't necessary but fun to watch). The free evening wine and water during our stay were nice touches as well. The hotel was recently renovated but that doesn't mean everything is new as many areas of the hotel and room were untouched. For example, our bathroom was very old and motel-esque and not particularly clean compared to other $400/nt hotels. Higher end hotels will often do a renovation which means everything is new in the room but I would classify the Lotus as having done a partial renovation. Now, I should clarify that we have been to Waikiki a dozen times and if this was our first stay in Waikiki we would have been very pleased overall especially if we knew beforehand that there is no pool, pool access or fitness facility and didn't expect these amenities, which we were aware of. However we have been to Waikiki and stayed at other hotels therefore we have the luxury of making comparisons which is why we suggest this hotel is average. The location is definitely away from the crowds of Waikiki on Kalakaua but a short 10 minute walk if you want to be in the Waikiki mix but there is a large park almost beside the hotel which has some interesting characters. The massive park across the street is filled with people doing athletics. The hotel shares a private beach with Outrigger but it is very small and there is a lot of coral and rock a few meters into the water so bring water shoes if you intend to hit the beach and enter the water. I would recommend staying here for $200/nt but at $400/nt you can do better unless your primary focus is service within the hotel because that aspect is unparalleled. We did not try the restaurant during our stay but the reviews on TA appear to be good.","Banff, Canada",103,3.0

The hotel faces east with great views of Diamond Head. More limited views of the ocean, but you could throw a stone to the balcony to the beach.

We were travelling with 3 kids and I was worried the two rooms we booked would not be together and we would end up with one of the lower floors. We booked the D.H. Premium View and D.H. View. I sent an email to the Gen. Mgr. Joshua Gray and he made sure we had the top floor for that room and we were together. He also made sure there were two dbl beds in the kid's room and a king in the adult room. (The also provided a roll away bed so the two kids didn't have to share a dbl bed.) The staff was professional and fast. One of the coffee makers wasn't working in our room and it was replaced in less than 5 minutes. When we arrived, and during our whole stay, Wes worked the front desk was awesome. He helped us with everything we needed including printed directions and advice on anything we needed. I can't say enough good things about ALL the staff! (Thanks again Wes!)The rooms at Lotus are clean, new, updated, warm, comfortable, roomy, and have a great view of Diamond Head. You can even see a little of the ocean from our 7th floor room. This property is not beach front, but it's only steps away from beach. (Who needs a pool when you have the beach!) The hotel provides towels, chairs, sand toys etc...for whatever you might need at the beach. They do offer complimentary wine in the afternoon. We didn't make it to any of these afternoons, but it looked like the guests enjoyed the benefit.The main reason we picked this hotel was the location. The main area where all the hotels are is very crazy. We liked the Lotus because it's not on the strip but close enough to walk. With all the food I was eating, it was nice to walk a bit. The hotel also provides bikes to borrow for free. Parking at the hotel is valet. I was hoping to get away from the valet parking, but I decided to just pay for the convenience. If I could offer any areas of improvement it would be having the trees cut so you could have a better view of Diamond Head, especially below the 7th floor. It looks like the trees were basically cut right at the 7th floor. Below the 7th floor, I think the view would be partially obstructed by the trees. To be fair, I don't think the Lotus has control over the tree cutting. I think the trees are on City property. In any event, if you are on a budget, and can only afford the lower rooms, ask for the 7th floor. We saw the sunrise every morning over Diamond Head and it was beautiful.To sum up, there is nothing I have to complain about the Lotus. The staff and accommodations were excellent. It has a feel of very high quality hotel without the pretentiousness of some hotels. It was nice walking around the hotel and having the staff know your name.

The man working the front desk was incredibly kind to us and everybody else checking in/asking questions- it seemed like a genuine kindness, which I appreciate. The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are comfortable and extremely clean. Our view and patio were breathtaking and I felt a bit pampered staying there, even though our room was not as expensive as other hotel rooms in the area. It was about a mile walk to the downtown area where Waikiki beach is, but it was a nice walk.This is especially nice as the downtown area is loud and bustling. The rooms are much more quiet because it is away from the craziness that is Waikiki. We were constantly treated well and it is very close to the park and Aquarium. There is yoga in the mornings and you can borrow anything from bikes to beach equipment from the hotel. I regret only staying here one night and my next trip will include more stays at the Lotus. I'd definitely recommend it as a safe and pleasant place to stay in Honolulu. It is more of an adult oriented hotel- it is not unfriendly to kids in the slightest but this would be a fantastic hotel for a romantic weekend- note that it doesn't have a pool, but seriously, you're a few feet from the ocean- you don't need a pool, I guarantee it.","Boise, Idaho",5,5.0

Driving is of course always another option.Count in the cost for valet parking cause there's hardly any public parking space available in that area. However, the stuff has been very friendly from the very first moment. They gave me a room on the 11th floor so that I can catch a glimpse of the ocean when I look out of the window.

The beach is only a short walk away and if you needed to go back into Waikiki, the bus goes right past, but you can walk there in about 15 minutes. The view at night back to Waikiki is one of the best you'll get anywhere.","Sydney, Australia",11,5.0

The lobby is lovely. There is always fresh fruit and fresh water. The complementary wine in the afternoon is an added plus, as is the free coffee in the morning. If you don't want to buy breakfast from the restaurant on the 2nd floor, there is a convenience store next door. But make sure to eat dinner at the restaurant - great food and friendly servers. We went up for dessert one night, and two nights later, when we went back for dinner, Lisa remembered us! The front desk welcome was so warm and helpful - TJ and Travis really went out of their way to give us information, and to help us book our tour of the Arizona.The room was beautiful!! From our balcony, we had great views of Diamondhead and the ocean, admittedly with a parking lot in front, but the other 2 views made up for it!The beach was just a short walk, and thanks to Travis, we went equipped with beach chairs and towels. Small, but quiet beach - just what we were looking for.Admittedly, central Waikiki was a bit of a hike, but considering the craziness ( sort of like Times Square), we loved the location. We had been told not to get a car for Honolulu, and the advice was right on! Traffic is horrendous and there is no place to park. One day we walked down, but since I had a bad leg, we cabbed it down. One day we were actually able to take a bus back to the hotel, but that didn't happen again - they stopped running at 4:30 in the afternoon!? I made the suggestion that the hotel could offer a shuttle service just to central Waikiki a few times a day.I don't know if I would visit Honolulu again, but I do know that I would definitely stay at another Lotus property.","Livingston, New Jersey",11,5.0

I would suggest trying to get a higher floor but you may not get it with the limited amount of rooms. It never hurts to ask. The only odd thing about my room was the shower/Tub combination. It was really a stand up shower and not a tub. It's a bathtub only an toddler can use. I give the Lotus high marks.

Seriously people?I have written very favorable reviews of other places (see prior). And in fairness, the Lotus is an OK place. But the disconnect between the rave reviews of others and what you actually get is stunning. Given its rank, and its reviews, I can only blame myself for not looking more closely and reading the Lotus web site with the same skepticism that one would use when reading real estate listings in New York City.Let me start with the good: The Staff is truly wonderful, kind, helpful and deserve to work at a better hotel. This review is in no way a criticism of them. They could not have done anything more to improve our stay, which is why we did not complain to them. The issues with the hotel are beyond their correction. Also good: Free bicycles to borrow; attractive quiet lobby.The disappointing:1. ""steps from"" the beach is NOT on the beach; there is a row of buildings between the Lotus and the ocean, blocking what otherwise would be a great view2. No pool!

The lobby is modern and chic with colorful pillows and lots of comfy couches. 5 stars for customer service We were greeted immediately by the gentleman at guest services, PT. He was inviting and knowledgable. We were an hour early for check in, but our room was ready and we were allowed to get in earlier than check in time. PT remembered us and our room # the whole time without us having to constantly remind him of who we were. On the last day he asked about the wedding we attended, which meant he remembered our brief conversation upon our arrival 5 days later.  Travis helped us with bike rentals and was always friendly and accommodating. He gave us complimentary bottles of water and not only explained the bike laws, but gave recommendations for food!4 stars for experience Upon our arrival we were checked into a room with 2 double beds. I had reserved a king, but they had none left. If you read the fine print it says 2 doubles or king even if you click the button for the king online. We were informed that bed type could not be guaranteed, but we would be switched to a king the next day when one was available. Then the next morning we were awakened to construction on our patio. This was dreadful after staying out late our first night. We immediately called the front desk and were told there was nothing to be done about the construction, but were met with profuse apologies. My boyfriend called down a bit later since we were unable to keep sleeping and after speaking with the manager we were comped our first night. After that episode our experience was flawless. We were moved to the new room, never again woke up to construction and continued on to have a great experience at aqua lotus. 3 stars for view You have a view of diamond head and the ocean, but it's obstructed by a parking garage and many other buildings. From the lanai it's hard to block those things out of your view. From the bed it's gorgeous bc you can't see those obstructions as much. 4 stars for convenience The hotel is off the Waikiki strip, which can be a bonus if you want to be away from the congestion and noise. It's a bit more difficult to get places than if you were just staying downtown. It's about a 20 min walk to Waikiki proper and a 5 min bike ride. The hotel gives you bikes to rent for free which is fantastic. There's no ""resort"" fee, which you have to pay regardless of whether or not you take advantage at many of the hotels.

When my boyfriend asked for a shot f a specific gin they had 3 types from that maker. She let him taste all 3 to see which he liked best. A lot of their specialty cocktails came with vodka, which I don't like. Melissa was happy to make me my own special cocktail with a little extra love. One night they had live music. And they even let you take bottles of wine to your room. The only sad thing is they're only open till 11pm. ","San Francisco, California",21,4.0

This hotel was FABULOUS, exactly what I wanted... but it's important to know what you want: I was looking for a smaller, quieter, boutique-style hotel where I could get a great room with fantastic views and high quality service at a reasonable price. I wanted to be right on the ocean (not across the street from it), away from the crowded bustle of Waikiki (yet within easy walking distance of it). This hotel was all that and more: view of the ocean and Diamond Head, Triple A staff, right across from Kapiolani Regional Park (lots of fitness activities going on there), within in walking distance of zoo, aquarium and plenty of bus stops (bus system is pretty easy to navigate and inexpensive, but no problem getting a cab any time if you prefer - I did both). The hotel offers complimentary WIFI and wine between 3-5 PM, there is now a restaurant open on the premises (dinner only). There is complimentary coffee/tea service in the morning on the 2nd floor where you can also purchase. simple continental style breakfast items. My room (8th floor corner) had 2 balconies, complimentary water, refrigerator and a Starbucks Verissimo coffee maker that produced first rate lattes! Room service was twice/day. The decor was lovely,the room/bathroom was large,and the beds were extremely comfortable. There is an ATM in the hotel's spacious, serene and tastefully decorated lobby, a nearby convenience store and the award-winning Michel's Restaurant (French Haute Cuisine with an amazing view... you will not regret ordering Cherries Jubilee).I would re-book or recommend this hotel in a heartbeat, unless you ABSOLUTELY want a large, noisy, cookie-cutter, crowded hotel within the high end shopping district where you have to cross a heavily trafficked street in order to be at an over-populated beach.","Palm Springs, California",33,5.0

I prefer the quiet area, as I come to Hawaii to relax - not eat at Cheesecake Factory, shop at the Ferrari Store, and get over-whelmed by a ""World War Z"" swarm of tourists on the beach.- The hotel has its own restaurant for dinner (no breakfast or room service, however), and there are three nearby restaurants (Michel's, New Otani Hotel, and Beach Front Cafe). - The hotel has free wine from 3-5PM (legit!), and coffee/muffins for a charge during the morning (lame).- Next door is a small convenience store selling sundries, snacks, hygiene products, alcohol, etc.- The staff is efficient, friendly, and cool as [--] (offering paper cups so we could take our ""juice"" to the beach).The downsides: - Hotel is not beach front, and the ""ocean view room"" pictures are terrible misleading. The ""ocean views"" are the backsides of two taller buildings (which are beach front); in fact, you are better off getting a Diamond Head view, as they may offer great vistas of Kapiolani Park and Diamond Head. However, the hotel is within very easy walking distance (like ±150 feet), and they offer beach chairs.- No pool or gym. But whatever, you can swim in the ocean and do a few hikes.- No breakfast. The Beach Front Cafe is really good (and offers cheap eats), but requires a short walk to the park. But, damn, why not serve a basic breakfast, even for a charge?- No Room service. You have a restaurant, why not go the slightly extra step?- And, the travesty of travesties, no MINI BAR! How do you expect me to get ""housed""?Bottom line: I would stay here again if I stayed at a high room facing Diamond Head... and brought a supply of cereal and wine.",South Pole,4,4.0

The rooms are cleaned and service is great the problem is those are the only positives I can say.The hotel is far from any action which made evenings horrible for my wife and I. If you stay out too late you have to walk past homeless park where there are tons of homeless people. It makes you feel worried. Nothing happened mind you but walking at night through that is not exactly what I call paradise. There is no easy access to beach. The hotel provides you with cheap beach chairs which you have to walk to a beach a couple of hotels down. It gets very annoying as I was informed the hotel was beach front. Also the hotel is so far that no excursions picked us up. We had to got other hotels for pick up.There are no real options to eat at the hotel. The one place there was not our taste at all.I think this hotel works for older people. There is no life in lobby it just feels empty. If your goal is quietness and no action stay there.

I have mixed feelings about the hotel--- the rooms were nicely decorated with laminate wood and the staff was friendly and efficient- especially the valet parking! The hallways are open air and there is only 1 elevator (not a huge hotel so that was ok). Not much to eat or do around here, but the hotel is quiet. You have to take a little walk to the beach and some rooms have partial ocean views-- which ours did.

I had read the reviews over and over and thought that it would be nice to be away from the crowds and tourists in the main area of Waikiki. Well, the hotel is secluded and our shuttle bus driver had never even heard of it. The entrance is weird as it through the parking garage. We were not welcomed as others had said they were. If you stay there, make sure you have a car. There are no restaurants around at all to walk to unless you pay the high prices of their restaurant or two others in a nearby hotel or condo. The room was very nice, although there were stains on the folded bedspread at the end of the bed which should not have been and of which we complained. We were very unhappy there and wanted to change to another hotel that at least had something around it. The hotel is close to the beach but not on it. They offer you very low sand chairs that are rusty. My Mother may have gone to the beach if there were lounges but she doesn't sit on such low sand chairs which was the only choice. There is no nice outside places to sit if you do not go to the beach, only the balcony. We had many questions about things, like excursions to Pearl Harbor, trollies,and the guy at the desk merely gave me some pamphlets and did not offer to make any reservations for us until we asked. They were not helpful at all. I spoke to the manager and he said that his hotel is not a full service resort and does not have an excursion desk. That is a poor excuse as the most hip, chic boutique hotels in the northeast make sure their customers have everything they need. When I asked if they had the menus of the other restaurants nearby to look at, he said that he does not promote other restaurants. Well, the manager did reduce the cost of the room by 50% which was a nice gesture and did cover one taxi ride but we still had to pay for several other rides back and forth if we wanted to go out. Maybe if you have a car, it can make a difference. I would not recommend this hotel if you like service. Walking to the beach carrying one of their old sand chairs made me feel like I was staying at someone's apt. for the night. I think the place used to be a condominium and it must have been converted. Lobby is small, freezing cold and you never see many other guests. Boutique hotels can be great but the Lotus just didn't live up to its reviews. Everyone at the desk did not seem to know much. I would not recommend this hotel. We were extremely disappointed for our last day in Honalulu.","Hackensack, New Jersey",4,2.0

What more could you want?The staff were helpful and attentive and made us feel right at home, relaxed and comfortable as soon as we arrived. Even the service staff who came to clean our rooms and turn down our bed in the evenings were simply charming. Three cheers for their demure professionalism, which often goes unnoticed.Don't be concerned by the location, sure it's only glimpses of beach views and it's not right in Waikiki. It's a 1 minute walk to a lovely calm swimming beach which is shared by other hotels but not crowded at all.A comfortable 10 minute walk up to the main streets was no problem for us to ensure we weren't located in the mayhem of Waikiki. There's regular trolleys, buses and even free bicycles to get you into town if you don't want to walk. We thought the bicycles were great !One of the best thing about this hotel is that it ISN'T in the madhouse of the big chain hotels up on the main strip. Literally thousands of tourists jammed into that hotel and beach strip was very unattractive to us.We were told by others the restaurant was also very good, shame we missed the opportunity to try it.There was absolutely nothing we could fault about this hotel.

The staff here are absolutely excellent and very friendly. The rooms are awesome and very comfortable. One of the things I really dislike about the hotel is the lack of continental breakfast, even the crappiest hotels offer this! I guess people prefer to sit around at 2 in a dark lobby on sunny day and sip wine for free. Also, what's up with the ocean view vs. Diamond Head view? They won't give you a floor above 7 unless you booked an ""ocean view"" room. Not sure why 7 and above constitute ocean view when the view is absolutely no different!!

My 10 day stay was nothing short of spectacular! Upon arrival the staff was warm and welcoming. They greeted me with smiling faces and a water bottle. The hotel is clean, the décor is relaxing, the rooms are clean and spacious and the entire staff is so attentive. The General Manager, Joshua is also attentive…making sure each guest is happy. He even personally signs a thank you letter to each guest…WOW!!! I overheard a conversation with him and a guest who was staying for his 10th wedding anniversary... the restaurant had not reopened yet and the guest wanted to do something special for his wife… a special breakfast in bed… Joshua made it happen! You can’t get this ROYAL TREATMENT at the large hotels and certainly wouldn't see the General Manager taking such care of the guests. As everyone else has stated, the hotel isn't in the middle of the madness… it’s peaceful and relaxing. The walk to the restaurants is a quick one but it’s even quicker if you check out a beach cruiser bike from valet! You really feel spoiled by the staff and the multitude of extras are great… from beach bikes, chairs, water bottles, wine at night in the lobby, yoga in the park, and the Zen feel of the hotel… you won’t want to leave!!!

I started reading TripAdvisor posts after I had begun to plan our family trip to Hawaii, and as a result, I cancelled our reservations at a larger resort in a busy area of Waikiki so we could see if the Aqua Lotus lived up to all the great reviews. It sure did! Honolulu/the Waikiki area are wonderful of course, but as it is a busier area, it can be overwhelming for us folks who are used to the suburbs. Returning to this hotel after each day of sightseeing was soothing for my husband and I as well as our two daughters, 10 and 13.  As everyone says, the staff is without a doubt the best I have ever experienced in any other hotel, and we travel a lot. It was so nice to pull up our car and have someone ask how our day was, help us find a place to order pizza etc, this after the staff always made sure we had some water before we started out each day. While heading out to watch the 4th of July fireworks on the beach, we realized it would be a lot nicer if we had beach chairs. Of course when I returned to the lobby, we were immediately offered chairs we could borrow. We loved the views of Diamond Head, and felt ""at home"" in a busier part of Hawaii. In fact, when checking out, I asked a couple in the lobby if I could just cut in to say thank you at the front desk for a wonderful stay.

I had done a little research prior to booking my hotel in Honolulu, and was richly rewarded with my stay here. From check-in, to check-out, this hotel was outstanding in all facets of service. Check-in was quick, seamless, the staff courteous, and genuine. The beauty of the Aqua Lotus is its (small) size and location. What it lacks in not having a pool, it makes up for in superior service and location - (right on the beach, with a 15-minute walk to the Waikiki strip, well enough away from the noise and bright lights). Rooms are well-appointed, clean, and most importantly, quiet, with an incredibly comfortable bed. I booked a corner suite, on an upper floor, with beautiful views of Diamond Head and the beach. The knowledgeable reception staff was always happy to assist with bookings, recommendations on places to eat and share valuable local knowledge on things to do and see. The restaurant was undergoing refurbishment during my stay, but breakfast was still offered, with a wide array of healthy and appetizing options, great coffee and unobtrusive, excellent service.In comparison to the over-inflated prices of the soulless, cookie-cutter hotels on the Waikiki strip, the Aqua Lotus represents excellent value for money, with friendly, helpful staff that are a standout, and comfortable rooms that will deliver a memorable stay.

After literally TONS of research on my part, this hotel won my reservation for 2 nights in March just so we could visit Pearl Harbor (my husband is a Navy vet). For us, this hotel fit our needs perfectly and beautifully. Neither of us likes to be right in the thick of urban, so the location out-of-the hub of Waikiki was divine for us. This hotel is certainly off the beaten path but in a beautiful spot.We especially liked our view of Diamond Head and the green park across the street. We could see a pretty good amount of ocean from this same side balcony. From the front balcony, there was a sliver of ocean to be seen between two buildings, but we were ok with that. I think sometimes the whole ""oceanview"" aspect can be slightly over-rated. See the photos I uploaded for the various views from the room.Our room was on an upper floor (I don't remember which floor exactly) but I know we had unobstructed views from our balconies, from the elevator balcony, and also from the fire escape balcony. The views of downtown Waikiki at night from the elevator balcony were beautiful, with all the twinkling lights.The walk to town wasn't too long, in fact, I enjoy any opportunity for exercise, and this was a delightful one. Isn't any walk on a Hawaiian island a joyous experience, and something to lock into memory??!Staff was great during our stay, no issues there whatsoever. I didn't even think to look into the restaurant option, so if it was open (or not) during our stay I wasn't really aware. The lobby is a very relaxing atmosphere, and the lemon water is a nice welcoming touch, as is the wine during the late afternoon.Loved our room. I decided to reserve one of the corner rooms and I wasn't disappointed. Large and airy, we really loved it. I don't recall any cleanliness issues - everything was very clean for the most part. I also especially liked the Starbucks Verismo brewer -- took a bit to get the hang of it (I don't think the instructions were very clear!) but once I did the lattes were absolutely delicious.Considering the prices of most of the hotels in Waikiki, I think this hotel's rates are appropriate for what you are getting.

Sunrises in June are blocked from optimal off-the-premium-balcony photography on floors 1-8 by a tree, but there's an open-air fire escape that provides ample photographic opportunity. The property is an older-but-renovated property -- I was satisfied with the state of everything I encountered, ymmv, and (more importantly) wasn't constantly disturbed by A/C or neighbor noise -- and the main restaurant was closed for renovation while I was there. Additionally they had router problems on their wireless guest network for a bit -- but T-Mobile has solid 4G coverage there, so I worked right around it. Their staff is solidly fantastic: friendly, helpful, and accommodating. So, quiet location, reasonable price, great staff, totally acceptable facilities: I'd stay here again and thus give it 5 stars.","Portland, Oregon",4,5.0

Most of the questions were asked by myself and then I found out we were given a room on the 3rd floor,enquired why I didn't get a high floor, was told would be $20 more per night.This information would have been handy when booking.So we decided to see the room before deciding to upgrade.Our room was on level 3 right in front of the laundry and ice room. We agreed to stay in this room just because of the laundry,another big mistake.The ice machine is very noisy and we could hear the noise most of the time.Also this room is a very noisy with noise continuously coming from above and next doors.this was very very annoying.Room was big with 2twin beds, bathroom was old,and toilet blocked a few times.Facilities in room were iron,safe,hair dryer ,coffee machine and fridge-no mini bar which didn't bother us as we never touch things from there.I was very unhappy with our room as it was the lowest level from which rooms are in.level 2 has breakfast which you can purchase, free coffee and tea available from 7am to 10am.Also restaurant opening in July 2013 on level 2.moving to the elevator , what can I say.....14floors and one elevator which takes more then 5minutes to get if you are lucky.we managed to use the stairs on most occasions after waiting more than 5minutes .also note our room had a security alarm sensor,made me worry about security of our room as it could be easily accessed by outsiders as the corridor was open hallways.Our room cleaner was very efficient and did her job really good.Another good point was the coin laundry room which accepts quarters only $1 for wash and $1.50 for dryer,only issue was thy need to be cleaned and serviced regularly as dryer was not working on one selection. I was looking forward to a great end to our holidays at Aqua Lotus, this wasn't the case.We had booked 4months in advance and were looking forward to our stay here.the staff were the friendliest bunch, they helped us with any queries from bus information to shopping mall queries.The staff made our stay very pleasant.",Auckland,10,3.0

It had a little area on the second floor that was more like a cafe, and they served breakfast (complimentary coffee/tea, bagels, pastries, fresh cut fruit, etc.), but considering the Lotus was a bit of a walk away from the Waikiki hotels (and that the New Otani hotel next door required reservations for their restaurant), I would have had a much more convenient stay during June 2013 if they operated their own restaurant. I also had a bad experience the first time ordering breakfast here: I walked into the second floor and asked the employee there (a man with short black hair) if this was their restaurant, and he gave me an attitude saying, ""This is it!"" I already felt put off while ordering a bagel with cream cheese and lox, and when I brought it back to my room, the capers that came along with it was sloppily plopped all over the container. My bagel was wet and soggy. However, a few days later during my stay, I reluctantly entered the second floor again and a nice lady with blonde hair greeted me with a more welcoming attitude and prepared my breakfast much more neatly. I wish I could've met her the first time rather than the other employee. However, some earlier reviewers mentioned that this hotel is planning to add a restaurant to their facilities, so that will certainly be advantageous to future guests.Other than that, my stay here was great. I liked that it was away from the main part of Waikiki so that I can enjoy some peace and quiet during the daytime. The staff was always friendly to me and always tried to make conversation like asking me where I've been visiting while I've been in Hawaii, my future plans, and giving me sightseeing suggestions. My room was always clean when I returned to it. Although they don't have any on-site spas or restaurants like the other hotels, I think that they networked very well with an outside massage service called Infinity, and a local food delivery service that provided a dine-out menu to guests. I think these are what have kept costs low for hotel guests; low overhead costs for the hotel. On top of that, the refreshing ice water they provide in the lobby and the complimentary wine between 4pm-6pm are great perks. One more critical word: the lobby has these lovely sofas that look adorable, but do need a bit of cleaning. I saw a couple of stains on them during my stay. Other than that, the floor is always swept and the facilities look clean.","Flushing, New York",14,4.0

I'd like someone to define what criteria makes that a fact for a hotel. I stayed here for 4 nights in July 2012, so the restaurant was still not open. So a thermoses of free coffee in the morning or glass of house wine in the evening are the only beverages on offer. There is also no uninterrupted view of the beach or ocean, which can be seen in the distance or a partial view between the condos Which for a beach front category hotel is a bit of a letdown. The rooms are nice and minimal furnished, which is a good thing, coffee, free wifi, so the usual list, but you don’t come to Hawaii to stay in your room all the time. They offer bikes and free yoga on the beach, but I cannot rave about this like others. I stayed at the hotel next door recently and the difference in amazing Pacific ocean view rooms and a good service makes me rank the Lotus as 3 ½ stars, I’ve stayed in over 5 hotels in Wakiki in the last couple of years, so I think this ranking is realistic.

As an added surprise, he upgraded us to the corner suites, which are VERY much worth it. The mountain and beach view is simply breathtaking.

We are residents of Hawaii and have stayed at all the big, expensive hotels in Waikiki and Kahala. Without exception, the Lotus offered us the best hotel experience we have had since Kona Village closed its doors! My top priorities are always a really quiet room, a good bed, a lanai door that allows one not to use the A/C, which was actually pretty decent, compared to other properties. The thoughtful amenities: fresh ice water, crisp apples, daily newspaper, afternoon wine in the lobby may seem like tiny details, but they are appreciated. The room was spotless and cleaned on time every morning. Everyone from the valet boys, front desk, and housekeeping should be given a raise..they are all wonderful and seem to take real pride in their jobs.Every employee we came in contact with is from Hawaii and exuded aloha spirit at its best.

The hotel is close to Kapi'olani park and Waikiki aquarium. It is reasonably close to the commercial district but situated in a quiet locality and avoids the noise and madness of central Waikiki.The room was well-furnished and recently updated. We went with a premium view room and the upgrade was worth it for the view of the diamond head and the ocean.The hotel provides access to a private beach shared with another property. The beach is small but clean and the waters clear and calm. This was ideal for a novice swimmer like me. The hotel provides complimentary beach chairs and towels.The best part of this hotel is the staff. Everyone I met was very friendly and helpful and it really made our trip all that more enjoyable.There are a few nice touches:- Wine served in the evenings in the main lobby. Great little gesture from the staff to organize this daily and we enjoyed a glass of wine on the house in the evenings.- Free bicycle rentals to bike to Waikiki if you are so inclined.- Free internet.- Good breakfast.There is no lunch or dinner available on premises.

While you aren't directly on Waikiki, we find that a bonus. It's a quick walk through the park to get up to Waikiki (literally) for the famous beach, shopping and other tourist interests, but when you're ready for some peace and quiet you have it.

Service is excellent, goes beyond getting the job done. For example, twice I had to have documents printed and by the time I called the front desk to see if they got my email, they were already doing the printing. We had a corner room which is larger than standard, and it was one of the most roomy hotel rooms we have ever had, anywhere. We did not have a rental car in Oahu so had not only our luggage but golf bags and still there was plenty of room to keep everything stored neatly and out of the way. The restaurant was closed for an impending remodel, but the hotel served a variety of breakfast items starting at 6 am and all at reasonable prices. We took advantage of the dining options at the New Otani hotel next-door. The only drawback with the Lotus is that the only good way to get to ""the action"" in Waikiki is walking......which we did.......and it was a nice stroll. But for someone with mobility issues, it might be a bit out of the way. The Lotus was clean, quiet, well-appointed and with all-around high level of service.

I live in a rural area and the quieter end of Waikiki work well for my husband and I. The room was clean, the bed very comfortable and the decor pleasant. Although not directly on the beach, it is a very short stroll to a uncrowded beach with calm, clear water (who needs a pool, you're in Hawaii).

He was attentive, always helpful and wanted to make our stay special. Allen also was pleasant. We stayed in an ocean view premium on the 12th floor. The full view of Diamond Head and expansive views of the ocean were excellent. It is a smaller property so the feel is relaxed. The beach is close and it seemed more locals were at this end of the beach so we never missed the pool. While they offer free coffee in the morning, it is odd that they have a large area on the second floor for a restaurant but it is largely unused at this time. The wine in the afternoon is a nice touch and we appreciated the lemon water throughout the day. The bikes are fun but both needed air in the tires and it did not appear the staff was interested ensuring the maintenance of the bikes.

We made good use of the complimentary bikes which was a fun and faster way of getting around. Taxi was approx $15 from lotus to the pink palace which we thought was pricey but largely due to the maze of one way streets! You are unable to book bikes so first in first served. We stayed in a premium ocean view room which had a wrap around balcony and spectacular views. I would recommend requesting a room number ending in '21' rather than '25' as although they are both premium ocean view they are on opposite sides of the hotel and the '21' has far superior and less obstucted views. We were disappointed that although we had requested a king bed we were put in s room with 2 small double beds and were unable to change because the hotel was full for duration of our stay. Unfortunately they stipulate that they cant guarantee which bedding configuration you will get but this was definitely an issue for us and we would have booked elsewhere had we known we would be in a room with double beds. The lift was slow as there is only one in the hotel so make sure you allow for this. Apart from those two issues it was a lovely hotel. Allen the bell boy was extremely knowledgable and helpful, Sarah at the front dest was extremely accommodating and friendly as was Denise in the breakfast restaurant. The rooms were beautiful, spacious, airy,inviting and quiet and we all enjoyed the complimentary wines between 4-6pm each day down in the lobby and as we were a party of 6 the lobby was a lovely area to socialise and play cards etc. If you would like to travel any distance you need to book the shuttles a day ahead or you will be paying for an extremely expensive taxi fare EG $140 round trip to the outlet stores in a taxi as opposed to $22 in a shuttle but they require a days notice. The beach was lovely for sunning and swimming and the hotel provide you with beach towels and mats. We had two outstanding dinners and both only steps from the hotel.

What makes it even better is that there are really nice small beaches close by too. The room was beautiful, clean, and extremely comfortable. It had gorgeous, relaxing views of the ocean and Diamond Head. As someone who has neck and back problems, the bed was awesome. Instead of using an air mattress, I could actually sleep on their bed. I haven't been able to sleep on a hotel bed (except for Radisson Hotels) in years. They are renovating their restaurant, which I hope will be affordable despite the restaurants nearby being ridiculously expensive. However, they do sell light breakfast options. The food was very tasty, fresh and well prepared. The homemade granola is the best I have ever had...yes the granola. I hope they sell it at some point. It was flavorful and hearty, but not so hard you could break a tooth. The service from everyone there was nothing short of amazing. I have traveled plenty inside and outside of the United States to know what a true gem this hotel is. I hope it stays exactly the way it is (except for the restaurant).

There is a nice walkway along the beach that takes you to the more busy part of Waikiki (about 15-20 minutes). The hotel staff were friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. The valet made some great suggestions about local restaurants. There was no pool, but I enjoyed the short walk to the beach. It was pretty secluded when I went. I must say that the hotel buidling was disappointing. The lobby and elevator were in need of some sprucing up. The hotel website photos were outdated. The room, while clean and spacious, had several issues. There were stains on the ceilings, smudges on the bathroom counters, and the sliding wooden door to the lanai would not budge. We had to call the front desk twice (sliding door which required a crowbar to move and missing tv remote control). The room safe appeared to be very insecure. It was on a pedastal which was wobbly. The room also smelled somewhat musty. It was nice, though, to have the double lanais to air out the space. I booked the room through Jetsetter.

This was definitely my least favorite of the two. The Lobby and the room were quite nice, the staff polite, and the area is far more quiet than other parts of Waikiki. There is also a stellar view of Diamond Head. If these are all the requirements you have, then this is your hotel.Personally, I don't care to have to walk fifteen+ minutes past areas that are less than safe to get to the very edge of everything Waikiki has to offer...particularly with shopping bags. Then there is much more walking to get to various shopping and dining venues. This is not an area I would recommend walking through at night, particularly if you are alone. It's not really rough or anything, but I wouldn't want to risk it. During one walk I saw a half naked man surrounded by police on the sidewalk; the next day I saw a man trying to hold up a beach towel and dress at the same time as he stood against a car. I also didn't like the ""view"" of the ocean...which was barely a view at all. The bulbs in the rooms are blindingly bright, and the cover they throw across the foot of the bed was stained. I rolled it up and tucked it away during our stay...trying not to think of what it might be stained with! In fairness, however...this was the only real cleanliness issue I had during my stay. The paint is peeling away from the outside of the building, and, though you need your key to use the elevator, your door is open to the outside...not an indoor corridor. There is also no complimentary breakfast of any sort, as I recall.All this for more than an extra hundred dollars over the price of the other hotel? No thanks! I won't be staying here again. They aren't terrible, there are just too many better options.","Seneca, South Carolina",76,3.0

The ocean view is just a peekaboo view through the buildings that are actually on the beach. This was not a surprise, we got that before booking. The view of Diamond Head was stellar. We loved that the windows opened on 2 adjacent walls allowing the lovely breeze to circulate though the room. As others have noted, the elevator is incredibly slow, but we were never in that much of a rush.What we did not like was that it seemed every time we went to the lobby, there was never anyone at the front desk. We had to wait or hunt down someone to retrieve our car. Also, the ""restaurant"" was always out of items when we stopped in for breakfast. The ""business center"" is a very tiny room at the end of a dark hallway. When I went there to check into my flight and get a boarding pass, the entire stairway up was not lit and extremely dark as was the hallway getting to the room - very creepy and hard to navigate. Then when I checked into my flight, I had to pay a fee of around $7 dollars for a 10 or 15 minute session on their computer and was charged 75 cents for every page that printed out. I've never had this experience at any other hotel. If it weren't for these issues, I would have given it 4 stars.I thought that being away from the heart of Waikiki would be nice, but we found ourselves walking down there every day and then longing to be closer. We loved the upgrades made to the main avenue (Kalakaua?) and the new City Walk neighborhood at the south end of the strip and wished we had stayed down there instead.Just a side note, not about the hotel - it had been maybe 7 years since visiting Honolulu and we were appalled at how bad the traffic has become. We wasted so much time trying to drive from one spot to another. On our trip up to the north shore, the back up was so bad it took us over an hour just to get to the outskirts of town.

He spent the time to accommodate us at a sister property with an upgrade that he would pay the difference. Matthew turned a negative experience into a very positive experience and everything was handling very well and the other accommodations were excellent.

The rooms are lovely, spacious and comfortable with a mini fridge discreetly tucked away below the t.v. in a cabinet. Bathrooms are also spacious. House-keeping is good. Although we had an ""ocean view"" two times, it was a brief expanse of the Pacific glimpsed through tall buildings. There is a ""lack of privacy"" as folks from nearby buildings can easily see into your room. The first time I stayed at the hotel there was a roof-top party with a blaring bass that went on past 9pm. While management was sympathetic, they made it clear that the party was ""within"" their rights to carry-on into the evening. The very comfortable bed and high count sheets were fabulous. The second time I stayed at the hotel the bed was saggy, and it wasn't possible to switch rooms which made for a sore back. I would stay at the Lotus again because of the fantastic location, the quiet ""local"" neighborhood and easy access to local eateries and shopping on foot. San Souci beach is a short walk away. Way less crowded, if you're game to walk further is Diamond Head Beach. FYI you can park across the street in metered public parking (free at night) to save the cost of hotel parking. However, be sure to plug your meter in the morning or find other free street parking. If you want to stay in Waikiki and have a ""local experience"" you will LOVE the Lotus. This is the perfect place for solo travel, a couples retreat or friend's get-away. You will immediately feel at peace and at home on this property. Diamond Head, otherwise known as Mauna Leahi is a wahi pana or sacred and storied place for Hawaiians. Being so close in proximity to the Lotus, I always feel the mana or sacred energy of Mauna Leahi can be felt on-site. I grew up on Oahu and have always loved this section of Waikiki. The only reason why the Lotus did not receive 5 stars was because of the ""noisy party"" and ""saggy bed"" situations. I travel for a living and need to receive a sound sleep for early mornings.","Honolulu, Hawaii",25,4.0

The wonderful San Souci beach is just steps away from the Lotus. Kapiolani park surrounds the hotel. Diamond Head looms in the distance. The hustle of Waikiki is a pleasant 20 minute walk along the shoreline. You will be glad to return to the tranquility of the Lotus.No restaurant?

Not a big deal, but this is not an inexpensive place, and I had called well in advance to request something I didn't get. The view was decent (Diamondhead) and near Sans Souci Beach. Very clean room, nice staff at check in (though I had trouble finding staff when I had to check out.) The room wasn't quite as quiet as I had hoped. Also, the price is surprisingly high given that this is a hotel without a restaurant or room service, a 15 minute walk from Waikiki where you can get to restaurants (but not a great walk after dark), no pool, no breakfast (there is coffee). I had gotten an extremely good deal on price reserving a year before, but since then the prices have doubled and I no longer think it is decent value, as there are many places within Waikiki with more to offer in terms of amenities at more reasonable prices.

I have relied on trip advisor reviews when making reservations. But, this time I felt I did not get an accurate picture of what this hotel was going to be like. When we first arrived the front desk said we only had a reservation for 7 nights. We had a prepaid voucher for 10 nights! The clerk just kept shaking her head. There was no welcome, so happy you are staying with us!! Once in our room we found 2 double beds. I was informed that they do not guarantee king beds and that the only king available was in 2 days and would cost $40 more per night. Then she said ""oh and by the way the manager said you can stay the extra 3 nights"". Gee thanks! As for what the hotel actually offers....I knew we were off the beaten path away from Waikiki. That was part of the reason I chose this hotel. It is almost a mile and a half walk to the center of Waikiki. It is a lovely walk but, as another patron said, I wouldn't feel safe walking back alone at night because of the homeless population living in the parks next to the hotel. The ""private"" beach is a small patch of sand at the back of a parking lot down an alley through a gate that they lock up at night. There are beaches within walking distance that are much nicer.There is a restaurant but it is not open. There is no room service! The free coffee is available until 9:00am. So if you sleep in a bit you can forget that. But it isn't very easy to sleep in as you can hear the staff in the halls working very early in the morning.The rooms are kept very clean. With the exception of some mold on the shower doors and on the ceiling in the bathroom.There is one ice machine in the hotel that was so filthy I would not use the ice. There are also 2 washing machines and dryers ( in the same room as the ice machine). This room smells horribly! The machines are filthy. I went to do a load of laundry and found the staff in there washing hotel linens. This gave me pause... The hotel seems to be understaffed. There was one girl at the front desk. Many times she would be on the phone taking reservations, and unable to help any hotel patrons. This is a hotel for self sufficient guests. If you are looking for any attention at all Find a different hotel.As for what the aqua lotus does right? The VALET'S they are the true stars of the hotel.

I was told a request would be made but no guarantees and that if they couldn't give us a room with two double beds they could put a roll away bed in the room. I then emailed them to state that after that after such a long a flight we needed to know that two double beds would be guaranteed or I would need to cancel. I didn't get a reply to the email - 1 day later (today) I telephoned to check - and was told no guarantees. I therefore cancelled.

It's across the street from a large park and quite close to Diamondhead. Great room and very helpful, friendly staff. The only negative was the lack of a restaurant. They served a limited breakfast (not free), but orange juice was not available when we were there. However, there's an excellent restaurant in the hotel next door, and a walk of a few blocks gets you to Waikiki, where there are many good places to eat.","Houston, Texas",10,4.0

It had no pool (that's what the ocean is for) but an incredible view of Diamond Head, Kapiolani Park and the Ocean (which was a lovely surprise). We had a corner Diamond Head Premium room on the 7th floor and it was very quiet. The staff were all spectacular! Warm, friendly and extremely helpful (especially the valets and the housekeeping people). It was the perfect distance from noisy, bustling Waikiki. I've stayed in the dead center of Waikiki and I was truly spoiled staying here. There is a small hotel cafe with nice sitting areas but no formal restaurant. They are working on that part.

Previously a W, we enjoyed our room and found it to be in a great location. On our recent stay, we found the Lotus to be as equally as accommodating and the staff even friendlier! Check-in was quick. The valet service is so convenient and fast as well. Being a smaller hotel, you don't get the crowds of people.The hotel has no real amenities to speak of, no pool or restaurant. However, an awesome beach is steps away and two good restaurants are next door, Hau Tree Lanai in the New Otani hotel and Michel's in the Colony Surf. Michel's serves classic French and has a great view (more on the expensive side). Hau Tree Lanai is more casual, fusion flavors.We were fortunate enough to stay in The Diamond Head Suite, the penthouse. It's amazing!If you would like to be near Waikiki and still go shopping, people watch, have choices of restaurants, but sleep a little farther away from the crowds, this location can't be beat.

It was on the corner so we had a beautiful view of Diamond Head to the left & 2 beautiful views of the ocean to the right. The room was nice, big and comfortable. I was with my niece & sister-in-law so with 3 women, we needed a nice bathroom & that's what we got! Great shower & plenty of counter top space. I requested a microwave & they brought one up. The beds were very comfortable & we slept every night with the sliding glass door open enjoying the fresh air & the sound of the ocean! The room service was awesome, they were soo friendly & gave us complimentary bottles water every day. The desk clerks were the best! I want to give Wes a special thank you for being soo friendly & always having a big smile on his face. He really made us feel welcomed. As I said, everyone there was very attentive & we will definitely go back.  It is about a 15 min walk to the first part of Waikiki but the walk is beautiful & it we stopped in the morning at the Barefoot Cafe & ate breakfast on the beach. The hotel is just a couple of steps from the beach & the hotel lends you beach chairs & towels. I can not say enough about this hotel. I will tell you, you need to get a room on the 8th floor or higher for the view. We booked through Expedia & got an Ocean Premium room at a great price! We are already planning our next trip & I know we will book again at the Aqua Lotus. I've stayed in several other hotels in Waikiki & the rooms were half the size for the same price or more!",,3,5.0

If those are deal-breakers then you may want to stay elsewhere but you would be missing out on a gem.The Aqua Lotus does have a friendly welcoming staff (valet, front desk, housekeeping, managers), nice Diamond Head views, a location directly across from beautiful Kapiolani Park, good-sized clean contemporary rooms, and it is removed from the crazy madness of the heart of Waikiki (a ten minute walk along the beach). It is about 200 feet from Sans Souci Beach - a really nice swimming beach at the edge of Waikiki. It does offer beach cruiser bikes to explore the local area as well as beach mats and towels for guest use. A unique historic district of older homes and cottages are just steps away at the base of Diamond Head and a good long walk brings you up to the Diamond Head overlook. Access in and out to the rest of Honolulu is easy and you can skirt the traffic on Kalakaua in Waikiki.Improvements would be an extra elevator (only one) and a full service restaurant - it has a restaurant space that serves breakfast overlooking the park (nice) but it isn't fully operational yet.I definitely will return here on future trips to Honolulu. I've stayed at the Halekulani (5 star, $$$$$) and the Waikiki Parc (meh...) and I prefer the location of the Aqua Lotus despite its lack of beach & pool.

Even though it is not on the beach, access is only steps away.I understand this property was once the W and before that the Doubletree so its not brand new. Our room was on the third floor and probably had the worst view in the hotel - roof of the porte cochere below, parking garage across and ocean view blocked by condos. Security-wise that probably wasn't great either. Anyone on that floor could walk on the roof to your terrace and possibly break in, though we had no problem. Still it had nice morning sun and the room was spacious. There was a small kitchenette and a bathroom with a nice stone tile shower instead of tub. The furnishings were new, clean and modern and the wider room made the room seem brighter than a typical room.The platform bed however had a poor double-size mattress that sloped to the center. For one person that may not be too bad but for two it was. Add to that was the oversize linens housekeeping used to make up these beds made getting into bed impossible without ripping the bed apart. I had to remake the bed every night, and housekeeping kept making the bed same way every day.Parking is extra, and valet is required given the limited spaces available. But our car was always in a good spot and we could always grab the keys, jump in and go.There was no restaurant on the property during our stay, but other amenities like complementary wine every afternoon and free coffee each morning were nice. Staff were friendly and helpful. Beach towels and chairs were available to take to the public beach across the parking lot. I asked for and got a bath scale to help weigh our suitcases before we left. And the valets were great with directions and ideas for restaurants. There are coin laundry machines on the third floor too.There is no spa or fitness center either but the park across the street is flat and easy to walk or run around. There is a parcourse and public tennis courts too.Of course the location is the real attraction here. Kapiolani Park is big and quiet and short walk to the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. Getting around the island is as easy as a quick drive up Kapahulu to the H1.Despite the bed and the third floor, I liked the Lotus and would stay here again.","Seattle, Washington",25,4.0

It is located away from the busy side of Waikiki. It is easy to get to and from the hotel. I realize for some, the mandatory valet was not appreciated. To us it was well worth the fee. With limited parking at the hotel, it was nice driving up to the front door after a long day and having the valet take care of parking. The entire staff was extremely courteous. Although all the staff is great, Allen who is the valet and porter was extremely welcoming. He always greeted us by our name, asked us if we needed anything and just made sure he was taking care of us. The views are breathtaking as well!

The hotel is good, no doubt. Located about 15 Minutes walking distance to the first Hotels and Shops of Waikiki Beach. But I have to take take off points for following down sides:- no sea view. only view to park, Diamond Head or a parking lot of other buildings at the beach- the building is a beton square, beautiful inside but not from the outside, no green area. - the rooms were noisy (wind and fridge, etc.)- slow wifi- there were no shops nearby, thats ok. But to charge guest 4.50 US for a croissant at breakfast is no service!! They do have a restaurant but last week it was closed. - it was too cold in the lobby area, freezing!- i asked the lobby for island weather (cause it was raining in Honolulu and we wanted to escape) and he looked at his Iphone (for Honolulu!) and sayed it was just a bit of rain. That was it! I have an I phone as well.. It was a good hotel, the people were really nice, the rooms beautiful, BUT its not the best hotel you can stay at in Honolulu for that price. ",,10,3.0

Everywhere you look is a great view, and we could see all three from our tenth floor corner room (requested). And it is only a ten minute walk to all that is Waikiki, so we had goo food and nightlife within walking distance. They also provide free bicycles, free wine in the afternoon, free coffee in the morning, free beach towels. They have a funky/quirky vibe here and it is very relaxed.

The hotel is across from Kapiolani park, which is populated by locals, morning joggers, and yoga and tai chi devotees. If you walk about ten minutes in the other direction, away from the center of Waikiki, you're in a cute neighborhood of 1930s bungalows. Kaimana Beach is a minute's walk away, and although it's public (as are all the beaches in Hawaii), it feels almost private. Next door in the New Otani hotel, the Hau Tree restaurant is a real delight for breakfast and lunch. If all of this appeals to you, don't hesitate to book this hotel.In addition to the location, the Aqua Lotus has a lot of other things going for it. It used to be the W, so it's bright and modern (except for the lobby!), with wooden floors, super comfy bed, and a small but good bathroom. Alas, no bathtub. The view of the ocean is blocked, but depending on your room, you can still see it. And you can most certainly request a room with a dramatic and VERY close-up view of Diamond Head. (Our corner room on the eleventh floor had both aspects.)The housekeeping is excellent. It's impossible in Waikiki not to bring a lot of sand back into your hotel room, no matter how careful you are. Housekeeping somehow managed to vacuum it all up every day, even the sand on the lanai (balcony). Our room was kept spotless.The front desk is friendly and helpful. Small gripe -- our flight was delayed so we didn't arrive at the hotel until 4 a.m., and we had to wait a few minutes until someone showed up at the desk. But . . . it was 4 a.m., after all. You can get beach towels and other beach gear from the front desk.There are other pluses, which other reviewers have mentioned. We love the location, so we'll definitely use this hotel again.One final thought. This side of Waikiki has some vagrants. But they don't panhandle, and they don't really bother anyone.","Boston, Massachusetts",560,5.0

We moved to this hotel after five nights at the Trump at the other end of Waikiki, so this was an interesting contrast. The Lotus is a small boutique hotel that is pretty isolated from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. It actually is a little further from Waikiki Beach than I first thought. I would say you are a good ten to fifteen minute walk before you hit the first hotels (Marriott, Aston Waikiki) and shops, so keep that in mind. I believe the hotel used to be a 'W' property, and it retains that funky vibe along with the dim lighting in the lobby. There are only one or two staff at the front desk, it's pretty relaxed and casual. There is no self-park, valet parking only. The rooms are very nice, modern, comfortable, inviting. Maybe nicer than at the Trump, although there was no kitchen. But it does have a fridge.Since the hotel has no dinner restaurant, you will have to go out to eat. Immediately next door there are three excellent restaurants. Michels at the Colony Surf is an outstanding french/italian restaurant in a gorgeous setting, right on the beach, with tuxedoed waiters, luxury dinnerware, soft live music and tiki torches, very romantic and very high priced. We had a very nice meal here, it is a beautiful spot.Also next door at the Kaimana are two others. Miyako is on the second floor and is a japanese restaurant with a great view. I would highly recommend you book one of their three cabana tables (2-5 people), they are gorgeous, private, and scenic. The menu is fixed for the cabanas, only a couple of choices with 6-8 items on each. All the food was excellent. Try to book here for sunset, it really is gorgeous. The second restaurant at the Kaimana is the Hau Tree Lanai, another beautifully scenic restaurant right on the beach and under three giant Hau trees. We had a lovely breakfast here although a sudden shower had us running to another table. Other than these, plus a second floor casual breakfast spot at the Lotus, you will have to travel a fair ways for other dining choices. I would recommend the zoo, which is very good and not far away. The aquarium is very close as well. It's quite small and would only take an hour of your time. While I really liked the vibe of the hotel, I am not sure I would stay here again if coming back to Waikiki, as I feel it is just a bit far from the action. I think the Lotus is great for a short stay, 2-4 days maybe, but if you are staying longer you might want to be nearer the other end of Waikiki. Still, it's a very nice hotel...",Vancouver Canada,53,4.0

What a way to spend the last days in Hawaii before heading home. We had a room on the 8th floor overlooking Diamond Head and the Ocean. Everything about this hotel was right in line with a Boutique hotel you would find on the mainland. The hotel is small enough that after a few days the staff knows your name and where you are from. Even coming down to retrieve your car from the valet he doesn't need to ask for your name. We arrived very early the day of check in, but the staff held our luggage while we went out and explored. And we had a very late flight the day of our departure, and again the staff held our luggage. Housekeeping was fantastic, they came twice a day. They actually surprised us on the first day as we were not expecting a turn down service and left everything out. They did not disturb any of our personal belongings. Everything you would expect from a hotel is right here. The walk to the restaurants can be a bit far for some people. My wife did feel a bit nervous walking the route to Waikiki in the early evening hours as the lighting is not great and the park seems to fill up with homeless, but we made it safely. The other evenings we chose to drive to the main part of Waikiki instead. The only downside we found was with the internet speed. The wifi was a bit on the slow side, but it was free!

This particular visit was a family vacation and traveling with 3 young children can sometimes be challenging, yet we found we were all quite comfortable in our room and as an added perk, we discovered the kids (or just the young at heart) could play Wii in the lobby and there are even laundry facilities available to guests. We all enjoyed walking from the front door of the hotel to so many places nearby and felt this was truly a hidden gem unlike larger hotels that lack the intimacy and privacy that this hotel has to offer.

Some potentially useful insight for first time visitors:- There's parking and a valet, helpful if you'd like to get some basic groceries, which you can put in the mini-fridge. There's a Whole Foods in a reasonably drivable distance. The market next door is convenient but pricy, and the only liquor source in the area. - Call the front desk for a taxi, it'll be there within minutes (for late night dining/drinking). - Bicycles are available from the valet with no hassle, and make short work of a ride downtown. - If you're there for the Honolulu Marathon, buses to the start are about a 15 minute walk away, it is still quite convenient. - The beach next door is pretty great! Borrow some chairs from the front desk. - No restaurant at the time, but basic food available for breakfast on the 2nd floor. Likely to be home base for next year's visit.","Portland, Oregon",8,5.0

The hotel has just been renovated which is great but what on earth possessed them to put in hardwood floors!!! This means every sound from the floor above is transmitted even amplified to the floor below.

As pointed out, there is no pool (a bit of problem when we learned we had landed during the ""box jelly fish window"", which precluded swimming two days (check the web when planning your trip to avoid these times, which coincide with the moon's cycle!). Nor is there a restauran. Other than two higher ends restaurants in the two hotels nearby, no place to eat for close to a mile. It was only the day we were checking out did we learn that they had started serving a limited breakfast in the prior weeks (no notice anywhere!). Fortunately this wasn't a problem for us, as we are members of an athletic club in Seattle, which gave us total priveleges to the Outrigger Club next door, where we lounged on the beach, and ate most meals (very reasonably priced). We did appreciate the extra details offered - coffee in the a.m., rotating flavors of infused ice water in the day, and wine from 4:00 to 6:00 - with lovely big wine glasses. A refrigerator in your room allows you to have your cereal, cheese and sandwich makings, should you choose... The hotel also offers thrice weekly morning yoga in the park across the street, which we enjoyed. And I have to say, after walking once to the hustle of Waikiki, we were very pleased to stay put. We are runners, and the park and Diamond Head gives both short and longer running routes. Beach chairs and towels were appreciated, and the fact the hotel wasn't right on the beach was no problem. It was a very short path between two other buildings to the uncrowded beach. We meant to borrow the cruiser bikes which were always available for a trip to Waikiki or to see residential area of Diamond Head, but never got around to it. The rooms were vary spacious (we did NOT have a corner with two balconies), and I loved all the storage space in the rattan type shelving in the bathroom.

We were taking a cruise of the islands but wanted to arrive a few days in advance to acclimate to the time change (6 hours for us). On the basis of the reviews here at TripAdvisor we booked the Aqua Lotus. However, we also booked one night at a Waikiki resort hotel on the back end of the cruise. The difference was night and day! The Aqua Lotus staff must have been trained by Ritz Carlton personnel. They were amazing and did everything they could to make our stay special. The rooms are beautiful - sliding shutter doors instead of drapes, full length mirror, big bathroom / nice sized shower - a kind of ""modern design meets the Island"" feel. The wood laminate flooring might night satisfy everyone's tastes but it provides for a clean, cool and comfortable living space. The beach is right behind the hotel just a couple of minutes walk away. A few more minutes down the beach is Queen's Surf Cafe and Lanai where you can enjoy a relatively inexpensive meal right on the beach or take a short stroll in the morning and drink a quality cup of coffee or espresso while watching the morning surf. Everything about the location and the hotel is relatively peaceful. And the crowds of Waikiki are a 10 - 15 minute walk away if you need to be in the thick of things. Once a month local artists sell their work in Kapiolani Park, across the street from the hotel. We were fortunate enough that our stay corresponded to a show weekend. (Tip: buy your souvenirs at local arts shows if you want genuine articles made in Hawaii. Hilo Hatties and the ABC stores are selling items made in the Philippines and China so check carefully.) The number of rooms in the hotel is limited so you don't have to deal with the relentless masses of the resort hotels in Waikiki. Complementary coffee in the morning and wine in the evening is a nice touch. After our experience (4 days, 3 nights at the Aqua Lotus and one overnight at the resort hotel) I am so grateful we took the reviews here seriously and booked with Aqua Lotus. The resort hotel was so depressing in comparison. So crowded, wildly expensive and a little phoney / faux Hawaiian. (A word about valet parking. It was $20 at the Aqua Lotus, $30 at the big resort hotel. Service at the Aqua Lotus was instantaneous, at the big resort hotel we had to wait as long as 10 minutes for our car.) If we are ever fortunate enough to visit these gracious islands again, we would definitely book again with Aqua Lotus.

It is near enough to walk to but far enough away to be peaceful. It is a nice walk (about 10-15 minutes depending on your speed) into Waikiki and you can enjoy the ocean views all along the way.We had a really nice mountain view room on 4th floor with a good view of Diamond Head. It isn't worth paying more for an ocean view room because, as noted by other reviewers, the view is obscured by other buildings. It is worth noting there is no bath although we were happy with the shower. The room was spotlessly clean and well maintained by the housekeeping staff throughout our seven night stay.The strengths of this hotel lie in the clean, contemporary decor and the great service. The staff were really cheerful, enthusiastic and helpful. We particularly appreciated the evening wine, when we were there at the appropriate time, and the beach towels, chairs etc. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at the front desk and the car valets.On the negative side the wi-fi signal was very weak and we had problems getting on line. The only other negative is that the hotel doesn't have a restaurant any more. We knew that when booking but hadn't appreciated how difficult it would be to find somewhere that served breakfast nearby (apart from the place in the park, which isn't great). Walking into Waikiki is an option but we found it wasn't worth driving as it is quite difficult to find parking. The hotel does provide free morning coffee, but doughnuts or some cookies would be an added bonus!Just a tip for those with a car, you may not want to pay to valet park at the hotel. It costs USD20 per day (in line with other hotels) and you can park free outside the hotel on a meter bay from 6pm to around 8.00am .If you fancy a 'posh meal' Michels is just next door and is excellent. The front desk will book a table for you. If you fancy a good Italian meal away from Waikiki, try Happy Valley Pizza on the road to Diamond Head. Good pasta and pizza, nice staff and very reasonable prices.Overall, the Aqua Lotus is a really nice little hotel for the price and we would be happy to stay there again.

We decided on aqua lotus based on reviews on trip advisor, the other hotels we contemplated were Halekulani and The Modern. We stayed for 7 nights.The hotel was generally as described in previous reviews, furnished in an islander style. We opted to upgrade to a premium diamond head view room based on previous reviews suggesting the ocean view rooms were obscured by propoerties closer to the beach (true). Our room was on the 5th floor and we really had no view of the mount as there was a large tree at the front of the property obscuring it. We did however have an excellent view of the large car park next door. Although disappointed by this, the room itself was well furnished and comfortable, the king-size bed likewise comfortable. The TV was a large screen plasma although there was no pay tv...In Australia most hotels would have this avaialble, not sure if the lack of this is the norm for Hawaii??As previously described on this site, there is no pool, the beach being about 200 meters away. The hotel provides towels/ mats/ beach chairs gratis. The hotel provides free wine with the oddly named 'happy ending' although we only partook of this the first night as it would best be described as cheap, and we stuck to Japanese beer purchased at a nearby convenience store. There is no restaurant or really any conveniently located reasonable option for breakfast.We also had a concern with the reception staff's lack of local knowledge. We sought information regarding directions via bus to the local clothing outlets and were given a convoluted google based route involving about 4-5 different buses. We eventually worked out that there was a direct trolley to these. Then we wanted a bus to the northern beaches which were lovely. Again we were given misinformation and almost missed our intended bus as a result. Unfortunately there is no dedicated tourist information and therefore most tourists would rely on front of house staff. Aqua Lotus would do well to keep this in mind.Overall we had a pleasant stay, but I'm not sure against what benchmark those that rate this hotel consistently at 5 are using.

The hotel was a little hard to find at first but once we arrived, we were greeted warmly. The room looks just like the photos on-line which was a relief as that isn't always the case with on-line websites. Our room looked towards the ocean which was great for land locked guests. We thought we were getting a king sized bed but had two doubles. My husband is goldilocks incognito and thought the beds were too soft. I thought they were just right. I would suggest putting a small light or reflective light switch in the bathroom. It was very dark in the middle of the night :)First and foremost the staff was excellent. They were always offering to give us directions and help us navigate around. Although my husband had lived here for 8 years, it was a nice refresher. We had one whoopsie daisy that I only bring up not to make the hotel or staff feel bad but rather to demonstrate how incredible they were even with a mistake. One of the valets accidentally put a scratch on our rental car. No biggie, life happens. However, not only was he honest about what happened, but the manager came in (it was after 10 p.m. when we got called) and let us know right away. They are covering the costs and everything is going to be just fine. It's not the situation that defines a person or company but how they handle it that truly reflects the integrity of that company. Thank you to all the wonderful and amazing staff at the Aqua Lotus. You truly made our stay a wonderful experience and we cannot thank you enough. Mahalo!","Denver, Colorado",58,5.0

We had a minor difficult time finding it because the hotel sign says Lotus Diamond Head. A quick call to the hotel assured us that it was the one we were looking for. We were given a two double bed room, but when we went down to ask for a king, they quickly got us one and moved us. The hotel is beautiful, full of amenities that other hotels in the area don't provide (free internet, free morning coffee, free bikes, beach chairs, towels, and the wonderful free wine in the afternoon.) The staff was all very friendly and helpful and called us by name when greeting us. The room was lovely, bed comfortable, and bathroom very nice. The only thing that went wrong for us is we didn't realize how far from the rest of Waikiki Beach the hotel really is. We had returned our rental car when we got there (had been on the north shore for a week) thinking we could walk or cab it that week. It only took us one irritating day to realize that we needed to rent another car, which we did. Once we had a car, we were fine. We are both fairly young and in shape, but the hotel is really just a little too far from everything to walk every time you want to go somewhere. I should say however, that it was in a great location for our morning runs. We headed out towards Diamond Head and run up Diamond Head Rd. Terrific run.

If you want noise and crowds, book in Waikiki, but if you want quiet and peaceful this is the place. It is across the street from a very large park and Diamond Head is right outside. Location was convenient. It did take us a couple of days to figure out the one way streets which sometimes made things difficult, but once we understood the pattern, all worked out well. I had the best walk ever one early morning from the hotel to Waikiki and back...peaceful and relaxing. Frankly, the staff really made this trip. Knowledgeable, kind, aloha spirit, and helpful.

LOCATION: The hotel is on the quiet “Gold Coast,” in front of Diamond Head, across from Kapiolani Park and next to the Outrigger Canoe Club. All rooms have lanais that face Diamond Head, which looms very large and close, so you’ll have a nice view. If you’re on a higher floor, you’ll even get some ocean. STAFF: The staff could not have been nicer. They lay out coffee in the morning and wine in the evening on a table in the lobby. Anything we asked for, basically they accommodated.THE ROOM: The room had a very modern, clean design. Whites and teal blues. Sliding shutter doors closed out the sun. Nice flat-screen TV and complimentary wireless. THE PROPERTY: The only thing to note is that are no restaurants and there is no pool. But, you are right next to San Souci beach and the hotel will give you free beach chairs and towels. Much better than any pool. I would highly recommend to those who have done the busy Waikiki thing and are interested in staying a bit off the beaten path – just far enough – and don’t have the need to sit around a pool and be waited on hand and foot. A walk to the Halekulani for drinks is around 20 minutes or so.Tip: it’s $10 per day for valet parking, cheap enough, but there is ample meter parking across the street.","New York City, New York",35,4.0

One thing we were not aware of was a $20/day valet fee, as we rented a car, but this fee is not unheard of, I suppose. The housekeeping, despite tipping, was not exceptional, and he/she would do the minimum but always an OK job. I guess that we are used to places like Mexico and Dominican Republic where they go the extra mile and dress up the room. Overall, the room was clean, so no issues.The room itself was spacious, and the wood shuttered windows let in a lot of light, and gave us a view of Diamond Head and a park. We ate dinner on the balcony a few times and that was fun. Wireless internet is included, and in the lobby, there is free coffee in the AM (or hot chocolate for my young kids) and wine from 4-6 PM daily. A nice touch. The room has a small fridge, and that is handy as my kids like milk, cereal, etc in the AM and it was handy. If you cross the parking lot, about 100 yards away is a PRIVATE BEACH, which is clean, not crowded and next to the Outrigger Canoe club. This stretch of beach is secluded from the adjacent, more busy beach as it has a stone/lava rock barrier that you can walk out on and view the ocean. We went to the more busy adjacent beach and it was filled with garbage, plastic straws in the sand. Yuck. Our stretch of beach had lots of shells and little coral in the sand and hermit crabs the kids played with. We also hired one of the workers at the Canoe Club to give us a outrigger boat ride for an hour and we rode some waves at 6 PM. Fun!! We loved it. It was great in the AM, if you go there at 6:30 AM and have coffee/hot chocolate and bring a little breakfast. We watched the sun rise on the ocean and on Moloka'i. Fantastic.I agree with a lot of other comments by others. The concierge was friendly and helpful, but the valet guys (esp. Travis) were excellent and filled with lots of tips on what to do for kids, always ready with maps and advice.

I won't tell you which room we had (want to keep it a secret to insure its availability for future visits!) but the views of both Diamond Head and the ocean were absolutely gorgeous, and the quiet (even on the lanai) was very welcome from the usual bus and early morning garbage truck noise of everywhere else we have ever stayed in Waikiki proper. The 15-minute walk to the restaurants, shopping, and hustle and bustle of Waikiki is no big deal, and the Gold Coast and San Souci / Queen's Surf end of Waikiki is our favorite end of the beach, anyway. Be warned that there is no swimming pool, but why have a pool when the ocean is only steps away? The room (and lobby) was beautifully decorated in a Balinese theme and properly maintained, service and evening turndown were excellent, and the happy hour wine service in the lobby is a big plus! We can't wait for our next visit when the Lotus restaurant will be open, as we may never want to go far away from the Lotus, except to the beach! Which reminds me, we love how the Lotus provides so many amenities that are complimentary, including not only the happy hour wine service, but free WiFi Internet access, beach chairs and towels, cruiser bicycles, and even the in-room safe. It is so nice to find a boutique hotel with both reasonable rates and no ""nickle-and-dime"" amenities. With only 50 rooms, never is there a crowded or competitive feel to obtaining services or accessing the hotel elevator. An aloha spirit prevails, not only among hotel staff, but also among the guests, who during our stay all seemed like family. Special kudos to Dante at the front desk!

I had walked by this hotel many times (I'm there a lot on business) and I couldn't understand how the views would be any good. Wrong! They're breathtaking! And having the disappearing wall with balcony and the second smaller balcony allowed us to open up the room and let the breezes blow through... And it's so quiet we could hear the ocean! The staff was wonderful and we used the bikes to go for breakfast almost everyday in Waikiki (after coffee at sunrise on our balcony!) There is also a restaurant steps away at the hotel next door that serves b'fast, lunch and dinner. We used the free beach chairs, towels and umbrellas every day as we ventured around the island.

From the friendly greeting on arrival (and ever other time you meet someone), to assistance with any requests and helpful advice when you just don't know, the feeling here permeates casual relaxation - but without any sacrifice to the level of service you'll get. With views that overlook parklands, Daimond Head, a glimpse of the beach and a stunning vista towards downtown Honolulu (especially after sunset), this is where I'll be staying on future visits. The Aqua Lotus is situated an easy 15 minute walk from the bustle of the main strip but the 'buffer' of the beachfront parks makes for a lovely transition at the beginning and end of each day's activities. I left behind a couple of items after my first stay, but they were there, safe and sound, for pick-up on my return a week later. And on the second stay, unbeknowns to me, two credit cards had slid out of sight under furniture. Before we'd realised they were missing, hotel staff had contacted us and organised courier delivery (to Australia!) whilst happily declining offers to reimburse them.

I want to start of first by talking about the great staff at this hotel. As soon as I arrived to the hotel I was kindly greeted by the valet. I had a rental car so I knew that tipping the valet would add up over time. After my second day, the valet told me that I do not have to tip him all the time because I am always in and out of the hotel. Of course I still tipped him, but its the thought that showed me the type of employees this hotel hires. When I checked in, Dante at the front desk took care of my every needs. I had most of my activities preplanned before my trip, but his suggestions seemed better than some of my activities I had planned. So of course I took his word for it and canceled some of my activities. He also suggested some great places out of the Waikiki area for a romantic dinner with my wife. I could not have ever imagined my stay at a hotel to be so problem free. Anytime I had a question or need anything the hotel staff was right there to help me out. If I had it my way I would promote all of them lol.Secondly, I am going to talk about this hotel. The location in my opinion is better suited for me and my wife. Its away from the highly congested and noisy Waikiki area but still in walking distance. The amount of free amenities this hotel offers is unheard of. The hotel came with free wifi, which for me is a necessity. I know most hotels in Waikiki charge a daily fee for internet. The hotel provided free coffee and newspaper in the lobby every morning. The hotel provided free wine from 4-6 pm everyday. The hotel even provided us with free beach gear and even bicycles. My wife and I loved taking the bicycles out. Now the rooms from what the staff told me was just renovated a week or two ago so I was fortunate to enjoy the fine luxurious upgrades. As soon as I walked into my room, I was more than satisfied. The room was larger than I had anticipated. The floors were made of a dark hard wood flooring. All the furniture in the room was brand new. The king size bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. The TV was a flat panel LCD. The bathroom was nicely finished with marble floors and new fixtures. Although I was rarely in the room during the day, its still nice to come home and rest in a nice clean hotel room. Overall my stay at this hotel and Hawaii has been such a great experience and more than satisfying. I highly recommend others to stay at this hotel.

Food options are great if you are willing to pay (Michel's) and diverse if you walk down to Waikiki.As to your raving rant about the hotel next door, The New Otani, I have only ever had nothing but great service and aloha spirit.I highly recommend this hotel.

We are at a big name hotel on Maui right now and I am afraid to see the bill.At the Lotus: Free internet, free coffee in the morning (served in the lobby), free wine in the evenings (and it's good wine, pleasantly surprised, in real glasses). Free beach chair loaner. This would have cost us $30 per person here at the Westin! Not to mention the smiles here are genuine. I see a lot of comments about the location, but it worked for us as we had friends renting a house across the park. It is off the ""main strip"", but absolutely within walking distance of the famous waikiki beach. The location works for us as we have two little kids and they didn't have to be right next to us the whole time, it's a very quiet and safe location, one elevator, small lobby. You walk behind the hotel and onto san souci beach, heaven. FYI there is a hose you can use to wash the sand off if you miss the showers at the beach. Just past the aquarium is a really cool little place for breakfast and lunch right on the beach, the queens cafe or something like that. Great burger and teriyaki chicken and grilled fish.I did an amazing run in the mornings from the hotel up to the lighthouse (about two miles with a good hill), just ask Wesley at the valet desk which direction to head. If you have kids ask for Jesel as your housekeeper- she was so patient with ours and full of smiles.Thanks so much for a fantastic stay and vacation! Can't wait to come back following the remodel.","san diego, CA",38,5.0

At the last minute before our trip I panicked when thinking about the cost of our trip (15th wedding anniversary) and so I canceled our reservation at the Kahala for the first 5 nights of our trip and cashed in airline miles for the first five nights of the trip to stay here. Let me start off and say that we were greeted with a smile, the bell men was helpful, the free use of the bikes is a great perk and overall this hotel is just OK. I would categorize it as a place to stay that is reasonable in price, nothing more nothing less. If you are on a budget and the most important thing is to just get to Hawaii and you don't really stay in the room, workout or eat in the hotel, and you don't want to be near the huge crowds in Waikiki then this is probably the place for you. Now back to my review, I guess you could say that I went into this with low expectations and even those weren't met. When I think of Hawaii I think of a hotel room with a lanai and trade winds and at least something unique to look at if not an ocean/partial ocean view. I knew from the reviews that we wouldn't be getting an ocean view but I wasn't expecting a full view of a parking deck with construction going on at the building next door. I know the hotel can't control the construction and the view is what it is but that doesn't change the fact that standing in our room and opening our door to the lanai you would have never guessed we were even in Hawaii. I have had better views and a better vibe looking out of my window at the SpringHill Suites on a business trip to Louisville KY. That didn't sit well with me given the importance of the trip. I write this review mainly to people that might be on the fence about spending more money to stay at a nicer hotel. We found that it was worth it! (If you can somehow strech your money it is worth the extra cost at the Kahala and Halekulani). To be clear though I am the type of traveler that doesn't see the room as just a place to crash. I wouldn't call myself snobby but if I am going on a nice trip(and I would categorize a long trip to Hawaii as that) I want a nice room with some sense that the hotel has an ambiance and a soul that is special. That is not this hotel. I am also used to trips(business or family) where the hotel is just a place to stay and the trip is more about the location or the people I am with. If this trip was that kind of trip maybe this hotel would have fit the bill. One side note, we did try and upgrade the room the morning after we arrived and we were met with a resounding ""NO, the hotel is fully booked"". It was a Wednesday, from all appearances there were few people milling around the hotel so I can only surmise that because they already had our money they weren't interested in upgrading us. I could be wrong but the most damning thing about the service was that we decided to check out that day regardless of the fact that we lost those points and when we did the lady at the front desk never acknowledged that we were checking out early and thus never asked why or if there was anything they could do to change our mind?? Poor service to say the least. For those interested we said damn the cost and we moved over to the Kahala (partial ocean view) and we had a magical stay. Truly one of the most special places I have ever stayed in. I will be writing a review for that hotel as well as the Halekulani. After the Kahala we went over to the Royal Hawaiian, (once again, tried to save money and cashed in points) and couldn't believe the small dark shoebox off a room. Cost be damned we checked out the next day an ended our stay with 3 nights at the Halekulani. Almost as magical as the Kahala!!","Boulder, CO",17,2.0

Different look than usual big, corporate hotel chains. Comfy bed, clean room. Mine had a view of Diamond Head on one side and a sliver of the ocean (between two massive skyskraper condos) on the other side.Cons (HUGE but no fault of Aqua Lotus): 1) Construction noise from hotel next door. Call me fussy, but the sound of jack hammers and buzz saws ringing in your ears as you lie on the beach, trying to relax after a 6 hour trip from the mainland definitely throws a wet towel on the whole ""relaxing HI vacation"" vibe.  2) Winos/homeless people passed out, living in nearby parks, steps from the hotel.They didn't panhandle me (probably because they were unconscious) but they gave the area a creepy, unsafe vibe.3) Complete lack of food options nearby. The Aqua Lotus hotel has a sign near the elevator that refers to a restaurant in the hotel itself. However, it was ""closed"" when I was there. (Some staff members said it is ""under renovation""; others laughed, said it has been closed ""for years"" meaning--wink, wink--obviously no real plans to reopen it--if it ever existed.) The only real option for food nearby was a restaurant in the hotel next door (the Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel). Of course, food there is absurdly expensively overpriced but that's to be expected. Worse, I found the attitude of the restaurant greeter (a snotty old lady) downright rude. One evening, I arrived at around 5 PM and she refused to seat me for dinner, citing""lack of a reservation."" This was laughable because I ate there the previous night without a reservation or any problem. Besides, there were plenty of empty tables available and no one else in line. She clearly did not want to serve me because I was traveling on business/solo (instead of with a huge family or tour group in tow) and, obviously, would not be a huge cash cow for her/the restaurant. Instead, she referred me to a Japanese restaurant upstairs which was a TOTAL JOKE--dark room, completely empty (except for one other couple), across from rooms under construction, and attended by a few clueless old bats in kimonos who didn't speak a word of English and one of whom glared at me with a creepy combination of aggravation and condescension/shock when she first saw me and throughout the meal . Very uncomfortable and bizarre. (Guess she never heard of a single woman traveling or dinining alone. LOL) Certainly not the welcoming ""aloha"" spirit I expected. The only other ""options"" (not really) are a very small convenience store behind the Aqua Lotus where you can buy a candy bar and soda or you can walk a mile north for the lovely experience of dining on old picnic benches covered with pigeon droppings and flies, outside a concession stand. YUM!Don't fall for the website propaganda about how Diamond Head area hotels are a tranquil, relaxing, beautiful oasis far from the maddening tourist crowds of Waikiki. Next time, either stay on the North side of the island or elsewhere (Maui or another island).","Austin, TX",43,2.0

Plus the valet and front desk were always there and extremely helpful.I know some people said the one elevator bothered them but it wasn't a problem for us at all. Neither was the restaurant being under renovation - probably because we like to explore a bit. I will say that this hotel in general and the hotel where the beach is are both under renovation.

I love the Aqua Lotus (at Diamond Head; Honolulu) and will absolutely keep them in mind the next time I go to Hawaii! This place was sooooooooo much better than the place I stayed at last year...and most of the reason why is because of the people who work here at the hotel. You can't go wrong with staying at this hotel. The beds are ridiculously comfortable; the balconies are very nice; the amenities are extremely adequate (if not better than adequate); the hotel staff is absolutely top-notch; and the location is perfect...especially if you want a nice, quiet place to stay.

Very responsive and helpful and always cheerful.I love the location because its away from the touristy heart of Waikiki. My room was nice. The bed and pillows were super comfy. The lanai was a great place to both relax and to work from. The TV was older, but if you're coming to Hawai`i to watch tv then I have no words for you. Bathroom was nice and updated - lots of room around the sink for products and the shower water pressure was outstanding. Only minor complaint was that the internet was slow - they may have a speed limit as most hotels do. But i had my mifi card as backup. Housekeeping was nice and if they saw me early in the day, they would ask what time I wanted my room cleaned.There is no fitness center on this property, but luckily, you're right by the ocean for amazing swims and runs, and the hotel lends out bikes and has yoga several days a week.I also appreciated that they had beach mats and chairs to lend out, along with towels.

So many variables and tradeoffs that inevitably I end up choosing one and just hoping for the best. Having researched Hotels in Oahu extensively (and visited 4 times before) I had a fair idea what i was getting into. My choices were between The Modern, Hotel Renew and The Lotus. In the end, being away from the grind of Waikiki was important for me.First impressions: the Lotus is fantastic. Colorful lobby without being tacky, away from all the noise, and a small amount of rooms. We chose a Diamond Head premium room. Some will say the second lanai is a waste of money - and that might be true. But you get one less room on the side, more space( and some of the middle rooms are blue, which IMHO are nowhere near as nice). For my money - these rooms are the best. As always higher is better. Oh and the beds - the beds! supremely comfortable.The staff: Great! Very friendly, and helpful. A small staff ( i only encountered 4 staff in the front desk) means a very personal service. Best service i have had in Oahu by a long stretchThe amenities: Few, but for us - useful. If you need a hotel bar/restaurant - look elsewhere. For us - free yoga, beach towels/chairs and bikes where perfect. As well as complimentary coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. Great touches.The bottom line: We really felt like San Souci was 'our' beach. The staff are wonderful. The location is perfect. The room was fantastic.

Wow! Everything was perfect! I came here as a solo traveler for my birthday. I highly suggest paying for a corner, ocean premium room - your jaw will just hit the ground and your wallet won't experience sticker shock (as a baseline, I live in San Francisco.) I stayed in room 1125 and was simply blown away. The room was immaculate. I had two lanais (one faced Diamond Head and the ocean and the other faced the ocean.) There are two hotels directly in front of the hotel but they do not at all take away from the gorgeous view. I loved the twice-daily maid service, in-room turn-down service and every staff member! I cannot speak highly enough about Dante, Sarah and Carissa at the front desk. I have stayed at luxury and budget places around the world and really felt like I was staying with family. Travis and Wes rocked as valets and I thank them big time for their enthusiasm and hospitality. I requested a coffee maker and microwave and had them about 10 minutes after my early check-in (which I had requested given that my flight came in at Noon.) The onsite restaurant is not open yet (June 2012) but the Hau Tree is within 50 yards at the New Otani hotel - just make reservations in advance on Open Table as they honor those before honoring walk-ins and they are always packed. Again, I live in SF so the prices were not high for me but I can see that the prices would be high at the Hau Tree for breakfast/brunch/lunch. You can walk in about a minute to the beach at the Canoe Club and in about two minutes to the beach at Kaimana beach (the beach in front of the New Otani Hotel). The latter has amazing swimming! Aqua Lotus is along Kapiolani Park and about a 15 minutes walk from the crazy, packed, yucky, touristy Waikiki strip. Given I live in SF, I wanted to stay at a smaller hotel (this one has 50 rooms) and be away from the touristy stuff. Major bonus points for: no resort fees, complimentary beach chairs/beach towels/beach mats/beach bicycles/yoga mats and lessons 4 days a week at 7:30am in Kapiolani park/wine from 4pm - 6pm nightly/coffee in the lobby every morning. I have to emphasize that the staff here is simply amazing! Customer service rocks! Everyone will go out of their way to make sure you have the vacation of a lifetime. They are renovating the rooms (wood floors to replace carpets and furniture upgrades) this month and next. As a comparison, I had dinner at the Royal Hawaiian, Hilton Hawaiian Village, Halekulani and Moana Surfrider and I would not stay at those places unless I craved being in a very busy, packed, loud City environment during my vacation. I would, if I had tons of money, stay at the Kahala Resort on the Gold Coast. Short of Kahala, Aqua Lotus is *the* place to stay. Just be advised that you will have to walk to get to the action. Again, I live in SF and walk a lot so this was just fine with me. May not be ideal if you have little ones. I hope you love it as much as I did! I will be back for sure :-) Oh, and I slept with the sliding glass doors open every night - nothing better than being lulled to sleep by trade winds and ocean :-) :-) For me, this place was my own slice of paradise!

If you stayed at other Waikiki hotels, you'd hear the garbage trucks, tour buses, and fire engines through out the day. It's very peaceful at the Lotus.The staff is top notch.

We expected this as the Orbitz confirmation had 1 PM as the check-in time. We stayed around the hotel until 1 PM and then had to sit in the lobby until 3 PM waiting for our room to be ready.

Turns out I made an excellent choice! The hotel is not technically beachfront but the beach is just steps away through the parking lot. Speaking of which, we were not looking forward to paying $20 per day for valet parking (apparently standard in Waikiki) but we ended up finding parking on the street every night either right by the hotel or near the park down the street and saving lots of money. I was particularly impressed with the terrific staff, very friendly and knowledgeable. The housekeeping staff were amazing-got us extra pillows immediately-and, best story; we came back after a hike and showered-the room had already been cleaned-and then went to the beach for an hour. When we returned, the towels had all been replaced-again! Kudos to the Aqua Lotus staff. I would definitely stay here again.","Livonia, Michigan",2,5.0

They also provided a few apples in the lobby for guests. The hotel information in the room states that they charged $2 for every call made but we weren't charged. They offered to print my boarding passes which was appreciated. My only complaint is the location. The restaurant was closed so anytime you were hungry, you had to order take-out, go to the overpriced restaurant next door or walk the 10-15 minutes to Waikiki.

Hotel is at far end of Waikiki, almost in the shadow of Diamond Head Crater. We arrived about 2 hours before the normal check in time. We were met by valet Travis, who upon seeing our mountain of luggage retrieved a luggage cart and assisted us. A gracious front desk clerk allowed us to check in early. The upper floors of the hotel are completely open. The elevator opens up to an open air hallway so all access is from outside. The room was just ok. The bed felt like a typical truck stop type mattress. The shower had moldy grout in the corners and along the caulking of the shower door. The Lanai needed a good scrubbing. Some of the furniture was chipped and worn looking. Apparently there used to be a cafe and bar on the 2nd floor but it seemed to be closed down. Wine is offered in the lobby in the evening and coffee in the morning (no in room coffee, no microwave but there is a small fridge). I was very concerned about how easy it would be for a person of even moderate athletic ability to climb from one lanai to another. All it would take to have an intruder in a room is for someone to sit on the railing of the lanai and work their way over to where they had one leg on either side of a the thing wall diving the lanais. The lanais do have locking sliding glass doors but no way to listen to the ocean if you don't want to run the risk of an intruder. One can see into adjoining rooms simply by peeking around the wall separating the lanais. The pluses are the view of Diamond Head and a catty corner view of the ocean. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Due to a very late return from a poor Enoa tour we were very late checking out. Dante was understanding and only charged us a modest fee. Upon checking out Sarah was very courteous and even thought it was quite late allowed us to use the room to change and clean up before our flight home. I would probably stay here again simply for the people and the quietness of the area.","Grove, Oklahoma",18,3.0

We normally stay in larger hotels on Waikiki, but wanted to have a ""quieter"" experience with our two teenage children this trip. Aqua Lotus hotel is across the street from Kapiolani Park. The view from our balcony was Diamond Head/Kapiolani Park on the left and partial ocean view on the right. Gorgeous. Hotel staff was wonderful with all our needs. Cette and Bill were especially helpful with tourist tips, getting our car, avoiding traffic snarls, etc. Always a friendly face and kind. We loved having the bikes available to cruise along Kapiolani Park and on down Ala Wai Canal. Free towels and beach chairs were fantastic also. We never felt nickled and dimed as we have been with other resorts. This boutique hotel did not have a restaurant as it is apparently on hold with refurbishing; however, we walked to the hotel behind us and ate breakfast at the Hau Tree Lanie restaurant on the beach at the New Otani Hotel. Gorgeous under the old Hau trees which legend has it, author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote nad reflected. Rooms were clean, comfortable...fantastic shower head, and nice balconies. The hotel was almost completely booked, but we did not hear loud bangings above or below us...not sure if building or if just polite neighbors. The ""disco elevator"" was a big hit with my teenagers. Balinese, quiet/meditative style in lobby, but once you entered the elevator, club music was going away. Was a constant source of laughter and conversation with other guests. We took advantage of the courtesy wine happy hour a few times in the lobby, and took up a glass to our balcony and enjoyed the view.A convenience store was out and across the parking lot in a building suite for bananas, bread, drinks...or other food items for mini fridge.

The rooms are spacious and clean, with nice little balconies to sit and watch the world go by. It is well worth paying extra for the deluxe rooms on the higher floor, as they have lovely views (though you should be warned that the hotel is not directly oceanfront, so ocean views are at a slight distance. Even the higher-priced rooms are a great value for the area.  I've also had great experiences with the staff -- the small size of the hotel means that everyone is friendly, helpful, and unrushed.

Its a smaller hotel which worked great for us :)Long story: First of all the location was perfect, not on the strip with tons of noise, but closer to diamond head (which makes for a great view as well). Right across the street from a huge park.It was a little hard to find at first because we were looking for AQUA but it actually says Lotus, so look for that.We pull up to a very friendly smiling gentleman Travis, he was our valet (who also doubles as the bellman and the front desk person. this guy dies it all!) They only have valet parking which costs $20 a day, not the best news but so work it! He did inform us that with our Hawaii ID we got 50% off parking, great news. We checked in at the front desk and the gentleman told us that they have, get this: Complementary bikes for us to use, complementary coffee in the morning down stairs, complementary wine from 4-6pm in the lobby, complementary beach towels and chairs and even complementary yoga on certain days of the week! We loved having the bikes to ride, it really added so much to our trip. We really enjoyed the wine downstairs as well, made for a much more romantic trip.The room we got to was on the 3rd floor, with a view but not the best and it had 2 double beds (I had asked Expedia for a king). I'm not one to call and ask for things from the front desk but I thought I might as well ask if we can switch rooms to one with a king bed, the man at the front desk was so kind and told me that there were no rooms of the same type with a king, but that they did have a upgraded room (a corner room) for a $15 fee per day, we are on vacation so we said yes! Ohh boy it was so worth it, the room is on the corner and was a floor higher so the view of diamond head was great!We had a great stay, and they even let us check-out late upon asking them. Its nice and quite at night and during the day for that matter.The staff continued to be so nice and friendly and most of all accommodating. Travis, Bill and Saitte? Were all spectacular!! Short story: Traveled as a couple, great staff great location great complementary add on's.There is no pool so might not be great for kids. WE loved loved loved it and will be back the next time we are on Oahu.Only down side, now I'm nitpicking here is that there is only one elevator so it at times takes while for it to get to you.Note: Do Not waste your money at the restaurant next door Michele's, food is ok but WAY over priced.","Lihue, Hawaii",7,5.0

Although most of the reviews were very positive, I was a little concerned because it was referred to as a “boutique hotel” and not on the main drag of Waikiki. With this being our first trip to HNL I feared I would regret not staying on the strip. We had no regrets at the Aqua Lotus.On arrival, I suggest you request the highest floor possible. Our first night was on 5th floor. The views from 5th floor are somewhat obstructed by trees. I requested a higher floor at front desk, I was given a key to room on 9th floor to see if I liked it better. The view of Diamondhead and the ocean was tremendous, so we moved to the new room on 9th floor with no fuss.The rooms are bright, with balconies. Traveling with the family, bathrooms are very important. The bathrooms at the Aqua Lotus are large, tiled sink and shower. They use a rainfall shower head which is great after log day on the beach. All rooms have mini-fridge and free internet. I note these characteristics because on the similarly priced properties along the strip with small bathroom and daily internet charges ranged from $12.00-$23.00. At the Aqua Lotus there were no resort fees, no nickel and diming you to death. When we checked out, the bill was actually $4.00 less than what was estimated on my confirmation! When was the last time that happened?The staff was so genuine and helpful. They made excellent suggestions for excursions and food. Oh, and the complimentary bikes! What a benefit to be able to cycle around at your leisure and enjoy. Bike comes with helmets and locks. We rose during the day, but noticed that during the evening, all the bikes were checked out, must be something to night time bike riding.The property is across from the park where many locals seem to go and recreate and walk up to main strip. The Aquarium and Zoo are both within 10minute walk. Bill was there when we first arrived and greeted us like family. He was consistently very helpful and always greeted us with a smile and made us feel like we were returning home. He gave a very good restaurant suggestion (Lulu’s) and we were very pleased. Ceitte also had superb customer service. He helped us with our bike rental, adjusted our bike seats for us and told us where to find the most amazing scones. Front desk staff is also great, as well as the housekeeping staff (I didn’t catch the guy’s name that was so quick to bring us extra towels, but he was awesome, friendly and always smiling.)We would definitely stay at the Aqua Lotus again on our next visit to Honolulu.",Chicago,22,4.0

The bathroom is actually large enough for two people to dress comfortably. There was also a roomy balcony to have tea on and watch the sunrise over Diamond Head.

In some ways it met expectations and in others not so much. The location of the hotel was great for us, as we wanted to be close to the Waikiki resort but not in it. It is a full ten min walk to the start of the main strip but this is along the nice park area and there are nice parts of the beach closer than this. It is quite away from the opposite end of the action but there was always a taxi available even late into the night. There was also plenty of free street parking (6pm-10am) along the road so we never had any need for the valet and always got a spot right outside the hotel. The rooms were very nice, large and spotlessly clean with pleasant Hawaiian décor: TV cabinet, desk, sliding blind doors etc. The bathroom was very nice too with marble finish and nice amenities (lethally slippery floor though!). Wi-fi was very useful, plenty of storage space and an in-room safe. I asked for a coffee maker and it was delivered immediately with nice coffee replenished every day. Housekeeping was very good, done thoroughly any time of day. You could hire beach gear from the front desk too. Lobby wasn’t overly inviting though, it felt like an annex of the underground valet area. What was the relentless cheesy dance music all about? Always on in the lobby and on even louder in the elevator, didn’t really seem to fit.Having two balconies was nice, but I’m afraid this is where my review must slip into the negative… I did a lot of research for this hotel and luckily I knew there was no real ocean view to be had. Being both our birthdays we paid extra for a Diamond Head Premium, so we had a very nice view over Diamond Head and you could also glimpse the ocean in between some buildings across a parking lot. We knew what we were getting, but in the build up we had been tempted to splurge for the Premium Ocean room that offered both views. This hotel is set back from the seafront, has a number of buildings in between and none of the rooms seem to face directly toward the sea. Slightly misleading that you could pay extra for a diagonal view across a car park between some buildings. The Diamond Head views are lovely though, better than a sea view in my opinion. As well as this, I have already mentioned we were celebrating both our birthdays while staying at this hotel, and I had twice mentioned it to the hotel in advance. Now I would never cry foul that a free gift wasn’t waiting for us or similar like we have had in hotels before, but we were maybe hoping that we would get the best room within our budget. Instead we were on the floor 7 of at least 12, so our side balcony looked into trees (the lower rooms must have awful views in all honesty). In fact, it being both our birthdays wasn’t mentioned either in email reply or in person while we were there.Another thing that irked me was that the wireless internet was lost for over 24 hours on my birthday so I could not Skype or email with family. I can handle technical problems OK, but I got the impression the staff either didn’t believe me or just didn’t care each time I brought it up. I had to file a log with the provider etc myself and hope for the best. I found this a lot with the staff to be honest, a kind of too cool for school attitude and that you should just be appreciative that you’re staying at this hotel. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but they seemed a bit up themselves for want of a better expression (except a helpful girl who was usually on mornings). It was as if everything was an effort and when anything was done they wore an expression as if they’d just made you the best cocktail in the world and you’d better tip for it! There was also no free internet access available to guests without a laptop, you had to pay to use their communal computers. Very annoying, especially when the wi-fi goes down. It was little things like that that just didn’t sit well with us. When you pay a little more you expect a little more…","New York City, New York",59,3.0

We had booked an inexpensive ""Diamond Head View"" room but were upgraded to one of the best top floor corner rooms with views of Diamond Head in one direction and the ocean (away from Waikiki) in the other. Everything about our stay was perfect. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was spacious, bright and clean, the afternoon wine and free bicycles and beach chairs were unexpected and welcome extras. The location, a short walk through the park to busy Waikiki beach, was perfect for us. We liked being away from the bustle. The large park across the street was full of community activities and sports and gave a nice ""local"" feel to the place. This hotel is just behind another hotel and condo building, so not right on the beach, and not with direct beachfront views, but the direct views of Diamond Head and partial views of the ocean were still delightful. The beaches are small but OK and steps away from the hotel. There is no pool or onsite restaurant, though apparently a restaurant is opening soon. In the meantime the restaurant in the New Otami next door is very nice.","Syracuse, NY",3,5.0

The rooms were very clean and have great views. If you look to the left on the balcony you see the ocean, turm slightly and you will see the volcanos. Beds were super comfortable and the pillows were the best!There is a restaurant on the 2nd floor but it was closed for renovations, however the hotel staff made some great suggestions (Bogarts for Breakfast is a must). The Hotel is close to everything, yet far enough away for the secluded feeling. Walk to the zoo or aqurium. He snorkeled on the secluded beach and saw many fish.....Minutes away from all the shopping and night life.

We had an ocean view premium room on the 12th floor. The room was clean and spacious. The view was great – unobstructed view of Diamond Head with partial view of the ocean from the front balcony. The “25” series premium rooms also have a side standing balcony with partial ocean view on higher floors (we saw a whale from our room). The room has a small fridge for beverages and snacks but no coffee maker. We requested a coffee maker but after it had not arrived by the second day after our request, we cancelled the request and used the lobby coffee service.The web page advertises single king or two double beds. However the reservation process doesn’t allow for specifying a bed configuration request. We called after making the reservation on the web and asked for two doubles. We were told that requests cannot be guaranteed but they would note the request. Upon check-in, we did not get two doubles and they wouldn’t be available for a least a couple days, so we stayed with the king.We think that because the hotel is relatively small, and usually filled, that it is difficult for the staff to guarantee specific requests. However the rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable; and upper floor rooms have great views.The beach chairs, towels, and mats are a great service as is the afternoon wine service. The laundry facility on the 3rd floor is also helpful.There are many food options in this area on Kapahulu: Tokkuri Tei, Ono Hawaiian, Side Street Inn, Leonards. Also Diamond Head Market & Grill is a really enjoyable walk in the morning across Kapiolani Park (for scones); pick up salads or wraps to keep in the fridge for later in the day. There is also a Safeway on Kapahulu and a convenience store next door at New Otani.Like so many people mention, it is a great location nestled alongside Kapiolani Park.

We enjoyed being able to see the waves break on the ocean and thunderstorms.The room was very clean, pristine, and nicely decorated. The hotel's website says wi-fi is free, yet there was a card in the room stating they charged; we phoned the front desk who then clarified that wi-fi is free. (I would recommend the hotel remove these cards.)The employees were very cheerful, polite, and friendly. We enjoyed them!There are beach towels, mats, chairs, and bicycles to check out at no additional charge. We took advantage of the towels and bikes.There is an approximate 0.5 mile walk to the bustling Waikiki strip.

We stayed at a great hotel last time but I wanted something less noisy this time. When I read the reviews and description of aqua lotus, I booked the hotel although I was a little nervous about how far it really was from the main strip of stores and restaurants. From the moment we walked in to the sweet smelling lobby and were greeted by staff who were there to help us to our room, it was a great choice. A mistake in the number of beds that could have turned the trip negatively , was fixed quickly. A coffeemaker with hawaiian coffee and a microwave was brought to our room ; fridge provided too. The view from our balcony(1022) was amazing with diamond head to the left and the pacific ocean to the right. I was in heaven! The bed was comfy and I have a terrible back problem. The beach behind the hotel was terrific with the water crystal clear and while a little cool ... it was February after all ... we still enjoyed the water and sun. Oh yeah, the hotel really does lend chairs, umbrellas and towels. And you can also borrow a bike to take a ride around the surrounding park and mountain area. My husband even ran into them taping an episode of Hawaii 5-0 at the nearby park on a bike ride! The only drawback is the 15 to 20 minute walk for food and shopping - however it is a lovely stroll by the beach and park; great for working off calories from the variety of restaurants on the strip. Lu Lu's was one of our favorites. Service was amazing from information about the Bus, welcoming us back (shout out to Bill), help with luggage including storage while we awaited our plane, bed turndowns, the coffee and wine hours, etc. To sum it up .. if you are looking for a smaller hotel with awesome service, great views, breathtaking sunset and rises, and a vacation your friends will be envious of, book the Aqua Lotus.

The beds and bathroom are very nice, and access to the beach are easy.The restuarant in the New Otani next door has a very nice view on the beach and has classical food well done (shrimp salad, salad Nicoise)..Cons:The hotel does not have a real place to hang out as the restaurant is closed, here is no bar and the lobby is really a basement. However, the staff were helpful and the rooms are larger and in better condition than the New Otani. We were on the 9th floor and we overlooked the parking lot, with the ocean in the distant.

It is not right on the beach or have any unobstructed views of the beach (not from the 5th floor anyway) but it was a decent price and as an old W hotel the accomodations were very nice. There is no restaurant/bar inside but there was one nearby at the New Otani Hotel. Another highlight was Kapiolani park which was right across the street, if you like to run/walk/work out it is perfect. The zoo is also very nearby. The only part I didn't like so much was the distance we had to walk to everything else (i.e. Duke's, International Marketplace) which was about 15-20 minutes.

No breakfast available but we brought our own bowls for cereal and the fridge in the room will hold what you need. Fresh coffee and tea are available in the lobby in the morning so we could satisfy our breakfast needs. In the afternoon there is complimentary wine served in the lobby and you can take a glass to your room to enjoy on the balcony. The hotel is situated well away from the hubbub of central Waikiki and for myself I would much rather look out at Diamond Head and a park (limited views of the ocean from the balcony) than pay a premium in town for ocean views or look out onto all the highrise buildings.

The price was right and the location perfect to our way of thinking: a bit removed from the hustle and noise of Waikiki at the foot of Diamond Head and across the street from Kapi'olani Park. We booked our second four-night stay because we'd extended our time in Hawaii and the Lotus was worth a return visit.The ambiance is that of a small boutique hotel. The staff, as others have noted, are professional and friendly. Several times during our second stay, we were recognized as returning guests and welcomed back. The combination of staff, the special touches offered at the hotel, the rooms and location led to our conclusion, that we've found 'our' hotel in Honolulu. We will be back.Special touches: Morning coffee is provided daily in the lobby -- free copies of the Star-Advertiser newspaper as well. If you prefer in-room coffee, a pot, cups and coffee packets will be provided. Each afternoon complimentary red and white wine, self-served in Reidel wine glasses replace the morning coffee service. The hotel also provides beach towels and chairs as well as bikes for guests to use. Guests are also invited to participate in complimentary yoga classes offered four times a week at 7:30 a.m. Instructors lead the class in Kapi'olani park. (I had never tried a yoga class and participated in this one - it is incredible! The instructor, Courtney, was able to adapt the workout to the ability levels of each participant in the class. The park location was perfect allowing for us to watch the sun rise over Diamond Head.)The rooms: all have postcard views of Diamond Head (and there's also a beautiful view of Waikiki Beach on the open hallway between the elevator and the rooms.) The amount of water view you have depends on how high your room is and its location in the hotel. Our first stay, we were in an ocean view room, on the eighth floor, on the end of the building which gave us two patios and a view of the water and Diamond Head. On our return visit we spent four nights on a 10th floor room and had a bit more expansive water view. Both rooms were spacious, kept clean by the housekeeping staff that visited during the day and provided an evening turn-down of the delightfully comfortable beds. Rooms have wi-fi access and a small refridgerator. The decks are large with two chairs and a large table and provide spectacular views of Diamond Head.Hotel location: As noted above, the hotel is to the south of Waikiki, just past the Aquarium. We found it an easy walk through the park to get back to the busier part of town. In fact our hotel's location allowed for us to walk to the top of Diamond Head (7.5 miles round trip) and to Kahala Mall (about 5 miles) quite easily. But for those who don't want to walk, the Honolulu public bus system, TheBus, can take you to the island's major tourist attractions. There's a bus stop close to the hotel and is served by Bus 2 which loops you back to Kuhio Ave. (the heart of Waikiki) or Bus 14 which loops around the base of Diamond Head (past the lighthouse, and near the Kahala Hotel, to the Kahala Mall and Coco Head area. We were provided transfer coupons which were valid for four hours and as a result often didn't need pay for a return trip or provided a free transfer to a bus going to the place we were headed. The hotel front desk can provide a reference sheet and map that tells you which bus to catch to reach tourist destinations such as Pearl Harbor and the Polynesian Cultural Center and points along the North Shore. The cost per adult was $2.50 (we could have purchased a four-day pass for $25 but opted to walk to most destinations.) A rental car isn't necessary.Restaurants: There was talk that the hotel's second floor restaurant will re-open in the future but for the present time the nearby restaurants offered high-end dining options. As noted above though it was simple to hop the bus to get back into Waikiki where multitudes of eateries at all price ranges are to be found or out to the Kahala Mall where a similar array is available.Area free attractions: If you stay at the Lotus don't miss the free band concert in Kapi'olani Park on Sunday afternoons, check out the art along the fence of the nearby Honolulu Zoo and if you are lucky, catch one of the free hula shows in the park as well. We were also entertained watching pick-up soccer games in the park from our deck each evening. The hotel is very close to the Outrigger Canoe Club, a private club that's been a Honolulu tradition since 1908. If you are a member of a club that has a reciprocal membership with the OCC, and plan to use it while in Hawaii, this hotel is perfectly located for easy access. Ask about OCC hotel rates when you call for a reservation.","Agios Nikolaos, Greece",65,5.0

It is in a quieter part of Waikiki which in our opinion was fantastic as you have a more relaxing and paradisical experience in the area. Also, for the price it is a great value as other hotels of the same quality will charge more per night for the same types of views. We stayed in room 1221 (Ocean View Premium) and you cannot, absolutely cannot beat the views. We had two lanai's,one with a view of the ocean and Diamond Head and the other smaller one that looks out into the city and other mountains. The room was large and very clean. A few other reviewers commented on the stained carpet, there was a stain by the door but truly this was not a deal breaker. The room still felt up to date and modern. Also, people have commented on the TV's as they are not new flat screens, this was also not a deal breaker. I did not feel that I was lacking anything because the TV is an older style. The bed was super comfortable and it does have a feather mattress on top. This was not a problem, I did not experience it moving or becoming uncomfortable during the night. The bathroom does not have a tub, which was fine as we never take baths, but in a premium room one might expect to have a little more luxury and I would say that a few more amenities could be offered in the bathroom. The shampoo and conditioner and lotion were great, but when paying for one of the nicest rooms in the hotel it would be nice to see something special in the room. For example a shaving kit, or maybe cotton swabs....something to up the value of what you are paying for. There is not restaurant in the hotel although we were told two would be opening within the year. The hotel next door has a fabulous breakfast and as it has been mentioned it is pricey but maybe worth it one or two times. The ""hidden"" breakfast gem is located about a 5 minute walk toward busy Waikiki, Queens Surf Cafe & Lanai is super, super cheap by any standard and absolutely delicious. We were blown away. It is worth it for both breakfast and dinner. The pancakes were great and the lox was the best we ever had (no joke). That being said - we did not have a problem with the hotel offering no food or dining service. We ordered pizza one night and it was delivered to the room within 30 min. Back to the hotel - there is coffee service in the mornings and they serve wine from 4 - 6pm in the lobby which is a very nice touch (Gnarly Head Red). They offer free beach towels, chairs and mats and the beach is about 2 mins. from the front of the hotel. You can also take a ride on the complimentary beach cruisers they provide. All of these amenities came in handy for us and made our experience at the hotel very enjoyable. The only thing I would have liked was possible snorkel rental or sales. Otherwise, you have to bring your own or walk to the busier part of Waikiki to rent it. Parking is pricey at $20 but I believe it is one of the cheaper prices as compared to other hotels in Waikiki. You can park on the street at the meters but it will probably be a hassle and the street parking seemed to always be taken.The staff at the hotel was fantastic and friendly! No one was a problem for us and they all were knowledgeable and quick to deal with any problems. Travis the valet is fantastic. He recommend the Diamond Head Market and Grill for lunch and it was great. He was also very quick to get our car and patient as we had to get in and out of it several times. Carissa at the front desk was really nice and personable and helped us obtain a room on a high floor for extra special views. Two thumbs up for the staff!It you want a smaller hotel with amazing views, comfortable beds, and friendly staff this hotel is the place for you. If you like more action and want the hustle and bustle of a big resort like the Hilton or Royal Hawaiian in the heart of busy Waikiki, this will not be a good fit. The Aqua Lotus is a fabulous hotel and will only get better once their restaurants open.","Los Angeles, California",68,4.0

Ipod docks/wifi. We love the feel of a boutique hotel where the staff are extremely personable; nothing was ever a problem. No roads to cross to the beach, convenient parking, quieter end of town yet still within easy walking reach of buzzy Waikiki, so you don't feel excluded. The Lotus ticked every box for our family, which included our teenage sons. Nice touches such as newspapers, wine and coffee in the lobby add to the warmth of this fabulous place.

We booked through the 1-800 number and received an amazing deal. :)The staff at The Lotus are incredibly friendly and helpful - and the lobby is absolutely breathtaking, tranquil and always smells delicious!!The decor in the room is simple and clean - however the room overall is quite average with a very old and noisy mini-fridge, an older model tv and the 'pillow-top' on the bed rarely stays in place and is quite frustrating. Keeping in mind however, the view of Diamond Head is breathtaking. The only other negative is that, during our stay, the restaurant was closed for reservations. Granted, we could walk approximately 10-15 minutes to Waikiki and find numerous restaurants, ABC stores and shopping.The hotel is also incredibly close to the Aquarium as well as the Honolulu Zoo - it is also directly across the street from Kapiolani Park (which is perfect for walking the dogs, jogging, picnics or just enjoying the day) and an extremely short walk to the beach.Oh, one more thing - valet parking is mandatory - which we found a little frustrating as you have to pay for parking and then a tip is expected every time you require your car. Just something little, but something we would have liked to have known before we stayed here.Overall, the staff really make this hotel fantastic - and the lobby really is gorgeous!!","Kapolei, Hawaii",55,3.0

Granted, I was staying in the penthouse suite, but the appointments, view, gracious and humble service, and general ambiance all exist throughout the property.Every single room in the hotel has a lanai, and a spectacular view, (though no room has a completely unobstructed ocean view). And most importantly, every single room in the hotel has the easy-going-yet-upscale hotel vibe that comes with the property. It's cool, super friendly, way convenient, AND MOST IMPORTANT: NOT ON WAIKIKI.It is super convenient to everything, steps from the beach and great restaurants, but if you want to be among the masses, swept up in the tourist mayhem, or clambering to get into Abercrombie and Fitch, you'll actually have to WALK 10 blissful beach minutes to get there. Don't come here if you'll be disappointed that you're not in the thick of it, because you just won't appreciate the incredible charming appeal of this great hotel.The Lotus sits at the foot of Diamond Head, in a very peaceful, quiet area that I will no doubt return to again. It has changed its name a few times in recent history, which concerns me, only because I don't want the great service/vibe to disappear. It's perfection.",New York,168,5.0

Clarissa from the front desk upgraded us to a corner room in the tenth floor with views of both the ocean and diamond head for only $30 more a nite. Try and book this room 1025. It's the best room in the house! We love love this hotel because all the service folks were friendly and helpful with the aloha spirit. The hotel is about a good 15-20 minutes walk to waikiki but we didn't mind it since we were getting good exercise. Had breakfast at Bogarts which is a must. Dinner next door at Michelson was awesome but bit pricey. Great view. There is a casual restaurant next door at the Otani hotel. There is also a convenience store and a few shops and beauty salon next door. We hiked up to the top of Diamond head which was phenom. The beach on the property was the best for swimming. Not rocky and not much surf. It wasn't very crowded at all compared to Waikiki. The bedding was nice and comfy. You can ask for a coffee maker for your room nc. For some authentic local grub head out to Side street inn cafe which is a five min can drive. You will be happy happy happy.,"Newport Beach, California",14,5.0

We had TWO balconies! It was so beautiful! We got there at night and I must admit, it was a little hard to find at first buyt we got it! Very close to the strip - it's a nice walk! There is plenty of free public parking outside of the hotel - no need to pay for the parking. Just make sure you wake up in time to move it prior to getting a summons. We never had an issue here but then again, we were hardly in the room. Who goes to Hawaii to stay in a room? NOT US! We had the best time ever! Diamond HEad does get packed early so if your going to go there, I would suggest heading out as early as possible. Oh, and one other thing, the hotel has a BEAUTIFUL gong in the lobby, This is not a chain hotel or a resort but it was still very nice! A little outdated but nothing that I could not handle. Thanks again for the amazing room!","Kearny, New Jersey",121,4.0

We stayed on the fifth floor which had good views of the Ocean and Diamond head. This hotel is ten minutes walk from the main drag so is in a quiet location, It is also only 1 minute walk from beach access, and has parkland right on its doorstep. The Hotel has art Deco feel to it, we investigated the closed restuarant and once/ when its re-opened will definately improve this Hotels appeal.Cons - This Hotel has no restaurant as it is under renervation even though there wasn't any sign of work while we were their. There are Hotels nearby that have food but at a high cost. There are no restaurants in the near facility. The hotel also has no tea or coffeemaking facilities apart from 6-9am in the foyer. We asked for a kettle which after negotiation was provided. The staff, while friendly seemed unknowlegable on local shuttles or tour options to the local sites.Conclusion - good hotel but needs the edges ironed out. Recomendation for local eatery would be Tikkis ten minutes walk to the centre.","Auckland, New Zealand",3,4.0

We had two adjoining rooms that made a very comfortable suite. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were Very cleaned and the maid service was excellent. It is on the Waikiki beach, very close to Diamond Head. The beds are very comfortable, the pillows are too. Another nice feature is the balcony had wooden french doors that slid in place in front of the glass sliders. These blocked the early morning sun allowing a dark room for sleeping.The very best part of Aqua Lotus is the fact that it is run so seemlessly, we could enjoy our vacation without stressing over our accomodations. Believe me this is the exception not the rule, lol. I highly recomend it!","Andover, Conn",3,5.0

Check in was easy, the staff seem professional, and nice, but that's the Hawaii flow. The room I had was on the 7th floor, was a good size. A desk, working lamp, T.V cabinet, if you want to? You so don't need T.V. in Hawaii, and a good sized bathroom, and usual products, towels, hair dryer, and beds are comfy, with white sheets, staving away from the gory flower reprints.I also chose this hotel as I managed to get this is on a good deal, and it used to be a W, assumed, at least some of the aesthetics would be left over. The lobby is cute, but nothing grand, just nice, and actually lo key, it's a quiet hotel thank god. For a hotel that is 4 star, it could do with a little upscaling on touches, I mean, if you stay in solid boutique hotels, this is most definitely not one, it's just a well placed, neutrally painted hotel, with good staff. Something that is a good bonus, is the views! Diamond head is just behind the hotel, and to be honest, the area really starts to change if you take a walk. It's really the upscale area, and taking a morning run as I did was amazing. Close by is also the bus stops, for you to pick up to go around the island, but be prepared, it's forever))) And taxi's run up and down to road if you don't wanna walk. All in all, if they remain competitive on the price, always worth looking into this place, good sized rooms, and a peaceful nights sleep is exactly what you need if you're in Hawaii!","London, United Kingdom",17,4.0
