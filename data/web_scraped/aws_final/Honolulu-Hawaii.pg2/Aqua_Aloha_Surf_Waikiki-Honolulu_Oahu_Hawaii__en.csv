Expensive as well for a moderate room, everything is relatively close in Waikiki so location was ok. Staff were very helpful with all my requests. It was booked through a travel agent and was staying solo so I also had to pay a single supplement which made the price expensive considering the facilities.

You'd expect when welcoming fellow Kama'aina there'd be a bit more Aloha, but nothing. They didn't want to be there. They also tried to tell me my rate wasn't Kama'aina and wouldn't remove the Resort Fee despite my confirmation stating it was. It really was a terrible first impression, and as they say, first impressions last. Also, their website states they offer Kama'aina a free upgrade if available - no mention of this either.Secondly, elevators were very slow - there are only 2, and one was broken. You need to plan a LOT of time; sometimes as much as 10 minutes, to get up and down.Carpet in the room was dirty. Rooms were NOT serviced (no towels replaced, no cleaning) as my stay was only 2 nights (3 days). When I inquired at reception I was told ""... We only do that for stays over 3 nights"". This was NOT clear anywhere, nor was I told this at check-in. If I was, I would have been OK, and would have realized I could have just asked for new towels.. but the lack of communication was poor.Also, CONSTRUCTION. Lots of drilling beginning at 7am. I was not informed of this during check-in either. Go back to your room at 4pm for a rest? Forget about it - DRILLING. Loud. In reality, I think they give Kama'aina the *worst* rooms.Admittedly, hotels in HNL are only for you to sleep in. They are cheap, good location, but that is it. I would rather spend more $ to get some Aloha. Will NOT recommend, or stay here again, sorry.","Island of Hawaii, Hawaii",34,2.0

There is a parking garage where you pay I think $30 USD per night, however it was full when we arrived so we had to find another parking garage, about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The room was large and the bed was comfortable but everything else was sub par. The couch had large stains and the room looked old. There is also construction next to the hotel, which we could hear in the morning. The free breakfast buffet was just OK.

We got great service from staff at reception and maintenance, whenever needed e.g. I couldn't work out how to work my room card. We also used the car parking facility, you will have a car space allotted. The room was very basic, the photos don't show how dated the rooms are. But we were happy with them because they were spotlessly clean and were serviced every day. We had the best night's sleeps on their beds and pillows each night, air conditioning wasn't noisy for me. And there is a room next to the bathroom for make up etc. It was the best value for money at Christmas time in Waikiki. Would definitely stay here again. If you come here expecting 4 star or to look exactly as the pictures suggest e.g. brand spanking new, this isn't likely to meet your expectations if you are after fancy hotel. But if you're after value for money in Waikiki, a clean room to stay and a budget to stick to, and a laidback chill atmosphere that feels like you are at the beach, this is a great choice. We regretted that we weren't able to stay in this hotel for our entire stay in Honolulu.

We were able to get a room at Aqua Aloha Surf. It is a good hotel- they have a hearty breakfast with Asian lunch food as well as good pancakes (we got tired of it after a few days). It is a great location and the service was mostly very good. They have laundry facilities in the basement, cold water in the lobby, and free movie rentals. The deluxe room was big enough for a family of four if you don’t mind a double size bed. We got the deluxe room that has a double, twin, and sofa bed. We didn’t try pulling out the sofa but it worked as a single bed. One issue was the noise outside of the hotel. For the first couple of nights we left the glass door open (prefer no a/c) but it was terribly noisy with a bar across the street as well as construction. For the rest of the time we slept with the glass door closed, and a/c on and the noise was no longer an issue. There is a nice place to walk on a canal right next to the hotel, and plenty of rental bikes nearby. Excellent, cheap food everywhere. Overall, a great stay! Room has a microwave and mini fridge.

This year we decided to save some money and stay a couple of streets back from the action. The location was fine, even though there was a lot of construction happening right next door. Very clean and first impressions were excellent. Spacious room with great facilities in the room. The bed was super comfy. Only complaint is we were room 803 (last room on the block) the wind from outside kept banging our door, all night, sounded like someone was trying to break in.

The hotel is a mixture of rooms owned and managed by the hotel, and rooms/condos owned by private owners. The hotel has remodeled many, but not all of its rooms, and the rooms by the owners can be remodeled or very old and in disrepair.We found that the room that we rented through Airbnb was in the old and disrepair category. The owner was friendly and responsive, and fixed the toilet and the lights. We saw a room belonging to the hotle, and it looked fresh and modern. Good things about the hotel are that it is about a 10 minute walk to the beach; relatively low price; it has a good WiFi signal; and there is a good breakfast for hotel guests (or for purchase for Airbnb guests), and that the elevator worked well.Bad things are that it has no view of either beach or city due to being surrounded by higher buildings, and that we did not enjoy the Airbnb room.","Tampa, Florida",19,4.0

They never gave any type of service in fact instead of a greeting we received a “did you need something” uh yeah I want to check in. We came early had to wait forever to check in and once checked it it was terrible the beds were kids beds for a double room.The walls are popcorn ceilings with cracks where the AC is, the use a key to turn on power in sorry that is not new actually motels use that type of service and it’s not eco friendly it’s terrible use of electricity management. The safe was old and rusted I definitely didn’t want anything to do with it. They have a PS2 games not included and not taken care of either. Two of the buildings are in construction next to them until March 2020or later, so the fees should have been waived. Because there is no “resort” nor is quiet because they have looversfor windows not insulated windows. The pool is literally the size of a king bed from 3ft to 8ft. It was hard because asking for anything wasn’t just asking we had to call down several times for one item. Just extra conditioner. Example! The very next day we checked into a larger well managed hotel on Waikiki strip.We got our luggage taken in, ideas of places to go while we waited in for our rooms and our numbers were taken down to text us when room was ready now that’s a check in service. We were checked in before 11am I’ll never forget that me and my travel partner decided we were definitely coming back to that hotel! This place is a hostel but I’ve actually been to nice ones so even that’s not accurate. The manager T.C. likes to comment back on ratings like these and on google. Suggestion: stop commenting and make it better. The room rates from now til 2020 should not be that high and for not being renovated.Also huge red flag when it literally does not say hotel in the name it literally means it does not need to act like one. Which clearly they didn’t feel like. definitely not family friendly or any friendly.Its like their entire staff avoids tourist but they work in tourism and in a “hotel” bizarre behaviors to say the least.

So we went cheap - and not so close to the beach. The area looks like a warzone because of renovation and building. The room was tiny which was not much of an issue because thank goodness we were only there for one night. The windows in the room are apparently pretty non existent because on the 2 floor we could hear everything going on outside - thank goodness the AC was so loud and noisy it drowned out a lot of the noise. The place was relatively clean - except for the stains on the skimpy curtains, the carpeting, the chipped paint, even the pad of notepaper was all wrinkled from something wet and sticky having been set on it. And there were things left in the refrigerator. The bathroom was old - even the handle for the sink stopper was all bent, and the pocket door did not shut completely. The front desk - the only information the woman gave us was 'here is your parking permit - put it on the dash'. We had to call down later to find out where the ice machine was, and when the breakfast started. The breakfast of course caters to Asians - along with watery eggs, mini hot dogs trying to disguise themselves as sausages, the only juice was what appeared to be Hawaiian punch. The pastries included some sort of cake, and the mini donuts you get at the grocery store. And oh - dont even bother looking for jelly for the toast - they dont have it! They do not offer any assistance with unloading your car - if you use one of their carts be careful, they wheels dont work right and the ramp up from the driveway is a killer.

On the positives - it is relatively cheap for the area, it is located close to the beach and the room did have a bed in it.Thats about when the good parts of the experience end - I cant speak for all the check in staff (so there might be some good ones), the one we had was just particularly surly (always a top trait for someone that works in hospitality), there is the $25 a day resort /amentie fee which is of course a joke as you have no option to pay it (just include it in the room price ffs) but this is a standard gouging across Hawaii so I wont blame this hotel specifically for that, however where it does get amazing is when you do look at the amenities - the gym aka ""Exercise Area"" which is a single broken wieder multi gym sitting outside the lobby, Im not sure if you could legally describe it as something safe to exercise on, Ive added a photo as I found it particularly amusing - note the fact that if you did roll the dice and actualy use that machine it is located almost in the lobby and next to the vending machines adding to the special ambiance they have created. The rooms have a bed, TV and bathroom in them, we were concerned the bathroom door was going to fall to pieces in our hands every time we touched it but it did manage to survive our stay (win!), the use of PS3s as inroom DVD players is an interesting one I guess you could look at that as a positive. The air conditioner definitely worked you had a choice of either OFF or MEAT LOCKER COLD, we chose to dance between the two settings throughout the evening to keep things interesting.A few reviews have mentioned the breakfast and they are reasonably spot on, the angry greeting by the woman cooking pancakes is a bit of a low light but then the pancakes themselves are somewhat of a highlight of the whole hotel experience so its a real roller coaster of emotions throughout breakfast. It is served in an Asian buffet restaurant complete with large fishtank and ornate oval tables which does make for an interesting touch.If you are looking for a cheap hotel close to the beach and can overlook getting any sort of pleasure out of the hotel you are staying at on holiday then this is a fabulous choice, if not perhaps spend a few more dollars and keep hunting around",,27,2.0

There was a car park in the basement (very tight considering everyone has enormous trucks here) which is expensive at $30 a day. Remember they chuck a resort fee at you too- $25 a day to include everything you could ever want... NOT (free water in lobby, a newspaper, tea and coffee in room- ours didn’t have any)The staff weren’t quite up to scratch. Seeing as I work in hospitality, I do always expect a nice welcome- ours was far from it. I detest when they take your credit card as a ‘bond’ and automatically charge it when you check out, despite making it clear that I actually wanted to use another card. This caused big and unnecessary issues for us!! They also don’t explain anything about resort fees or parking when you arrive. I did hear a colleague say to the woman who checked us in ‘Don’t be so down about it, you can always try again’ so she was clearly having a bad day- which turned into a bad week for the whole time we were there.

Yes the rooms are dated that you cant not deny however they are clean and homey. The beds are so comfortable and they have the best pillows. Another bonus: unlimited internet so no need to buy data packs while travelling overseas. You do have to pay a resort fee of $25 per night which covers your breakfast, towels, internet and a shuttle to Ala Moana shopping mall. I felt this was great value for money. The staff were extremely helpful whenever we needed anything they were happy and accommodating of our needs. They have a cute little coffee shop inside the hotel and they do the best coffee! They also have a little nail/beauty shop onsite. I never used this so cant give feedback. Only negative was the breakfast. We actually only used our voucher for this once as we didnt like the choices. The only thing we ate was the freshly made pancakes. Everything else was not to our liking. Its more tailored to the Asian tourists. They do have toast but no toppings to go on it which is strange. Other than breakfast eveything else was awesome. If you are wanting a safe place to stay with friendly staff and brilliantly located motel (5mins walk to the beach an shopping) and you can look past the dated look then this is the place to staying wouldn't hesitate to stay here again when I come back to Hawaii.

For those who do not know how ""hotel rooms"" work in Hawaii, let me explain. The hotel rooms are considered ""condos"", and are each owned by someone. They are not owned by the ""hotel"". They simply maintain them and clean them after each guest leaves. With that being said, I'm very disappointed this time around. First of all I go through a third party to book, as its cheaper. The third party collects the taxes and fees. When I got to the property after paying over $500 for my 4 day stay, I was charged another $133 for a ""resort fee"". This ""hotel"" is far from a ""resort"". The staff are very very nice, I will give them that, however this is not a resort, its barely a hotel at this point. The lobby is okay, but has the same furniture in it that it had when I started staying here in 2010. Very old, worn and outdated. The rooms are no exception. They are suppose to require the owners to keep them up, and great condition and not to look like a dump. When I first checked in I was sent to 204, which was the size of a bathroom. Smells horrible and could barely turn around in the room and had no patio. They moved me to 609 with a fee of $10 per day ""upgrade fee"", however the only upgrade was a larger room and a patio. The condition of the room however was nowhere near an upgrade. With a king size bed that the mattress is broken down on the side and the foot, sagging and in horrible condition. The carpet is filthy, the walls have wallpaper that is peeling and ripped. The baseboards are water damaged. The lamp shades are gross with stains and dust. The sofa I wouldn't let a dog lay on it was so dirty. The tile in the bathroom shower looks like it was put in when the place was built. The furniture is chipped, broken and looks like its from the 80's. This is the last time I will stay at Aqua Surf Waikiki. I love the area because it is so close to everything, but I think it is time to start staying at the large corporate owned hotels that have better standards and requirements. Hopefully this building will get bought out and tore down for condos or something. BTW... the WiFi is horrible too! (See Photos)","Dothan, Alabama",6,2.0

The reason why I only give this property a 2 is because the room we stayed in had louver windows which would not shut completely so it was very, very loud day and night and when we asked (more than once) if we could change rooms they just sent people to try and close them which didnt work so we barely slept. The decor of the room we had was pretty bad and not a fair representation of the photos on their website or online which is disappointing. The aircon unit was temperamental and not to mention right at head height out of the wall next to you so we could not use it without it blowing directly on you when you sleep. The bathroom was in pretty poor shape and the shower was either scolding hot or cold, no in between here. They also charge a resort fee of $25 and I am unsure why when there are no special amenities. The only saving graces to give this property a 2 were that the towels and bedding were clean and comfy and they have an onsite guest laundry so if you have been travelling a while you can do this chore at the hotel.

No customer service other than tour information. Certainly no general knowledge of the area when asked to some staff. They advertised as featuring disability friendly i.e. personal disability lift as well as hydraulic chair lift for pool access. That's the only reason I booked this hotel and cost of course suited our budget and not too far to walk to beach with wheelchair, advertised as 3-4☆ on booking dot com. The lift worked once going down to street and never again during our stay nor did they bother to fix it or attempt to. The ramp out front stops at steps. Ramp in side says no prams or♿ disability. No wheel chair can get up or down the step to ramp that goes nowhere. I went for a swim in the pool which I thought I could manage to get in by myself, with aid of the handrail,however the top step,which looked achievable, certainly wasn't,which I unfortunately found out was way too steep and felt like it nearly ripped my leg off. The pain was excruciating. There was no signage to say' beware steep step'anywhere! After trying to ease the pain by swimming and moving about in the water. I needed to get out. I couldn't get out no matter how I tried and asked for the hydro lift to be available to staff in outside area. I asked if it worked,as I may need it. He told me ""yes, it did"".I asked for help. Eventually someone came,no communication to me whatsoever. Took out the battery after punching buttons. The battery didn't work. Three & half hours later(which in that amount of time caused eczema on my body and limbs from pool chemicals, i later found out)When i complained about the lack of communication to me or husband of what was going on,I was told battery needed to be 25% to work and it was only at 17%. All this time the battery still wasn't charged nor was there a spare. Throughout this period of time there was no communication from any of the staff. Only after I and my husband complained, to any staff walking by,and his, numerous visits to the service desk, to ask for assistance or at least some sort of communication,did the duty day manager finally appear. A Spanish guy I was told can't remember his name.His problem solving was ridiculous. No other staff assisted either. He preceded to tell me that they ""never use the lift,maybe twice in 50 weeks"". ""That this was a...(he didn't finish the sentence)that there's other hotels like Trump Tower and high end ones down the road etc I could have stayed at"". A full on discussion proceeded for about 15 minutes about the area and low sociological housing development etc taking place. That had nothing to do with me. After telling him i needed to get out and to get something for me to stand on as I couldn't get a leg up onto that top step as I injured my muscle when i got in. I told him to get a brick, so i could climb up to that top step. I'm 5'2"" not 7'. He asked if i got in myself and i told him i had as it looked like a normal step. I tried to check, to feel but fell as the reflection was deceiving. He disappeared for a while and brought back a wooden crate. He said ""will this do? Try it"" Which I replied ""you try it"". He didn't but expected me to. I had get out with the help of my husband and him lifting me onto it, then out. A risk! I was scared. It was a flimsy pinewood, crate that if my footing was wrong i could have snapped the pinewood and gone straight through. I that told him there should be a signage. 6 days later the crate was still there on the side of pool. The hydraulic lift into the pool hadn't been fixed neither had the disability lift to carpark. Or any signage placed there. This could have happened to anyone. There are other steps built into the pool wall, that kids could manage but not too many adults could. Certainly not disabled or elderly. I swim for exercise as I cannot walk very well. Yet they still take money for disability false advertising.

We didn't want to spend all our funds on accomodations that we wouldn't be spending much time in, except to sleep, bathe and dress. The Aqua Aloha Surf Waikiki, is a little dated, but for me cleanliness is more important than how modern the furniture is. We had a suite with a firm King bed with plush, high end linens. There were complimentary Hawaiian Tropic soaps and shampoo. Bath and shower were clean and well stocked with high end towels as well. So what may be lacking aestetically is made up for with these items of importance. The Aqua Aloha Surf has a pool, although world famous Waikiki beach is within walking distance. There is ample shopping, bars and food choices a few blocks away. Our favorite evening spots were the Maui Brewing Company and Tiki's Grill and Bar at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel(also within walking distance). The staff was very friendly and helpful whenever we had questions or needed assistance. I recommend the Aqua Aloha Surf and would definitely stay at this facility again.","Baltimore, Maryland",7,4.0

A large comfortable bed, a nice sofa and big TV and a clean although rather small bathroom. Breakfast was rather underwhelming.

This place is a short walk to everything good, so location is ticked for those that have not been there. This is my third stay at the Aqua Aloha Surf. I like the place. It's older and has a comfortable feel about it. The check in staff are happy to see you, but don't jump the counter. When I checked out, the lady was pretty cold, but I wasn't after a hug. It's not the five star joint where they pretend we are family. I have some complaints on this trip that I'm not happy about. I did the 15th floor for three nights. Construction drilling at 8.30am on two of the mornings removed my relaxation and I was annoyed by it. Very loud drilling. I did call the counter to be informed by an indifferent male that construction would be from 8am to 4pm. I personally think they should do the loud stuff after 10am. The first day my shower water pressure didn't work and I couldn't shower. Annoying. I liked the cagey house keeper. She asks you if you want your room turned over. This is in the hope you decline. Not normal for hotels. She does it in a nice way. But read between the lines on that work ethic. And made the room up to an outstanding standard when asked to do it. So this trip Aqua Aloha Surf you only get a three star from me. In my two priors it would have been a five if I had rated. Don't be discouraged by my comments.

It's like they threw a bunch of random Hawaiian-themed words together into something they though sounded good. Day 1 - we land at the airport and I call the hotel to ask (politely) if they have airport shuttle service. I was told they only offer service TO the airport and do not pick up. When I repeated this to the person on the phone to make sure I heard him correctly and he responded with ""yes, that's what I just advised you."" So we had to pay $15 each to a shuttle company to take us to the hotel. Something we didn't budget for. We get to the hotel and are told our room won't be ready for an hour, that we could stash our stuff, find some lunch and come back later. I was ""hangry"" at that point so that just wasn't acceptable to me. I muttered under my breath (loud enough for the girl at the desk (Fanny) to hear me that I was going to note that in my review on Trip Advisor. Miraculously, our room was instantly ready. Or should I Say our hole. It was clean, I will give it that- the first thing I do when I go to any hotel, doesn't matter how top notch, is check for mold, excessive dust, etc. Surprisingly I didn't find any in the obvious spots like the bathroom and refrigerator. The carpet is wearing thin, but no holes or anything noticeable. Then I started noticing little things like the tear in the wallpaper on one side of the bed, the chips in the paint in various spots around the bathroom, heavy rust on the A/C unit outside and filth underneath of it on the inside. There was also a random chair in the corner that was heavily stained with what looked like coffee. In the bathroom, the silver ring around the ceiling light above the tub/toilet is rusted and the towel bar is coming loose from the wall. The top of the safe in the closet is also mysteriously rusted when it's not exposed to the elements.I wanted to go relax in the pool after a long day of travel, but there was a notice posted that it would be closed each day until 4pm and be open until 10pm on certain days and normal openings on weekends. (this was Tuesday) due to construction on the outside of the building, but guests were welcome to use the pool around the block at their sister property the Aqua Bamboo by obtaining a pass at the front desk. Day 2 - we come downstairs for breakfast and the first thing I notice are various wild birds and pigeons hopping in and out of the room, and their ""remnants"" spattered on the floor. The attendant I'm not sure spoke English very well. She was barely able to get out ""Good morning."" Another guest walked in behind us and walked past her. She made some sort of noise to get the girl's attention and pointed to the little punch cards we were given for daily breakfast vouchers. She didn't speak English well enough to say ""excuse me, do you have your ticket?"" The guest is a far better person than I would be because I don't respond to grunts and gestures. It was extremely humid and the front part of the breakfast area was in sort of an open air area adjacent to the pool. On the coffee/juice station table, there was a juice dispenser that was some kind of sugary Koolaid style fruit punch. No fresh fruit juices. Next to that was a tray of bread next to a conveyor belt toaster and two big bowls of spreads - butter and cream cheese. Dairy products sitting out in the heat? Yeah that's safe. Walk into the next room that had permanent buffet stations set up. Again, no fresh fruit, bacon or anything a typical hotel continental breakfast would be. Now I understand there's a very large population of Asian tourists that come and expect their traditional foods, but have options for other guests as well. Not just unidentifiable items that smell worse than a wet diaper. Once breakfast is over, the place does convert to an Asian buffet restaurant supposedly. There was a selection of Hostess donuts out near the Koolaid dispenser and their flavor varied each day between chocolate, coconut and white powder and the bread changed every other day for toast from white to wheat. There were also random exercise equipment pieces sitting outside just randomly there.(expensive-looking equipment) I walked up to the front desk to ask about the nail salon that's in the corner and if I needed to make an appointment. I instantly recognized the voice as the condescending jerk that answered my call about the airport shuttle. I glanced at his nametag, but could not get a clear reading of it. It was something Hawaiian anyway - started with a K - heavy guy with spiky brown hair. I simply asked if I had to make an appointment and all he said was ""they're closed right now"" (well yes I can see that, the room is dark) and ""we don't take her appointments"" (well I didn't figure you did, I just asked a simple question). The neighborhood itself is sort of a slum. No problems, just unsightly. Fast forward ahead to our last day. We awoke to find the railing of our balcony wrapped with DANGER tape and a chunk missing out of the edge of it. It would have been nice to be notified ahead of time that this would be happening. The shuttle picked us up to take us to the airport. He crammed as many people in that van as he could get, it was like being in a clown car! We weren't told ahead of time there would be a cost (so we could budget ahead), until my husband asked how much. We were told $28. Neither of us had enough cash so we asked if he could take a card. He responded with a heavy sigh and eye roll and ""give me the card."" I will NEVER stay here again and never recommend this to anyone else. We stayed here through a travel company and they have been notified as well.","Salisbury, Maryland",10,2.0

Reception / staff We were surprised about the lack of hospitality from staff, right from the moment we arrived. Interactions with staff were cursory, verging on rude, and I don’t think a single one cracked a smile. Ever. Rooms The rooms are dated. On seeing the decor, my partner and I played a game - ‘when was this hotel last decorated?’. I said the 80s. She said early 90s. I think she was being generous. This hotel is shabby. There were holes in walls that had been patched and not repainted. The floor lamp - the main source of light in our room - was literally held together with blu-tak (see photo for evidence). It is the kind of place where you want to check the soft furnishings for bedbugs - we did. There weren’t any - it was clean enough. In fact the bed was very comfortable. Location Three blocks from the beach - a short walk, which is great. However the block that the hotel is in, that third block from the beach, is poorly-lit and dingy. I wouldn’t feel safe walking that final block alone at night. Breakfast Actually a joke. Like, seriously seriously bad. Bain maries of cold eggs, spam and a selection of asian dishes (noodles, vegetables etc). My partner thought she’d try a boiled egg - can’t go too wrong with that, right? Nope, there was a dead bug floating in amongst the eggs. There was bread and a toaster, with margarine but no other spreads on offer (one table nearby had brought their own jar of peanut butter to breakfast with them). Little pancakes (also cold) and one type of cereal - sugar coated. Avoid. Value This is the kind of place that should cost $50 a night. While the location is okay, for a relatively small investment you could stay somewhere much, much nicer. Overall verdict Avoid... unless you’re desperate.","Melbourne, Australia",15,2.0

As I've found with other properties in the Aqua chain, the rooms tend to be a bit dated and/or worn (but clean). What they do offer is a central Waikiki location at a bargain rate. The parking lot is small and fills up quickly. When I finished work for the day, I snagged a parking space and walked to my dinner destination. Drive out in the evening and the lot might be full when you return. Fortunately, there's loads of great dining within walking distance. They gave me a video rental card upon check in. A nice gesture I was too tired to bother with at the end of the day. As others have mentioned, the complimentary breakfast was not very good. I wish I hadn't bothered. FYI...it's in a Chinese restaurant hence some of the odd offerings. They would be better served doing a few items well rather than offering lots of items done poorly. The elevators were so slow, I gave up and used the stairs. Unfortunately, my stay coincided with a big Samoan sporting event. (Probably had something to do with the slow elevators.)

Breakfast - Nice selection of pancakes, toast, eggs, sausages, cakes, rice & noodles. Reception staff - Very helpful. We booked a superior room but the 1st room we got really wasn't up to standard (small, no view, no bath) but they moved us to a higher floor which was great.DVDs - They give you a card for free DVD rentals in the lobby which was a sweet touch. CONS:Car park - Charged $25 a night for this but often found there was no space due to work trucks. Didn't think it was right that they parked in the handicapped bay either. Building work - Extremely noisy building work on the hotel between 8am-4pm, Mon-Fri made it impossible to ever sleep in or spend much time in the room. Our travel agent didn't tell us about this & neither did the hotel staff until we asked. Safety - We only found out when checking out that we weren't meant to go on our balcony because they were all unstable (hence the building work).

Our room had a strange smell like that of tobacco. We wanted to use the safe for our valuables but when we opened it there was mouldy ginger. Yes, you read that right mouldy ginger. We reported this to reception at the same time we had to get our key reprogrammed as it had stopped working. At the time of reporting this, a young and obviously distressed woman walked into reception shouting at no one. While the receptionist assured us he would send someone to our room to remove the mouldy ginger, he turned to us and said, “don't worry about her she's schizophrenic and lives in the building”. Clearly sympathetic of those with mental health problems. He turned to his colleague and asked him to “call the cops”, perhaps some way of reassuring us.The breakfast was the strangest I'd ever seen. Chicken chow mein, cabbage and kidney beans was part of the selection. There were pancakes, some cereals and porridge oats floating in milk as well as the standard tea and coffee in polystyrene cups. It was nice to be visited by the resident pigeon during our first morning.Despite asking reception three times to remove the ginger, it was never removed. We simply closed and locked the safe to avoid the smell. The hotel is in a good location, however, the noise is very bad which I guess is to be expected. You have to choose between the racket of the old air conditioning unit or outside. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for light sleepers.All in all, this hotel is recommended to those with a good sense of humour. If this would cause you stress (as it did to a family member we were travelling with) then this is not the hotel for you. This is clearly a budget hotel and therefore expectations must remain low.

The staff were lovely and very helpful. We arrived early in the morning (8am) from the airport and were able to store our bags in the storeroom until our room was ready - which the staff arranged to be earlier than the expected 2pm! We took advantage of the international date line 'do-over day' and went to Ala Moana shopping centre to pass away the morning. Staff explained local buses and shuttle options.The first room we were allocated was an ok size, had a decent bathroom, windows that opened, A/C...etc. There was a bit of a problem with the A/C after the first night. I spoke the staff and they simply asked me to pack up all our gear and they would move us to a different room, while we were out for the day. So so helpful. The next room we got was brilliant. Bigger, quieter A/C, balcony, ensuite...etc. Felt very grateful that the staff sorted out the issue so promptly, and without any fuss.Breakfast and WIFI (in the room and in the public hotel spaces) was all included in the price. The breakfast wasn't too fancy, but there was the usual toast, cereal, eggs and coffee (plus many Asian inspired dishes as well). This hotel also had a private pool, and a small outdoor gym area.Location-wise, this hotel is closer to the canal than the beach - but its only a short 5 minute walk to Waikiki Beach (about 2 blocks), and all that shopping/eating that happens in the Waikiki ""hub"". In fact, I could argue that it was better to be a little away from all the busy hustle and bustle of the main very touristy Waikiki Beach strip!!!It was pretty quiet location - even on the balcony - and certainly in the hotel, you couldn't hear your neighbours, or the lifts going..etc. I think there was one night where you could hear some people larking about in the street (but it was New Years Eve - so that is only to be expected!).There were a fair few amenities close by as well - a Food Pantry (grocery store), Alamo car rental place, fast food and other restaurants..as well as the obligatory ABC shops! So I would have to say the location, while not right on the beach, was really great.Overall, this hotel is not bright and shiny/ brand new - but it is very comfortable, well-appointed, good facilities and great staff. I would stay here again.","Wollongong, Australia",26,4.0

However you need to expect the following, if you check in earlier there are no facilities. Facilities such as pay for an early check in, or as I doubt the hotel was 100% full there must be an empty room somewhere, so we waited for 3 hours to check in. After a 10 hour (no sleep flight due to turbulence) we tried to cope by resting by the pool. I tried to make use of this time by asking for the Pearl Harbour tickets I had booked directly with the hotel, I had called directly to make the reservation so would assume that they would put me on to THEIR concierge. When I learned that the tickets were not there and they tied to tell me that I had not made the reservation, I thought lucky I had brought the contact numbers with me, it turns out the concierge I had been forwarded on to was at a completely different hotel? How does that happen? Also the concierge at this hotel was not helpful at all in helping me beyond loaning me the phone. So with this disappointment I noticed during our wait I counted the growing number of people also in our situation (24) all with their luggage in the lobby. I had assumed (incorrectly) that the reservation clerk would serve us first (first arrival etc) when our room became available but as I listened to the multiple complaints of fellow travellers - just knew there was no chance. I also note with interest the exercise equipment that was outside and rusted (not sure if there was a room elsewhere) When we finally got to our room, it was on the second floor that overlooked the filthy roof of the lobby entrance. My first concern was security - the windows are louvered (the kind that can be easily removed and there weren't winders on all the windows so could not shut one of the windows). The room itself smelled bad, and the hotel safe was a remnant of the 60's - keyed and rusty. We were so tired we tried to sleep straight away (beds looked clean) but woke up 2 hours later due to the noise. The traffic is so noisy, so if you aren't a fan you might want to consider this. We also woke up with the heat, so tried to get the air conditioner going (note I said tried). The final straw for us was, a group of very loud party of women returning home at 11pm who were booked next door to us and kept up the chatter and laughter. So I made the decision to walk to the Hilton Garden View in the next street for availability. Upon check out the lady at reception wanted to know why we were cancelling. She said we should have complained about the noise and she would send security to check on it. It was interesting to note that the whole time we spent moving hotels, the security guard had not move from his spot. I was charged for the use of the room (fair enough we had used it ) but I can tell you the change to the Hilton Garden View was SO MUCH WORTH IT!. They were so friendlier, nicer and put us in a quiet spot and when I explained the mess with the Pearl Harbour tickets, they contacted Roberts Hawaii Tours and straightened it all out.",Gold Coast,5,1.0

This said, the in room amenities were good, clean and everything worked as expected. The beds were comfortable. Breakfast is provided by a Chinese family possibly subcontracted by the hotel, and caters for Chinese and Polynesian guests rather than Europeans. There are 2 cereals: Cornflakes and Cherios. The milk for it is so diluted, you can see through it. The coffee was good, though, so was the scrambled eggs.There are no crusty breadrolls, just sliced bread for toast. If you like cold sliced meats or cheese, jam or honey, you will be disappointed.

Everything about the hotel: decor, furnishing, bathroom and shower, lifts, foyer is 1970s - don't expect the niceties of a Shangri-La. Having stated this, the staff work hard to keep the place tidy. Other things I disliked about the hotel were: 1) The beds - they sink in and are really uncomfortable. I stayed 10 nights and upgraded rooms (to a superior) half way; the beds were terrible in both rooms. I had back pains in the night and couldn't get a good night sleep. 2) The breakfast wasn't very nice, oily noodles, soggy eggs, etc. The breakfast choice doesn't change, so after a few mornings, it becomes very tedious. 3) The pool is more like a big bath tub, not even children bother to use it. Not sure why it's there to be honest. The hotel is well located, 3mins walk from Waikiki beach and close to a main bus route from which you can get access to busses to all over the island (although it's better to have access to car).

We were sent back to our rooms with no explanation just hopes and dreams that there was no threat. That was comforting..(not). I asked reception to check with housekeeping for an item we had that seemed to vanish and there was absolutely no follow up.

Unable to book it this year we decided to choose this hotel as we know the area and that it's 10 minutes walk from the beach and central to all amenities in Waikki. We arrived at 10.30pm after traveling 25 hours to a warm reception from the receptionist and an ungrade as we were staying 20 nights. The lobby was very welcoming and nicely decorated.Our room was freshly decorated and very clean. Our lay/balcony had lovely sea views and city view as we were 15 floors up. During our stay I found the staff busy and very pleasant maintaining the apartments and always happy to help. You can borrow towels/chairs/ swimming equipment from reception which was a great bonus. We were able to rent out films for free if we decided to have a night in. The managers special was his own cocktail and lovely Hawaiian music, very informal which we liked. The laundry service was a blessing as we were staying so long, $2.25 for a was and a dollar to dry,you share the two machines with the residents so up early is advisable. My only three complaints,two of which the hotel can do nothing about is that the road is very noisy,it's a two way road and you also have the traffic along the canal,even up at 15 floors we could hear everything. The hotel across the road has a bar that's open till 3am and as there are no window you can hear everything. Not music,just very load talking! The last one is the breakfast, it's different. A selection of pancakes/ bread/cakes/ spiced onions/fried rice/chow mien/ porridge. I'm a boring eater so toast and porridge suited me for a while but a bit of rotation would be good and also food labelled as I'm a vegetarian and had no idea what some of the food was. Toward the end of the holiday we tended to eat out for breakfast,maybe because we had stayed so long it just got boring and if we went down at 8.30 it seemed to be the leftovers and the stale bread not replenished etc!!

We had a room with a single bed and double bed.The hotel location is great, just a couple of blocks from the main Waikiki beach. There is a Food Pantry grocery store that had everything we needed (PS I don't recommend buying any of the pre-cooked whole chickens because they tended to be way overcooked, dry and tasteless)The hotel has a free shuttle service that takes you from the hotel to various destinations in and around Waikiki which we used often.For other travel, we used the city buses which take you almost anywhere on the island you want to go. The hotel staff were great giving advice on how to get to various locations on the island.You have to be aware that you will pay $18 per day ""resort fee"" which covers daily newspapers, video rentals, beach towels, and the breakfast. Its not over the top, but after we booked the package, the hotel raised the cost of this. Truth be told, a majority of this cost covers the breakfast, which was pricey given the food offered was at the lower end of quality and selection. It caters more to an oriental clientele.

Not just a little loud, but RIDICULOUSLY loud. Even on the 8th floor - we were woken up nightly by the sounds of cars, police sirens, arguing drunks - blaring music from the parking lot next door. Buying ear plus did not help. It's not a safe spot to walk late at night, many transients. The parking fee is $25 PER DAY, the 'resort' fee is $18, which I think is excessive for this hotel. For the added resort fees you are paying, this breakfast should be a LOT better. You are better off grabbing packaged foods at ABC or walking a block to a restaurant. Some of this is kinda typical of downtown Waikiki, other things like the security / noise could be addressed by the resort.

My room was small, bed pretty small but at least there was a fridge and coffee maker. They actually give you a free DVD card to rent DVDs, free continental breakfast (don't remember any other Aqua offering this), and towel cards. There is a tiny pool and a ""gym"" area with 2 machines and one was broken. Lobby is open air and just about the ""nicest"" part of the hotel. There is coffee in lobby that looks like it was there all day and there is even a shuttle that goes to Ala Moana shopping mall (picks up at other Aqua Properties).Some of the clients complained that the rooms were too small but hey, they got their rooms for free. Since I was by myself it was fine and a last minute booking for peak January it was ok. The windows aren't sound proof so you can definitely hear noise if you are not on the quiet side.

Multiple grocery stores and fast food joints are also within 5 minutes of walking. There is an additional and mandatory resort fee of $15 per night which gives you access to WiFi, DVD rentals, coffee, pool, pool/beach towels and other amenities. I find this fee unnecessary and it could very well be in the room price itself. Unfortunately this seems to be common practice among Hawaii hotels to distract customers.WiFi worked fine. Gym consisted of a treading mill and 2 other equipment and was quite disappointing. Coffee at the lobby was great to take to room when passing by. Beach towels exchange was a great and easy service.The lobby area looked fine and the staff were friendly and spoke understandable English to a non-native speaker.Room rating 3/5:We stayed at the superior room on 7th floor. Room looked a bit old and worn down but was mostly clean. It was spacious enough but was missing any chairs or sofa to relax and sit on. Also no tables to eat or write on. Windows were louvre style and provided absolutely no noise insulation from the street traffic below. Pack your ear plugs if you want a peaceful sleep. The double bed mattress had gotten noticeably softer on the other side.Bathroom was ok but the shower area had a bit rusty appearance. The shower was in a bath tub. The tub was so rusty and dirty looking that you didn't really want to bath in it. The shower head was way too low for a tall person (+180cm) to have a comfortable shower. The balcony had a nice view to the canal and city. There was also a microwave, coffee maker, TV and decent side refrigerator provided, which was nice. Housekeeping kept the room clean and tidy.Breakfast 1/5:Worst breakfast buffet I have ever eaten. It seemed more like a cheap Chinese lunch than the continental breakfast advertised. No bacon, no proper bread, no ham, no cheese... One type of juice was provided each day and tasted very watery and fake. The pancakes were ok.The breakfast area looked dull and smelled weird. Lady at the front checking breakfast passes looked grumpy all the time and didn't speak English very well. Utensils and plates had to be checked every time for dirty spots. You had to carry your own dishes to a messy collection cart. Serving tables were all over the place and caused people to walk back and forth the area and try not bump to each other.",,2,3.0

The place is clean and you get maid service every day. It also includes a breakfast each day.

There was a microwave, fridge and tv. The breakfast was very basic and something that I would not pay for if not included .

What brings me back is the price and only the price. I find that most hotel rooms in Waikiki are pretty much the same, the only main variance is the price and that mainly being dictated by the distance to the beach. A shower is a shower, a bed is a bed. Price doesn't guarantee mattress age or quality. I have been in a lot of hotels and a room is a room. You have to ask yourself what your needs are and how much you are willing to pay to have them met. Like airlines, hotels create an artificial value system based on very little. Ocean views? How long will you spend looking at those? Just go to the beach. Closeness to the beach? Most are a short walk from the beach. A taxi ride to and from the beach will probably cost you $20 a day. Compare that to your room price.Aqua Aloha Surf is great value for money. There is a free courtesy bus, which used judiciously can get you within a short walk of most places. It runs a loop around Waikiki and out to Ala Moana Shopping Center. The loop takes approximately 30 mins. Tip the driver $1 or more per passenger every trip and he will probably drop you off just about anywhere along the route. The free breakfast buffet is not bad but not great. It consists mainly of toast, pancakes, eggs (boiled and scrambled), spam, sausages, noodles, cupcakes, oranges, apples, coffee, etc. Everything is made on the cheap. My best advice is bring spreads for your toast as there is none. Bring milk as the milk supplied is powdered and watery. The syrup for the pancakes is watery also. Share what you bring with those around you and you will have friends for life. The free bus will drop and pick you up from Walmart or Don Quijote to get groceries on the cheap. PLEASE NOTE.....the buffet is well timed by the hotel to have only a few guests, being 7-9am. This is important because if you are using tour buses to do a ""circle island tour"", ""Pearl Harbour tour"", trip to Kualoa Ranch, etc they all leave prior to 7am. The hotel knows this! So no free breakfast for you.The most annoying part of this hotel is the loudness of the door locking mechanisms when closing. A minor irritation during the day can be very sleep disruptive at night for lighter sleepers. My room was adjacent the fire exit (902) with a smoker in the room next door that kept on popping out all night for a quick fix. Bang, bang, bang all night long.The hotel is reasonably maintained and everything is fresh and clean. The staff are average, not excessively rude but not attentive to service either. This hotel is average all the way with a cheap price. To get a cheaper price search with a third party provider, get their price then ring up the hotel and ask for a cheaper price if you go directly through the hotel. The hotel has to pay the third party provider a percentage so often you will get a discount and the hotel will actually make a larger profit.To get top class service as you do sometimes at the pricier hotels just tip the staff. Treat them well and they will do the same. Learn their names. A small amount of kindness and a little money will see you treated like royalty and cost you less than a more expensive hotel overall.",,30,4.0

Front desk staff was helpful and always had tips for us to help us get around. The Aqua Resorts shuttle bus app was very helpful. We were on the 8th. floor and had a great view off our balcony. Honolulu is a busy city and you should be prepared for traffic and emergency vehicle noise 24/7. This Hotel is older and has the old school louvred glass windows, so there is no sound proofing but we were usually so tired it didn't matter. Wifi was good and worked through out the Hotel. The breakfast buffet was the only disappointment during our stay. I realize that there are a lot of Asian folks on holidays but, the buffet could probably do better catering to the North American style of breakfast and spend a little extra to use real butter for toast and pancakes instead of whatever that yellow goo is that has no flavour and basically makes everything soggy and gross. Other reviewers have mentioned the food and I thought maybe they were exaggerating but, they weren't. We sat with many different people and all had the same complaint. Bacon and real butter would immediately improve the breakfast buffet. Under cooked ham and cocktail wieners are no substitute for bacon. Parking is at a premium so be prepared to pay $25 per day or take your chances trying to find street parking.

We did however end up with a double bed for the first night (think this was due to the tour company not the hotel) they couldn't give us another room that night however they assured us they could give us a new room on the Sunday. We did choose to upgrade which I would recommend for $10 dollars a night it was well worth it we ended up with a balcony and a sofa (a much bigger room) They also moved all or stuff for us when the room was ready. This just advise you to keep your cases packed . Be aware you do pay $18 a night fee for the hotel however included in this is breakfast every morning ( this is in the Chinese on the side of the hotel so don't be alarmed with the egg fried rice, however there was a number of other stuff that was more than edible), free beach towels that you can change every day, free unlimited tea and coffee in you room ( none of this cheap instant stuff, it was lovely fresh perculater coffee which was a nice change compare to what you receive when traveling Europe) The cleaners done a wonderful job and the room was left spotless every day, I also left comfortable enough to not put stuff in the safe every day (mainly as I forgot) but everything was left as we placed it. All rooms seemed to have air con which is not extra, we didn't really use ours as it can be loud, we just chose to sleep with balcony door open a little ( the street outside can be noisy at certain times ) but we where on the 15th floor so wasn't too bad. We spent one day in the hotel and left just as the cleaners where at the end of their shift and offered to clean our room then for us. We declined but I thought this we just that little bit extra you look for when staying in a hotel. The pool is small and sun loungers limited. However you can't go to Waikiki and spend your whole time by the hotel pool. I would recommend going to the beach , but the pool is ideal for just an afternoon chilling out. The hotel bar is great. Beer is cheaper than in any of the restaurants you eat at. The staff where very friendly and more than helpful. It has a small smoking area outside that you can sit in and watch tv if you wish.

Less than 2 blocks from the beach, around the corner to most public bus stops, easy walk to Ala Moana shops, Kapiolani Park etc (must enjoy walking though). As with the majority of hotels you also pay a resort tax which funds a free shuttle to the Ala Moana centre, free in room and Waikiki wifi, free DVD rental (not a great choice) and breakfast. The breakfast times are strict so I didn't eat it a few days that I had to get up early and there was no breakfast -to-go option even though you paid the tax. Breakfast is adequate but definitely geared towards the Asian market. Every Tuesday @ 4.30 the manager supplies free cocktails to guests and there is musical entertainment.

We were greeted like friends by Nicole on our arrival, and that set a tone that lasted throughout our stay at the hotel. The cleaning staff are so nice, and did an amazing job every day. Our room always looked so nice when we returned from our day. We were given the option of a 6th or 14th floor room and we took the 14th floor. This was a good decision - all the rooms are great, but not all the veiws are million-dollar views. On the back side, if you are lower than the 10th floor, you may not have the best view. It will be mostly buildings. Higher up though and you can see the mountains, the Ala Wai Canal, the golf course and in some units you even get a peek at the ocean. The room is huge (by our standards), and nicely decorated - felt like the perfect Hawaiian atmosphere. Waking up every day with the windows/doors open is a treat (from Canada - gets a bit cool at night). Televisions in the room are big, but in our view unnecessary as we rarely returned before 10:00pm, and for some reason television in the States is terrible. Mostly all commercials and angry commentators. Now, on to the breakfast buffet. This is the weak spot, unless you have a good sense of humour and then it is pretty darn cute and funny. We tried it our first day knowing the reviews from others were not glowing. Have to say, the reviews on the buffet are spot on. The toast is good, though. The buffet has a huge selection, and we give props to the hotel for being ambitious, but our suggestion is to dial down the options and maybe focus on fewer items done a bit better. But, as mentioned, even an amazing buffet would only have been used by us once or twice - there are so many options in Hawaii, not the least is the fresh, local tropical fruit like pineapples, papayas, avocados, ..... Overall, an enjoyable stay and a great hotel to make your home base in Waikiki.","Vancouver, BC",29,4.0

The value of good employees and human customer service to a business can never be underestimated.We arrived quite late in the evening to the horror of realising that our reservation had not been registered by the hotel. I am not the one to say if it was otel.com or the hotel who had made a mistake, but it really doesn't matter much since ultimately the hotel has chose otel.com as a service provider. It took the reception and otel.com more than an hour to solve the issue and part of the problem was that both parties refused to spend money calling the other part and required to fix the problem via fax (this is 2016)...We got room 205 and that part of the hotel has sort of moist slightly moldy smell to it. Not too bad, but clearly noticeable. Room was quite small but that was expected as this hotel after all is a budget option in Waikiki. Bed was sold as a double bed, but I must say it was good fortune that both of us are relatively slim and we are pretty comfortable in intimate situations. Bet was small (maybe 120cm). All this was acceptable but the room is located just above a generator set, main air condition unit or something similar noisy. The first night was unbearable with a constant noise and hardly no sleep. Next morning we zombied down to the reception asking the receptionist to change room. It took him 15 sec to review the situation before offering us room 609 (surely a free upgrade) and our remainder of the stay was flawless.Big thank you to Vinh - you saved our vacation and this TripAdvisor review.

It also provided complimentary breakfast, which is hard to come by. We were greeted pleasantly by the staff and had no negative interactions with them during our week long stay. Upon check-in we informed them about the reason for the trip: birthday/ 10th anniversary, so they upgraded our room. And while it was an adequate room with microwave and fridge, it was nothing special. Bed was comfortable, view was pretty good, but at night it was quite noisy and both my wife and I occasionally woke up. This was easily solved by having the A/C fan run at night. We only ate breakfast 4 times because we were busy doing sunrise hikes on the other days. Breakfast is definitely catered to an Asian population: kimchi, fried rice and noodles, but there were other things, scrambled eggs, pancakes, orange slices, coffee cake and coconut doughnuts. The quality of food was fair: eggs were pretty runny and there was an odd flavor on the rice and noodles, but mix pancakes were...well...pancakes from a mix and tasted as such. We didn't use their pool or gym, which were not extravagant by any means. Hotel parking is $25/day, but street parking on Ala Wai Blvd is free (hit or miss), or there is paid parking next to the hotel for $15/$18 from 5pm-7am on weekday/weekends (had no trouble with availability). After paying for hotel parking 1 day we figured out the other options (wish staff had told us about those options). The hotel is conveniently located to shopping, grocery store (which we used for many of our meals), restaurants and the beach. We were able to get beach towels each day, use wi-fi and checked out some movies for free (part of resort fees). I won't go too much into the rooms, as there are plenty of other reviews. Yes the rooms are outdated and could use some extra cleaning, but we didn't go to Hawaii to spend a lot of time in our room. We used the room to sleep in and once we figured out how to solve the noise problem, we were able to get decent sleep on the beds, which were pretty comfortable.Pro: cheap rooms, free breakfast, free wifi, decent views, location to beach/shoppingCons: quality of food, street noise, outdated rooms","Portland, Oregon",19,3.0

My wife booked 3 nights at the Aqua Aloha Surf in error thinking she was booking the Aston Wakiki (a hotel we've stayed at during a previous visit and had a WONDERFUL experience). BIG MISTAKE! Upon noticing the mistake, it was too late to cancel the reservation without penalty so we proceeded to check in. Tripadvisor presented some favorable reviews so we thought this may not be so bad... I WAS WRONG!Upon entering our room, we immediately noticed how dated and small the room was. But the ULTIMATE turn off was not the paint peeling from the dressers, rusted spacesavers in the bathroom or even the accumulated mildew on the bathroom fixtures... it was the potential hepatitis the poor housekeeping exposed my family and I to with the DRIED UP BLOOD i found on one of the dressers!!!Upon bringing the matter to the managers (Julian Martinez) attention, they promptly changed my room. However, this already set the tone for the unpleasant experience. The new room included all of the amenities of the previous room: the rusted and soap scum/mildew infested bathroom, stained couch pillows, etc. However, thankfully, I didn't notice any blood in this room.Given the horrific experience of night 1, I was under the impression that management would at least offer to discount the first night, provide a complimentary room upgrade, SOMETHING! But no... that didn't happen. My wife and I spent the entire night browsing for affordable lodging elsewhere for the duration of our trip. The next day we woke up to having a TERRIBLE breakfast at the hotel. This put the icing on the cake for our decision to end our stay there prematurely.

It was a great rate for an affordable stay in Waikiki and I felt that it delivered great value even for that low rate. The staff is terrific in an quiet way; they upgraded me to the next level room without even asking. I enjoyed a king bed room with lanai and city views. The room itself is basic but was everything I needed. The bed was comfortable and I enjoyed the views from my corner location. The air conditioning worked and there was coffee maker and minifridge. They provide free wifi, complimentary beach chair and towel, and free dvd (which I was too busy to use). They just don't nickel and dime you to death. I so greatly appreciated being allowed a late checkout which other hotels can be very stingy about. I felt they were always accommodating. I liked it so much that I brought my friends staying at another hotel by and they decided to switch to this hotel later in the week and also loved their stay.I am surprised at the negative reviews on the breakfast buffet. It was far better than most breakfasts provided at hotels especially in this price range. Sure, it is not the typical American or continental breakfast and it is geared to a more Asian market but the quality was very good. Their scrambled eggs were delicious and they had delicious sponge cake and she was making pancakes all the time. I enjoyed the fried rice with fried cabbage; it was all fresh and delicious. There was also sliced oranges.The lobby is a little worn and dated and it is not one of the swanky hotels on the beach but it was all fine and a great value for the price. There was some noise in the morning so those who are sensitive to that may want to ask for a rear location as some other reviews suggest. I loved my city corner views so the noise was worth it for me. It is only about 3 blocks walk to the beach and is very well located. The bus stop is about a block away and you can take the public bus to Hanauma Bay. Another tip for transportation: I found a shuttle bus company (8088412928) that was only $12.50 each way to the airport. They picked me up right at the hotel and is the lowest rate I could fine.

No partial refund was offered for the inconvenience of accommodating us in an inferior room.2. Ensuite had absolutely NO counter space to put cosmetics or shaving gear. Had to use toilet lid. 3. Noise from the street below was unbearable, even with doors and windows closed. 4. Our reason for selecting this hotel was the offer of continental breakfast. We needn't have held our breath - there was no jam or marmalade; only maple syrup because we were told: ""it's too expensive"", The dining room where we ate was a DISGRACE. In any other Western country such a building would be condemned, but alas, we sat in a room with ceiling only half there and bits of ceiling were hanging down. The walls had exposed framing and cables, but no plaster. A concertina divider supposedly hid all the junk (ladders, tools etc). behind it. At the conclusion of breakfast, we neatly stacked out plates on the table and got up to leave, when a female employee rushed over and ordered us to clean the table and scrape our leftovers into the uncovered plastic bin situated in the centre of the room. 5. Two doors provided access to this dining room (entry and exit). In the event we mistakenly used the wrong door, we were quickly reminded by a ""doorman"" in dark shades to go the other way. Pulling a towel taut in front of our faces, he barred us leaving the room. Not once did he speak or smile. 6. Staff at the front desk were friendly enough and obliging. 7. Day Two in the hotel: We asked for milk with our coffee and were directed to a separate room which was specifically allocated to Asian tourists. In that room, we found a vat of milk which we had to scoop out with a ladle! 8. Would NEVER, EVER go there again and would recommend that people avoid this hotel.

It is a nice clean place. The furniture is a bit outdated and the kitchen does serve food mainly geared for Asian customers. I guess its enough to start off your day. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was kept very clean and fresh towels etc was provided as and when requested. My flight came in at 8am in the morning and the staff were able to accommodate an early check-in for me which was really great as I had my 15 month old. The pool is small (and deep at one end 8ft) but the walk to the beach isn't that far. you get towels and beach chair from the front desk. They even let my kid borrow a boogie board without asking which was great. yes early morning trucks do make some noise but I was so tired from the swimming and exploring to really be bothered by the noise.

But when we arrived, it was two single beds and one sofa bed. Three adults can in no way fit on two single beds that were not even joined. • The sofa bed was terrible, could feel every spring in it. When we informed staff they gave us another wheel in bed but that was just as bad. They made no attempts to relocate us to a different room. Thought this was unfair as we all paid equal amounts and so all deserve a proper decent bed to sleep in.• We decided then to put the mattress on the floor and take turns sleeping on it, and even though room service saw our mattress on the floor they made no attempts to rectify this, a simple sorry would have gone a long way.• One light in the room was missing, which meant we had to rely on the bathroom light for one half of the room• They never left enough toilet paper for us, so for those 10 nights we asked for toilet paper every day. Wouldn’t be the worst idea to leave a stock of them in the bathroom though.• Room service meant doing the beds and literally nothing else. The shower and toilet wasn’t cleaned once for those ten nights.• The room had no salt, pepper, sugar, tea or milk. Only one sachet of coffee was provided for 10 days. No kettle or toaster either.• Some curtains wouldn’t work and that meant we could only close half of the window, so we always had light streaming into our room at night. Not good!• At breakfast time, we were meant to present the breakfast lady with our breakfast cards, after a few days I forgot mine and though she recognised me she wouldn’t let me have any food unless and until I went upstairs and got my card which she would just scribble on. It was embarrassing being denied food, considering she had seen me every day for the past 5 days and knew I had a breakfast card. Not like she was keeping count or making a record of anything.• Also during breakfast there were a bunch of rules: “Only two eggs per person”. No jam or honey was provided either and it was the same breakfast all 10 days. • They said they had a gym but there were a grand total of 3 machines and 2 of which were incredibly rusted and the treadmill was always covered and not accessible. We’re new to this country and paid a pretty decent amount for this accommodation, I don’t expect 5 star quality, but the general amenities would have been nice. The staff were helpful when we asked about tours and other activities and did give us some helpful advice. A big thank you to staff member Douglas who has amazing customer service.

Having been given a clip-card for a continental breakfast, we proceeded down to eat. Most of us were expecting to be welcomed to a selection of fresh fruits to be juiced as we chose. Instead we found porridge and American coffee with creamer powder or liquid. The pancakes were plain and maple syrup was offered as a topper. It seemed to be the most edible choice. There were also cocktail franks and very little else. If you have had croissants and fresh rolls with eggs and various sliced meats and cheeses in Europe, you would not call the breakfast continental, but American.The fruit doves and big pigeons and sparrows accompanied each other to the tables. They stole food if you left it momentarily, They walked on eating surfaces and left the general area unsightly.We only breakfasted there twice in five days and chose to go elsewhere.

It felt really homie, like I'm in paradise.Obviously, this isn't a high class, 5 star hotel, so I wasn't expecting that experience. But I felt like I received something close. I don't understand how this hotel gets low ratings. I loved it here. My only complaint is not necessarily for just the hotel, but for all of Hawaii. In Japan, we have bidets in all the bathrooms, but not having one here was a little inconveniencing.

The reception staff were always helpful when we wanted to make restaurant reservations or shuttle bookings. On the whole the hotel itself is okay, but nothing outstanding.- The reception area is nice and big and has free WIFI- Breakfast is included and it's a step up from a continental. You get two hard boiled eggs, toast, porridge, fruit, pancakes, donuts, sausages, and juice.- WIFI in your room is included in the resort fee they charge (which is extra on top of the nightly rate).- The rooms have pretty crappy windows (those ones that are made of multiple panels of glass and open like a set of blinds) so it can get pretty noisy at all times of the day/night.- The bed my partner and I slept on was pretty tiny (just a double not a queen or king). For some reason the other couples we were with all had larger beds than us.- The shower pressure is average.- The door between the room with the sink and the room with the shower/toilet was a fold out screen (a pretty poor excuse for a door).- Coffee is included in the resort fee but not tea, and there was no kettle in our room but we did have a fridge. They don't give you milk either, just creamer.- The room is actually really spacious and has a couch which is great!On the whole it was a nice stay.

After they found out that we were newly engaged, they sent up champagne and chocolates...that was a really unexpected treat. Breakfast was ok (pancakes, mini donuts, cake, muffins, 2 types of dry cereal, hot oatmeal, cocktail sausages, rice and boiled eggs, white/brown bread to make toast), nothing over the top but filled our hungry tummies in the morning. This was part of our holiday package otherwise I believe it was $6/day. There is a $15/day hospitality fee but this fee is at all hotels and some hotels were more.

The Hotel is tired and needs a makeover. Our room on the seventh floor was small with no overhead lighting and only two bedside lamps. The aircon unit which sits in the window cavity was noisy. There wasn't even a chair in the room. The breakfasts on offer (the same everyday) were disgusting consisting of boiled rice, hard boiled eggs kept warm in a metal warmer, mini sausages the size of my little finger, something that looked like a lumpy porridge, two cheap cereals but only very small bowls to pour it into, bread to toast but no jams or honey etc. Ended up having a boiled egg sandwich on toast. The best on offer were freshly made small pancakes and maple syrup. Oh and small slices of a cake and mini crunchy donuts (which I observed being emptied out of a packet.) The people who have the contract to supply these 'breakfasts' are seriously letting the Hotel down. After two mornings we gave this breakfast a miss and either bought fresh fruit or ate at the Food Pantry around the corner. Several other visitors were doing the same and commented about how disgusting the breakfasts were. You were even expected to and told to if you didn't scrape your scraps into a bin on a trolley and stack your plates and cutlery before leaving. What kind of Hotel asks its patrons to do this???? What a first! We observed 'the lady' following a departing family and TELLING them to 'go back and clear your table!' It wasn't even them who had left the 'so called mess.' The staff were polite and helpful and I'm sure they are aware of the dissatisfaction of guests re the breakfasts. These same people also had a buffet lunch and dinner on offer but we rarely saw anyone eating there. One couple did try it and said it was the worst meal they can remember. The best compliment I can offer is the location which is just two blocks (a five minute walk) from the beach and plenty of food outlets close by and an ABC Store a few minutes down the street. We discovered the restaurant at Hotel across the road and ate there four nights. Their food, wide menu choices, prices and service were excellent.

The balcony was comfortable and large with a great view of city or it could be canal on other side. Frig and m/w were most useful. TV was large and rotated for either bed (king) or sofa viewing. The hotel shares a parking lot with THE ONLY supermarket in Waikiki and the Food Pantry has a great bakery; thank you very much. They also provide beach chairs and towels so we spent lots of time on the main beach which is 2 blocks from hotel. They even provide umbrellas for the rainy days and we had several. You are an easy walk from several great restaurants including Moana Beach restaurant $$$$, Tanaka, and a wonderful noodle asian place. The breakfasts in house until 9 am are excellent i.e. oatmal and freshly made to order pancakes are great plus toast, fresh fruit and such. Not a complaint here. We were half block from a major bus stop and used it to go everywhere on island. We also booked a Roberts Circle Island tour on-line for $ 37 for eight hours!

Both rooms were in need of redecoration and the furniture was old and scuffed and not very good quality.

I got an email replied telling me how to go to the hotel but did not reply me with other information. I ended up brought a mini shampoo, soap, and conditioner with me. After reading all the reviews about this hotel, we felt that we should have chosen other hotel.The hotel was a bit old from the outside but it was ok for a budget hotel. The checked in time was fast as we arrived at night time. We two were given a room on the 3rd floor with two beds. We tried to request with two beds on a higher floor, but no twin beds were available on the higher floor except for one queen bed on the 9th floor (Standard room). We two took the 9th floor one. After we got the room, the room was not that small compared to what the reviews from other people. Actually, it was bigger if you compared with other budget hotels in Asian countries. We were actually in room 913, but it was not that bad that compared to one of the comment. The room was a bit old, but clean and quite quiet even though it was quite near the evaluator. The other two persons came on the next day, and upgraded to the deluxe room with extra fee. The room was much bigger with a sofa bed. (So, if you want a bigger room, pay a bit extra). Like other reviews said, the air conditioner in the standard room actually next to the bed, but I am ok with that. On the other hand, the air conditioner located far away from the bed in the deluxe room.The location is good, and it took less than 10 minutes walking to the Wakiki beach. There were McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Burger King within 7 minutes walking. Bus stop was about 2 minutes walking from the hotel. You can take bus from the airport if you have a hand carry luggage.There was a $15 fee resort fee charged for each day. It was said that the fee included the following; breakfast, beach towel, DVD rental, and shuttle bus to Ala Moana. The shuttle bus ran every 30 minutes, and it could hold up to 15 or 16 persons. Therefore, it would be better if you go there by bus. However, it actually took less time to arrive to your hotel compared to bus. We tried one departing at 9pm from Ala Moana to the hotel, and it was really fast and comfortable. (However, it was always full during day time).Regarding to the breakfast, like what other traveller’s comment, it was same every day. The breakfast included; pancake, rice, mini sausage, two boiled egg, porridge, cereal, sponge cake (not everyday, or when rice was ran out), one or two types of mini donut (roasted coconut, or chocolate), mini biscuit, white bread, sliced apple, sliced orange, coffee, tea, or a juice in red color (I have no idea what that is, but if Tim Clark, the manager can tell me here). The food could be warm if you went to eat after 7:30am. The porridge was watery on top; therefore, you need to mix it with the bottom first; however, I liked more watery. In my opinion, the breakfast was not bad that was mentioned from other post. I actually ate breakfast at the hotel everyday. I have been to another hotel in Portland, and the breakfast was only white bread, scramble egg, bacon, orange, apple, coffee, and tea. Therefore, as a budget hotel, the breakfast was considerate as good in my opinion, and I cannot complain about it. The only suggest I would say was that it would look nice to put a table clothes, and I think it would look good when picking the food. In addition, I suggest that put all the cutlery (Folk, spoon, and knife) outside instead of next to the pancake. It was convenience to hold the cutlery when I want to have a bowl of porridge, or a cup of coffee.On every Tuesday between 4:30pm to 5:30pm, there is a kind of small party in the lobby. A drink which was in blue color (I don’t know the name, but please tell me the name when you reply to this post), and some chocolates. It was quite fun.In conclusion, as a budget hotel, I think it provides a good value with good location. The staff were good and family, and I felt warm in staying at this hotel. We would actually to stay in this hotel if we go to Hawaii again.(I would also like to thanks Shane and Helen here as they were trying to help us to get two rooms that on the same floor)","Vancouver, Canada",4,5.0

No problem though as like many people - we wernt here for the room. Free WiFi was good fast and strong signal and a local corner shop is handy.Breakfast was a let down. It's a strange set up with a supervisor checking on everything you do. One time we didn't bring our ticket down and were sent back to the room to find it before we were allowed breakfast. I'm unsure why they just don't have a list of rooms/people for breakfast like in every other hotel. Breakfas is like a school canteen with a very limited range and plastic cups. You have to scrape your plates clean into a bin once finished. Very odd.The hotel itself though was generally good and worth it for the location. I would recommend to friends.

Breakfast is free for most bookings. We will continue to come back because we love this 15 story property and the staff is great. For the money we had a large, by Waikiki standards, room, a good sized bathroom, a refrigerator, micowave, and sink with plates and utensils. There is a kiosk for renting free DVD's. There is a player in each room. We saved money by going to the nearby grocery store many nights. The location is excellent. Right in the heart of Waikiki and about 4-6 minutes walking time to the beach. The pool is small. Seating is limited and the sun shines on the pool for a limited time due to the position of the pool to the nearby buildings so if you are a pool person get down early.To sum up, you get what you pay for. I always get a kick when people complain about this or that when comparing a property to one that is two to three times the cost per room.

The staff were friendly and helpful but my one main gripe was at breakfast time. The breakfast was minimal to say the least, and a member of staff would take your breakfast ticket as you arrived, to obviously make sure you weren't taking anything you weren't entitled to, but would then pretty much stay rooted to the spot almost spying on everyone to ensure they didn't go back for too many eggs or seconds!! I didn't feel at all relaxed during breakfast and the worst of it (and I am not a lazy person) was when I went to leave the breakfast table on my first morning, to be called back by this same member of staff and told to scrape my plate into a bin, and place my cutlery into one washing up bowl and my plate/dish into another!!

Our room also came equipped with a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. That being said, if you are looking for a hotel with a nice big pool, or jacuzzi/hot tub, sauna etc. then it's best to look elsewhere in Waikiki. At the same time the breakfast offered here isn't exactly a home run either, but at least it's something if you look at the other side of the coin. The strange part was that the hotels complimentary coffee in the lobby (near the elevator) was actually much better then what was served in the room with the breakfast.... Not sure if other reviewers noticed that? That aside though the hotel is also very close to Waikiki beach which was great! And you are pretty much walking distance to most attractions in Waikiki.

Closest stop to our hotel by the way is the Aqua Pacific Monarch Hotel (5-10 minute walk from the hotel). The other thing to note is that for each night you stay at the hotel you are charged a $15 (per night) hospitality fee.

I have to say we weren't fans of paying this fee as we don't feel we really got the return back in value, but if every hotel does it in Waikiki then I guess one doesn't have much of a choice. Just be aware when you check-out you'll need to be swiping the Credit Card (as for all other hotels in the Waikiki area).","Burlington, Canada",170,3.0

Firstly this place is cheap for Waikiki standards so don't turn up expecting 5 star, this is rated as a 2.5 star hotel. I stayed in the lead in moderate room which if you are just looking for a comfortable bed then this is fine, upgrade to the next room type if you want a little more space and a balcony. Location was fine only 10 minute walk to the beach. Lobby area was nice and open. The free breakfast actually had more choices then I expected, Ive stayed at other Aqua hotels and you only got half of what the Surf offered. There is a resort fee of US$15, this has become a standard across Hawaii with some places charging as much as $35 a night!

It's not the greatest hotel but it's not the worst either, especially for the location. The only reason I gave it four stars was not necessarily for the hotel itself, which could use a bit of updating. However they were renovating one of the elevators during our stay (the other was already completed) so one elevator for 15 floors and thousands of guests wasn't ideal. The room itself was a pretty decent size, we stayed in the superior room with the Lanai (balcony), it has a king bed and a sofa that has a pull out bed. It includes a refrigerator (kept things from spoiling but didn't keep things extremely cold), a microwave, coffee pot with coffee, plates, mugs and silverware. They had a small TV and a PS3 in the room where you could watch movies from the DVD rental box downstairs. Anyway, the four stars, you're two blocks from Waikiki beach. About a 15 minute walk from the zoo and aquarium and various shops/mall. Down the street from the hotel there is also a food pantry (grocery store) that also has a coffee bean and a delicious food place called Hi Steaks. There's an ABC store that is extremely handy (even though they have one on just about every corner). The hotel offers breakfast from 7-9 am. Which consists of pancakes, ham, white rice (soy sauce available), oranges, apples, two or three different types of cakes and donuts, and cereal (with powdered milk). They have tea, orange juice and coffee for drinks. The staff was nice even though upon arrival we had to wait about 15 minutes for someone to check us in even though there were three people behind the main desk. the six nights we were there, house keeping only serviced our room twice. Both days we were out most of the day until late evening. The other days it would be 2:30 or 3pm when we would get back and they would be cleaning the rooms next door, but not ours. We understood with 15 floors and thousands of rooms maybe one or two days but four days? At least when they knocked, they were friendly and asked if we needed anything. There is a laundry room in the parking garage/basement under the hotel. $1.25 for washer and another $1.25 for dryer, it honestly came in handy. The wifi was okay but not great, it got the job done.

The location is great for the price, it's walking distance to Waikiki beach. But the two elevators were extremely slow and one was then shut down for maintenance. It was inconvenient and we had to use the stairs more often than not because waiting for the one working elevator took too long. Also the one working elevator was small and stopped on every floor. The hotel offers a continental breakfast. It is mediocre at best. Not to mention a cockroach was crawling on table my group was sitting at durning breakfast. The beds were clean though other people in my group did not have clean beds and had to call to get new clean sheets. The shower had ants crawling in it too. The air conditioning did not work all that well and it leaked. The windows were not sound proofed and you could hear the sound from the street from the room.

However, I woke up with bug bites several days into our stay here. I gave it another night and woke up with even more bug bites which are confirmed to be from bed bugs. Bed bug bites were a new experience for me and not one I would ever want to go thru again. I discreetly spoke with the General Manager of the property and explained my concerns about the apparent bugs in our room. I understand that people travel from all over the world and live in quite different circumstances than I am accustomed to. I don't fault the hotel for having bed bugs but I do fault the GM for his lack of concern and communication. As we waited in the lobby, he sent a housekeeping lady to our room. She appeared quite some time later with a push cart full of boxes of trash can liners. I assumed to bag everything up. She went into the GM's office, closed the door and after some time they both walked out. My husband and I approached them and the housekeeper stated that she did not find anything. The GM was on his cell phone and never got off the phone to discuss the situation. Thankfully, we were due to check out later that day! I don't think I could have made it another night! I am very disappointed in the approach or lack thereof taken by management. I am still itching and in a lot of discomfort almost a week later. I had the pleasure of returning home and storing all of my luggage in the garage to kill off any bugs we may have brought home with us. Also, I should mention than upon checking out you pay the $15.00 per night resort fee and $22.00 per night + tax for parking (which you may or may not get a spot). The breakfast menu was the same every day that we were there. It consisted of toast, pancakes, cereal, oatmeal, apples, oranges, small donuts, rice and luncheon ham. The positives to this property is that it is in a decent location (if you don't mind noise). We were on the 12th floor and it was extremely loud by 6 am from street traffic.

We stayed on the 12th floor where the windows are not double glased but consist of louvers which open to allow airflow. Unfortunately this does nothing to stop outside noise. This hotel is on the corner of two major roads and the traffic noise on the 12th floor is horrendous. With vehicles stopping at the lights and starting off again as well as the endless stream of passenger coaches with their beep beep reversing tones as they back into parks near the hotel, this noise goes on all day and well into the night. The open air bar across the road closes about 3am each night and is very noisy as the drunks leave in the wee hours. To top it all off the local delivery trucks start up about 5am so you can forget any sleep from then on. After about 4 to 5 days we were sleeping for a fwe hours in the afternoon to try to catch up. So much for getting out to see the sights, could have stayed home and slept in the afternoon. The room only had one chair for two people and no table, funny arrangement. Hot water was only just if you did not add any cold water to it.

There are plenty of shops and restaurants in close proximity, ABC shops, a great Thai restaurant and a 50's type cafe ""The Rock Island Cafe"", which is worth a visit. The rooms vary in size from just a room to suites, the more space, the higher cost. The rooms are clean but the building is old with louvered windows that whistle in the wind. The windows cannot be closed tight enough to stop the whistle. The air conditioner is the older style, box in the wall, noisey and cannot cope with the Honolulu conditions. Better off opening the windows if you can handle the wind blowing through at the higher levels. The rooms are also noisey from traffic and air-con from other buildings. Free WiFi is available. The tap in the bathroom is very difficult to use to rinse out the mouth after brushing teeth, better off using the tap at the kitchenette. The worst of our stay at the Aqua Aloha Hotel was the breakfast. It was included in the cost but we did note a sign at the front of the hotel, $6 breakfast. My wife and I have eaten in many hotels around the world and this experience would have to be the worst. One would get a better meal at a hostel In detail the pancakes were too thick and gluggy, the breads were too sweet, the boiled eggs were cold, the cereals too sweet and the coffee, even with real milk was awful, with powdered milk which was offered, it was worse. In a word, undrinkable, in a group of 7, none of the coffees were drunk. The only item on the menu that was any good was the slices of orange. (did not try the oatmeal) Then on leaving we were chased out the door and told to clear our plates off the table. That would not normally be an issue if we were advised beforehand that our table had to be cleared on leaving but we not and I do not recall seeing any signs.

You can now imagine the frustration I was feeling and the opportunity to vent on the front desk ambassador Douglas Neuner ( i uncovered his name later). But before I was able to ""unleash"" my frustrations on him, he anticipated my frustration and proceeded to clearly explain the situation to me in a very calming and professional way, After calming me down and getting me to understand it wasn't the fault of the hotel, he then brought out the hotel's Reservation Mgr. Ms. Aimee Noa, who then explained how the booking process worked and educated me again on why this situation occurred. They then quickly provided me with another hotel room, provided a wonderful upgraded guest room and made clear that the problem would be fixed after my departure. Just from this interaction alone, I knew I picked the right hotel as their ability to turn a potentially bad sitauiton into a positive guest experience, thus I'm writing this revew.As for the hotel facility, my guest room came with a mini frdige/frezzer and a microwave which is perfect for storing drinks and my ""leftover"" food of my dinners.

The room, though clean, smelled mildewy (could be that it's a tropical location and the windows were simply slatted plastic open to the outside if you wanted and never really shut tight) and the bathroom was rather old and the shower changed temperature as other rooms around you used their water. The breakfast was a basic continental breakfast with the addition of pancakes. I could've gone with a bit more variety and more healthful choices.Our room (as most rooms, I think) had a kitchenette with refrigerator, microwave, sink, and a full set of dishes, which was nice and appreciated since it's terribly expensive to eat out all the time.Most of the staff was friendly and helpful and it appeared to be a safe location. There was even a set of coin-operated washers and dryers for hotel guests to use. As with many hotels, this one charges an additional $15/day resort fee that we were told covers the breakfast, wifi, shuttle, ""free"" DVDs, game station, and a few other things I can't remember. While I understand the practice I just wish they would tack it on the price and be done with it - anyone who comes to Hawaii will already have been ""fee-ed"" to death by the airlines, the extra taxes, and the cost of everything in Hawaii.","Minneapolis, Minnesota",66,3.0

Keep in mind this is a budget hotel and that's what you are going to get. It is on the level of a Motel 6 or an old Econo Lodge type of property. The pictures of the rooms on the website a very deceiving. The hotel rooms are old and have had obvious numerous repairs. The views from the rooms are looking at other hotels or apartments. We ate breakfast there one time and that was enough for us. The Sand Bar and Grill across the street has a breakfast buffet but it is not that good either for $12.95 a person. The plus to this hotel is that it is around the corner from a Food Pantry (small grocery store) it has a Coffee Bean coffee house and there are a couple of small restaurants in side as well.  If you are a senior you get a decent discount on the room rate if you are not a Senior I would recommend that you pay the extra money and go to the Marriot, Hyatt or Hilton.

Our room was on the 6th floor facing Kanekapolei St and the street noise is very loud-- keep this in mind if you're a light sleeper.

We had a bed, a dresser with a microwave and a coffee machine on it and a cabinet with a fridge in it and the TV and a gaming unit on it. That is it. Our suitcases had to stay on the floor because there was nowhere to put them. There was no chair to sit in. When we asked at least for a chair, we got a plastic chair. We were told that all the units are owned by different people and what the unit has is what the people think they need to supply. The deluxe units I think are bigger and have a sofa. Another thing that was something I did not care for is the bathroom sink is in the bedroom. The tub and toilet are in a closed room, but not the sink.

This was my second visit to Oahu (loved it so much I had to return) - my previous budget hotel was a few blocks away- but the deal at the Aqua Aloha was better. Breakfast was basic but tasty - the freshly made pancakes were absolutely delicious. Spam and rice was available too. Coffee in the room tasted weird but there was some available in the lobby during the day which I preferred. Some people were put off by the birds flying over and onto the tables on the outdoor section at breakfast - this didn't worry me but I guess it could be a hygiene issue.Didn't use the outdoor pool as the beach was so near. The lobby area was small but pleasant - enjoyed using the wifi in the evenings to research our trips for the following day.The room itself had a nice partial view over the canal towards the mountains. Shower was very basic (which I expected) but it did the job. The bed was comfy enough but the downside to the room was the noise and lack of privacy. Curtains didn't quite cover the window area enough and you could partially see into windows in apartments opposite. (I ended up using a peg to secure the curtains). Also - the slatted windows, which didn't close fully, meant there was a lot of noise and echo from the street below.

The hotel does not provide milk for tea, coffee or breakfast cereals, providing an artificial 'creamer' instead. There are no jugs in the rooms to boil water for tea. Tea bags and hot water are available in the lobby. There was a perculator for making coffee in the rooms.Our experience after the first stay was very positive. The second stay was unfortunately a disappointment. On our first stay we had a room with a fabulously comfortable queen bed and a nice view from our balcony. The room was clean and all the essentials we needed worked. Our check- in and check- out were handled in a friendly and efficient manner and our overall impression was very positive. Unfortunately our experience was quite different for our second stay a week later. Our room only had a double bed and the shower facilities were very old and tired. Our balcony view this time only looked over adjoining apartment blocks. In addition, we also experienced poor staff service when we dared to complain about the hotel running out of basic provisions (tea bags). There were also issues with other provisions in the lobby that weekend. The older male service staff on duty were at best indifferent and certainly not customer service focused. The tea bag saga, and no creamer and cold coffee in the lobby are only small issues per se, but when combined with a room that was anything but 'superior' and unhelpful/ unfriendly front desk staff, the positive experience of our stay the week earlier was 'wiped out'.

Our criteria were: pool, breakfast and WiFi + reasonable distance to the beach/centre. All hotels in this area are expensive, so we had to accept that, and we paid about $850 dollars for 6 nights. Breakfast was strictly limited to 7-9 am, which meant that we missed it on 2 days due to early starts, but when we had it, it was fine - all the expected continental items plus fresh made pancakes with maple syrup and porridge.

Also, on a quiet corner of the hotel which was good as others did complain about noisy street outside. Our room, on the 4th floor, was OK for noise, apart from the air conditioning - even if we switched ours off, you could hear others' working - but just imagine it is waves!Easy walking distance to the beach, the shops & restaurants and bus stops. The staff were lovely. Especially the concierge who was very knowledgeable and helped us patiently each day to plan our activities. Anything she didn't know, she looked up.Other staff were also nice; no problem about finding change for the bus for example (you have to give exact change of $2.50 per person).Interesting red shrimps displayed in reception - the hotel has a connection with their conservation on the Big Island. A small bookshelf has books available - as a keen member of bookcrossing.com this was a bonus and I left a book on the shelves and found one that I wanted to read.Bed was comfy and king-size. Room was clean and tidied every day. Coffee provided plus nice toiletries. Small balcony did not have much of a view but was useful for drying washing!The canal is close by and worth a walk along - you can clearly see at least two kinds of fish in the water.All in all, we were pleased with our choice and would happily stay at this hotel again.","Worcestershire, United Kingdom",176,4.0

On August 1, I arrived in Honolulu via plane at 10:30 pm at night. As soon as my plane landed, I called the hotel to confirm the room at Aqua Aloha Surf. A woman who answered the phone confirmed my reservation and I informed her that I would be checking in in about an hour. She repeated that my room was confirmed. When I finally arrived at the hotel at midnight, I was informed upon checking in that there was no room available for me as the hotel overbooked. Lance, the man working at the front desk, stated that he had no idea why I was told that the room was confirmed considering that ""everyone knew the situation."" Rather, Lance informed me that Iwould be relocated to another hotel about 10 minutes away. It was midnight and as as single woman traveler, I was upset and a bit nervous about having to locate to a completely new hotel. When I arrived at the other hotel, it did not have the same amenities as the hotel room Ibooked. I specifically booked Aqua Aloha Surf because of its location to the beach and its wifi. The hotel they moved me to, Pagoda Hotel, was not within walking distance of Waikiki Beach nor did it have wifi internet access. Additionally, the taxi driver that took me to the new hotel told me that Aqua Aloha Surf tends to do this quite often- overbook and then move their guests to another hotel. I wanted to alertpeople. This hotel moved paying guests from the hotel they book to another one. This is a clear safety issue as travelers are forced to go to another area of town that they have no knowledge of.I would really recommend not booking at this hotel or any of its related properties.

The rate was very affordable ($99/nt booked through Hotwire) compared to other hotels in the Waikiki area, and this included a buffet breakfast (see more on breakfast below). And the location was good--walking distance to the beach, shops and restaurants. Because of this we didn't bother renting a car while we stayed. The room (queen + twin) was clean as was everything else in the hotel. There are a number of restaurants that participate in a delivery service to the hotel (a catalog of menus is in the room), so you could choose to eat in if you like. The concierge was very helpful, and we were able to purchase tickets to a luau through the hotel, a great time saver!What could be done better: The ""queen"" bed in our room was awfully small, and I suspected it was actually a double bed. My husband is big and tall, so the two of us in a double bed is not comfortable at all. The room was small, comparable to a cabin on a cruise ship, though it did include a small refrigerator, microwave and some dishes and utensils for eating. The breakfast buffet was almost not edible. The hard-boiled eggs were... well, let's just say that they had an unusual texture. (How do you mess up hard-boiled eggs??!) And the multitude of birds were constantly picking at the dirty dishes left by the guests at the tables and in a bin. If a free breakfast weighs heavily in your decision for a hotel, then this will be a disappointment. The decor and fixtures are a bit dated, but when you're spending most of your time at the beach and out-and-about, it probably doesn't matter much unless you want to hang around the hotel. Wi-fi is only available in the lobby with hard-wired ethernet available in the rooms. I can't connect my iPhone via ethernet so I was not pleased with the inconvenience.Overall impression: if you have a limited budget for vacationing in Waikiki, this hotel will suffice. Not bad, but not great.","West Lafayette, Indiana",5,3.0

I was not expecting much at all for the price, but boy was I surprised. From the moment I walked in the front door to the moment I stepped into my cab ride to the airport, I was greeted with friendliness and the 'aloha' spirit. My first impression was from the clean, open lobby and the friendly and helpful front desk. Not only did they greet me warmly and seem very happy to be there, the awesome gentleman at the front desk started up some small talk while he was processing my room and didn't rush me away from the desk as soon as he was done. In almost every other hotel I've been at, the front desk feels more like a 'business first' philosophy, and this is the first time I've walked away from the front desk and still felt like a human being (and not just a room number).For the next 7 days, the hotel continued to impress me. The hotel was close enough to the main area of the city for shopping, eating, night life, etc but far enough away that noise wasn't a huge problem. The room was big enough without feeling like a cave; just the right size to feel comfy. Personally, I don't need too much in a room to be happy and the room I booked was more than good enough. Besides the standard bed/dresser/TV, the room came equipped with clean dishes (including cutlery), a small couch, a coffee table, a sink, an (empty) refrigerator, air conditioning unit, and small balcony.From the location, to the friendly and helpful staff (including the front desk, manager, maintenance crew, and cleaning crew), to the room itself, to the amenities such as the pool and breakfast, everything was just right. Cons: None that I could think of. The only complaints I've seen are over the breakfast menu, free wifi, and pool size, possibly, but you are literally next to the main strip of Waikiki, which is bordering the crystal clear ocean waters. You have Diamond Head Crater and Pearl Harbor nearby, besides all of the attractions and authentic eateries (Pho Thinh, Leonard's Bakery, Rainbow Cafe, and Marukame Udon are all recommended). You shouldn't be at the hotel for these things!Pros: Everything.

The room didn't even have a chair.As this was our first trip to Hawaii I wasn't looking forward to spending any time in this room, let alone a whole week! My husband mentioned my disappointment to Julian the desk clerk the next day and he kindly offered us a full upgrade to a larger room (with a chair!), higher floor with balcony, fridge, microwave and bath. Thank you, even arranged the transfer of our ample luggage. Sadly the room was very noisy - but then most hotel rooms are in Waikiki - rubbish trucks start their rounds VERY early, sirens and voices.... we left the windows open due to a noisy air conditioner, so couldn't win either way. However the bed was good and comfortable.The location is 4 minutes walk to the beach and convenient to different food options, supermarket very close by. Desk and tour staff pleasant and helpful.The breakfast was very disappointing, hardly anything left the first day with still 20 minutes to go (no eggs) and pigeons and birds need to be looked out for as quick to take off with your breakfast if you aren't looking!","Tauranga, New Zealand",0,3.0

I loved the decor and room colours (mellow beach tones with just the right pops of colour) We enjoyed having a drink or two on the balcony each night. Good water pressure in the shower. Very comfortable bed with modern linens (would have liked some pillow variety and all of the pillows were large and somewhat firm) Also, having a bar sink, dishes, microwave and fridge was extremely helpful for us. The tv is small and the cable reception was not very good...but we weren't in Hawaii to watch tv!The beach is a short walk away, and the Ala Wai Canal is right beside the hotel. It's a great location, as it has the best of both world - a quiet street beside a lovely canal for walking, but quick access to all of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. There is a grocery store right around the corner on Kuhio, and ample restaurants within walking distance. The morning breakfast was very appreciated. The selection is not fantastic as far as healthy choices, but the fresh made pancakes were the best I've ever had (honestly!) The pool area is quite small, but most people make their way to Waikiki Beach if they want to swim. All-in-all, this is a very well-run hotel, and our stay was seamless.

I don't need a resort atmosphere nor amenities. I recommend that travelers who have similar needs for a hotel check out the Aqua Aloha Surf!For around $100 a night I got a big king deluxe room with a bathroom with full-sized shower/tub, small kitchenette area, sofa and balcony. The balcony had great views of the rest of Waikiki, the mountains and a bit of ocean. The room was clean and mostly well-maintained. It had a very good A/C unit with remote control - which wasn't needed because of the room's nice slatted glass windows, which let in a nice breeze and kept the room cool. A generous breakfast was included. The hotel is just a few minutes' walk from Waikiki beach. It is also very near stops for The Bus, which gets you nearly anywhere on Oahu for cheap.This is solidly a 4-star review for a budget hotel. I can't give it 5 stars for the following reasons:1) Bathroom was a little dated and shabby. The tub was clean and fairly new but the walls and sliding door were a little banged up and could use a fresh coat of paint. The bathroom also desperately needed a fan!2) The bathroom had few accessibility aids. There were no grab bars in the tub nor bathroom walls, or a no-slip mat in the tub. I have to point this deficiency out because I stayed with my partner who has limited mobility. He made do with no incident but I caution that those who are more disabled may have problems. I encourage the hotel management to consider installing these critical safety features in each of the rooms, at some point.3) The WiFi was awfully slow and difficult to use. Not too important to me but my partner observed that it was essentially unusable. It was also totally inaccessible from our 10th floor room.Despite this short list of complaints, I love this hotel and I will definitely be back. I feel that nowhere else is as a good value in Waikiki than this place. ","Seattle, WA",8,4.0

We selected Aqua Aloha based on TripAdvisor recommendations and its proximity to the beach. Although this is an older hotel, it is very well maintained. The staff, from check-in to check-out were very helpful and professional. The hotel manager's ""Welcome Cocktail"" on Tuesday evening was an unexpected surprise.The location is great, about a 5 minute walk to Waikiki Beach. The hotel was built in days when energy conservation was not as great a concern as it is today. The windows are venetian slatted glass and even when closed there is really no seal to the outside. The drawback here is the room air conditioner has a hard time keeping up with the mid-day heat and if there are emergency vehicles traversing close by during the night, you'll hear them for sure. There is a buffet breakfast included but we opted to eat breakfast at Dukes in the Outrigger, overlooking Waikiki Beach.

We were very excited about our stay and planned and reserved many activities, restaurants and car rental based on our hotel location. When we arrived at the Aqua Aloha Surf from an over 6 hour flight from Arizona and were told that they did not have a room for us due to over booking, we were in a huge state of shock. For one, we are both seasoned travelers and luckily have never, ever experienced this and secondly, we never received any advance notice of this by either email or phone. The front desk staff and manager did their job and tried be nice, however it left us with a very uneasy feeling to start our vacation off this way. In any case, we were given a box of chocolates and told that they reserved a room for us at the Luana hotel located on Kalakaua. Since neither my husband nor myself have ever been to Honolulu, we had no idea what this meant location wise for everything we had planned. However, at this point based on what the people at the hotel were telling us, we hoped to be fine with all we had planned. They paid for our cab and off we went to the Luana, which we knew nothing about. The front desk staff at the Aqua Aloha Surf told us that the Luana was a better caliber of hotel and we would find it to be an even better stay. So, we arrived at the Luana and were greeted by the front desk. Upon our arrival it became apparent that the staff at the Aqua Aloha Surf only partially notified the front desk at the Luana and so we the displaced travelers, who booked our room almost 5 months before had to go over with the front desk at the Luana our rate, the fact that the Aqua Aloha Surf already charged us for our first night and that they would only be responsible for charging us for 6 nights. We had to review the rate we were going to pay at the Aqua Aloha Surf as it was less than what they were charging at the Luana. We also had to discuss parking fees as we would be renting a car (5 minutes from the Aqua Aloha Surf, now 15 minutes from the Luana) in a few days and we were planning on paying for the parking fees that the Aqua Aloha Surf charged and not what the Luana Charges. We also were going to be given some free breakfast vouchers. This was nice, however, we had not planned to eat there but even that was a fiasco. Initially they showed only one person would be in our room, another error??? So they did not want to give us vouchers for more than 1 person and we would have to check back. We did not need or want them, but if we did, we would then have to waste more time explaining this to the front desk and taking up more of our precious vacation time. When I expressed this to the girl at the front desk, she responded in a condescending manner. Our room was not ready when we arrived but when it was we were fine with the room. It was simple but comfortable and we chose to put all of the aggravation behind us and enjoy our vacation. After returning and speaking to many people in the lodging business, I feel we should have been given a lot more for our inconvenience. The story that the Luana is a much higher scale hotel is all well and good, but they did not offer us anything more than we were going to get at the Aqua Aloha Surf as far as amenities go. I believe we should have been comped a night or upgraded on our room at the very least for this huge inconvenience. In the end I learned a huge lesson, even if you book your hotel well in advance, don’t always expect it to be yours until you arrive. I love to plan our vacations so it won’t stop me from planning them as I do, but at least now I know that this can happen. I am hopeful though it never will again because it started out our vacation in a very unpleasant way.","Atlanta, Georgia",504,1.0

We had contacted their Sales team to get a government rate, since this was government travel. Their Sales Manager contacted us and offered us some great rates, but after that it went downhill. It was like pulling teeth to get a confirmation, then it was done wrong, then we never knew if the reservation had been made or not. We ended up booking the room ourselves and cancelling with the Sales Manager, and again, we never received a cancellation confirmation email from her.We ended up booking a package that included breakfast and some drink vouchers. When we checked in, the Front Desk had to be reminded that we had the package. No drink vouchers available. Conflictive information in how to solve the problem.Rooms were pretty nice, modern but rather small. There is no privacy as you have a building right across from you. The room however was clean and the daily housekeeping was excellent. The room also had a refrigerator, microwave and dishes.There is no wi-fi in the room, only high speed internet in the room, but the internet was extremely slow. Wi fi is offered for free in the lobby, but since this is the only place with wi fi, there are tons of people there and the internet is very slow.The hotel offers free coffee, tea and water 24 hours, nice touch.Gym is a joke, as it is part of the lobby and it has 3 work out machines.If you book directly you have breakfast included. Breakfast is served in a restaurant that is in the hotel, but privately operated. The staff there was not extremely friendly and the restaurant can clearly not handle the amount of guests trying to have breakfast.Overall our stay was not bad, the staff was very friendly, specially Helene at check out. Aqua Aloha Surf is perfect for budget conscious travellers, who don't need all the amenities that other hotels offer.Parking is offered in their underground garage at $20 a day.

I chose the Aqua Aloha Surf based on other reviews & a reasonable rate (Avg $149/day). We arrived at the hotel at approximately 5:30 on a Thursday afternoon. The front desk staff were very welcoming, the open air lobby nicely decorated. I had requested a room on a higher floor (there are 16 floors in the Aqua Aloha). They gave us Room 1008, which, they explained was their 'model' room. They are in the process of renovating & they asked us to complete a survey after our stay to rate the room which would help as they plan the rest of their renovations. We loved the room. It was considered a junior suite as it had a king size bed, nice kitchenette, a pull-out loveseat and a good size bathroom. The floor is tile with a nice area rug in front of the loveseat. The 42"" flat screen TV was mounted on the wall above the desk/bureau combination unit. It was a great TV, a lot of available channels. The bed was extremely comfortable, lots of pillows, great mattress. There is an air conditioner unit mounted at ceiling level. It's the quietest a/c unit I have ever had in a hotel room. There was absolutely no problem sleeping with the unit on as the quiet hum was actually very soothing. The only problem, even on the 10th floor, was the noise caused by the garbage trucks going by most days, at about 5-5:30. The other problem is each room has a balcony and on the first 2 nights, the people next door were partying. It felt like they were right in our room. I think the reason is that the window is this slat-type and there was no way to close the slats to keep all the noise out. On the 2nd night, I made myself some earplugs out of tissues & that helped a lot. Luckily, it was just the first 2 nights, after that, all was quiet on the balconies. The view from the balcony was okay, there were some mountain views to the right, but it was mostly high rise apartments/condos that we saw. We didn't spend any real time on the balcony. One note, the A/C unit condensation empties out through a tube that runs through the wall out onto the balcony and the water goes into a large plastic waste basket. Once that waste basket fills up, the water slowly runs over the side, onto the balcony floor, and gradually runs off the balcony. I felt the run off from the balcony above ours. It isn't a stream or anything, just kind of a splash from where the water may have hit the railing. But, I think if I was sitting out there, it would have gotten annoying. The bathroom was great. Only a shower, no tub. But the shower was wonderful, very roomy and the shower head was terrific. Great water pressure and the head itself was the kind with colored lights indicating the how hot the water was. The sink was roomy, the counter was granite. Lots of light & storage. The closet area is in the bathroom and is very narrow. Above the closet is a small safe, which came in handy. Each morning there is a breakfast (included in the room charge) downstairs adjacent to the lobby. When you go, you present your breakfast card and they mark off the day. Each day there are always pancakes, sliced apples, orange wedges, hard boiled eggs, white rice, wheat & Italian sliced bread, mini donuts or muffins and oatmeal. The coffee is very weak, with only powdered creamer. There's better coffee out in the lobby. The juice selection is poor, seems like just Hi-C type drinks. But, it's nice to have the breakfast right there every day. Although, by the last day, I had had enough pancakes! The hotel provides beach towels and sand chairs for each guest to carry down to the beach, which is a nice walk of about 3-4 blocks. Hotel is centrally located to a great area; 1/2 block away from an ABC store, which was great. Many restaurant and shopping choices and just a 1/2 block from the bus stops. By the way, getting around by bus is the only way to go; it's a great system. Be sure to get a bus pass on your first or second day; you'll be glad you did. A four day pass is $35 per person and it is so worth it. You can go almost anywhere on the island with this pass. We went to Diamond Head, Pearl Harbor, Hanauma Bay, and other places via the bus system. I will review the different points of interest separately. All in all, I feel for the price, this hotel was a good choice for us.","shelton, connecticut",44,4.0

We travel on a strict budget, which excludes the big name hotels in the area (except for the Ilikai, which was a time share resort exchange). For point of reference, our only other Waikiki hotel room stays were in the Imperial and the Aston at the Waikiki Banyon. The Aqua Aloha Surf compares very favorably to those two. We had a ""Deluxe"" room with a king size bed (comfortable mattress); it was a little dated but very clean and appropriately supplied and appointed with small fridge, bar type sink, coffee maker and microwave crammed into a very small space. The bathroom (tub, shower and toilet) was average size for an older hotel and given privacy from the ""old-style"" (separate hot and cold faucets) sink area just outside it. The closet was spacious with plenty of hangars and had a safe in which to secure valuables. The wall-type air conditioner was adequate and placed in the far corner of the room from the bed; that meant running it on high to sleep in comfortable conditions, but it also meant that there was no cold draft blowing on us during the night (as we have experienced in many other hotels). Even though we were on the 14th floor, and the air conditioner was making its steady noise, there was considerable truck noise starting at six in the morning. We found this to be the case at the Imperial and the Aston as well. Because we booked online directly with the hotel, we were rewarded with daily complimentary breakfasts. Billed by the hotel as a ""continental breakfast,"" it was actually something more than that, including hard pancakes, boiled eggs, griddled pressed ham, hot oatmeal, cold cereal, assorted breads for toast, muffins and the usual hot and cold beverages. We did not use the very small ground floor level pool, and, the times that we passed by it, no one else was using it either. The seats in the lobby were not terribly comfortable, but there was free wi-fi for hotel guests in it. Free cable internet service was available in the rooms. We had a car and so availed ourselves of their 35 space self-park facilities for $20 extra per night. The hotel staff was courteous, professional, helpful and, when not otherwise engaged, friendly and willing to chat.

We wouldn't have known if the front desk hadn't told us. So we had our own private parking spot right by the entry for our entire stay! 5 stars for what it is -- a great pied a terre.

Beautiful view of the Ala Wai Canal, golf course, and on the other side - quite a bit of ocean. Only negative comments: 1) the stucco wall rather than grating on the 16th floor, which makes it tough for a short person to see the view when sitting on the lanai. 2) the paint and grouting in the room's bathroom needed touching up (made the room look standard rather than deluxe). All else was good: the bed area of the room was very nice, with a full-wall mirror. Maid staff was exceptional - I left a note requesting flat/soft pillows (the 4 in the room were so high I eventually pillowcased a sofa throw pillow so I could sleep w/o neck pain) and had 2 good pillows when I returned later in the day. One maid even left me a nice thank you note for the day's cash tip. The lobby and exterior of the hotel looked classy.

Slow, at times, but reliable to book things etc.Housekeeping come through every day and do a thorough job of cleaning.The bed and pillows are comfortable and clean.Concierge can organise activities and are available from certain hours downstairs in the lobby or if you call from your room.This hotel is in a prime location to the main beach strips of Waikiki. It is within a short walking distance to many different sights and locations. An ABC store which is like a large convenience store with just about anything you need, is down the road on the corner, approx a 2.5 min walk.

There were several things that I did not like in the room we stayed in. First our sink became clogged after calling maintenence it was never fixed, there is no actual bathroom door, there is just a pocket door that slides and doesn't lock (not a problem for us as this was a romantic/couple trip) but it might be a little awkward for others who are traveling as friends etc. I also would recommend keeping atleast some of the blinds shut if you are staying on the front side of the hotel as it faces the Sand Villa directly across, we had the misfortune of waking up to see a couple having sex directly across from our room with their blinds wide open......And if we could see them they could see us... (LOL) The pool is very small and there is no hottub which was a big disappointment, as this a boutique hotel they are limited on space but it still was a disappointment. Lastly the daily breakfast buffet that was included in our room was less than desirable, We stayed there for 9 days and we ate the buffet 7/9 days. The only thing that changed on the menu was muffins going to a breakfast type cake and vice versa. After staying here I never wanted to see a pancake again. The daily breakfast menu consists of pancakes, boiled eggs, muffins, donuts or breakfast type cake, (depending on what day it was) white rice, sliced pieces of ham (very salty btw so beware) oatmeal, dry cereal, powdered milk, toast, water and what I thought was orange juice but tastes more like really bad tang. After all has been said I would recommend this hotel and if you aren't partial to the possibility of eating the same breakfast everyday go for it! I would stay here again but I would not partake in the breakfast buffet.",Oregon,14,3.0

But you do not pay for a 5 star hotel... so you should not expect one!!!We had a room with 2 beds, basic cooking facilities, sofa & coffee table + balcony. The bathroom could do with a bit of refurbishing - you enter in a small room with a sink, a safe and a small wardrobe. From there you can access to another small room with a toilet and a shower. The door was half broken - but you could still close it.The shower was a good size but the water would not go down. Surely the bathroom could improve dramatically with some updating.We asked for a quiet room and we were allocated one on a high floor, facing the back. I was very happy about it because Waikiki is noisy. The noise in our room was acceptable - but if would have been much better if the hotel had double-glazing.There is a small pool with 6 or 7 sun loungers, we used it for an hour or so twice during our stay and it was quite nice. There are also a couple of machines (I cannot call it a gym) behind reception - we did not use it but I think it is a nice thought... those who want to keep fit have the opportunity to do so.You can get coffee and tea for free all day at the machine next to the restaurant. if you want special coffee (espresso, etc) you have to pay a small fee. You can get beach towel for free at reception.We had breakfast included and it was ok. The selection offered is a bit limited, but you still manage to find something you like.What I found a bit strange (I have been to many hotels and never seen this before in my life) is that you were only allowed to 2 boiled eggs per person. I obviously do not know if they do it because some people would eat 4 o 5 eggs (I would never dream of it...!!!), but I thought it was strange.Of perhaps eggs in Hawaii are very expensive....now that I think of it, boiled eggs were only available on some days, not every day.As I said, that did not bother me at all - I just found it odd.The breakfast room would transform into a restaurant in the evening, run by a Chinese family. We tried the buffet and it was good value for money.All in all, I was more than happy staying at this hotel. The location is good (those who say it is scary have probably never been to some areas of LA, NY or London!), the room was absolutely fine, the service was good and there are lots of little touches (free tea and coffee, free towels, swimming pool) that put this hotel above other hotels for money conscious travellers,","Munich, Germany",183,3.0

We didn't mind paying the extra night just for that reason. So we checked out on Monday a little before 2pm. A front desk staff member named Kalei was nice enough to offer to refund the 2nd night since we weren't staying the night and were checking out within the 2 hour time-frame of the usual noon check-out. I was pleasantly surprised that he offered and I gladly accepted. I think some hotels would probably just take advantage and charge for the additional night.

The room we had requested turned out to not be available, but Nickie had upgraded us to a beautiful room. We found the top floor to be much quieter for sleeping than the 9th floor had been in the previous year.

We booked through Thomson and had asked for pretty much bog standard accommodation as we were on a budget - we wanted to spend more money exploring Oahu! Check in was painless and all of the staff were friendly and pleasant enough throughout our stay.Our room was decent for the price we had paid. I had noticed a few reviews saying the standard rooms were small but it was plenty big enough for a couple sharing using it as a holiday base. We were literally only in the room to sleep at night then back in the afternoon after a day out for a nap/shower then back out again. Bathroom was spotlessly clean, in fact the whole room was always clean - the only thing that could've done with more attention were the windows (the slats were very dirty) but this was a minor thing. We had the buffet breakfast included in the rate we paid however we probably only used it 4 or 5 days out of the 14 we were there. There wasn't much variation day to day but the food on offer was (mostly) good quality. The pancakes and muffins were delicious but the juice wasn't too good. Could've done with fresh juice rather than cordial type stuff. We chose to eat breakfast out most days, partially to have a bigger breakfast (then not eat again until evening) and partially due to meeting up with friends to have breakfast with. The hotel is in such a good location, just a couple of blocks to the beach and there are tons of restaurants, bars and shops nearby. Hotel is right by the Ala Wai canal which we'd walk down regularly to get to a friend's place, and also to walk up to Diamond Head (long walk but worth it!). The hotel does have a tiny pool however we didn't use this and didn't see anybody using it the whole time we were there - the sea is only 5 minutes away!

Most importantly, the staff was overly accomodating for our every request- including holding our bags after checkout and being willing to split up our bill several ways as requested by our university finance department.

I paid $20 to park in about 15 available spaces but when I left in the morning I had a ticket. I asked the desk clerk what's up with that. She said I didn't have the correct license plate written on the pass that was INSIDE my locked car in the windshield...the one SHE wrote down. So she said forget it. Hotels are extremely high in Honolulu and the major chains are non-existent or way out of my price range so Aqua was within my price range.

You don't have any place to hang your towels.B- Wired Internet??? Come on guys, we're living in the Ipads and Iphones era. They only work with WiFi.

I didn't know if I would be getting a below average hotel experience since the prices were so low but the online reviews were all positive so I decided to give them a try. The hotel experience I received GREATLY EXCEEDED my expectations. The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated (not that 30-year-old-rattan-furniture-and-hibiscus-print theme that a lot of the other super tourist-y hotels have). The hotel staff was helpful and friendly and informed me of the free breakfast downstairs every morning. Bonus! Good stuff too- fresh pancakes, fruit, boiled eggs, ham, oatmeal, ...

Having 4 people with a bunch of luggage makes it hard for the room attendant to clean around your stuff but at least they try! We were on the 14th floor and had a nice breeze flow through the room. We also had to rent a car and it was $20 a night. But traveling with that many people makes it totally worth it. Parking is crazy! They provide one beach towel per person in the room and you can switch them out as often as you want. Along with that, they offer beach chairs for no charge! I thought that was really nice.

We stayed in this hotel on Oahu for 5 nights before hopping over to the Big Island. Two specific things that stand out about our experience at this hotel is (1) One our way to breakfast the morning after our first night there we were stopped by a staff at the front desk and offered a larger room with a bigger bed for the rest of our stay. (2) Aaron, the concierge in the hotel was a pleasure to meet and full of information about the island and things to do. I had booked the Hummer ""LOST"" tour before coming to the island (which I highly recommend with KOS Hummer Tours) and that is where we first met Aaron. He picked us up at the hotel the morning of our tour and during the day we learned that he worked for Expedia at our hotel and offered to help us with any activities that we wanted to do during our vacation. We stopped by his desk the next day. He helped us find a rental car for our arrival on Big Island at a great price and helped us decide to do a helicopter tour on Big Island and the whale watch on Maui. These are things that we knew that we wanted to do while in Hawaii, he is not at all pushy like a salesman but truly wants you to enjoy and get the most out of your stay. He even called after we got on Big Island to make sure we received our rental car without any problems.It is employee's like this that make a business successful. Thanks for everything.

No matter on what side you get your room, you will have a look onto the balcony of another hotel. The balcony is not equipped very lovingly (two plastic seats, no table, but maybe this is because the balcony is very small) and the room is overall very small. It can also be quite noisy because of the traffic (if your room is next to the public parking, you have the ""pieppiep"" of the trucks of the suppliers going backwards every morning). But altogether it was a pleasant stay there, very clean and friendly staff. You have to face the price! If you want something really great, you have to pay far a lot more..... There is a coin operated guest laundry and you can park your car for 20,- dollars extra a day on the ground floor (may be the public parking right next door is cheaper, but we were too lazy to find out...) My personal opinion to Waikiki beach (being near to this beach was one of the Pros of the Aqua Aloha Surf): Waikiki beach is far supervalued.

After three complaints they finally changed our room.. which was only marginally better. At least we managed to get to sleep on it.If you are travelling solo, the mattresses would be fine - you can choose the most comfortable part to sleep on!They explained this was going to be rectified in the renovations but in my mind they should never have got to this state in the first place. That one night before we got moved was the most uncomfortable sleep in my life - camping is a better alternative!Also, I would not waste money prepaying the daily contiental breakfast (you can pay $6 if you want it the odd day out of convenience).

I really did not price out many Waikiki hotels so I hope if you book this hotel, you are getting a very good rate. It's a couple of blocks off of the beach which is not the worse thing if you're getting a break. But overall it is not in the best shape either. If I was rating the hotel, I would give it 2.5 stars. Upon arrival, a large cockroach ran across our feet but I suppose that can be expected in an open air lobby in Hawaii? The desk staff was consistently OK but never overly friendly or helpful but not nasty either. The concierge gal is great! The rooms are on the smallish side and need an uplift. We had a corner room with good views of the canal and mountain and the ocean way to the right. Temp is hard to moderate as it is only on when your key is left in the room. If you don't mind a little walking, location is central to the beach. The continental breakfast is probably not worth the effort.

Maid service was good and employees were friendly. The concierge was helpful. Unfortunately, the negatives outweighed the positives. The beds felt like sleeping on marshmallows--no support (we had two rooms and the same problem in both). Rooms are small and plain, bathrooms are miniscule. The free breakfast was unappetizing--to indicate how much so, know that we ate at Denny's (which my 12-year-old grandson likes--but then he's 12) as an alternative. There are only 2 small elevators for 200 rooms, so the wait can be quite long when guests are trying to get to breakfast between 7-9 am. (In my experience, even cheaper motels on the mainland have at least a 3-hour breakfast window.) The lounge furniture in the lobby was cheap and uncomfortable. The Wi-Fi connection was too slow for my grandson to download a movie on his Kindle. The small TV in the lobby hangs above the elevator doors (really). Parking space in the garage is a joke, plus they charge an extra $20 a night for parking. When we first arrived in our room, I stepped out onto the balcony and noticed the air conditioner had large holes in the grill, lots of rust, and what I think were salt deposits clogging much of the vent. I assumed it wouldn't work, although it actually did (and was needed at night even in December, because there is no air flow through the room). There is no restaurant in the hotel (other than the poor breakfast bar) and it was a hassle seeking out places to eat and waiting in line. Overall, I was disappointed with this room, especially as we were paying $200/night for it. Would not return (but in fairness, I would not return to Waikiki either--overhyped, expensive, crowded.

The Waikiki Sand Villa directly across the road has wifi for guests in all rooms (we'd previously stayed there) so it's possible to deliver and this hotel ought to consider it.Self-parking is available for $20 in the small underground carpark but there are < 20 parking spaces for guests, which isn't nearly enough for the hotel. The first night we were able to park underground, but the next night we needed to park in the less-protected parking lot beside the hotel. That only fits another 8-10 cars and the tight maneuvering required meant some people parked across two carparks, further reducing the available parking spots. We got the last park on the second night and I'm not sure what the plan would have been if that had not been available - find your own street park and move the car all day?Overall, the room was functional but the chances of securing a carpark are risky.

The rooms are a bit small but they are pretty typical of Oahu hotels. There was a nice mini refrigerator in the room and a micro wave. The balcony is good size and you share it with the rooms air conditioner. We wanted to sleep with the slider and windows open but the noise on the street makes that impossible. I have stayed at several hotels along Kuhio and the noise just echoes. It's like a big canyon. The way to get a good night sleep is to turn on the air conditioner and close the windows.

Our room was tiny, not even room for a regular bathroom door, but a pocket door instead. The bed was very comfortable and we appreciated the in-room safe and the dorm-size refrigerator. The room did have a/c, but with windows that don't fully close, the room never seemed to get to a completely comfortable temperature for me. And with windows that don't fully close, that makes for waking to all the morning noises that you find in a city, too. The free breakfast was ok. We were disappointed that the pool was closed for maintenance the 3 days we were there, but when we saw the pool, it wouldn't have mattered anyway - it was about the size of a large hot tub. (When you can walk 2 blocks and be at the ocean, why would you need a pool? It would have been nice to take a dip the evening we got there because it was dark and too late to head for the ocean, but a refreshing swim would have been great.) The staff were nice, the room was clean. My only major complaint is parking. In a 16 story building (I think) there were 24 ... yes, that is right, 24 parking spots in the garage. We got the last spot and didn't go anywhere that we had to drive until we checked out, fearing we wouldn't get another spot. The desk staff told us there was parking lot parking available at the end of the building if it was needed, but the neighborhood isn't great-I'm pretty sure we saw people 'casing' cars there, and I'm glad we were able to park in at least somewhat protected area. (Even that 'parking lot' appeared to hold no more that a few cars.) I guess most people take taxis there or something?? Back to the neighborhood ... always felt safe in the day time. Wouldn't have felt safe walking alone at night up to the hotel from the beach and shopping area, but I wasn't alone and felt fine. Overall, if we were staying in the area for a night or two, we'd go back to this property - inexpensive, clean, friendly staff, and close to Waikiki without the enormous pricetag of other ""name-brand"" hotels in the area. However, if we were staying longer than a couple nights, I think we'd find something else ... ok for short stays, but too small and too confining (rooms and parking) for an extended stay for us.","Twin Cities, MN",3,4.0

If I had to rate it for the service of the hotel employees, I would have given it 5 stars, A+, no reservations. The man at the concierge desk always greeted me by name whenever I came down the elevator, the staff was extremely helpful and very friendly, and any questions I had were immediately addressed. The service was absolutely stellar. The hotel is located almost on Ala Wai, although it is still within easy walking distance to the beach.But the room itself? I'm not sure how old the Aqua Aloha is, but my friend and I requested a double room for our stay, and I couldn't believe how tiny it was. And it had two TWIN beds. I didn't think hotels even came with twin beds anymore. The shower was kind of on the scary side and I didn't want to go in without slippers; it wasn't dirty per se, it just looked very very old. Also, nothing annoys me more than bathrooms with standalone sinks and no countertops. Ladies, I think you know what I mean. The lights wouldn't come on at least once while we stayed there, but as soon as we called the front desk someone came up immediately to fix the problem. We drove to Waikiki, so we needed parking at the hotel and I have to say, RENT A SMALL CAR. The parking lot is extremely tiny and cramped, and if they had a valet service I didn't see it. We also had a lower-level room, with a view of nothing except the roof of the next building. There was also some sort of construction going on in the street out front while we were staying there, although I can't blame the hotel for that.So in the end it was very hard for me to rate this hotel, perhaps it was just the choice of room, if we had splurged it might have been much nicer. In the end I would probably not stay here again, I would go for a more updated hotel closer to the beachfront.","Los Angeles, California",42,3.0

The room we got was well equipped - there was a sofa, a center coffee table, and kitchen amenities such as a microwave and a fridge.2. The hotel is quite centrally located. It is <5 minutes from the Waikiki Beach. Tour buses also stop at this location.3. Free beach towels and free beach chairs are a very nice perk. I have stayed at other beach hotels too in Hawaii and elsewhere but I have not found any hotel to offer free beach chairs. But given that those folks did offer free beach chairs, we could take those with us to the beach and use them.4. A filling continental breakfast was offered with our reservations and that was nice and filling. The person making pancakes was really fast and the pancakes were simple but very good!5. There was a person from Expedia (Bianca) right next to the front desk who really helped us get reservations for a Circle Island Tour and a Snorkeling Trip the next day at very short notice. If she is available, you could certainly speak with her and have her help you in your trip planning.6. The check-out process was also smooth.Room for improvement: Not much for the price that they offer. But since I am a nitpicker, I will point something out: While they are located close to the Waikiki Beach, the particular street on which they are located is dark and a little shady. The hotels/ hostels right next to it also look a little shady. I asked my wife about it as we were headed back to our hotel one night about whether she would have been comfortable walking by herself and she said that she wouldn't.

The toilet did not flush right, I didn't want to touch anything in the bathroom, and the weirdest thing was the card key- electricity. To get the power to work in the room you had to leave your card key in the door (get an extra key). I understand they are trying to conserve energy but give an extra key...

We were deciding between paying much more for a fancier hotel or going the budget route - because we wanted to explore the Island and not stay indoors, we chose the latter and are very glad we did. Upon booking, and based on previous reviews to book on a higher level, I requested that we be placed in a room on levels 4 and above - on check-in, lovely Helene who also speaks French gave us a room on the 15th floor with unbeatable views of the coast, the city and the mountains. Our room was quite small but I think that was mainly because they stuffed a king bed in there - not that it mattered since we weren't inside much except to sleep! The bed was slightly soft for my liking but after a day of snorkelling, surfing and driving around, I can fall asleep on anything! The room was clean, air con not even necessary since the nights were so cool. My only qualm is that our toilet sink would spray every which way if you cranked it on - not too fussed though, we just had to let it trickle. The location is also great because you're close to all the action but far away enough for it not to be too busy.All in all, it was a great stay despite the fact that we didn't really spend much time in our room - I suppose that is the way you want it to be when in Hawaii.

Also, their parking lot is limited and very small. You might want to park elsewhere or rent scooters as an alternative. Parking fee is $20/Night.","Laurel, Maryland, USA",15,3.0

The only downer of the whole trip was the very poor standard of accommodation at the Aqua Aloha Surf hotel in Honolulu. Although reasonably central, the property is old, noisy and in urgent need of a makeover. Our room faced the main drag and because the windows were some sort of old style glass ""hoppers"" it was impossible to shut out the considerable traffic noise as well as the goings on of party revellers into the wee small hours. The plumbing in our room failed twice causing distressing rumbling and bubbling noises from the toilet and a discharge of dirty water and sludge into the shower recess. We were moved to the rear of the hotel for the third night which was better until the garbage trucks began their cacophony next door banging and crashing at 5am!  Ok, it wasn't the most expensive property in town but even for $130/night it was way over priced! Breakfast was ok if you're partial to a high cholesterol diet, orange cordial and the wave of a single teabag over a litre of water. Not good.","Sydney, Australia",3,1.0

The prices (~$150+) also reflect this categorization. However, this seemed to me rather as a very good budget option than midrange. The rooms are outdated with stains on the carpet, couch, and walls; the beds are not very comfortable, the rooms are rather small and feel cramped. The AC is a loud old box in the wall which makes sleeping difficult and instead opening windows at night is even louder since Waikiki is a rather busy place.The lobby looks way more modern and renovated than the rooms. But the service is very friendly and the hotel is in excellent location, just two blocks from the touristy street and beach.

I decided to go downstairs at the front desk to find out how much it would be to stay another nite. They quoted me $79 per nite ...which was ridiculous since I know that room we were staying is only worth $59 thru discounthotelshawaii.com (i think this is the website). But at $79 that's the cheapest i could find that day! I went ahead and got it anyway but continue to complain about how tiny the room was and that there' s no vanity table in the bathroom for toiletries. The front desk guy suggested that we check out first and then he will find me a better room later on as they are pretty full that day. My sister and I toured the city and when i returned later on that day I was pleasantly surprised that he upgraded me to a much better room....bigger one with bigger bed, with a balcony overseeing a beautiful view, a bathroom with vanity table and a lot more....I was a happy camper then and very appreciative for a GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.. Becoz of that...I would definitely return to this hotel....but will never get that tiny STD room tho!",,4,5.0

It was centrally located so we were able to walk every evening all over Waikiki. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was just right. We upgraded to a Superior with a King bed and got a corner room with a lanai. For staying eight days, we never felt cramped in our room. There is always city noise in Waikiki, so don't expect quiet. We were on the 9th floor which gave us a glimpse of the ocean and a view of a lot of buildings, but that was fine for us. Our bed was comfortable, and we appreciated having the mini-refrigerator and microwave for our use. Manager's Welcome Party on Tuesday evening was a treat. We loved the ukelele player and enjoyed the hosted ""Blue Wave"" drinks as we met other travellers in our hotel. Parking for our rental car was $20 a night, which we hadn't anticipated. We learned to get back to our hotel by 5:30 - 6:00 pm in order to secure a parking spot at the hotel, and then we walked in the evenings. They, unfortunately, only have about 30 or so parking spots available, so if it's full, you have to find parking somewhere else in the area. The continental breakfast is served by an independent business in the morning and is mostly just carbs (pancakes, oatmeal, toast, pastries) with hard-boiled eggs being served every third day, but it filled the spot for a while. We appreciated the hotel's coffee and tea machine that is available 24 hours. The rate we got for our room was excellent, everything was clean and nice, and we definitely will stay with Aloha Surf again when we return to Waikiki.","Auburn, California",34,5.0

The solid construction means quiet rooms, and the location puts you a convenient couple of blocks from the main part of what's left of Waikiki Beach and its mayhem, without forcing you to be part of it. There are quieter walks and jogs available along the Canal, down to Kapiolani Park.Rooms are compact but functional, with good beds and bathrooms. There are decent views from the small upper-story balconies, and the fridge, microwave, coffee maker and dishes provided allow you to eat in if you care to. The included breakfast is very weak, but it's a start. The pool is also insignificant, but there's always the beach if you want to get wet.Staff and management make a solid and generally very successful effort to provide plenty of Aloha, with one glaring exception, a desk guy named Lance. When we checked in late at night after a long flight, he was busily screwing up two other parties, even though the solution to their problems was obvious to me after a minute of listening. When his victims took time out to confer with each other, I showed him my voucher, and asked for a registration form. He snapped back that he was helping these other people, which was the opposite of the truth, so I turned to one couple, asked if I'd understood the problem, and suggested the obvious solution, which was adopted. Then someone in an upper room called, obviously repeating a complaint about noisy neighbors, and Lance snapped at him. Finally, he managed to check us in.When we were checking out to catch an early flight to Asia a few days later, there was Lance again. We had prearranged a shuttle with the concierge, and I asked him to confirm which company's shuttle we were booked on, so we could watch for it. He gave us the wrong information, and when a shuttle driver came to the lobby shouting ""Airport"", my wife went and checked with Lance, who snapped that it wasn't the right company. When our supposed shuttle was 15 minutes late, the real concierge arrived, and it turned out that Lance had given us the wrong info, and sent our shuttle away. Fortunately, it was still making its rounds, and picked us up in time to catch our flight to Taipei.A desk clerk should be able to reason and multitask without turning snippy and snarly, but Lance couldn't even task, and he was surly as well as incompetent. I'd gladly stay at the Aloha Surf again based on its reasonable rates and good location, but I'd be way happier if Lance was removing gum from the sidewalk or cleaning bathrooms rather than screwing up reception.",Queen Charlotte,243,4.0

It's a great place to visit, but narrowing down just WHERE you'll stay can be very difficult. There's so much to choose from! Do you stay that the expensive all inclusive hotels and waste half your money on amenities, or do a little more research to find out what you'll REALLY need for your stay? I've stayed in Hiltons and Marriotts in the past and they're great, but not really worth the money you pay. I will NEVER stay at a ritzy wine & dine hotel in Oahu. If that's what you're looking for then this isn't the place for you. However, if you're looking for a comfortable clean bed to sleep in.... you can't pass this place up! Seriously one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in. The room was clean and had updated furnishings/decor. Fridge, sink, microwave and eating utensils all included. As far as a hotel ROOM is concerned, this is exactly all you need for your stay in Oahu. There's so much to do in Waikiki alone that you won't be in your room much anyway. The lobby is modern and clean with a full staff 24/7 for your every need. Work-Out equipment is just off the lobby in an indoor/outdoor setting. Small clean pool (I've worked in the hot tub/sauna industry for a few years so pool standards are pretty high) just enough room to cool off and feel comfortable if a couple others happen to join you. The location is absolutely perfect! It's in the middle of Waikiki so you can walk anywhere you need to go. A grocery store (not ABC their prices are ridiculous) is just through the parking lot. They have fresh everything and the best prices I've come across. The ONLY hole in the wall sports pub is not too far away, LEGENDS.... the owner is a very nice man and he keeps polite friendly staff to make you feel at home. If/when I go back to Waikiki I will only stay at Aqua Aloha Surf, it was the right decision for me, and ANYONE looking for a great place to stay without wasting all your spending money on a top dollar hotel. Other than the rooms, amenities, aesthetics of this boutique hotel, the STAFF was absolutely wonderful to us. Couldn't be happier with our stay there.","Beaverton, Oregon",5,5.0

Based on the reviews of the Aqua Aloha, I thought I couldn't go wrong...but I was.Pros: Excellent location in terms of being able to walk to any place in Waikiki (the beach, bars, shops and restaurants). ABC store on the corner which was very convienent to grab snacks/beverages to take back to the room. The bed was a decent size and was probably one of the best hotel beds I've ever slept in - very comfortable. Cons: We upgraded to a superior room which was fine but our room (#403) faced a parking lot and, without fail, every morning woke up about 5-5:30am to the sound of garbage trucks or delivery trucks. Our lanai faced an apartment building which was so close, I could see the couple across from us doing their morning exercises. The bathroom is in need of a desperate upgrade. And finally, we were greeted every morning or evening by a cockroach. I realize we're in the tropics and things like this happen but a) this never happened at the Marriott and b) one of them showed up every day on cue.

Our room however faced a nearby apartment block so you didn't feel like you were getting any real privacy (sometimes the curtains didn't close quite fully). As it was only on the fourth floor, noise could sometimes be an issue. Also, our particular rooms was actually rented out by the hotel across the street, so you needed to cross the road whenever you wanted to ask reception anything!

Two blocks away from the beach, King's Village and Shopping-Clean and quiet (requested to have room to be higher level, away from elevators)-Free breakfast that's pretty decent-Good, quick and nice service-If you are renting a car, its nice because there's free parking half a block away along the canal (or else its 20 bucks to park underground)-The plates/microwave/utensils/fridge etc is huge help! Load up on the water and reheating cheesecake factory leftovers is great.-The beds were comfortable for me as it is soft and sinks in really nicely; however, beware, this can also be a con as my SO found the beds uncomfortable as he likes firmer beds. Cons:-The bathroom was a bit awkward as there was no actual door... it was more of an open-ish sliding door that didn't hide any unpleasant sounds. The tv was constantly cranked up high to provide privacy for my significant other (there were stomach problems)-Our card key did not work several times. We had to change it 4-5 times within a few days-The AC was not cold enough despite blasting it all night-The blowdryer did not work in our room either. It took several phone calls and 3 days to have this replaced -The elevators take a bit long (but really that can't be helped)I think with some maintenance, this hotel can definitely be better!

The breeze through the open windows made for a very comfortable temperature. There was definitely traffic noise, but afterall, this is Honolulu! Perhaps closing the windows and turning on the a/c would block out most noise. Breakfast (a nice bonus!) was sufficient and selection varied slightly daily. All staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. Check-in and out was a prompt. We really enjoyed the 24 hour complimentary coffee and ice water in the lovely open lobby/pool area. No wifi in the rooms but the cable plug-in worked just fine. The king bed was super comfy! Our only complaint would be.. the sofa-bed :( It was dirty and worn.

There were no major issues during our stay and the front desk was helpful and quick to respond to any requests. We jokingly named this the ""Mini Hotel"" because everything is small, but still gets the job done (see full review below).Breakfast - Our room came with the free breakfast which was adequate. It is mostly a variety of breakfast type breads, pancakes and cereal. They do have cut up fresh fruit which was nice and one day they had hard boiled eggs. The lady making the pancakes is super nice and the pancakes are good. The only problem is that they only give you little tiny bread plates which makes it hard to handle - just make multiple trips.Lobby/Pool - The lobby is nice and open air. There is a vending machine that sells beverages at a somewhat reasonable price and a machine that has free regular coffee or $1 fancy coffee drinks. Just off the lobby is an internet cafe and tour company. We didn't use etiher of these, so I can't comment. The pool is tiny and only has a few lounge chairs, so just plan on heading to the beach - you are in Hawaii.Room - Our room was small, which I expected, but had enough space for what we needed. The bed was very comfortable and king sized. The curtains were wearing thin in a few places and didn't slide very well open and closed, but still got the job done. The windows were very clean and our view was great, but they are the crank open slatted windows so they don't block out much noise. There is an air conditioner in the room, but we never needed to turn it on. If you opened the windows there was enough of a breeze to keep things comfortable. The room had a balcony, but it was only large enough for two patio chairs. There is a mini-fridge and a tiny microwave. There is also a safe, but it was too small to fit a regular size laptop. The room overall was clean, but looks like it could use a floor to ceiling cleaning because many of the walls had dirt spots on them. In regards to the noise issue mentioned in other reviews, it is loud. Even on the higher floors away from Ala Wai, it is still loud. So, if you have sensitivity to noise when sleeping, bring ear plugs. The noise bothered me the first night, but I got used to it after that. My boyfriend, on the other hand, never adjusted and needed his earplugs.Location - The location was perfect for our needs which was visiting friends who live in the area. If you are looking for a place very close to the water, then you will be disappointed. It is about a 5-10 minute walk to the Kalakaua Ave which is the main street along the beach. It then takes another 3 minutes or so to actually get through the hotels and out to the beach. It isn't too bad, but it isn't a quick trip down to the beach. There a a number of restaurants of varying price and type nearby, a Food Pantry grocery store a block away, and, of course, a number of ABC Stores.","San Diego, CA",42,4.0

We were also close to the bus stop, which was perfect for us. the room was very clean and was cleaned well throughout our stay. We had a balcony but it looked out onto an ugly building opposite and it was extremely noisy so not really very useful! The room was small by US standards but we were happy with it for what we paid. We had complimentary beach towels and a free safe and the shower worked fine. The pool area is tiny and so is the fitness suite so don't stay here if these things are important to you!I would have given an extra star but the day before we checked out I asked the receptionist if they could find out what time our transfer with Roberts was booked for as I hadn't received an email confirming the time. However, rather than just calling them up (which would have taken 2 minutes max) I was given a phone number and pointed to the pay phone.

I have been to Waikiki 7 times and in all my trips have stayed at an Aqua Resort, including the Aloha Surf. The first time I stayed there was great, so much so I talked the rest of my family into staying there on our return trip. I was offered a good rate for being a returning customer, however if they would have told me that I would be treated so poorly, I probably wouldn't have taken the offer. The first problem was a combination of miscommunication on both my part and theirs. We had got the dates of our arrival mixed up, and we turned up a day before they were expecting us and they had no rooms. I had called the hotel twice prior to arriving to confirm and not once anyone mentioned that they had a different date for us. Because of this, my mother, grandmother, sister in law and brother in law, my partner and my 5 month old baby and myself (6 adults and a baby) had to stay in one room for the first night. No one was overly apologetic for this, however at least we had somewhere to sleep. The next issue we had was our airconditioner was extremely loud, as well as our toilet, as they had maintenance issues with it, so we could not flush at night as it would wake our baby, it was that loud. I was also called at 10pm at night to go down to reception to sign a form in regards to beach towels etc, which they forgot to ask me to sign on check in. When I asked if I could come down in the morning as I was trying to get my baby to sleep, they said no and that I had to go down once the baby was asleep, nevermind I was in my PJ's and dead tired. This was my 2nd night so its not like they couldn't get me to sign it in the next 10 days we were there! It is in a loud location, so I wouldn't recommend anyone with a baby to stay there. However, it is close to the supermarket and not far from the beach.They take $100 bond on check in, which is fine, but we then realised they had not only taken $100 for a bond but $1000 on top of this. When we asked them about this they said it was hotel policy, so too bad if we wanted to access that money while we were there and to pay by another form of payment. They didn't mention this to us either on check-in, only discovered it when checking our account. This also caused problems on checkout as the money had been frozen (because of them) and then when we went to check out they couldn't unfreeze it and then asked for another credit card to finalised payment. We ended up walking out to catch our flight and leaving it with them to sort out as it was 5.30am and they wanted us to call our bank (in another country) to get the money unfrozen, which again, they froze in the first place without our permission. For the entire stay I felt like I was a pain, even though we asked for nothing from them and didn't complain about anything while we were there. I'm not sure what has happened with the Aqua chain over the last couple of years but it wasn't what I have remembered and would not recommend anyone staying there again.","Melbourne, Australia",4,1.0

When we arrived, their were two employees behind the desk. One was helping another customer the other seemed to be avoiding helping us. She walked away from the desk a few times, then unhappily asked us if we needed help. When she looked up our reservations (made 6 months in advance) they were nowhere to be found. She then told us they didn't have any rooms available. After a 10 minute wait, she was able to find a room for us. The room was tiny. The couch in the room was covered with stains it was disgusting.The bathroom was also tiny, it will only accomodate one person at a time. Their was no tub for my children to bathe in. The bathroom didn't even have a normal door. It was a sliding wooden door without a lock that didn't even shut completley. The balcony is no place for children! I piled up all the luggage infront of the door to make sure the kids didn't make their way out there. During our stay, people were running up and down the halls, yelling, and slamming doors well into the wee hours of the morning. Thankfully the kids never woke up but I didn't get much sleep. The area the hotel is located in can be a little scary at night. Paking is minimal and expensive. Elevators were slow. This is not the place to stay if you have kids.

It was so small I don' t know how they got the furniture in. For a small fee we upgraded to a nicer (larger) room on an upper floor (actually the one TripAdvisor uses for the hotel's profile pic). WELL WORTH the minimal fee. There's an ABC store downt the street - there's an ABC store down every street come to think of it - and you can walk down and get snacks and frosty beverages and take them back to your room to save some extra $$. I love getting their tuna roll & other triangle shaped hand rolls for breakfast.This hotel is totally cute too.

My last visit was the week of 1/10-1/17/2012. I was extremely surprised at the poor service. The rooms were not cleaned properly, there were dishes left in the sink, complimentary coffee was not provided daily, and the shower area smelled like mildew. When I called the desk to ask for coffee, I was told that I had to go downstairs and get it myself. The personnel at the front desk were rude and unwilling to help. The people at the continental buffet were rude and unfriendly. I mentioned that the pancakes were cold and the lady touched it with her fingers and then put it back on the grill to serve it to someone else. There were no bowls to put the cream of wheat into, so I was given a syrofoam cup to use.

Both of these had a similar feel to them and I understood why when I found out that the Aqua-hotels also run the Best Western I stayed at earlier. The location is pretty good (a few blocks from the beach, close to major bus lines) being both fairly central and still quiet.The check-in experience was not exactly the best. The guy at the front desk seemed less than happy having people disturb him. We arrived at around two and were told the room was not ready yet. In a sense it was fine since check-in time was at three but usually they can provide one clean room an hour before check-in (especially when they had a sign with vacancy outside the entire time we stayed there) but service did not appear to be at the top of the agenda. No offer to take care of our bags so asked if they could store and then was told it would be possible. Returned at three and the room was ready then, it was however now a lady at the front desk and had to go through showing passport (ID-card was not accepted and) providing credit card details again. The pace that she worked at was probably the slowest I ever seen - took around 10 minutes for her to just check passport, get the credit card details and then just hand us the key.The room was on a high floor and it was a pleasant surprise. The room was larger than expected with room for a sofa and table in addition to the bed. The view from the balcony was also better than expected,could see both the ocean and the river. The room also had a sink where they also placed a microwave oven, kitchen utensils, coffee maker and a fridge. The decor was however a bit worn but must admit that it was not without charm. What we could however done without was the paper thin doors. In combination with a very loud cleaning lady (she was constantly screaming, talking etc in the corridor) did not make it easy to sleep in.In the bathroom there was only a shower with not the best water pressure and it was fairly small but still sufficient. The main negative about the room was the fact that there was no WiFi - I was surprised that any hotel these days do not offer WiFi in the room. Wired internet was acceptable 10 years ago now but these days it is just not good enough to only have WiFi in the lobby. The breakfast that was provided was not good - poor selection and quality and the breakfast was only open from 7 to 9 and when we showed up at 8.50 one day there was almost no food left - asked for some additional things but was just told that this was what they had. Was then rushed to finish before 9 - not that difficult since there was almost no food.There is a pool that is fairly ok in size but it was a bit cold and also almost no sun so not the best place to hang out but I would imagine most people prefer the beach. There is also a tiny fitness center (three machines and one of these, the treadmill, was broken). Nice added benefit was however they provide beach towels free of charge.Price-wise the hotel is still a decent deal but I do believe that there are better options in the same price range (for example I would rather stay at the Best Western Coconut that I stayed at earlier). Would probably not repeat the stay here next time mainly due to the lack of service attitude among the personnel, poor breakfast and lack of WiFi in the rooms.","Stockholm, Sweden",178,3.0

I picked the hotel initially based on the reviews on trip advisor. And boy were the reviews right- great room for great price, great location and great atmosphere. Warm and friendly staff and free brekky! The only issues really 1. Would prefer a kettle instead of a coffee machine that way could have tea or coffee option. 2. It wolud great if free internet was avaible in rooms wireless - it was hard as there were not too many power outlets to plug in your laptop. We had no qualms staying there on our return to Waikiki. I have been slow to Put in a review, but from the recent reviews , it sounds like the standards are being maintained. Hawaii was such a lovely surprise experience for us, in that I didn't really have any expectations. mainly as I am not really a beach goer (plus we have great beaches here in Sydney). but was so blown away by the wonderful people and thewonderful place it is.

A lot has changed in a decade since I was last here. The hotel had been sold and renovated. Its a bit more modern and tried to look trendy but theres nothing fancy about it. Its a 2 star, barely, and I didnt expect much. I got what I expected for $80. Booked on line thru expedia and stayed in late November.I had a single room with a queen bed. My room was 200 square feet. Yes thats right 200 sq ft including the bath room. For those who arent good with math a queen size bed takes up about a third of that area and the bath room the other third. Also crammed in there was a desk a night stand and a mini fridge with microwave. It was cozy to say the least. Im glad it was just me. There would have been no room for a wife any way. The bed was comfy with good linnen. The bathroom had only a shower, no tub. Thats the way it was a decade ago. My room was on the 2nd floor with a scenic view of the top of the lobby canopy and air conditioning units. The pool was ice cold. I dont understand why on Oahu other than expensive energy costs, they dont heat the pools. Its like they dont want people to use them. All the pools on Maui are heated. Wifi in the lobby. Internet in the room is free but requires cat 5 cord which they will loan from the front desk. They also loaned nice beach towels out too.On Wed night the manager has a blue hawiian cocktail party that was a nice touch. Staff were friendly and helpful. Theres a full grocery store at the end of the block. The beach is 2 and a half blocks away.One thing they need is a courtesy room or poolside change room with showers for guests to freshen up at if they have a late flight out. I cant believe Mexico is ahead of Hawaii on this.This is a cheap, clean basic hotel.

There was only a shower (no bath) but plentiful hot water.There was a good deal of noise from the hallway and Ala Wai Blvd, and from the hallway, both of which I could sleep through. The noise that I found most bothersome was from the previously adjoining room. While it was closed off, it was off-putting to hear someone coughing in the next room.I did not go for the included breakfast because it was only available for short times (7am-8:30am I believe), and that didn't work for my schedule.I was pleased with the hotel service - they extended my checkout time by an hour so that I could spend my last morning at the beach, and stored my luggage until it was time for me to leave for the airport.Tips:This hotel is an extra block away from the beach if you're comparing to the Kuhio Avenue hotels.

The hotel is somewhat dated (but has been revamped in recent years). It is centrally located (near many shops and transport modes) and not far from the main beach. The hotel's lobby area is spacious, comfortable, welcoming. The rooms are clean, tidy, comfortable, adequately equipped with the essential utilities. Staff are genuinely friendly, polite, competent, efficient, accommodating. The hotel Manager (Tim Clark) is an excellent manager who is very friendly and genuinely listens to his hotel customers. I personally know of very few managers who seem to constantly monitor customer feedback (on sites such as Trip Advisor) and genuinely make the effort to address negative feedback. One such example is the hotel's internet availability: Earlier in the year I (whilst I was planning our Hawaii itinerary) I had noticed (through TripAdvisor) that there had been some criticism of internet unavailability in the hotel's rooms; this matter was certainly resolved by the time of our stay. Regarding noise, many of the hotel rooms seem to be equipped with louvres (rather than glazed windows); when these louvers are not (or do not) shut properly, the room air conditioners are forced to work constantly and give rise to elevated (but tolerable) noise levels. For those who happen to be spending Tuesday night at the hotel, take the opportunity to enjoy the Manager's Happy Hour- free cocktails accompanied by a free sideshow of entertainers including musicians, magicians and masseurs! (quite a spectacle, particularly for kids!). In summary: This hotel is quite comfortable, enjoyable, good-value for the standard of accommodation it provides (and particularly suited for visitors of all ages on average travel budgets). Hotel staff are friendly and the hotel Manager (Tim Clark) is a genuinely caring Manager to deal with. Highly recommended. Tim, we hope to see you again on our next Hawaiian trip!","Brisbane, Australia",3,4.0

After a 7 night cruise we made our next stop at this location. We arrived in the morning from our cruise - about 10:40 AM and we were told that our room was not ready and would not be ready until at least 12:30 PM. We kind of expected that and I knew this hotel has laundry facility so we asked if we could go do that first. Our front desk check in person appeared to be quiet, soft spoken and not the most helpful. He did tell us we could leave our suitcases safely with them - but did not tell us where laundry was, or that we needed a key, nor how to find the laundry room itself! We eventually found the basement location - a small room tucked away back in a corner - locked for safety - with 2 washers and dryers. Now although the cost of the machines was good - one washer leaked and there was a puddle of water in the corner and the room smelled musty. Someone had a wash on and a drying on and the washers run quickly and the dryer goes for a long time so we spent all of our time there waiting for the drying person to come back and take out their stuff so we could finish our washing! The room iyself was very hot and the vent came out right outside the door so it was a sauna around the area - no place to sit and I had no faith to go and leave our stuff unattended! Also the dryer vent screen was loose and so a lot of lint stuff flying around - in fact some bikes parked outside the door were covered in lint. A little care could be given to this area!Once we were done laundry, our room was ready. We only had a double bed and a single bed and after having had 2 queens at the last hotel - this was a little disappointing. The room itself was adequate and did have a couch which was a nice change and much more comfy to sit on. We also had dishes which previous hotel did not - we were able to purchase food items we bought from the Food Pantry - a block away - and save ourselves some money and provide convenience. The small fridge was inside a cupboard and seemed to be running quite hot when the door was closed - we left the cupboard door ajar and it seemed to work better.The Air conditioner was located in the far corner, beside the couch and down by the floor. It was extrememly difficult to get the whole room down to a bearable temp as the air does not circulate like it should. We never did feel comfortable unless stting right beside couch and I found myself getting up in the night and sleeping on the couch for awhile to cool down. Previous location had central air - much better!Pool area was small - but ok area and a BBQ for customer use as well as nice wicker loungers and cushions. We actually enjoyed the pool several times. There is also a nice seating area - open air - with table and chairs - all part of the lobby area that was quite nice. Large TV in lobby, water to drink etc. No view from our room what so ever, not that it was a huge deal and although it was up one block off of Kuhio - was no where near as convenient as previous Aqua Hotel. The room cleaner - we asked only for clean towels and more coffee on the 2nd day so she got off lightly. On the next day we were out - but she left no coffee, no spare Toilet Paper but left extra towels. To be fair - we could have gone and asked for it - but it was annoying just the same.We did have occasion to ask other questions of the front desk staff and found everyone else to be completely friendly and helpful. I had no problem booking a spa appt, getting directions or getting my boarding passes printed. I took advantage of the Early Bird Spa Special on the day my son went golfing and highly recommend it!

I stayed 4 nights (Tues. - Fri.) in Oct. '11. Staff was friendly. All inquiries were handled smoothly & immediately. Room was very clean, bed was incredibly comfy, excellent water pressure in shower & all room amenities were new and in good working order. No problems with noise from other guests or staff - very quiet in that respect. Location can't really be beat especially for the price, but the trade off is you should expect noise. I was on the 12th floor (street side) and had street noise until about 11 pm. Slept soundly. Woke up to garbage trucks at 6 am but easily went back to sleep once they moved on. Despite upgrades, hotel shows its age & is a no-frills type of place. Only vending area was in the lobby. No valet & apparently no bellhops (not a big deal to me), but they did have a friendly security guy who wasn't bashful about doing his job. Parking is $20/night self-parking in area below lobby & lot next to hotel. (Tip: If you think you might rent a car, reserve it before your trip on a daily basis but be aware of return times. Easier to cancel a reservation than to try to get a car on a walk-in basis.) Room was on the small side - roughly 12'x14' and had no seating, simply the bed or the floor. Other rooms might offer more, but because I was traveling alone I was simply looking for an inexpensive place to sleep & shower, with a few specific amenities. No bathtub, only small shower stall, but again, had excellent pressure so no complaints. TV had your typical ABC, NBC, CBS fare. No premium channels. Overall, rough around the edges, but tries & was more than satisfactory for what I needed/wanted. Must say I know people who would NOT have stayed there and if I'd been traveling with a companion, might have upgraded a bit (something nicer in the same hotel?) but was fine for just me. Would recommend to certain personalities, but not for everyone. Again, solid 3+, but not a place if you're looking for luxury.","Galesburg, Illinois",12,3.0

We booked this vacation through discounthawaiicarrental.com. We had originally booked the standard room but called ahead of time to upgrade the room to a superior room based on the reviews here. At check in the front desk seemed a little stressed from being busy, probably could have used another person but was nice to us, this seemed to be the same each time we needed the front desk. I parked the car after check in which is $20 per day under the hotel. There’s not much parking under there, although we did find a spot each day, there’s also additional parking nearby if it’s full.Our room was on the 14th floor which had a nice view of the city and balcony which we enjoyed. The room was still very small. Which made us glad we upgraded, can’t imagine how small the standard room would have been. Room had a fridge, small TV, we did have a king bed which was very comfortable. The bathroom was ok, very small vanity separated from the business side of the bathroom.The continental breakfast was included with our room, which we had 2 of the 3 mornings. It was good considering other continental breakfasts hotel try to serve you. Other things: The lobby was very nice and open air as is much of Waikiki. We arrived on a Tuesday which had the manager’s reception which was nice. Free drinks, free 5 min chair massages (sign up early cause the line gets long). There’s a small pool which you would probably only use for a quick refresher, not really for lounging. They offer towels for use at the beach at the front desk.Overall: It’s an above average budget hotel, rooms are really all that, but the location is good as well as the amenities and price.

The service was great and staff very friendly. We had a small maintenance problem which was taken care of very quickly. Unfortunately I was told at the time I booked a few weeks before that we would have a room with 3 beds and found they only had a queen with sofa bed available to us. It seems that if you reserve a room (with payment) you should get what you request, especially if you are told you will, but hotels have the practice of giving preference to walk-up customers to make sure they get the business. However, after I reminded them of being promised the extra bed, they did put us in a room like we wanted the next night.  I did feel the quality of one of the rooms was a little lacking--the curtains were broken and had holes in them, and the air conditioner did not work very well. But both rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable.  We enjoyed the breakfast- it was limited to the usual continental breakfast fare- but was a nice bonus.  All in all, we enjoyed our stay here, and I give kudos to the staff for being very helpful and friendly which makes a big difference, and I would stay here again.",Atlanta,0,4.0

You can stay at the Sheraton for the same price sometimes but you won't get airfare for half price. If you are looking at this it's because it fits your budget. Don't expect a fancy hotel and you'll be fine. Also don't expect to be treated sweetly if you come in with a hot temper. No one likes to be treated badly, including people who work in hotels.That said, our room was very clean and the staff are all very nice. I never went in the pool but I sat there a couple of times and it's okay for a tiny pool. Little kids seemed to have a good time there. We were upgraded upon arrival and got a room on 15th floor. One major bonus to this hotel is the balconies. We ate out there every morning and sipped drinks in the evening. Location is nice too. We went to the grocery store every day for fresh fruit and snacks. I'm only giving 3 stars because the room decor is dated, the beds are queen, parking is $20 (when available - so call ahead if you are driving in from the airport) and it's not on the water.

After some research, I decided to go with the Aloha Surf and Spa Hotel as I had read good things about it. The price was low and the service was fantastic. On Tuesdays, they have a complimentary happy hour in which they serve a cocktail they make (the name slips my mind), and my friends and I loved it. Craig and Ofelia were so nice, and they just seemed so happy to go around the lobby, giving out chocolates and pouring their signature cocktails into empty glasses. Our room was great, and much to our surprise came with a microwave, coffee pot, and fridge. The location of the hotel is wonderful as well - just a few blocks from the main shopping streets, and a half a block from a beautiful canal that is perfect for jogging along. Everything is near by, which is what I look for in a hotel. Combine it with the price, and you've got a winner. The only minor setback is the breakfast - it is $4.95 for some pancakes, muffins, toast, and oatmeal. Personally, I dont think it's worth the price. If it was complimentary, then that would have been great. But given the small selection, I'd go elsewhere for breakfast.But regardless of that set back, I still gave it an excellent rating - I think the hotel is absolutely wonderful and I recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in Honolulu.

It's a good budget hotel, but I would stress that it is definitely a budget hotel. My interactions with the front desk staff was limited but they all seemed very nice. The Tuesday happy hour hosted by the manager was delicious. The location is very convenient right off of the two main-drags of Waikiki. The room was ok sized and the bed was comfy. However, the sofa was clearly stained and the curtains were pretty shabby and had cuts in them. The vanity area was very fine. The bath/shower was ok but it clearly needed to be updated. I know some people would have not accepted the minor stains under the tub faucet. I like the power saving feature I've seen a lot in Europe with the door key but it was frustrating to have to reset the time on the clock every night b/c it lost power every time I took my keycard out of the slot. The window a/c unit had a nifty remote but unfortunately the a/c is poorly positioned. It blows the cool air right onto the side of the sofa, which prevents it from getting across the room to the bed. The flat screen tv was fine but having a paper channel listing would have been nice.As other reviews have mentioned, the breakfast is pretty bad. I've seen a lot of continental breakfasts and other than the freshly made pancakes, it is the worst I've ever seen. Besides the pancakes, you have the choice of sliced apples and oranges, small grocery store bought muffins, some bread to toast and what looked like angel food cake. Plus some punch type drink. It was included in the price of my room but if not you can purchase it for $5. I'd go to IHOP instead. Overall, though, considering how much time I spent in my room, which wasn't much, I'd give this place a 3 out of 5.","Arlington, Virginia",22,3.0

Coming from overseas, we didn't have a useable mobile phone so were pleased that local calls made at the hotel was free. We stayed here for 5 nights and on day 2 reported that the phone was not working. We alerted this to the reception staff the next day (again). He said that he had sent somebody over (yet the phone was still not working). Finally on day 4, the phone was fixed (yay) and we could make whatever local reservations required....We got charged incorrectly for parking (so check your invoices)- the reception staff was quite rude about this (no apologies) and when I tried clarifying a couple of things, she was condescending.

My wife and I have stayed at the Aqua Aloha Surf twice now. We liked it so much the first time that we booked it again for our wedding last year.We upgraded to their best suite, which is on the top floor in the corner, facing the beach and the front road. There is a great wrap-around porch that is roomy enough to have a few of your friends over to have a drink and watch the sun set.There is a separate bedroom with a king bed, a living room with a wet bar containing a microwave, fridge, sink, and basic servingware. The bathroom is basic, clean, and functional. Our friends and family had booked a few other rooms in the Aqua, and our suite quickly became the hangout. Free breakfast is served in the lobby each day, again fairly basic, but exactly what we were looking for; a good selection of breads, eggs, fruits, juices, and coffee. There is a small pool out back, but as many others have commented, with the beach so close, why go to the pool?The underground parking garage is small, and on our first trip to the Aloha Surf, we found ourselves having to park in the lot next to the hotel; no extra charge, but just something to keep in mind, be sure to request your spot early. The day after our wedding we made use of the small, yet affordably priced spa to book a few last minute massages. The therapists were great, and made every effort to accommodate us, even though our booking very last minute. Throughout our stay the entire staff were gracious and helpful, always working hard to make sure that we were taken care of. It's worth noting because it's the staff that can make or break a stay, and every time we've been to this hotel all of the staff have made us feel welcome.In short, it was a great stay, and the Aloha Surf is a great place, we enjoyed our time there, and we're looking forward to visiting again soon.","San Diego, California",34,4.0

I was only in Honolulu for 3 nights, and this was the only time we didn't have a rental car. We mainly went to the island to see the typical tourist attractions Pearl Harbor, Polynesian Cultural Center, State Capitol and more. I booked this hotel as part of a package that included my air to the islands, and all inter-island flights, in addition to package tours on this island. I had other arrangements for lodging and transportation on the 3 other islands we visited.The hotel was clean and provided a continental breakfast every morning. This is very nice and can save you lots of money in a place where everything is expensive. They also have free copies of the local newspaper available to help you keep up with the rest of the world. This is sometimes difficult to do because of the time difference. I landed on the island right after the news broke about the death of Osama bin Laden. I read all about it the next morning in the free paper.The hotel is just a few blocks from Waikiki beach and all the ""fancy"" hotels, yet costs just a fraction of what they charge. The hotel will ""loan"" you beach towels to take to the beach. Our room was on the 11th floor near the top and we had a small, but nice balcony. Depending on the time of year, you can open all the windows and get a great breeze through the room. A unique thing about the room is that there is a master control switch for all the electricity in the room. You insert your card key into a slot on the wall to activate the entire room. If you don't have the card, then you don't have any power. This is kind of strange, but I think it is a great way to conserve power! How many of us leave our rooms for the day, with the A/C cranked and every light on? There is a small refrigerator and a FREE safe in each room as well. We went to the ABC store on the corner and purchased a bottle of rum and had a few cocktails in the room. We took the remainder of the rum (in my wife's purse) on our trip to the Polynesian Cultural Center. It is a great place, but (since it is run by the Mormons) there is no alcohol on the premises. During the Luau there, we added the rum to our punch for a little extra kick. We were close to the pickup locations for our charter tours, and close to lots of shopping and dining. I would stay here again. There is also a city bus stop a few blocks away which we utilized as well. The rooms are not big by any stretch. The bathroom is tiny and has a pocket door. We did not use the small pool onsite, but it looked clean and inviting. While this place is not fancy, it is clean, affordable and convenient.

The regular rooms are clean and small, with a microwave and a refrigerator. We were able to fit leftovers in the fridge and microwave them for lunch the next day. If you get a good price and are on a budget, this is a good option. The beach is a short five to ten minute walk away and the hotel will give you beach towels. The staff are nice. By saving money here, you could also splurge on a nice meal at one of the beachfront hotel restaurants. We did not eat at any, but a few came highly recommended by the hotel staff and some of the O'ahu guidebooks. Plan on spending a bit though for these. Avoid Jimmy Buffet's and the Surfboard Museum, unless you like over-priced drinks and food at a ""touristy"" place. Spend your money at the nicer beachfront restaurants or at one of the local bars. I would not recommend for a long stay unless you fully vette out the suites. It may be comfortable, but for the single rooms they are small and have no kitchenette. The continental breakfast is so-so. Five bucks gets you pancakes, donuts, and oatmeal. There is a restaurant one or two blocks toward the ocean that will give you a nice full plate and coffee for about eight dollars. I'd recommend that. Tuesdays be sure to go to the manager's reception from 5 to 6 pm where the hotel serves it's free specialty mixed drink and provides entertainment (live music, massage table, and magician). General O'ahu tip: no need to rent a car. While it may seem that taking the buses and shuttles come out to about the same price as a rental, don't forget about paying for overnight parking at the hotels. This can run you up to $40 a night. You might be able to find a deal, but check it out. We found that the buses were clean and safe and the shuttles took you wherever you want, including Pearl Harbor.","Illinois City, Illinois",36,3.0

The property seems to go down hill a little each year - small things that add up to a poor visit. Desk service to begin with was poor. They couldn't find our reservation when we arrived so asked to see our confirmation. The next morning at breakfast they asked for our tickets, which we hadn't been given so back we went to the front desk. He checked our reservation and said ""you're checking out today"" and we responded no -four more days. At that point we had to go up to the room for the confirmation again. That's just the beginning but explains why we didn't go back to complain about the variety of small things that continued during our stay - clearly customer service is not a strength here any longer!. Small problems included no lock on balcony door, missing bedside light bulb, no faucet water pressure (clogged screen), small room although we'd paid extra for upgrade, and the list goes on.

We ate some of our evening meals in our room - peanut butter & jelly sandwiches, carrot sticks, bananas, etc that we purchased from an ABC store about a half a block away. Milk is very expensive in Hawaii so did not purchase milk. The hotel has a sufficient breakfast - pancakes, toast, muffins, cake, oranges & apples & oatmeal. The meal is served 7-8:30 am. (Room rate is breakfast for 2 people - additional people in room are $2 per person). The attendant is ""timely"" on opening and closing!

We chose this hotel because of the reasonable price, decent Tripadvisor rating, and the continental breakfast. We decided that we would rather have a longer trip at a cheaper hotel, then shorter at somewhere more expensive... in hindsight, I probably wouldn't do that again. Lobby: the lobby looks pretty good when you first arrive, but the front desk service was a little slow. Not a big deal, I mean you're on vacation so where do you have to go? But for what it's worth, it was slow.Room: So the room was pretty pathetic. I mean I understand that it's Waikiki so there isn't a lot of space but the room was TEENY TINY! I have never ever been in a smaller hotel room. The bathroom had a pocket door because there wouldn't be any room for a real door, and although there was a full size closet, you couldn't get to half of it because the bed/nightstand completely covered it. The TV was pretty small and wasn't centered with the bed, so that was kind of weird. I've read a lot of reviews that have said ""the room is small, but how much time do you spend in there anyway."" But I'm telling you this room was itsy-bitsy no matter how much or how little time you spend. I would definitely not recommend the room for more than 2 people and that's pushing it. Breakfast: My husband and I aren't very picky about food so we thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast... especially since it was free. But as many people have said, the selection is pretty limited. They made pancakes every morning and then had 2 mini donut options and 2 fruit options. They also had oatmeal, coffee and hot water. There's just something different about the pineapple in Hawaii so I filled up on that every day! Our main issue was breakfast was the limited serving hours. It was pretty early for us, so we missed it a couple times, and more than once we ran down in our PJs just to catch it in time. But like a said, free is free, and we enjoyed that.Fitness equipment: was pretty much a joke. I never once saw anyone use it. It was pretty much right in the lobby and it's so hot outside I don't know who would. I think they have the equipment just to say they have it, but everyone knows it's just there for decoration. If I remember correctly it was like 1 treadmill and 1 stationary bike...Pool: Like the room - teeny tiny - but nice enough. A lot of hotels in Waikiki don't even have pools so I appreciated this. We were a little annoyed because they spent about 2 hours cleaning it one day and kept saying they would open in half an hour, but that kept extending. It wouldn't have been a big deal but because they only had 6 lounge chairs, I didn't want to go back up to the room and then get out there and not get a chair. We spent most days at the beach though, so the pool wasn't too much of an issue.Parking: a lot of people have complained about the parking, but it's pretty clear on their website you'll be charged. We just factored it into our budget for the trip so we weren't upset. We always parked in the outside lot instead of underground and never had trouble getting one spot. Overall this hotel was OK. The room was cleaned every day, we had plenty of towels, the front desk was helpful enough and ultimately... you're 3 blocks from the world famous Waikiki beach and within walking distance of tons of shopping and hotels. So it's good enough. Would we stay here again? No probably not. I would recommend it to my low maintenance friends who live on a budget, but I would not recommend it to anyone who is even slightly picky and has a little bit more money.","Los Angeles, California",108,3.0

WOW! I've NEVER paid that much to park somewhere which didnt even matter because the parking was full, & the guy recommended a parking structure about a block away when theres another pay lot next to them for the same price as the hotel, the room was smaller than my closet, there is NO room to walk if you have 2 people without crawling on the bed to get around, you get off the front of the bed, boom your in the bathroom (which still had trash in it when we checked in)......the ac was blowing towards the tv which is all located on the SIDE of the bed, I don't know about you but I like to enjoy the ac but Im sure the tv enjoyed it!, Maintenance doesn't work at night so if you clog the toilet or something your S.O.L., the ONE thing that I did LOVE was the saving on electricity card in the wall thing, that was pretty neat!

We went into it not expecting ""elite"" service, and actually came away feeling that we were well taken care of. And so with eyes wide open, our stay was actually very enjoyable, and we felt the staff really exceeded our expectations.Reservation: I actually was looking at a couple of Aqua properties, but I asked the lady on the phone, and she was able to tell me which hotels were under renovation during my stay. That helped in selecting the right hotel. I even called multiple times in the same day to ask more questions, and she (was the same lady each time) was really friendly and helpful.Location: Really, 5 minutes from the beach. We brought our 8-month old, and it was never a problem walking with her. I asked at the Front Desk for overnight hotel parking (rented a car for 2 days), but there wasn't a space available. There's a few metered parking spots on the street, and I was always able to find parking (you can park for free on Ala Moana near the canal (if you can get a spot) or at the metered spots after 6pm (but you have to move it again before 7am). Same or 1 block distance to the bus/trolley stops. I even walked to The Rainbow Drive-in with no problems. For the price, you're really getting good access to Waikiki.Room: Great view! (we stayed on the top 16th floor) Again, for the price, this couldn't be beat. With the A/C on, I couldn't hear any of the street noise, and we slept soundly. With it off, I could hear the car honks, even someone yelling (but nothing to the point of having to bring ear plugs, like I read other hotels GIVING to their guests to block out the noise). The room was always clean. Now that I think of it, the deadbolt doesn't actually work, but I never felt unsafe. Everything worked, ample plugs throughout the room for my electronics. Bathroom is decent (ours had a basin sink and slate floors).Breakfast: It's 7a-8:30a. Pancakes, oatmeal, a couple of fresh fruit selections, and some type of small baked good (mini-muffins or doughnuts). OJ, milk, coffee, water. The restaurant it's served in has maybe 8-10 tables seating 4 people each, so it's not BIG -- but again, don't expect a banquet and it won't disappoint. Think of a Starbucks-sized vending machine with pancakes. Just enough to wake you up -- we only ate there half the time, to be honest, because we wanted to try other places in Hawaii. But if you're on a budget, you could fill up on what they had to offer and it would tide you over to lunch.Staff: Very friendly. Funny too. Again, go into this expecting to get what you're paying for. You're not paying for someone to carry you to your room via piggyback or rose petals; you're paying for a room to relax in, in between the things you do in Hawaii. I asked for suggestions, and I got them. I joked around with the staff, and we all had a good time. One lady came in almost like she was expecting to be greeted at the threshold of the hotel and waited on hand and foot, as if she was paying for service by the minute. My wife and I came in as if we were renting a room from a college friend, and we always felt welcome. One staff member, Nolan, was really helpful to us; we learned midway in our trip that he was leaving for the Disney place, which was a shame, but he lives closer to Aulani and it was a better opportunity for him. But Vinh and the rest of the staff were just as friendly. OVERALL, just ""hang loose"", don't be uptight, and everything's gonna be alright. :) If you prefer to be pampered by servants instead of helped out by friends, this probably isn't your cup of tea. Book the place knowing you can save and still feel safe.PROS: Location, price, serviceCONS: Limited hotel parking",California,3,5.0

Small rooms...well, you are in Hawaii....hello...GO OUTSIDE!!! However, upon reading that I looked and saw I could upgrade to a superior room that offered 340 sq. feet compared to 220 sq. ft. I did that and found the room to be a very nice size (large if you compare to European hotels) with couch, coffee table, dresser, mini fridge, dishware, microwave, small kitchen sink and balcony with 2 chairs. I saved money by being able to save my leftovers and reheat them! I read the staff was unfriendly....WHAT? The review writer must be some nasty person because every member of the staff was helpful, kind and went above and beyond trying to help us. A maintenance staff member even went out on the back roof after I dropped my hair clip (I know...but I got it in Italy) from the 15th floor and retrieved it for me!The managers reception (every Tuesday) was a treat. Free ""Wipeout"" cocktails, chair massages (get there on time...only 12 lucky people get a 5 minute massage!) and staff circulating with chocolate covered macadamia nuts. Bathrooms were a tiny bit outdated, but not a hint of mold or mildew anywhere...very clean and stand up shower was a very good size. A/C worked fantastic.

It's near the International Market which has great pineapple non-alchololic drinks. The rooms felt a little small in space, but everything does in Waikiki.

Fortunately, through TripAdvisor, I was able to contact a couple that had stayed here who countered the unpleasant reviews with a glowing review. After all, some of the reviews I read spoke about bedbugs. Upon check in I was pleasantly surprised and happy. The front desk personnel were friendly and nice. The room, although small, sufficed for two adults. It was clean and well kept. Very nice comfortable room with plush mattresses. Yes, it is an older hotel but we were in Ohau to visit not to stay inside a resort. The hotel met our purposes very well.

Cleanliness; We stayed in the 10th floor. they clean the room, change the towels, refill the toiletries everyday. And if you need extra assistance, Merlinda the housekeeper is always willing to help. Hospitality: The front desk staff are always helpful. The people that serve breakfast are all nice. They have the Managers Special every Tuesday. Mr. Tim is amazing.

You can use the internet but they don't have wireless and you have to borrow a cable from the lobby or bring your own. The room was very old and had a lot of holes in the walls (not from fists but from stuff that had one time been hanging). It could use some paint. The floors were carpetted but really old and dingy. The bathroom only had a shower... no bathtub. The windows were really thin so you could hear the street noise. I was on the 15th floor so I was able to still sleep through the noise.The curtains were probably the original and had stains all over. Very dingy. I found the mirror hung on the entire wall behind the bed pretty tacky. I did not use the pool but did walk past it. It was brownish but I think that was from the bottom of the pool and hopefully not just the water. I didn't fully inpsect the situation. The hotel has breakfast which starts at 0700. I didn't try it because I checked out prior to it starting. I think if you book through the hotel, breakfast is included but if you book through another website it is not.

We were told that this was a delivery to a nearby supermarket and that it happened every day. We asked if we could be moved and the hotel management were very good - they put us on a higher floor on the opposite side of the building - that solved the problem nicely.Our main problem was with parking. On our arrival the car park was full and we had to park in a nearby public car park which cost $18 overnight. We had to move the car before 7 am in order to avoid an additional full day's parking fee. We complained to the hotel about the parking and they issued us with a parking permit and assured us that we wouldn't have a problem again - we didn't, for the next two days as we arrived back between 5 and 6 pm. On the next day we returned at 10.30 and there were no spaces so we were next door again, having to move the car by 7 am. We complained again and the staff did what they could to try to resolve the situation. The problem is though that there simply are not enough spaces, even for people with permits. It was explained to us that some people use the car park illegally and that reduces the spaces for guests.

Stayed only 2 nites in Waikiki before moving over to Turtle Bay on the North Shore. The hotel is a located on the canal side of Waikiki and I do have to say, I did miss the direct ocean views. However, our view from Deluxe Room 1402 on the corner of the 14th floor did privide a peek-a-boo ocean view which was a pleasant suprise. The location of the hotel was great, central enough to all that Waikiki has to offer. We didnt spend much time at the hotel other than for sleeping and showering....and the bed was sooo comfy! Just wanted to roll up that mattress and take it home with me! Decent room size (we had a corner room) and never had any problems with water tempature as noted by other guests. One negative is the price for parking! 20$ a day is a bit of a buzzkill.....and its very hard to find street parking in the evening. We decided just to pay for the two days that we were there since we didnt have to worry about paying for parking on the other side of the island. But, parking would have ran us 160$ if we had stayed in Waikiki the length of our vacation and that would have been a major negative with us. Maybe the hotel should consider discounting parking rates depending on the length of your stay? Wandered over to the lil bar and grill accross the way at the Sand Villa.....open late for pupus and cocktails....great prices, decent food. All in all, had a great stay, would definatley stay again if we were in Waikiki.....would definatley suggest this hotel for budget minded travelers or those who like a nice comfy home base who plan on using the amenties of nature to spend the day.....not the infinity pool and tennis courts of thier hotel.

The hotel is clean and comfortable, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the price is very reasonable.The hotel is located on a side street that runs between busy Kuhio Ave and Ala Wai Blvd, so you’re away from the worst of the traffic. That’s not to say you won’t hear sirens or other noises – this is a major city, after all – but if you ask for a room at the back of the hotel rather than facing Kanekapolei St, you should enjoy relative peace and quiet. Rooms can be very small. The most basic, the moderate, is tiny and has no balcony. Not a problem if you’re staying just a night or two and plan to use the room only for sleeping and showering, but if you’re staying longer, you’ll be more comfortable in something larger. We had a deluxe with balcony, which is considerably more spacious and includes a sofa as well as dishes and cutlery.This was our second stay at the Aqua Aloha in two years. The beds have been replaced since our last visit and are really comfortable. Breakfasts are pretty much as before – basics like pancakes, oatmeal, toast and sliced fruit, which you may want to augment with yogurt, milk and real fruit juice from the ABC Store down the street – but they may no longer be included in the room rate. Breakfast was part of our vacation package and is, I believe, included if you book directly with the hotel, but if you go through a third party, you may have to pay. Another minor change is that you now need cards, issued at check-in, to get beach towels from the front desk. Internet access is available throughout the hotel – wireless in the lobby, via Ethernet cable in your room, though we were actually able to get wireless connection there too. The in-room safe is big enough for a laptop. The hotel is a two-minute walk to the beach. If you’re a jogger, the sidewalk along Ala Wai Canal, right beside the hotel, is a popular spot. There’s a city-owned 18-hole golf course on the other side of the canal and public tennis courts an easy walk away at Kapiolani Park and Diamond Head Tennis Centre. The zoo and aquarium are also within easy walking distance. TheBus, O’ahu’s great public transit system, will get you to many other places of interest without the hassle of renting and parking a car. The nearest stop, which serves many routes, is just a moment from the hotel. This time we rode TheBus to Hanauma Bay, Hawaii’s Plantation Village, the Lyon Arboretum, Manoa Falls and the Honolulu Academy of Arts. On our previous visit TheBus took us on a circle tour around the island, to Senator Fong’s Plantation and Garden, Makapuu Point and Lighthouse, Pearl Harbour, the Bishop Museum and Kailua Bay, among other destinations.The Aqua chain has a number of hotels in Waikiki. I haven’t stayed in any others so can’t comment on their facilities or service, but we walked past several and on that basis I’d say the Aloha Surf and Spa wins hands down for the quietest location (least road traffic) and biggest lobby (nice setting for weekly manager’s cocktail party). Definitely recommended, provided you're looking for comfort rather than luxury.","Victoria, BC",393,5.0

The hotel is handy for Waikiki beach, being only a five minute walk, but located by the Ala Wai canal which means it is a little quieter than some hotels on the main road.The staff are very friendly, the breakfast is basic but welcome, the hotel is very clean, the pool is small but nice if you can get in early and reserve a space and some of the views from the higher floors are great. Also has free internet, which is not always a given in some larger, chain hotels.We booked through priceline so got a really good deal but would recommend this hotel to anyone.We heard that the canal could be dangerous at night but saw no evidence of this being true. The canal is in fact quite a nice walk during the day time, particularly if you're going to Bailey's for some vintage Hawaiian shirts.One problem - when you get the bus from the airport, the Aloha Surf can be quite far down the drop-off order. It is literally a one minute walk from the regular bus stop though, so do consider saving a bit of money and just taking the scheduled bus rather than the airport express.There is also a one way system in operation on some streets for those who are driving.","Houston, Texas",24,4.0

It is a small, boutique hotel with clean rooms, good service, great personnel, and an outstanding value for the price we paid. We took a deluxe room with a large king-size bed, a couch, a small refrigerator, coffee-maker, and a microwave oven, which is a rarity in almost all other hotels. The microwave was extremely useful in heating muffins, biscuits, and leftover food that we brought back from restaurants (we stayed for a week). The room had plates, bowls, coffee cups, and silverware too. It was nice to sit on the balcony with our morning coffee, watching the sun come up. True, we could not see the beach from the hotel, but we could look the other way and have a magnificent view of the Koolau Mountains, Palolo Valley, the Kaimuki district, and Manoa Valley (home of the University of Hawaii). We could also see early morning canoe paddlers and kayakers in the Ala Wai Canal, as well as golfers across the canal, and walkers and joggers along the canal.The hotel also provided free coffee or hot tea in the lobby in addition to a free copy of the daily, local newspaper. On Tuesday afternoons, there is a Manager's Reception during which there was musical entertainment, free massages, chocolate-covered macadamia nut candies, and the hotel's signature drink called a Wipeout. According to Manager/""Bartender"", Tim Clark, the drink consisted of vodka, blue curacao, pineapple juice, and coconut cream. Yes, they were delicious, and you could have all you wanted!The location of the hotel is very nice too. It is a short two-block walk to the beach and what would be considered the Heart of Waikiki. Walk straight down Kanekapolei Street and you'll come right to Kalakaua Avenue (the main artery of Waikiki) and the Moana Surfrider Hotel, which was the first hotel ever built in Waikiki. The beach is just to the left of the hotel. Walk to the right along the avenue, and you will come to all the shops and restaurants you could possibly want in Waikiki. By the way, around the corner on Kuhio Avenue (and a short two-minute walk from the hotel) is the Food Pantry. It is the ONLY full-service supermarket in Waikiki. We picked up all our snacks and ""goodies"" from this market. And, in case you don't have a rental car, the excellent city bus service runs on both Kuhio and Kalakaua Avenues.My wife and I live most of the year in Maine. We were in Honolulu to celebrate our birthdays, and staying in a nice, clean hotel certainly helped to make our vacation a great one! I don't know what else to say except that if you want the most ""bang for your buck"" and have a clean, inexpensive hotel with a friendly staff to help you ENJOY your Waikiki stay, then this hotel is the place for you!","Brunswick, Maine",1,4.0

As many others have mentioned, the location is great; it's two blocks from the beach and close to a Food Pantry (shares the same parking lot) and the bus stop. As a disclaimer, this hotel is definitely not ""honey-moon"" material, but if you are like us and not planning on spending a whole lot of time in the room anyway the Aqua Aloha is a great value. In addtion to the great location & value, we really enjoyed the friendly front desk folks and the Tuesday night free Wipeout drinks and reception. The rooms have a mini fridge and microwave which was a nice bonus for us as we purchased groceries for our breakfast and lunches. There was a small pool, we went to it once or twice and enjoyed it.The room was definitely small and a bit outdated, and unfortunately we did get a room on the street side of the hotel... I was so excited to get to the room I totally forgot to ask for one on the Lagoon side at check-in. We planned on asking to move but once all of our stuff was unpacked and had spent a night we thought we could handle the road noise (we're both heavy sleepers). I would say our biggest complaint was probably the shower... I imagine it was not just our room, but it would just not hold a constant temperature. It would literally go from normal to scalding then straight to freezing within a few seconds multiple times during a 10-15 minute shower! I literally am not exaggerating, this definitely needs to be fixed.I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family... as long as you go with the right attitude, you cannot go wrong with the location and value.","Bellingham, Washington",31,4.0

I told them to deliver it at midnight and they were right on time and even got a box of chocolates! Aaaahh how I loved the stay there and of course Hawaii is heaven on earth! If you book directly with the hotel, you get free breakfast - Breakfast included fresh pancakes, breads, oatmeal, and a good variety of cakes with of course the regular tea and coffee. Parking was a bit expensive, $20/24 hours - but you pay for the location and after getting the Free Upgrade on the room we didn't really mind paying the parking charges.

These beds are SO comfortable and despite the city noise, we slept like babies (sometimes 9 - 10 hours!)This hotel is very busy and appeared to be packed the entire time we were there. Service is excellent - these people are definitely trying to make an impression on their customers. There are people from all over the world that stay here and I heard nothing but great comments. We appreciated the great room service we received from Merlinda. Our room was spotless and she was so polite and helpful. We had problems setting up our laptop and upon requesting assistance from the front desk, a gentleman arrived at our room and within a few minutes he had diagnosed and fixed our problem. There is free internet here so bring your laptops. Frontend employees were professional, courteous and helpful. This hotel has an authentic ""Hawaii"" feel to it, with glass slats for windows that open to allow warm tradewinds to flow through your room. There is a huge acquarium filled with tropical fish located in the breakfast room. A large glass cistern filled with ice and water is available in the open lobby and welcomes thirsty patrons returning from their outings at the beach and city. The lobby has an inviting decor that beckons one to sit and enjoy the cool breeze that flows through the entire lower level. A stack of daily newspapers are free to patrons and I found this to be the added touch that made me feel like it was home. Beach towels were also available for visits to the beach. Our plane leaves at eight oclock this evening and the front desk said that we could store our luggage in their luggage room until it is convenient to pick it up.There is no reason to stay anywhere else in Waikiki unless you are in to the Los Angelos hotel style, but then why are you in Hawaii anyways?

I should mention that we were staying on the 11th floor and being up so high reduces much of the city noise. There is an ABC convenience store and main bus stop at the end of the block in case you want to grab a snack or hop the bus to Chinatown or the airport. The room we stayed in was a Deluxe, the bed was comfortable, the water pressure and temperature consistency great, the city view awesome, and housekeeping did a fantastic and consistent job of keeping our room clean and stocked with fresh towels.

Then she told us that she was able to upgrade us to a one bedroom of 360 square feet for no extra charge for our entire 6 night stay. Also we were able to check in then and there 3 hours earlier. Was very relieved to be able to go upstairs and have a shower after a long 10 hour overnight flight!The room was great, a huge king bed, balcony, microwave, small fridge and couch. Was extremely comfortable for our 6 night stay. The only critisisms I have are that the staff I didn't find were very comforting over the tsunami drama that unfolded when we were there. We were told don't worry it won't happen and they didn't seem concerned at all. We were obviously freaking out at this stage as it was our 2nd night in Waikiki. It's a small thing and it was only one staff member. I wouldn't not stay there because of that, just saying they could be a bit more helpful in a situation like this in future.The other is that like a lot of people have said, request a room on the canal side. We were in a room that directly faced the street right underneath the Food Panty. Every morning we heard trucks reversing at a very early hour which woke us up.

I booked the hotel after reading lots of reviews and forum posts here on TA, and overall was attracted to the price, location, and relatively good reviews. This is definitely a hotel for budget-conscious travelers who want a clean, safe and comfortable place to stay, but aren't adamant about having a vast array of amenities and services, or really updated luxuries. My husband and I are really active travelers who spend every moment of the day out and doing things - so we really just needed a place to crash at night and get some good sleep to energize ourselves for the next day's adventures. This hotel served that purpose. We checked into the hotel at around 5 pm on a Tuesday, which meant we walked right into the manager's weekly happy hour - a nice touch. Free cocktails, live music and socializing. The lobby is modern and chic, with friendly and efficient staff. There is exercise equipment around and a very small pool (we never used either). We did sit in the lobby for a few minutes one day to use the free wi-fi. When I booked the room, my reservation had included complimentary breakfast each day but upon check-in I noticed that we'd be charged $4.95 per day per person for breakfast. We decided not to have breakfast at the hotel if we had to pay for it, but in my experience $4.95 isn't too bad for breakfast in the Waikiki area, so maybe others would prefer to go for it. We're not huge breakfast people.I had booked a standard city-view room, and had seen photos here on TA and didn't expect much space. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of room we had. A 6 drawer dresser, 2 night stands, a flat screen TV. Queen sized bed, a keyed safe. The most dated part of the room was the bathroom/shower stall, which is cramped and if you're over 5'8"" you may find that it isn't much room - fortunately we're both pretty short, so it wasn't a problem for us. But on the whole, the room was clean and appointed with everything we needed. It wasn't pindrop quiet at night - in fact, I could here drunk partiers outside coming home each night/early morning around 3 am to nearby hotels, singing loudly and carrying on - but whatever. Waikiki is kind of a vacation party zone, so I imagine that goes with the territory. I had read about the noise and brought foam earplugs with me, but in the end I didn't really care about the noise and never used them. The hotel is located an EASY 3-block walk to Waikiki Beach and all the tourist areas. On your way you'll pass at least 3 ABC stores, a Burger King, a Subway, tons of other local restaurants and cafes and tourist shops, etc. There is every chain restaurant, fast food joint, etc. that you might care to visit, not to mention other local places. And tons of shopping - I had no idea what a shopping mecca Waikiki is. If you enjoy walking and don't mind the few blocks or not waking up to an ocean view, you can save yourself some money by staying here and taking in sights as you stroll to the beach, to lunch/dinner or other activities.One of the big concerns in the Waikiki area is parking. The Aqua Aloha has limited underground parking for an additional $20 a day, and I'd heard that the Aston Waikiki Banyan about 3 blocks away will let you park for $10 a day - but to our delight we were able to find street parking on Ala Wai Blvd. everyday except once for free, within 3-4 blocks of the hotel. We never had to circle more than twice, and you can park there anytime except Fridays 8:30-11:30 am for street cleaning (we were out anyway, so no problem). That being said, we live in a huge East Coast mainland city where we parallel park on the street every single day of our lives, and negotiating the street cleaning days, etc., so this was no biggie to us. If you're used to having garage parking at your home and hate jostling for street parking, maybe you should spring for the garage pass. But I was happy that we saved a few bucks doing this - and it was easy.The Aqua Aloha also has coin-operated washers and dryers in the basement/parking level, which we used - nice to be able to wash a load and pack light for your trip. The front desk provided me quarters for change, which was easy enough.If you're a runner, you'll be happy to know that the Aqua Aloha is located conveniently to several pleasant running routes, including a paved path around the Ala Wai Canal, and then routes that take you along the Queen's Park and then to Waikiki Beach and Diamondhead. You'll really like it. Overall, I'd definitely stay here again. At $119 a night and no extra for parking, we saved a ton of money that we could use to do other fun activities and eat some awesome meals out.","Miami Lakes, Florida",30,3.0

We make two trips per year to Hawai'i and Aqua makes it more affordable. Come for the price, stay for the value.The staff is exceptional at the Aloha Surf as it is at the other Aqua Hotels we've stayed at. Always attentive, always serving. The hotel is a little older, has smaller rooms but plenty of room for two of us comfortably. And CLEAN. Even in the tropical climate we've never seen a single bug, and always have a sparkling clean room. Security and cleanliness are uppermost for us, and we are not let down. We feel safe and secure here which makes for a much better vacation. The manager, Tim, is very accommodating and accessible, even hosting a cocktail party for guests. It makes a very friendly atmosphere. The continental breakfast is nicely done, and saves us money over other Waikiki breakfast costs. It is obvious that Tim and his staff take the Aqua advertising seriously, it's not just words. They are that good. We will be back!",Chicago,0,4.0

Even their housekeeping staff are very nice and accommodating. Having the Food Pantry next to the hotel was also very convenient and having a Redbox rental.

We were not disappointed. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is a short walk to the beach. The ""budget"" room where we stayed was very basic but we didn't find it uncomfortable (like some other reviews seemed to indicate and....there's a difference between ""needs upgrading"" and dirty. The Aloha Surf is not dirty). After all, we were there to enjoy Waikiki, not stay in our room. The managers reception on Tuesday night was fun with free drinks, music and massages. The continental breakfast was a big plus (wasn't nearly as sparse and some reviews indicate). The wireless internet in the lobby worked well as did the wired internet in the room (I suggest bringing your own 15 foot network cord). If you want a little more space in the room, I would suggest upgrading to one of the upper floors (we peeked). So, if you want to spend a lot of money and be pampered and stumble out of bed to buy $12 Mai-Tai's at the beach bar, please book at one of the ""foo-foo"" hotels.

The management was kind but said there was nothing to be done. We were not expecting a 5 star resort but we were expecting a 3 star with clean facilities. The breakfast, too, was mediocre at best. There was limited offerings and if you have dietary restrictions it would be difficult to eat it. Spend the extra $$ and stay at a better resort. Also, it is a block or so from the ocean.

You get what you pay for, so we weren't expecting a five star, beach front hotel. The hotel was clean and well kept. The lobby was very nice, but the rest of the hotel wasn't nearly as updated. The first night, our room was terrible. We were in a standard room (very small) on the second floor above the entrance way. I could barely sleep because it was so loud and the bed was very lumpy. Luckily, we were assured at check-in that we would be transferred to another room for the rest of our stay. The second room was perfect. It was a deluxe room on the eight floor facing the opposite direction. The room had a couch, coffee table, lanai, and was more roomy. We were much happier this room. The bed was also very comfortable, it was considerably quieter, and the extra space was very nice. Our biggest complaint would have to be the breakfast. We do not eat a big breakfast, so we thought that the complimentary breakfast would be a great bonus for us. We went the first morning and did not return. The breakfast selection was terrible.

We booked through Travelocity and on the website it states that there is free breakfast. When we arrived we asked what time breakfast was served and the hotel would not honor it. It took countless negotiating to get breakfast/ countless phone calls. The hotel ended-up offering it to us, which was nice, but very frustrating. We went down the next morning and were very disappointed. I don’t know why I fought so hard to get it. It consisted of some brown apple slices a few orange slices, some poor tasting bread and some pancakces. It was not worth the price!

I've been reading some of the previous negative reviews and I think they are uncalled for. The hotel staff is friendly, welcoming, and quick to resolve any issues. When we first got to our room, we could not get the AC to start. So we called the front desk, and in less than 5 minutes, the maintenance guy showed up and fixed the AC. YES, the rooms are tiny. But what do you expect? This is Waikiki, my darlings. Space is limited as it is, and I certainly do not blame the hotel for tiny rooms. If you are looking for large luxurious spaces, pick a more expensive hotel! We had no problems with the size of the room. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and everything was clean. YES, it is noisy. MOST hotels located smack in the middle of the city are going to be noisy. Again, it's common sense. We were not bothered by the noise, in fact, it helped us to wake up earlier so we could get out and experience the things Hawaii has to offer. If you want a quieter hotel, pick one that's far from the city, or pick a higher floor. What we loved most was how amazingly good the housekeeping staff was. Rosalie did a wonderful job of keeping the room clean for us and making sure we were always stocked with necessities. In fact, one morning we overslept and did not leave the hotel until around noon, and when we returned that night the room had been cleaned! We had thought for sure that housekeeping would skip us since we ran so late, and were expecting to return to a messy room. But she must have returned to clean up well after finishing her rounds. The effort was definitely appreciated :) YES, the bathroom is a little older than other newer hotels, but so what?? It's kept clean, well stocked, there's hot water when you need it, and a shower stall. It's COZY, not run-down or falling apart. If you are looking to spend your vacation locked up in the hotel room and staring at a pretty bathroom with a bathtub, don't bother going to Hawaii in the first place! ;) Our room was equipped with a mini refrigerator and a microwave, and also a coffeemaker. We were also given a cord for internet access, which worked fine with us. We only had to use our laptop a couple of times to check on certain things. Overall, this was a nice cozy, clean atmosphere with a friendly ambiance. I would stay here again, especially since it is also reasonably priced.","Orlando, Florida",1,5.0

We were first given a tiny room with a really loud noise coming from an exhaust fan outside. We were moved to a more normal sized room, but the noise from outside was still incredibly loud. It felt like we were still on the plane, but it was after midnight and we were exhausted so I slept with earplugs. (Later we discovered one source of noise was large refrigeration fans at the Food Pantry which is right behind the hotel.) The problem is that the windows are louvered glass and can't keep out very much noise. The next day the clerk told us there was nothing else available, but then gave us a key to a room on the 8th floor with a sliding door that was somewhat quieter, but we could hear the elevator clanking up from below and stopping with a thud right behind the bed.This is Waikiki so of course we didn't expect total peace and quiet and our only other experience was at the Princess Kaiulani which was silent in comparison, but it's not very restful to have to turn on the TV just to drown out noise from the street. In response to the previous reviewer, we were in the back of the 3rd floor so I don't think it would have made a difference for you to move.We booked this hotel based the on the startlingly positive reviews here and the fact that it was only $100 a night during Christmas week compared to $200 at the Kaiulani. The location was good, but everything else was average including the staff, some of whom seemed inconvenienced by any disturbance. Maybe this is the best you can get in Waikiki at this price, but next time we won't mind paying a little more.Note: We had a completely different experience at another Aqua hotel on Kaua'i.","Vancouver, Canada",7,2.0

The Bad:Our room # is 400 facing the street and the worst ever. The hotel is on the corner of Ala Wai Blvd. and you can hear everything. The window and sliding door are not sound proof. If my room is on the back I would have had an enjoyable sleep. I assume the higher the floor the lower the level of noise but I don't really know. By the way the first night I did ask for a room in the back but was told none available. After two nights I went to the front desk again and mentioned I am willing to pay but again none available. We were there for five nights and I didn't want to ruin my time there anymore. We were gone all day everyday and only came back to get ready for the dinner then bedtime. No matter how tired I am I can't get over hearing all the noises outside, ambulance, buses, even garbage truck at 4:30am.Bathroom is horrible. It is outdated that the plumbing system failed for us. The shower is so tiny and good for one person. The water pressure is so low and the temperature keeps on switching from hot to cold then back. Even this part I was not able to enjoy.

The towel system was great and there were always towels available when you were ready for a fresh one.When we arrived we had only booked one room, then decided to get a second room and were lucky enough to have rooms next door to each other.

There is a free coffee machine that brews good, fresh, individual cups in the lobby next to the breakfast room, all day.We attended the Manager's Reception on the Tuesday and had a lovely time drinking a few ""Wipe Outs"" that were expertly mixed by Tim the hotel manager. We spoke a little and I mentioned that we were visiting in part to celebrate my wife's birthday the next day. Imagine our surprise when the next day in the lobby Tim came by and presented my wife with a very nice box of local chocolates ( her favorites) and wished her a very Happy Birthday! We were impressed that he could remember something like that after meeting and speaking with so many other guests the night before! Considering that we had no idea where we should stay in Honolulu when we booked our trip, I think we made the right choice and had a lovely holiday experience by choosing the Aloha Surf. We would come back any time. Thanks again to Tim and all his staff for making our stay a pleasurable experience.",Canada,0,4.0

It is a nice place, only a few blocks from the beach. The value for the hotel/location is excellent and service was outstanding and the room was clean.They have a small gym (located in kind of of a weird place), they have 3 pieces of exercise equipment available to use from 5am on. It is located at the back end of the lobby in an open area, I used the treadmill and it worked fine.The only thing I did not rate highly was the air conditioning for the room. The a/c worked fine, however it is located by the base of the floor on the opposite end of the room from the bed. We all know that hot air rises, so the fact that the cold air starts off at the bottom of the floor really does not help cool down the room and even though the air was blowing cold from the a/c unit, it did not have a lot of fan speed behind it so the room really never got that cool. I had it blowing at 60 degrees, but it was still a bit warmer than I normally liked. My room was facing the street so there was a certain amount of street noise that could not be avoided late at night, so if you want a room that is quieter, you may want to request a room facing away from the street.They also serve a very nice continental breakfast, pancakes, oatmeal, small muffins, slices of fruit, toast.

The hotel is about 3 blocks from the beach, close to the Ala Wai canal. The Food Pantry grocery is on the same block. I paid a little extra for a ""superior"" room with a sofa and coffee table. It is really a small studio suite. Dishes and cutlery are provided. It would have been nice to have a dish towel - I had to use a bath hand-towel in place of one. There is a fridge, microwave and kitchen sink, so you can put simple meals together. I didn't use the barbeque by the pool but that's an option for more cooking.Tim, the manager, Helen on reception and Nolan make this a specially warm hotel. There is lots of opportunity to meet other guests and chat at breakfast which is a real plus if you are traveling solo.A couple of things to be aware of is that the pool is too small to do laps - it is more of a plunge pool.

Even though I was going on a budget trip I had an amazing time. I wanted to stay under a $1000.00 for air/hotel. So these comments are just my opinion. I have done some travelling so I know what I like and dont like.Hotel was basic but clean and the staff where very friendly.Room-well, what can I say it was very small with two single beds (not doubles). I bit dated, bathroom was small and only had a shower. The windows in the room had those panel so it was very noisy. My room had a fridge and we also had internet connect but had to use cable. We made a comment to the hotel manager and they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room but we decided to stay in same room since we did not spend alot of time there.Hotel Location-was about 2 blocks from beach so I was fine with this. Parking-they do have parking but it was 20.00/day (bit expensive) and one night there where no parking for us.Breakfast-I am bit fussy here so we only ate the first morning and that was the apples/oranges and the toast. Very basic. There is a restaurant 1 block down on the corner with breakfast for 3.95 (2 pancakes, bacon and eggs). I also purchased some fruit from the ABC stores and had the spinach egg wrap from Starbucks. There are many options.Beach - was pretty nice. The water was cold but on those hot days it was refreshing. We had nice weather during our trip. The beach was busy at times but we where ok with this. We where going to rent some umbrellas at the beach but found out our hotel offered those cheap ones and they worked just fine. They also offered boogie boards and the matts. You can buy the matts for $1.99 at the ABC stores.Restaurants-lots around but our favorite is the cheesecake factory. We had this salad that was big enough for 3 people. Drinks are expensive. 8.95 for tropical ones. Duke's another favorite-right on beach and live music. Starbucks is one block up and 2 blocks over. We went to Honolulu to this restaurant called Aloha Tower-very nice, had live music. We also went to Jameson's by the Sea in Haleiwa (north shore).Car Rental-we rented an convertible for 2 days. We went to the North Shore (Waimea Bay) and to a luau at Paraside cove (booked thu hotel) for $125.0 for deluxe package which includes seating at front, meal is served, 4 drinks, picture and a mug. I didnt drink since I drove there. You can take tour bus.If you are driving anywhere, leave before 4:00 or after 6:00 since the highway is very busy.North Shore beaches where amazing and quite - we went on the monday so not as busy. Also, if you see the red flags up beware. People are in the ocean but that is the locals and they know the water. The power of the ocean took us by surprise!!We went to Pearl Harbour-very interesting-you cannot take your back packs in so leave in car. you can take camera.So overall I had an amazing time. We would stay at this hotel again-yes. I would get a different room. There is alot to see in Waikiki but drive around the island. It is amazing!!!","Calgary, AB",0,3.0

The in-room safe allowed us to be carefree when we went to the beach for our surf lesson knowing that our valuables were locked up. The mini-kitchenette with plates and silverware allowed us to ""eat-in"" 4 very simple suppers and pack lunches. It was great to have the Food Pantry right next door.

It was a tremendous value and we're quite happy overall with our stay.The hits:- awesome location- clean rooms- friendly staff- really comfy beds- wicked powerful A/C in the rooms!- Ethernet cable for in-room internet provided at no cost- free beach towel and beach mat lending service- we always found parking (and always underground for 7 of our 8 days!) in the hotel lotThe misses:- Aqua's website is misleading in terms of internet accessibility...wifi is only in the lobby; rooms only have a wired access port. I'm not saying that they should spend the money to put wifi in every room, but clarifying the website would alleviate guest disappointment - just let us know in advance that there's only wired internet up in the room, that's all.- the 'continental breakfast' really wasn't up to snuff (unless you're into eating nothing but sugar for breakfast). Pancakes, cakey muffins, toast (only butter - no other condiments), some sad looking apple slices, powdered donuts, and chocolate cake (seriously!) were on hand, but that was it. That being said, cheap Hawaiian breakfast can be had in pretty much any direction within a block's walk for the $3.75/person range, so it's really not that bad.- this is a little picky, but a higher grade of toilet paper would sure be nice...it's not like gas station toilet paper or anything, but definitely the cheapest stuff I've ever seen in a hotel. But that's easily fixed by picking up your own if it bothers you.Overall we're really happy with our stay here, and would go out of our way to stay here again - and would definitely recommend it to others.

Let's start with the highlights: Location is good. Right near the canal and four longer blocks from the beach. Enjoy being away from the madness of the beach hotels. The lobby is bright and airy with a large TV. Nice place to seat to plan your day or wait for a tour bus. Also received a good rate.The rooms themselves are average. Decent size with a nice touch of mini fridge, sink, microwave and plates & utensils in your room. I was on a higher floor and had a nice view of the city. Didn't find this hotel any noiser than any other hotel in a big city. The shower was great, but no bathtub if you want that. Sink and vanity are outside of the shower/toilet room. Small, but enough space for my toileties. Didn't have to wait long for either of the two elevators. Free papers each morning in the lobby.Now for the downside: The furniture is dated. My sofa had stains all over it. The lighting in the room is almost non-existant. If you want to sit anywhere but the bed at night, you won' t see much. The room also had a strange smell to it. My balcony was covered with water leaking from my airconditioner and bird feces. Didn't use it during my stay.They offer Wifi in the lobby. If you don't have a computer, they have (a self named)""world's greatest internet cafe"" in the lobby. It was only open once during my week and then the employee told me that the internet was not available.The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast. It is sparse. For someone who is looking for healthy options, they do have fresh fruit, which is nice. The breakfast is from 7-830 daily, so if you arent up early, you will miss out. They state they have a fitness center. It looks to be two machines off the lobby. The week I was there, both had big bags over them saying out of order. Asking the front desk for other alternatives, he told me he knew of none.This brings me to the bigger issue I have with the hotel: The staff. With the exception of the hotel's manager (who could have not been nicer) and the woman who works overnights at the front desk, I was surprised at the demeanor and service the front desk offered. From the man who checked me in to the afternoon and evening staff. No one ever had a smile or friendly greeting. This is Hawaii, so as someone who travels there often, I really expect more. At this hotel, I felt that I shouldn't. You really felt like you could have been at any big chain location along any highway in the country.Though I love the location and this hotel has much potential, because of the lackluster staff, I would definitely have to think hard before returning.","New York, NY",120,3.0

We had stayed at another Aqua resort in spring 2009 and had an idea of what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised and pleased to discover this hotel surpassed our expectations. This hotel so much better compared to the other Aqua resort we stayed at last year. Everyone at front reception/desk staff was extremely helpful pleasant and professional. I dealt with a lot of the staff at the front desk because of internet problems (my computer was not configured properly and I had to try and sort this out with my IT department back at home). One staff member (unfortunately, we didn't get his name) was very helpful providing directions and making suggestions for how to spend the day - even to say advise us ""Ladies - medium rare"" for amount of sun exposure we should get.The room was a bit dated but that was OK because we weren't spending our vacation in the room. The beds were very comfortable (new pillow top mattresses) and they gave us clean towels every day. Note, at this Aqua hotel, they provided towels for the beach. Last year, we had to take bath towels to the beach. The breakfast though predictable was better than other hotels where breakfast is included in the price - pancakes, oatmeal and fresh fruit.The hotel was closed to public transportation, shopping and within a short walking distance to the beach.I would recommend this hotel.

We enjoyed and appreciated the continental breakfast each morning because the cost of meals in Waikiki can get quite pricey. We went to the Managers reception where Tim the manager made these yummy wipe out cocktails for everyone you could also get massages or sketches of you in the lobby while we sipped on drinks and listened to the ukulele music and singing. What a great way to get to know their guests. Nolan at the front desk was super helpful.

I stayed here the last time I was on Oahu and was very happy with it so it was an easy choice. We arrived after an 8 hour flight to find that they had no record of our room that we'd booked 6 months earlier through Delta Vacations! I was ready to freak out as we'd already paid but Vinh at the front desk quickly told us not to worry and that he'd take care of us. He said that on our first night we'd have a small room but if we could hold out, he'd upgrade us the following day. The next day we went on a tour and when we came back, sure enough, we were all set up with a bigger room and they'd even moved our luggage for us. I was very happy with the service and the room had a balcony, a microwave, refrigerator, sink and dishes. We enjoyed our stay here very much and the price is right too! It's not right on the main drag so there wasn't really a lot of street noise either. I think the rooms must have been pretty well insulated because we never heard any other people on our floor at all. We joked that the whole floor must have been reserved just for us! I slept like a baby too, I don't remember the beds being that comfortable the last time I was there!I was also glad that this time I was able to attend the manager's reception on Tuesday night! I only made the tail end of it but was very glad that I got to try the legendary Wipe Out cocktails which were very good by the way. And free breakfast was also a money saver! I don't think many places offer a free breakfast so I was very happy about that!

Not a fancy resort, but that's ok. We stayed there for a week and enjoyed the clean room, open air lobby, free towel loans at the front desk, complimentary breakfast, wi-fi in the lobby, and Manager's Reception with free drinks, music, and chair massages. We were overall quite happy with it. I won't fault them for the garbage trucks in the morning--not their fault.I will mention a couple points that could be improved, both of which have already been mentioned. First, the breakfast is just sweet carbs. Pancakes, muffins, and actual chocolate cake for breakfast. There was oatmeal and some cut fruit, true, but the breakfast really needs something else...I like the previous commenter's suggestion of hard boiled eggs. Or at least milk to go with the starches. The fake juice was a bad drink to start the day with. Second, they really need to be clearer about returning the parking passes. Exactly like the previous person, we had no idea we were supposed to return it, so when we checked out, they tried to charge us for parking for all days. We convinced them we'd only used it one day, so they corrected it, thank goodness. If they weren't as accommodating, this would have been a huge bummer.So I spent more time on the two improvement areas than the rest, but really, the rest of it was all pretty good. Note: I didn't use the spa, so I can't comment on that. I'd have no qualms about staying here again or recommending it.

Being located right along the canal offered a wonderful view of the neighborhoods north of us in the hills. Each morning you could watch as the clouds cleared overhead revealing the mountains just as the sun touched them. Amazing! The walk to Waikiki was also pleasant, maybe 8-10 minutes if we took our time. The staff were all great. I wish I would have remembered a few names. All were helpful with towels for the beach, directions to local hot spots and made check-in and check-out painless. Even though our room was a bit snug it came with everything we needed to enjoy our trip at it's fullest.

And it's three long blocks from the beach. But you're also not paying $300 a night. This hotel goes the extra mile, something not so common these days for a 2-3 star hotel. Front desk staff - and room service, for that matter - are cheerful and helpful. Rooms are a tad dated, but in excellent condition and kept spotless. Never ran out of hot water. A stack of newspapers are at the lobby elevators. Towels are terrific and there's a never-ending supply of them at the front desk if you want to take them to the beach or use around the pool. The pool is too small and the loungers seem always to be inhabited by the same people who missed the kindergarten lesson about sharing — but the most famous beach in the world is three blocks away so why stay at the pool? A couple small gripes: the included breakfast is too sweet and desperately in need of some protein — perhaps a hard-boiled egg would be a cost effective way of responding to this. Also, parking is available if you book a day or two ahead — but make sure that when you return the car to the rental agency that you let the front desk know that you don't need parking anymore, or else they assume you still want it and charge you at the end of your stay (actually, when we explained ourselves, they took it off the bill, but you may not look so honest or pitiable). This chain is the only Hawaiian-owned chain, so the money stays in the local economy. Next time, we'll stay at an Aqua Hotel again, but perhaps a different one just for the change.

It was quiet, clean (enough) and within walking distance to everything. Comfortable was what we wanted and that was what we got, I suppose. The cleaning was a bit uneven though. The first few days it was perfect and then it wasn't. The shower had obviously been overlooked and the dishes were poorly cleaned. We assumed it couldn't possibly have been the little sunshine of a cleaning lady whom we met the first days since she always left the place spotless. It does feel petty to complain about two or three (four?) days of not so great cleaning when everything else was super, but there it is.In conclusion I suppose the only thing I didn't like about the hotel was that I couldn't take Nolan home with me. How can anyone be in such a good mood as early as 7 am?

The amenities are nice....breakfast, newspapers and Wi-Fi in the lower lobby. Our room was very basic....a view of the condominium complex next door, but it was fine because we didn't spend much time in the hotel. An air conditioner is a necessity on Waikiki; ours kept tripping the circuit breaker but we were able to get it going by resetting it. My only complaint is the $20 per day to park your rental car. We did not know of this fee and were informed by their staff that ""all the hotels charge a fee"" to park on their premises. This may be true but $20 seems exorbitant and this fee is not clearly stated on their web site. Unless you want to hunt around for street parking this is the only sensible alternative....expensive though it may be. If you plan to park in their underground garage, keep your vehicle small....it can get tough maneuvering in those tight spaces. All in all.....this is a very nice hotel in an ideal part of Waikiki.

Check in was quick and friendly and unfortunately I didn't get the name of the gentlemanbut he took the time to tell me what the hotel offered and where to find everything.Check out was just as quick and friendly, there was not waiting time as people have mentioned, everything was quick and effiecient.Upon reading some of the reviews I was unsure of what the rooms or location would be like but I can say everything was perfect. The room was large and very clean and the location was great. Close to the beach and activities but far enough away (about a 5 minute walk) from the beach and the main strip Kalakaua which I have stayed on many times and can be extremely noisy and crowed.

When I checked in they upgraded our room which was a nice surprise. I booked through the hotel website this summer to take advantage of their promotion at the time, of having every 5th night free. The room was a nice size, it looked like their pictures. There was a couch, coffee table, large bed (which I will add was extremly comfortable). There was a small kitchen area with a fridge and microwave, the bathroom was on the small side, a very small shower, but the water was hot and the pressure was great. the continental breakfast was great....pancakes, oatmeal, toast, and various store bought pastries. There was always fresh fruit, tea/coffee and iced tea. I will say though, after a few days, you get tired of it, would be nice to have some variety. I wont complain though, as its rare to find a hotel that has a complimentary breakfast. There was also free wifi, which is a great find as well. I didn't find the rooms noisy at all. I stayed on the side that faced the apartments, that may of been why. There is likely no nice view at this hotel, unless you're on the top 2 floors. But that wasn't important to me.The rooms appeared very clean, I saw no bugs at all through my stay, and the housekeeping is extremely friendly. However, on our 8th night, we misplaced our safe key. On the hunt for the key, we looked under the kitchenette, surprised to see a broken beer bottle (not from me), and under the bed was the back of a panty liner (not mine). The desk staff were nice, but a little blunt at times. They were very qick to mention charges when I requested things (parking, replacing the safe key, printing off an itenerary, local phone calls, etc.) . Parking is $20 a day, and I was upset to learn that to replace the safe key was a whopping $50. The managers cocktail hous on tuesdays was great, the ""wipeout"" is delicious, the massages are great. I never visited the pool, it was quite small. And surprised there was no nice restaurant or souvenier shop. There is a little ""cafe"" open certain hoursI will definatly stay here again, simply because of the price, the free breakfast and wifi.","Alberta, Canada",13,4.0

We absolutely loved the hotel. We stayed for one week in a one-bedroom suite with a gorgeous view of the mountains from the 16th floor.The staff and service was excellent, and the hotel offered many amenities that larger chain hotels did not, including a daily complimentary continental breakfast (my dad loved the hotcakes and fresh pineapple), a manager's reception on Tuesday with complimentary cocktails & music, free beach towels check outs, free wired internet, and lovely body wash, shampoo & conditioner, and lotion (something most hotels cost-cut, but not at the Aloha Surf).As for our suite: I loved the fact that bathroom was in the hallway between the living room and bedroom, which made sharing the space very convenient. The suites are quite large with huge balconies. The kitchenette area was stocked with all the essentials too: microwave, mini-fridge, coffee-maker, plates, bowels, silverware, kitchen towel etc. It was very convenient for making a quick mid-day snack.My thanks to Tim, the manager and Nolan for making my parents' trip to Oahu so enjoyable.

The hotel itself was very nice upon entry and the free breakfast was a selling point for us too. We had rented a car but didn't want to spend $20/night parking, so were always able to find free parking along the canal - even though the walk was long at times.The staff were very friendly and they always had a basket of fresh apples at the desk - something we readily enjoyed. They were also very knowledgable and were able to quickly give suggestions and tips about things to go and places to see.Waikiki/Honolulu is very similar to any other major big city in the US, but the beach is amazing and fun! One thing to note: the bathroom in the room was very poor - a make-shift sliding door, a cracked-tile shower with dingy curtain, etc etc. However, the rest of the room was fine and even had a nice kitchenette and sitting area. We didn't spend a lot of time in our room, so it was certainly sufficient for the price we paid on hotwire.

You won't get a beachside view of the ocean but it's a very short walk to get there. Shuttles to all the major shopping pick up less than a block away. The only downfall is that the Hotel is going to need some updating and remodeling soon. The bathrooms are a bit small but have all the traditional amenities you would expect.

No real complaints, the rooms were ok but the bathroom could have done with a spruce up as paint was peeling off the wall and it was a little dark...apart from that the room was function (but not as large as European rooms).Having said that, the bed...oh the bed...was absolute heaven! As many others have already said, the bed was easily one of the best beds Ive ever slept in...only bettered by that of the Sofatel in London (at 20 times the price of the stay!)!!!The room also cost next to nothing and was an absolutely fantastic deal with such a touristy spot for a time of the year that all of Europe is on holiday!! Parking was a bit of a bother, having to squeeze our tank in behind another tank that had not made best use of its spot in the front of the hotel! But after a 40 point turn we managed to get in :)Breakfast was also complementary and I quite enjoyed the pancakes :) Internet was available for free, where the room connection was wired but WIFI was available in the lobby.There is a swimming pool, but its location and size made it impractical (no sun) so we didnt use it.Would we stay again if traveling on a budget?

The room was bright and efficiently laid out, perfectly comfortable to suit our needs. The only negative was the very loud traffic in the morning (we were on the 5th floor, so perhaps the higher floors are quieter) and a view of apartments from our balcony. However, this hotel was significantly less expensive than many of the others that we had considered, and I feel that the lower price more than made up for the noise and less-than-ideal view. The location was convenient, very quick walk to the beach, shopping, and restaurants.The staff were extremely helpful, professional, and knowledgeable. They were also quite proactive, as they called us the night before we were leaving, to see if we needed any help scheduling transportation to the airport. We happened to be there on a Tuesday and attended the Manager's Reception, in the hotel manager, serves complimentary ""wipe-out"" cocktails (very tasty!). This was a nice touch.

We arrived at 9am from a 10 hour flight from Sydney, and were exhausted. Unfortunately for us, with a 3pm check-in time and no rooms available for us to be able to fall into and crash, we were told to come back in a few hours so we left our suitcase there and headed down the street.We went back around lunchttime and asked if there were any rooms yet. The lady at the counter said that it wasn't on a high level, but there was a room on Level 7 we could have. Anything was perfect at that time of the day when all we wanted to do was crash out.We booked a Superior room, with balcony...which faced apartment blocks. The room itself was quite pretty and spacious - with a couch and plenty of room to dump all of our shopping bags & large suitcases.We arrived in on a Tuesday, in time for the Managements Welcome cocktail party, which was really nice. The wipeout cocktails were really yummy, and it was a good opportunity to relax and talk to fellow people staying at the hotel. We only went to the 'free breakfast' twice during the 12 days, as we're not massive fans of the things that were available for the breakfast - toast (but the only condiment being cream cheese), pancakes, and then pineapple pieces, mini muffins & mini donuts. The coffee was good though. This free breakfast is only available between 7am and 8.30am.The thing I'd like to say about this hotel is don't expect it to be a 5 star hotel at a lower starred price. We paid $79 US a night (before taxes) which is an amazing price when other hotels in the same region are charging $200 US + a night. The bed was comfortable, the shower was hot, the fridge kept things cold - can you see the pattern here? Our room facing the apartment blocks / street was quite noisy - my husband is a light sleeper and could only sleep for 3-4 hours a night due to the noises of a nighttime, then at 6am onwards with trucks, cleaners on the same level shouting to one another and over their walkie talkie etc. If you're a light sleeper, maybe ask for a room on a higher level or facing away from the street.If I was to go back to Hawaii again, I probably would stay here again - just with those pre-requisites in place for our room - higher up, and away from the noisy street.

It is just small enough to offer that ""boutique"" hotel feeling, far beyond its affordable rates. The staff and management were exceptional;, always available without being overbearing, efficient and effective but calm and professional. The Aloha Spirit is alive and well at the Aqua, from Manager Tim Clark's warm and competent demeanor, to the low-key hawaiian themed furnishings and decor, to the staff's disposition. It was truly a pleasurable difference from the large-chain hotels we frequently stay in. In the big-branded hotels, you could be literally anywhere...and that defeats the purpose of a vacation in Hawaii. In contrast, the Aqua Aloha Surf and Spa has a true local feel to it. And having lived in Hawaii for 25 years, I can tell you that there is no bigger compliment or better measure of success in Hawaii.","Wailuku, Hawaii",0,5.0

This hotel was excellent for the price; however, remember the price factor as there are some minor issues. The hotel location itself is excellent as it is located within two blocks on the main part of Waikiki Beach. It is a very easy walk with the hotel being very close to many restaurants and the Food Pantry Supermarket (kind of pricey for some food but good for some making a few lunches and snacks). The lobby of the hotel is very nice with a lot of Hawaii charm and nice staff. Check out the manager hour for free drinks, massages, and music on Tuesday at 5PM. They even gave my son some coconut and pineapple juice. We paid extra for a upgraded room and it was still a little cozy but had a balcony. The room had a nice kitchen for basic preparation for snacks and a balcony. The view was of a apartment complex across the street but had some nice mountain views to the east. The room was a little but worn but overall it was comfortable with amenities. There was also a small pool with cold water which was nice for a dip on hot days but not really a place to hang out. Overall the stay was very pleasant and nice as the staff was very friendly, location was excellent, and the room was adeqaute.

I traveled with a friend and we were on a budget and we got a decent price for this hotel. We were prepared for budget accomodations but were pleasantly surprised! We got one double bed which meant sleeping in the same bed but we were in Hawaii for goodness sake so we were fine with it (we also didn't ask for two beds either so I'm not complaining!). We had interactions with the staff on several occasions and they were always very pleasant and helpful. I was very impressed that there was a hotel near Waikiki that offered free breakfast - that was a major plus for someone who is on a budget!! And it was good!! We did not have the opportunity to use the pool but it looked just fine. Our room was very clean and I don't remember any problems with excessive street noise. You have to walk a few blocks to the beach but again, we're in Hawaii and 3 blocks is nothing!I'm just bummed that we didn't get to go to the manager's reception as we were not there on that day. However, I'm going to be traveling to Honolulu with my cousin in October and I plan to attend this time! I booked my next trip through Delta Vacations and was happy to see that this place was one of the options! Even though this time we could have booked hotels that were closer to the beach and more expensive, I opted to make reservations here because of my great stay last time. Why take a chance when you already know that you like a place? I'm looking forward to my upcoming vacation and staying here again!",Wisconsin,29,5.0

I booked more than 30 days in advance so I saved a nice chunk of change on the room. Im a big guy at 6'11"" so the most important thing to me was having a king bed. I called to book a superior room with a king but was told there were no kings available at that time. So I just booked the next room up a deluxe with a king. A few days later I decided on upgrading to a junior suite and emailed them about it. I was told it was no problem. If I recall the junior suite was $135 more for the 7 nights I would be staying there. Mahina handled all my emails and was great. A few days later I emailed her asking if it was possible to be on the top floor (Honolulu can get loud at night) and she said she'd put in a request for it. Then I asked to have the room facing Diamond Head if at all possible. (The other side of the hotel doesnt have as nice a view as the Diamond Head side btw) She responded that she'd also put that in the request as well. I arrived arould 1pm on June 24th, two hours early for check-in. They held my bags for me at the front counter as the room wasnt ready yet and I spent the next two hours wandering around Waikiki and grabbed lunch. Came back at 3pm, and what do yuou know.....my room was on the top floor (room #1608) and facing diamond head! Couldnt have asked for anything more than that. I never had any issues with noise from outside or from the other rooms. Its definately worth it for the top floor. The bed was brand new (manufacture date on the tag was 6/15/2010!) and was very comfortable.  Yes some of the furniture in the room shows signs of wear, but then again you arent paying $300 a night at the Hilton Hawaiian Village or $450+ at the Moana Surfrider. The balcony was HUGE! compared to the other size rooms that werea floor below us. It also didnt have the white plastic furniture outside that the units that are below a junior suite have. It was all wicker. Four seats total with a nice table and a bench seat as well. Internet was free which is a huge plus for someone on a budget. Most hotels charge $15 plus a day and not having to spend money on that free's up cash to do what matters most on vacation, sightseeing, great food, etc. All I had to do was ask the counter for an ethernet (probably a 15 foot one at that which is nice if you want to sit outside on the balcony and use your laptop). I dont know why people complain about the free internet being slow. It worked fine with my laptop. The bathroom was adequate for our stay. Nothing too fancy. The bathtub/shower did show some wear as well as the fixtures in it. The toilet did run after it was flushed but all you had to do was jiggle the handle and it stopped right away. If there is one thing the Aqua Surf & Spa should upgrade next it should be the bathroom. But again, it was fine for my needs. The kitchenette is a nice addition to the room. It had a small microwave, mini-fridge, small sink and actual flatware and silverware to eat with. We stopped at the Food Pantry right nextdoor and stocked up on some drinks and food. The Food Pantry nextdoor is a great thing to have. Whatever you need they pretty much have. Yes its a little pricey but then again what isnt in Hawaii? The parking garage is small but we never had any trouble finding a spot for the rental car. Parking is $20 a day which is pretty standard for most area hotels. During our stay we wanted to know where the best place to rent a decent surfboard was (places on Waikiki Beach can be ridiculously expensive). The front desk told us that Mark the facility maintenance guy at the hotel was a surfer and could help us out. The first day in our room we called the front desk and within 3 minutes he was knocking at our door. The guy was great, telling us where to rent a board, great places to grab food, etc. He should seriously be in customer service or relations or something. For the remainder of my stay there whenever Id bump into him we'd stop and have a chat. He always remembered my first name. Its nice to see there are still employees like him around. The one thing I was bummed about (though no fault of the hotels) was that our luau at Paradise Cove (amazing experience, if you go pray you get Cousin Bronsons bus, he's a riot) was the same night as the hotels free cocktail party with Tim Clark the manager, so I missed that. I did a lot of research and reading of reviews on the hotels in Honolulu/Waikiki and decided on the Aqua Surf & Spa because of its quiet location (the walk to Waikiki beach was around 8 minutes), the price of the rooms, free internet and most of all because whenever there is a bad review written here, Tim Clark the manager always leaves a comment and is very polite about everything. Stuff like that goes a long way with people, Im proof of that. I hope this review is helpful (as are the pics) and that if you choose to stay at the Aqua Surf & Spa you have as great a time as I did. Nextime Im back in Oahu i'll be staying there again.Aloha & Mahalo!",Huntington Beach,15,5.0

I'll start with the positive; the hotel is in a prime location that's within walking distance from Waikiki beach and all of the shopping destinations in the area. If you want to hop on the Trolley and head to Ala Moana the pick up point isn't far away. The hotel itself is pretty clean and doesn't offer any added frills which keeps the costs down. My mattress was a little in the old and uncomfortable side but they are in the process of replacing them all with new beds. The staff was friendly and accomodating. I don't have a lot of negatives to add but I will say that the entrie Waikiki area is very noisy and you may hear traffic and/or sirens going off. This is unavoidable and really isn't controlable for the hotel. The only thing that got on my nerves was the extremley slow and small elevators. There are only two elevators that always seemed to be packed with people and the wait could be a little while if there were a lot of people or it was a peak time. The only thing I would recommend the managment to address would be asking the housekeepers to spend a little extra time cleaning the showers. My room's shower reminded me of a gym shower stall after rush hour. Other than that I don't have any real complaints but next time I'm in Honolulu I'm going to spend a few extra bucks and stay at one of the nicer resorts.",,3,3.0

I spoke with Vinh at the front desk ,explained to him that i asked for early check in,it was only 8a when we arrived,he apologized and said they were sold out the night before ,but took my cell # and said he would call me as soon as a room was available, He did just that within 20 minutes he called me to say they had a room available and even gave me alittle larger room to accomodate my disabled husband and child's bed. The continental breakfast every morning was wonderful!! Pancakes made fresh while you wait, toast,juice oatmeal, donuts,coffee, fresh fruit and a smiling staff and a free Honolulu newspaper to read,much more than i expected, saved us about 20.00 a day for breakfast. and the staff was great. friendly and quick to accomodate our needs, I stayed at the Hyatt regency last year with an ocean front room,while that was nice, the aqua aloha surf was a much homier feel. and the managers reception on tuesday night was a great opportunity to meet Tim the hotel Manager,he was bar tending. and no limit to the drinks. there is a laundry facility in their basement,they have change at the front desk, with an ABC store on every corner very convenient,the Beach was 3 short blocks away, Parking was 20.00 a night, but a little birdy in the hotel lobby told me about a hotel down the street about 6 blocks that was only 10.00 per night, a 10 minute walk. on Kuhio avenuethe Aqua Aloha Surf is a.Great Hotel I will stay again we travel there twice a year to visit family and will recommend this to everyone,as far as noise every one speaks of, yes there is alot of street level noise we were on the 11th floor, but you are on vacation in beautiful Waikiki, why would you want to sleep in and miss the beautiful sunrise,or go for a walk on the Beach ?","Las Vegas, Nevada",2,5.0

Before going into the details, I will say that we had a wonderful visit, and would definitely return. Here are the details:First, Tim (the manager) is the best. We communicated via email before our trip and he was quick to reply (unlike most managers) and assured me that all my requests would be met (room away from the street, high floor). Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised with a room upgrade and wine/chocolates because he remembered that this was our honeymoon. The hotel entrance was great - it was recently remodeled and is very inviting - open layout, comfortable chairs, TV, etc. The person checking us in was quick, nice, and professional.Our room was exactly what we needed - a comfortable bed, functional A/C, sofa, mini-fridge, microwave, coffee-maker, etc. As most reviews point out, the rooms are not huge - but it all depends on what you want and need, for most people it's large enough. The sink was clogged when we arrived, and maintenance repaired it in 15 minutes. I mention this because any time we needed something, they took care of it immediately. High-speed internet is free, although wired (they provide cables). The hotel offers beach towels - you just sign them out and drop them off when you're done. This was very convenient since we didn't have to pack beach towels and we had fresh ones each day.The free breakfast is hit or miss. The food is great considering most hotels don't offer free breakfast. There was coffee, juice, muffins, fresh fruit, toast, and pancakes. The only issue we had was that some people were very rude - note that this has nothing to do with the hotel, it is with some guests (I won't mention where they were from, but I've run into this a few times). They would cut in line rather than wait their turn, and a few times as I was waiting for pancakes, they would put their plate over mine and ""steal"" my pancake. If they somehow had better crowd control, it would have been more pleasant.My wife took advantage of the spa in the lobby - and had a wonderful experience. She highly recommended a massage (I did not get one).The location is one of the best things about this hotel. It's centrally located within walking distance from many eateries, drugstores, shopping areas, and the beach. Everything is within a 10-15 min walk. Parking was $20/night and we chose to pay it for convenience. Apparently there are places nearby where you can park for less, but we thought it was worth the extra money. There aren't many spaces, but we never had an issue finding a spot regardless of the time.The staff as a whole was great. We don't remember their names (sorry!). I do remember Nolan helping us a few times, and of the 3-4 people we interacted with, they were all wonderful. As I said in the beginning, Tim the manager made sure we enjoyed our stay from beginning to end. In summary, we had a wonderful stay, and when we return to Hawaii, we will definitely stay here again. It is by far the best deal - you get a great room in a wonderful location with excellent staff. To Tim and the rest of the staff, thank you for making our stay a wonderful one.Michael",mxc305,5,5.0

My mum booked the Aqua Aloha Surf for their rooms, so I booked it for mine too. When I checked in I was greeted very nicely by the front desk staff. The lobby was very cute and very clean, and the check-in process was quick. We jumped in the elevators and went up to our room on the 8th floor.Now since I was only staying one night, I booked the Deluxe Room with a Private Lanai. Best Decision Ever. The room was very nice and very clean. The couch and coffee table was a nice touch and the lanai was nice to chill out on. The linens on the bed were very crisp white and the kitchenette area was clean. There was a microwave, small refrigerator, plates, silverware, cups, etc. The deluxe room was large too. I heard some complaints from people who said the regular rooms are too small. But the hotel prices are usually so low that it should be okay to splurge for the upgrade.The bed was extremely comfy and I did not hear any excessive noise like other people claim to have heard. I had no issues with this room and thought it was excellent.I had one small issue, and I discussed it with Tim, the hotel manager, at the end of the Manager's Reception when I was visiting my family on Tuesday night. He took care of the small issue and was very polite about it. He even gave me his business card if I felt it necessary to contact him in the future. And btw, the reception was great! My parents loved the free cocktails and I enjoyed my pineapple juice (due to the under-21 factor). Another employee was walking around taking pictures of guests and took e-mails so that everyone got a free picture of their family emailed to them. Yet another employee was walking around with chocolate-covered mac nuts, all while free massages, charactertures, and live music was going on.The pool is small, but it's warm, clean, and deep. The pool chair are very comfortable and their is a large grill that guest's can use next to the pool. Take advantage of making your own dinner one night next to the pool! Oh, and the hotel checks out beach towels for the pool or the beach, yet another freebie.The hotel has a free breakfast from 7-830am (I think that's the times). This was surprising a good breakfast, there was juice, coffee, tea, donuts, fresh pineapple, muffins, toast, and an attendant making pancakes. My family ate their every morning, probably saved them $20 each day. I had it when I stayed, it was really good and a nice treat to have breakfast ready in the lobby.I've stayed at the Double Tree and the Hyatt before, both in Waikiki. Between the three hotels I've stayed at, I'm choosing this one again. I've been recommending it to people I know coming to the islands and anyone else that is looking for a Waikiki hotel. The price is fantastic and the hotel is clean and a great deal!I am planning to stay here again at the end of July, I really was that impressed by the value. Whether you're visiting the islands or you're a Kama'aina, I suggest this hotel. Now, nothing is perfect. So if I had to make suggestions I would say that the elevators was a little warm and stuffy, and also that you should plan on parking somewhere else because it seemed like there are maybe 20-25 stalls total for the hotel and they are $20/night. The fitness center is like two work-out machines behind a screen in the front lobby, go for a run on the beach or a swim instead. Also, the lanai furniture is just basic plastic patio chairs. But it works for chilling on the lanai at night!So thank you Aloha Surf for an excellent stay and thank you Tim for the lovely reception.(Yeah, I know this is lengthy, but my favorite reviews are the helpful ones with lots of info!)","Las Vegas, Nevada",24,5.0

The rooms are small, but are well laid out so the size is not a problem. The hotel has been recently remodeled into a modern stylish look that makes it feel a step up from typical moderate priced chains. It is truly only 2 blocks from Waikiki beach- close enough for an easy walk to the water, night life and food, but far enough that there is less street noise at night than at some other hotels (this is important at 11pm when you're body still thinks its 3am). The staff were amazingly helpful with everything- transportation advice, referrrals on car rental agencies, directions, food recommendations, upgrades available- everything (thank you Nolan and Helene- you were a great help!). The manager, Tim, is very friendly and accessible, and does a reception every Wednesday evening with free cocktails, chair massages and a man playing ukelele and singing- all while you sit in the open lobby or by the pool and relax. There is a large propane grill by the pool for guests to use if you'd prefer to cook, which is nice given food prices. Breakfast in the morning is pancakes, oatmeal, toast and fresh fruit- much better than the typical danish and coffee spread at most places. We were very please with Carmencita in housekeeping who did a great job in our room every day too.

Both times we experienced friendly staff at the front desk during check-in. The first time we got a complimentary upgrade from a standard to a deluxe room. The second time we had made advance reservations via travelocity.com but the hotel didn't have us in their system. The hotel was full, so the front desk person called travelocity to see what happened with our reservation. He was kind enough to wait on hold for a long time before reaching someone. After learning that our reservation had not gone through, he gave us a jr. suite at the same price we paid online. I was thankful that we didn't have to go to another hotel (it was almost midnight). The whole thing probably took nearly an hour to resolve; they went beyond the call of duty in my mind. The rooms are nothing fancy, but meet your needs for a clean, convenient place to sleep.

Many restaurants, tourist stores, and markets nearby. The neighborhood can be a bit dicey. I have been approached by a dope dealer and a well-dressed hooker, but never saw any serious crime.

But so what - we only used it to sleep and shower in - had microwave, small refrigerator, coffee pot - coffee was supplied daily. This hotel is CLEAN and the service was top notch - from the front desk to the housekeeping staff, this was an amazing bargain to stay in Waikiki. Breakfast was included (700-830 am) and was fresh fruit, numerous pastries, pancakes, juices, coffee, tea, oatmeal, etc - and the front desk supplies ethernet cables (no charge) for wifi in your room. If there is an area they need to improve on, it is their wifi capability in your room - always ""low"" and not so reliable. But this is one of the very few hotels in Waikiki Beach with free breakfast and free wifi - and the prices to stay are a real bargain. We have already decided to return and will definitely stay at this hotel again - it was everything we needed and there are many restaurants, a grocery store, convenience stores, etc within a one block area. All in all, one of the best vacations we have had (and yes, we have been before but never at such low rates) - if you are looking for a high end, beachfront hotel, this will not be the place for you - but if you want clean, friendly and only 2 short blocks from the beach and all the action of Waikiki Beach, this is the place for you!",USA,4,4.0

I didn't get his name but he was very friendly and informative. He asked if we were celebrating any occasion during our trip such as an anniversary or honeymoon and we told him yes, our anniversary. So he said they would send us up some champagne and we never received it during our 9 night stay. I thought that was really kind of strange and it upset me. Why even ask, right? Also during our check in we were told that their parking lot was full and told we could park at another hotel location a few blocks away. I asked if it would be discounted due to the inconvenience and the answer was no. Luckily I was able to locate parking at a better rate online prior to our arrival and that's what we used for the duration of our trip. During the day (from 10am-6pm I believe) the hotel offers their parking for free to their guests. One day after we parked during these hours and then told the female receptionist just for courtesy she asked how long we would be there and said we may have to move our car by 4 even though it was free until 6. I never understood this. It all ended up working out but made me feel like other guests were more important than us since there were empty spaces at the time and it was free another 3 hours. Free is free right? It was first come first serve so this upset and confused me.The complimentary breakfast is better than most hotels but near the end of our trip the pineapple seemed a little rotten and we couldn't eat it. The first 6 or 7 days it was great. All the other food was good. I liked having the oatmeal and fruit everyday. There's a good variety sure to please everyone. Toast (white and wheat) with butter and cream cheese, donuts, muffins, oranges, pineapple, coffee, tea, juice, water, oatmeal (brown sugar on the side), and pancakes and syrup. I think that's everything : )We had a corner room so our balcony was open on both sides instead of having a wall on one side. It was a gorgeous view of the Ala Wai/mountains/downtown that we enojoyed daily. If you prefer a view you'll be on the street side and if you're a light sleeper you'll want to bring earplugs. The windows don't block out any noise and there's a lot as early at 4 am. I would stay in this room again though just because I think the view is worth the racquet and we're east coasters and were in the habit of waking up by 6 or so anyways. It didn't really bother us.Our room had everything we needed and more. A good sized safe, maybe 10 x 14 or so..?, a mini fridge that's on the large size which we put to great use, a microwave, coffee maker, 3 large drawers that all our clothes fit into. We were realyl happy with it. Everything was very clean. Like other reviews I read the only thing I would say is the tub area could use a re-do but honestly it's not that big of a deal. We were in Hawaii so the last thing on our minds was our shower! We were only in the room to sleep and shower and the room served that purpose just fine. Don't get me wrong, we had a great trip and if/when we return to Oahu we would probably highly consider staying here again. It's about a 5 minute walk to the beach and is very centrally located. I would recommend it.","Litchfield, New Hampshire",1,3.0

The bath room was small too, but looked somehow newer and more acceptable.The windows had zero sound insulation and every vehicle that passed, or people talking outside on the road by was noted. Worst was the rubbish truck that came every morning about 06:00 am and parked with running engine some time in front of the hotel.After our complain we were given a room to the rear of the hotel which was more quiet. Still worn though. A few other points: Location: About 5 Minutes walk to Waikiki. That's very good.Lobby: quite open and spacey. Nice looking.Breakfast was included. It was quite simple, but absolutely sufficient for me. The coffee (important for me!) from the dispenser was good too. What was not good was the timing from 07:00-08:30 - and it closed 08:30 sharp. We were on holidays and don't really like to get up so early to catch breakfast. That was one issue, the other issue was that the breakfast area had limited seating. On days when the hotel was fuller guests had to venture to the lobby to find an empty seat. IMHO they should extend the breakfast time to at least 09:00 - or better 09:30. Internet: The rooms have free wired internet which works well.Staff: There wasn't too much staff interaction for us, but they seem all very nice and friendly.Conclusion: I would not stay in that place again.

The room set up was awkward with the tv sitting on the same table where the internet connection is at and had no chair high enough to sit on to work on the computer. The bathroom was cramped.

The location was also good, near all of the action in Waikiki. We also enjoyed the free breakfast every day. My biggest issue with the hotel was the cleanliness of the room. The floor clearly hadn't been mopped in a while. There was a lot of dust around. The bathroom walls and door were dirty. The hotel would have been so much better had the room been properly cleaned.

As soon as we arrived, there was no one to greet us and we had to carry our own luggage up to the lobby. Even though we stood there looking lost, no one approached us or told us where to go. When we went to the receptionist, even they ignored us and it took us a couple of times to get their attention. Finally, when we had one receptionist's attention, he was extremely curt and rude. We thought Hawaii was supposed to be home to friendly people and offer exceptional service, boy were we wrong. My husband and I have traveled to many countries and stayed in MANY hotels; out of all the places we've stayed at, this was the worst place. The room was tiny and not worth what we paid for. (you also have to pay $20 for parking). We were so turned off by the service we checked out the next day and moved hotels. It was THAT bad. Moving hotels was the best decision we'd ever made. We moved to a hotel only $30 dollars more expensive which turned out to be a 5star hotel - let me tell you, it was a completely different experience. For only $30 more, we received exceptional service and our hotel room was huge, clean, comfortable. It was such a stark difference from Aqua Aloha Surf & Spa. I honestly cannot get over how disappointed I was with the service at Aqua Aloha. 2 receptionists we interacted with were horrible. These 2 individuals should not be serving guests. When we spoke to the manager (through the phone, because he wasn't coming in until the afternoon), even HE gave us attitude!

Both times, the hotel was fully booked. The first time, I stayed with family and we rented out two suites on the top floor, fl 16. Excellent stay that time. Breakfast was good and we had a great vacation. I came back a year later with friends and we stayed in a cheaper room. I got an upgrade for coming back but we stayed on the 6th floor. This was not great since we got a smaller room, even with the upgrade but hey, we didn't complain because of the deal we were getting. What were the 2 things that prevent me from giving this place the same review as the first was that the breakfast seemed to go down in quality. Not a huge deal but I just remember more fruit and more juices the first time. The second, and bigger issue was that our room was next to the parking lot of the grocery store next door. There is an enormous banyan tree in that lot which has been around forever. If you're staying on the lower floors, you'll find that as soon as the sun is about to rise, those birds start chirping like nuts. Yeah, this is Hawaii and birds are everywhere but it's like that tree is the local Denny's or something. They're all chirping up a storm. For someone who likes to sleep til 8am or 9am, their chirping at 5am caused a problem. I asked to change rooms but the hotel was full so I used earplugs but I could still hear them... If you're a light sleeper, just pay the extra for a higher floor or a room on the side farthest from that tree. But still, it was a good stay for the price.",mitchellgrant,0,4.0

The lobby is incredible, great for relaxing, and the rooms were surprisingly modern. I was expecting problems with cleanliness and the air conditioner, both of which are issues at another Aqua property, but I was very pleasantly surprised.There were a total of 14 of us staying in 6 rooms for a family reunion for 9 days. The only complaint we had was it was difficult to get them to set up the booking in advance and get the quote... kind of had to keep pestering them. (It finally took a message like, ""Really? In this economy you WANT us to take our $6000 down the street?"") But once we eventually got the quote, we were delighted with it, and the service at the hotel itself was fantastic.The pool, and poolside area is a bit of a joke, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll probably want the Princess Kaiulani down the street. It has a better setup overall (big pool, sunning area, restaurant, bar, live music at night), but if you're mostly looking for a room for crashing, the Aqua's rooms are nicer.

Originally thought we might have a bit of a hike to the beach from the Aqua Aloha but were very pleasantly surprised! A few minutes pleasant easy walk with all the beach gear and a 6 year old (who generally didn't like walking far at all in the heat!)Right next door to the Food Pantry supermarket, and our favourite inexpensive eating spot ""Perrys Smorgy"" was on the same block. Very close to bus stop. For our purposes we couldn't have got a better location.Hotel amenities/services: Loved the lobby with the surf videos playing behind the desk. The free breakfast was much appreciated, yes it does finish at 8.30 so we needed to be organised but were happy with that. Pancakes, donuts, toast, fruit. Can't quite remember if there was cereal as well (getting mixed up with other hotel breakfasts!) You do need to show your room key to enter the breakfast room, we saw a couple of guests argue about this but I think it is a fair enough rule. Only possible downside to breakfast was that at the time we stayed it got very busy, by 8.15AM both the breakfast room and lobby seating got quite full but you weren't able to take food away to your room.Didn't use the pool but it looked fine.Weekly Managers reception with free drinks was a nice touch.No problems with room keys, elevators etc.We loved how this hotel was smaller than a lot of others and seemed quite peaceful compared to the full on activity in the lobbies of the larger hotels.Room: We had a triple all-in-one room on 12th floor and were thrilled with it, couch plus table, kitchenette and enough play space to keep my daughter happy. Room was clean and well maintained, saw one cockroach on first night but he didn't return and I know a few bugs are to be expected in a tropical climate (according to the guest book the hotel will attend to them if reported). No noise issues at all (apart from a few sirens going past which is par for the course in a city).Staff: All of the staff whom we came in contact with from housekeeping to maintenance to reception were friendly,approachable and helpful. We had a lovely chat to Mark the maintenance man who came in to change over the lightbulbs (he should have an official guest relations job!). Our housekeeping lady was lovely and always arranged my daughters toys nicely on the bed (daughter really appreciated this!) The desk staff were very helpful with sightseeing/attraction information. The lady on the desk ordered a taxi for us to get to the airport and she ran through our schedule with us to make sure we would be there with time to spare (this was a few days after the security breach which led to extra checks and longer lines at airports). On a prior trip to Hawaii we had stayed at a hotel (since demolished to make way for a new shopping complex) whose desk staff were quite indifferent towards us so we were really appreciative of the Aqua Aloha's employees.We would definately stay at this hotel again, even though the exchange rate has picked up considerably!","Canterbury, New Zealand",18,4.0

Compared to all the other hotels in the area, it's soooo cheap! It's only a 5 minute walk from the Waikiki beach and serves a fairly decent free breakfast. (Pancakes, toast, muffins, fruit.) Unfortunately the price and the breakfast are pretty much the only saving graces, because the hotel is horrendously run down. We booked the the cheapest room in the hotel and it was advertised as having a queen bed. After checking in we walked into a tiny room with a tiny full bed and a crappy, dingy stand-up shower. The room was on the 3rd floor and we were woken up at 6am by next door construction and traffic noises from a nearby busy road. This wasn't going to fly, so for 20 bucks/night we upgraded to the deluxe suite on the 14 floor. This room was considerably quieter, had a normal queen bed and a balcony. It also had a very stained couch, very stained drapes, a dingy bathroom, and a toilet that wouldn't stop running. Since this was one of their nicer rooms, I'm assuming all of other rooms in the hotel are in a similar state.So if you are broke and just wan't to go Hawaii, this place is for you.

I got exactly that: a decent room with limited amenities at a fair price. I needed something close to everything and this hotel is close to the beach, shopping, and local tourist attractions. One added convenience was the free internet and free local calls. If you do not have your lap top, you can access the world wide web for a fee in the internet cafe which is situated in the lobby. The service from all employees from the front desk to the chamber maids was fine. All my requests were met efficiently and with a great deal of professionalism. The Aqua hotel is part of a chain and there are a few of these properties with different names such as the Wave and the Surf, in and around Waikiki. Even though I was there at the peak of tourist season, during the Christmas holidays, I was gratified that the hotel was smaller thus catering to a smaller number of guests.

Especially when we told them we were on our honeymoon. They insisted on upgrading us and even chastised us for not emailing them sooner! The rooms are on the small side, but they have a refrigerator (which is necessary in the heat) and free broadband access (you need to collect a ethernet cable from the front desk if you don't have one). Some advice:1. Take the shuttle from the airport. It only costed $9 per person. Taxis can charge you up to $100! You can purchase a round trip for $16. The shuttle driver from the airport was giving us great information and tips.2. Don't eat at the Jimmy Buffet restaurant. The food was OK, but the service was very, very slow. And there were probably as many wait staff around as customers! I was literally bumping into them.3. Do take the helicopter tour of the island. It costs around $200 per person for 45 minutes and a further $40 or 50 (for European) to purchase the video you made with pilot's commentary. It is very much worth it if you are probably never going to be able to go back. You can book this at the activities desk in the lobby.",Hampshire,0,4.0

Nothing special but great value for the budget minded traveller. We got upgraded to a ""superior"" room without asking. I would have like to have seen the regular room for comparsion. We only had a shower and my wife wished it contained a bath. But it was kept cleaned and tidy. As usual, we mostly used it for arrivng back and going to bed after long day of activities.It is only a short walk to the beaches, shopping, aquarium, zoo, park, bus stop and ABC convenience stores (which are everywheres in Waikiki!). A bus schedule can be picked up at those stores. Buses cost $2 and one can even take them all around the island. We did a 2.5 hour half-island circle tour in one and really enjoyed it to get familiarized with the island.The staff was very friendly and helpful. They gave directions, suggested restaurants and order taxis and a shuttle bus for us. Taxis cost us about $30-40 to airport. Another time we used a coupon for a shuttle bus ($6 each) and it got us to the airport in 30 minutes (but later in evening..not rush hour).Breakfast is OK but still adequate. Muffins, doughnuts, fresh pancakes, and toasted bread (without any jam...I guess you could bring your own!). Also some fruit (pineapples & bananas) and juice (a little watered down not freshly squeezed!). Not much place to sit and eat. Often one has to share a table. A couple at a table where we sat down got up, took their food and left! There was enough room but I guess they didn't want to share. There is a unused dining room right beside the breakfast area but they wouldn't allow people in to eat there. Overall it was a pleasant place to stay among much more expensive hotels in the area.

I am completely satisfied with it, especially considering the price I paid.Hotel is located in the center of Waikiki, 3 blocks from the beach. The lobby area has a swanky design, the staff is friendly. There is a coffee/tea machine. The ""Spa"" in the name is a marketing gimmick - it just means that there is an attached massage parlor in the same building. The pool and the gym were tiny and located basically in the lobby area - probably just to put check marks in the ""facilities provided"". But I didn't care for them, so I'm not complaining. There is a lady at the reception from Expedia who helps booking tours and activities. You probably could get similar trips cheaper elsewhere, but I did not have time to shop around.My room was really tiny, but I didn't mind that much. It was in great condition, had a flat screen tv (not HD, but thankfully it wasn't mangling the picture by stretching it). There was a fridge, a microwave and free wired internet.Free breakfast (pancakes, toast, pastries, fruit) was pretty good and was saving me at least $15 every morning by Waikiki prices. The parking garage was tiny and cramped. I actually broke the mirror of my rental car while backing out of the space. Since there are so few parking spaces, they charge the obscene $20/day for parking. After browsing the tripadvisor forums I found a better deal ($10) at Waikiki Banyan 3 long blocks away. In general you don't need a car in Waikiki, so I would seriously recommend getting it only for those days when you plan to explore the island.To summarize, I enjoyed my stay. It's a modern 3-star hotel in great condition and in a convenient location.","San Francisco, California",50,4.0

The rooms aren't the largest we've ever seen but they were comfortable for 2 of us. Nice sized furnished balcony, comfy beds and couch. Enjoyed the small, but adequate, breakfast and coffee each morning. Didn't spend much time in the room itself (who does when they vacation in paradise?!) but it was great for the time we were there. The front desk staff was more than helpful in helping us with whatever we needed, including a great dinner for our anniversary, and they even made the reservations and called a cab for us while we changed. The pool is small but we never used it, as the ocean is 2 short blocks away. There are several great restaurants within a block of the hotel and of course the infamous ABC store on the corner to get whatever you need. Parking is a liitle pricey and is first come only in the lot next to the hotel (which the hotel doesn't manage or own). Views from the partial ocean view room we were in were nice, not amazing (as we were 2 block from the beach behind other hotels) but decent, and the mountain views from the other side of the balcony were beautiful.

Because we were bumped from the Bamboo, we were given the jr. suite, free parking, and a box of chocolates which was nice. But overall, the Aloha Surf was good enough. The bed wasn't extremely comfortable but wasn't terrible. The safe had a key instead of the digital lock. The furniture in the room was older and stained. The shower was pretty gross. The handle on the toilet had to be jiggled to get it to stop running everytime we flushed. The tv was very very tiny. The view was nice. There is a refrigerator, microwave, larger sink, and buners.

The team member said if we came back at noon they could probably check us in earlier which is exactly what happened. So we walked around for the morning and they conveniently stored our luggage for us. We were on the 7th floor and faced the street and had a balcony. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff were great, very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is in a great location. Just 2 blocks from the beach (you can borrow a towel to take to the beach from the front desk) and the International Marketplace was also a couple of blocks away. There are restaurants and shops all around. They offer breakfast each morning from 7.30-8.30am with fresh fruit, muffins, donuts etc and occasionally pancakes. There are a couple of juice options. It was a little early for me, so my husband would get up and bring me up a bowl of food which suited me fine.If you have your own laptop you can get a cable from the front desk and get free Internet access which was great. There is also WiFi in the reception area.I was a little challenged by the noise, I even took earplugs after reading other reviews. But it wasn't so much the street noise that bothered me but the noise from the people next door who let their baby cry ALL night (obviously this is not the hotel's problem)!! We asked to be moved and the hotel was very obliging, but our neighbors ended up moving so there was no need in the end.I noticed our room must have had the option of being a connecting one as there was a door and I think that's where the noise issue came from as we could easily hear normal conversations. There were days were the adjoining room must have been empty so we didn't worry too much about it.This hotel is great, but I personally like a little more luxury so next time I will probably opt for another property, and pay the price for it!Surf & Spa is a great hotel at an affordable price.","Sydney, Australia",85,4.0

If your not staying long and/or don’t have much stuff the Superior would be fine, if staying for awhile though the deluxe room is worth it… Wasn’t much bigger but having the couch and extra room for suit cases made a world of difference… Didn’t have any issues with the bathroom or anything else in the room… Nothing fancy but was quite nice… The breakfast was more of a bonus then anything especially seeing as not many offer one that’s included and most seem to charge an arm and leg that don’t… The thing that I enjoyed most about the hotel was the help of the front desk and also the location… It was really close to the grocery store which we found quite helpful… I was also worried about it being a few blocks away from the beach but once we got there didn’t even notice it really… As for the front desk, I asked them to help me out to do up the room because I was planning on getting engaged on a certain night… When we came back from our sunset cruise not only was she surprised but I was as well… Flower petals leading up to the bed and a giant shaped heart on the king size bed along with wine and chocolates… They even put flower petals in the bathroom… It was certainly I night to remember and I can thank the front desk and managers of the hotel for organizing it… Also organized a few tours through them which was really quite helpful… If they thought it was a little to pricy they let us know and offer us suggestions on what else to do… The one ocean joy trip they recommended was just as they said and was one of the highlights of our trip… Asked about renting a car and they said they were all out… A few calls from the pay phone to some of the other places around and we ended up getting a car, no problem at all… Aside from, nothing really to complain about… If your looking for something fancy this isn’t it but if you looking for a solid hotel with staff that’s willing to go that little extra mile then I would have no problem recommending this hotel…",Ontario,2,4.0

In the past 25 years I've stayed in absolutely the worst properties and the very best. I like to think I know hotels. The Aqua Aloha Surf & Spa is pretty darn good given that you could pay far more for a major chain hotel like the Hyatt or Hilton or Sheraton and get a room that looks like any other. This hotel is just fine for couples, families or business. If you want expensive luxury, pampering and a view of the ocean, this ain't it. If you want good value for money - this is it.CHECK-IN: a guest had an ""issue"" when I arrived and desk staff - after saying they'd be with me - focused on that for about 5 mins. They apologized profusely when they did get to me; no problems after that with check-in. They were friendly and helpful and correctly advised against eating in the Asian fusion restaurant in the hotel (I did anyway and I regret it).MY ROOM: I'd researched a lot of Waikiki properties in advance and booked directly with reservations staff at Aqua - the small Honolulu based chain of boutique hotels that owns the Aloha Surf & Spa. I requested a 1-bedroom suite with a view as high up in the hotel as possible, and that's exactly what I got. Top floor, north-west corner, with a large wrap-around balcony and lovely view of the mountains over the canal from living room window. I can see a tiny piece of the Pacific. Bottom-line: you will NOT get an ocean view at this property. The street noise up this high is not a problem.Room Size: I don't know about the rest of the rooms, but this 1-bedroom with separate living room is big enough for me. I imagine a couple with two kids might be a bit squeezed since there's very little closet space. There's just a kitchenette, small microwave with turntable, sink, plates and cutlery and a fridge underneath sink. Apparently there are other rooms with a full kitchen.TV's - yes, they are flat screens as advertised, but NO they are not wide-screens (they're 4:3) or HDTV's. They're also not very big. Reception is not great. But you aren't coming to Hawaii to watch TV are you? It's good enough.OVERALL ROOM CONDITION/CLEANLINESS: appointments and furnishings aren't new, but they all match and they're in decent condition. I wouldn't say its the most clean room I've been in, but its not dirty at all, good enough. The ceilings are the old acoustical prickly stuff - they really should scrape it all off, they're weathered and stained. There are blackout curtains but because some of the curtain has pulled off the hook, they don't completely block all the light - its good enough. The bed is kinda tired and lumpy, but good enough if you're looking for a semi-firm bed as am I. No plush pillow-tops or sleep number beds here I'm afraid. There are different kinds of pillows on the bed - not just puffy, fat ones, which makes me happy, I like thin, firm pillows.BATHROOM: my suite has a little dressing mirror and shelf outside of the bathroom, next to the closet. Bathroom itself has seen better days but its clean enough; shower only; good water pressure. The towels are decent and there's a lot of them. There's a safe in the closet; you take the key with you. Ironing board and iron are provided.INTERNET: essential for me; they asked if I had a laptop and gave me the cable (CAT5) at the front desk. Room hookup is glued to dresser that TV sits on, which means the cable trails across the floor if you put your laptop on the coffee table in front of the couch: trip hazard. There's a table and chair by the door meant to be a desk, but I don't like staring at walls when I work. Internet connection is free and works just fine.BREAKFAST: continental breakfast offered, includes pancakes, toast, and oatmeal, fresh fruit, coffee, etc. It's nothing special but its good enough. Served on paper plates with plastic utensils - they could do better there. Seating is a bit of a problem; everyone is all over the lobby trying to eat breakfast at the same time. Starts at 7am - I need it earlier, oh well.PARKING: There's maybe 25 spots down there, but every time I come back from work there seems to be a spot or two open. Fingers crossed. Parking costs $20 a day; pricey but worth it.MAID SERVICE: the person cleaning my room, Analiya, is doing fine. She makes the bed, tidies up and washes my dishes for me and sets them out to dry. I did notice when I first checked in that there was a little food from previous guest in fridge - she must have forgotten to check. No big deal; she's getting a nice tip.SPA: I'm about to have a massage, I'm sure it will be fine. They've got a special on right now - 50 minutes for $65 including tip. Not bad. Lots of spas here are double that.HOTEL RESTAURANT: CHINESE/ASIAN Fusion. They warned me at the front desk that it wasn't very good; it's not. There's a bar/internet cafe too; I'm sure its fine.OVERALL - you could do a lot worse and spend a lot more; the Aloha Surf and Spa is certainly good enough!",San Diego,39,4.0

He told me that he would be checking me into a room on the 2nd floor. Since I booked a standard room 5 MONTHS before my arrival, I had called and requested if they could please put me in a standard room higher up to avoid the noise. The customer service rep. at the time told me they have 2-3 standard rooms from floors 3 and up. He said the 2nd floor has the most standard size rooms and that they could not guarantee me a room on a higher floor. I asked him I understood and if they could try their best to please accommodate me and my gf, who has a hard time sleeping if there were a lot of noise. I guess calling and booking 5 months early did not help. I tried to explain to him my situation and that I called 5 months earlier. The noise was definitely a problem and I was going to be staying there for a week. At this time, a woman, who I suspect to be the on duty supervisor or manager named SINA, walked over and interjected into our conversation. She started to have a defensive tone and raised her voice at me. She said that they do not guarantee anything and that they were fully booked for the night. However, I saw a vacancy sign lit up in the front of the hotel. I did not know why she had to give me a defensive tone when I was trying to tell them what I did and if there was any way I could get a room higher up. I did not argue with her and just kept my cool. I resented the fact that she have displayed really POOR customer service on the first day. I look young for my age and I believe she thought I did not know much. She practically ruined my first night and I was pretty upset. I had read numerous comment on the customer service at this hotel several months before my trip and a majority of the reviews gave it a good rating. This incident did not live up to that expectation at all!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would not return to this hotel again. If they pride themselves over customer service then at least have the decency to be respectful to me.

I called the front desk to try and change rooms and the said they were fully booked, only to go downstairs and see the vacancy sign lit up! Since we booked through priceline, which is non refundable, we did not make a big deal,since we were only staying one night. We did consider just driving home and not even using the room!

The ride takes 45 minutes, and the bus drops you at the corner of Kuhio and Kanakapolei, a two-minute walk from the hotel. You’ll need exact fare of US $2 (bills or change), and your luggage must fit under your seat or on your lap; if not, the driver may not allow you on (we saw this happen). As a rough guide, if you can take your stuff on the plane as carry-on, you can take it on the bus, but play safe and check the website (www.thebus.org) for details about the size and number of items permitted. While you’re on the site, plug in your arrival date, time and hotel address to find out which buses coincide with your schedule.Room and service:We had booked a moderate room but were told on check-in that we were being upgraded at no cost to a deluxe room, a very nice gesture that was much appreciated as the room assigned was considerably larger than we would otherwise have had. Our room (#704) was at the back of the hotel (i.e., not overlooking Kanekapolei), so we heard virtually no traffic noise. In fact, other than the occasional early morning garbage pick-up, which you hear in any city anywhere, there was no disturbance of any kind – and most nights we slept with the windows and balcony door open rather than run the air conditioning.The room had an Ethernet connection (we took our own cable, though I understand you can borrow one from the front desk), and the safe in the closet was big enough for our MacBook, digital cameras, wallets and other bits and pieces. There’s no fee, but don’t lose the key, or you’ll be charged $50 for a replacement. The room also had a small fridge and microwave, along with dinner plates, side plates, bowls, mugs and cutlery. There was a good selection of TV channels, but if you’d rather watch a movie and have a laptop, you can rent DVDs from Food Pantry for $1.Breakfast, served from 7:00-8:30 a.m. sharp, was included in the hotel rate. It consisted of oatmeal porridge, pancakes, orange wedges and either pineapple slices or banana halves, bread/toast with cream cheese, small muffins, mini donuts and coffee. There was no milk for either the porridge or the coffee – just powdered creamer – and no jam, but you can easily pick up supplies at one of the nearby stores and keep it in your fridge. The lobby can be busy at breakfast, so if you can’t find seating, or if you just prefer to eat outdoors, head along the little corridor adjacent to the spa to a small outdoor seating area. We had it to ourselves almost every morning.Eats and drinks around the corner:You can stock up on picnic and/or meal supplies at stores located just moments from the hotel. The ABC Store on the corner of Kanekapolei and Kuhio has packaged sandwiches and deli stuff, frozen dinners, fresh fruit, yogurt, cold drinks (including beer and wine), ice cream, macadamia nuts, etc. There are ABCs everywhere – 37 in or near Waikiki – carrying pretty much the same stock. I went into the branch at 2456 Kalakaua (oceanfront) in search of an insulated lunch bag I’d seen on their website. Turned out it’s sold only by mail order, but they very kindly arranged to have it shipped (this involved someone from the store going and picking it up), and it was available for me to collect the following day. Talk about customer service!The Food Pantry, Waikiki’s only real supermarket, is just around the corner from the hotel on Kuhio. It carries sushi (always fresh because it’s made on the premises, and the turnover is rapid), sandwiches and wraps, salads (green, pasta, roasted veggie, etc.), BBQ chickens, hot Asian dishes, packaged meals like chicken cutlets, meatloaf, salmon cakes (choice varies daily), beer, wine, spirits and baked goods. There’s also an in-store coffee shop and a Beard Papa’s serving light breakfasts, if you’d like a change from hotel fare.Perry’s Smorgy Restaurant, again on the corner of Kanekapolei and Kuhio, serves buffet-style breakfast, lunch and dinner. You can eat indoors or take an outdoor table beside the waterfall in the little garden. We tried it for dinner and were impressed by the quality, variety and freshness of the food for just US $12. They don’t serve liquor, but you’re welcome to take your own beer or wine (no corkage charge, and they provide the bottle opener and glasses).Things to do within walking distance of the hotel:Waikiki Beach is just a few minutes away. Best time to go if you want to avoid the crowds is early morning. The water is also calmer, and you’re less likely to overdo the sun. You can check out beach towels at the front desk; ask the bell staff to sign them back in.Diamond Head is a pleasant walk from the hotel, and you’ll be rewarded with good views of Waikiki and Honolulu. It takes 45-60 minutes at a leisurely pace to reach the park entrance, then another 45 minutes or so to the summit. Do your feet a favour and wear light hikers or sneakers. Guidebooks advise you to take a flashlight for the tunnels, but that information seems to be old; the tunnels are lit. The park closes at 6 p.m., so don’t start out too late or you may get locked in.The aquarium and zoo, opposite each other, are about ten minutes from the hotel, and both are well worth a visit. We had planned to snorkel at Hanauma Bay on our last day, but the weather was poor, so we settled for the aquarium instead. You may not get to swim with the fish, but you will get good photos (mine are better than the ones I took while snorkelling during a previous vacation at Captain Cook on the Big Island). Across the street at the zoo, you can get quite close to a number of (non-dangerous) animals. We were told that late morning or lunchtime is the best time for viewing because that’s when most animals are fed; nonetheless, we saw the majority during a late afternoon visit.Things to do by bus from the hotel:About eight routes have stops on Kuhio near Kanekapolei. You can pick up timetables for many of them at the ABC Store on that corner. It is also the closest place to buy a pass for four consecutive days of unlimited travel on TheBus (US $20, cash only). Otherwise, have exact US $2 for each trip. Though most places are reachable by bus, some destinations that look nearby on the map take an extraordinarily long time to get to. Before you leave home, think about where you’d like to visit and use www.thebus.org to plan your route and estimate travel time. Also check the time of the last bus (some routes operate only during daylight hours). If you do get lost, drivers are helpful.Pearl Harbor is easily reached by bus. Entrance to the offshore Arizona Monument is free. Prior to being shuttled over, you’ll see a movie about the attack on the fleet at Pearl Harbor. There are optional paid tours of the battleship Missouri and the submarine Bowfin. We visited the latter and found it intriguing.The Hawai’i Maritime Centre at Pier 7 in Honolulu Harbor is a short ride from the hotel. Unfortunately, the replica of the double-hulled canoe that retraced the voyage of Polynesia’s ancient explorers using just celestial navigation is no longer located there, and the Falls of Clyde, the last remaining fully-rigged four-master, may be removed at any time for repairs, but there are still plenty of interesting exhibits. The nearby Aloha Tower gives views of the harbour and downtown.The Bishop Museum, which operates the Maritime Centre, is another worthwhile destination you can get to by bus. The Hawai’ian Hall was closed when we visited, but even without it, there’s a lot to see, and docents give talks or demonstrations about various topics.O’ahu has many lovely beaches that are on bus routes. Access Kailua Bay via the beach park, which has restrooms and showers. Most people turn right when they walk onto the beach. If you turn left, you’ll be further from the facilities, but you’ll also have the place almost to yourself, especially in the morning. The sand is very soft and the water crystal clear. There’s not much shade, so arrive early if you want to bag a spot under the trees. From Kailua, we took a bus to Sea Life Park and from there walked past Makapuu Beach Park and on up to the lighthouse at Makapuu Point (there’s no bus stop at the point). It takes about 45 minutes from the parking lot to the summit. Great views, and if you’re lucky, you may see humpback whales. (We didn’t, but others did.) On the way back to Waikiki, you could stop at Koko Crater and hike to its botanical garden (admission free, no facilities). Plan carefully, because depending on the bus route and direction (this area is on a circle route), travel from one spot to another can take longer than you might expect. The north shore beaches are also accessible by bus. Some are more suitable for surfing than swimming. If you just want to give the area the once-over, take the circle bus route. You’ll see quite a bit of the island, though it will take maybe three hours or more.Checking out:Our flight was late at night, so we left our luggage with the bell staff after checking out. The front desk will arrange a shuttle to the airport if you wish, or you can take the bus.If you’ve made it this far, my apologies for the length of the review. There are lots of other things to do and places to see in O’ahu, and the Aqua Aloha is a good base for your visit.","Victoria, BC",393,5.0

As such, I apologize in advance for its length.So, where do I start with this amazing hotel??? Well, first off, I cannot go any further without complimenting the tremendous service that this hotel provided us during our stay! From the moment we checked in on the evening of April 6th, 2009 to the time we departed on the morning of April 13th, 2009, the staff at this hotel were always willing to help us out!Before continuing with my review, I would just like to give a huge thank you to the hotel manager, Courtnay Koski. I had been in contact with her months before my visit as I was planning to propose to my then-girlfriend on Waikiki beach during our stay. Well, what can I say, Courtnay not only helped me organize the setup in my hotel room for my special night, I found out that she actually came in on a Saturday night at midnight and personally set up our room exactly how I described it to her. It was truly amazing, better than I could have ever imagined it! Better yet, she had offered a complimentary upgrade for our room to a Deluxe Partial City View room for the duration of our stay even though I had originally booked a room at the lowest price level (i.e. moderate city view). She also provided us with a complimentary bottle of wine and a box of Hawaiian chocolates in the room to celebrate our engagement. What more can someone ask for then this? It was a very special moment in our lives and Courtnay took care of everything no questions asked, and she also helped me stay within my budget given the current economic conditions and the high costs associated with the entire proposal process. She is definitely a hard-working professional who is willing to go the extra mile for her guests. But wait, that's not all! Courtnay had already had my room ready for us when we checked in and as soon as we entered the room, I found a hand-written personal message from Courtnay to welcome us! How many hotel managers do you know who would do this for their guests??? This is customer service at its best! Courtnay is truly dedicated to her job and it just goes to show how this type of extraordinary service can reflect on the rest of the staff at the Aloha Surf!As for the rest of hotel amenities, they were great for the purposes of our trip! The complimentary reception in the lobby on Tuesday evening from 5-6pm was a great start to the evening as they were providing unlimited cocktails and 10-minute massages along with entertainment provided by the hotel staff and a grand prize raffle for a free 60-minute massage. The pool was small, but was not really important for us and there was also a nice tanning area around the pool that was great for relaxing! We didn't rent a car so I cannot comment on the parking situation there! The room was a perfect size for us with a sofa and king bed, but I would recommend going for the deluxe room with sofa as there wasn't a luggage rack in the room so the sofa came in handy for putting our luggage on! The bathroom was a bit small, but what do you expect for such a great value hotel! If you are like me, you would rather save the $100+ per night on your hotel room and use that extra $$$ for the rest of your trip (i.e. activities, restaurants, shopping, etc!)We were first time visitors to Waikiki and this hotel location was still perfect for us! Not even a 5-minute walk to the beautiful waves of Pacific Ocean and central Waikiki beach, and easy access to Honolulu's bus system within a couple minutes walking distance! Best of all, this location gets you right in the heart of Waikiki beach where there is a nice concession area and easy access to public restrooms right on the beach!I hope that this review is helpful and if you would like more specific information about the hotel before you visit, I would recommend contacting Courtnay, as she was more than willing to help me out with any questions I had! Also, please take a look at the pictures that I have included and feel free to contact me if you require any further tips/insight about this hotel and I will gladly try to help you out!","Vancouver, Canada",25,5.0

The hotel room was clean and spacious with a kitchenette. We were on the 8th floor. It was very convenient to Food Pantry, which I think is the only major grocery store on Waikiki. It was also convenient to the bus transfer stop, and a pretty short walk to the beach. The complimentary breakfast included pancakes, muffins, toast, different fruits, juice, etc. It was a lot better than most free hotel breakfasts. My husband got a good massage in the hotel spa.

The pictures online of the lobby were a very good representation of the hotel. The hotel has been recently renovated- the rooms were modern, bright, clean and tastefully decorated. I wasn't expecting anything fancy but we were more than happy with our time at the Aqua Aloha The staff were extremely helpful. Breakfast was included- nothing fancy but they had pancakes, muffins, donuts, fruit, poridge and juice/coffee. They did not have jam for the toast or milk for the poridge but we just bought some milk and jam/peanut butter so it was an easy solution. I would definetly return to this hotel for another holiday. The only down side was that it was 2 blocks from the beach (about 5-7 min walk) but we did have an ocean view from our balcony. The rooms on the street side definetly have a better view of the ocean providing you are on the 12th floor or higher (otherwise there are too many buildings blocking your the view). We found this hotel much quieter than other hotels we have stayed in while in Waikiki. The swimming pool was very small- but who goes to Hawaii to sit at a pool when you can sit on a beach? There was free internet connections in the room.",Canada,6,4.0

You could literally walk anywhere you wanted to go (including the beach!) which we loved! Be sure and try the nearby Japanese restaurant where the chefs cook right at your table -- very, very fun and delicious too! (The hotel might have discount coupons for this -- ask!)

We stayed in a room that overlooked the teeny tiny pool down below and some old apartments across from us. You could see Waikiki Beach in the distance to the right, which was kind of neat. I have mixed reviews about this hotel because the entrance was very nice and open and clean. The room wasn't too bad. Maybe 3 out of 5 but the first night we stayed there was a Saturday night and people were yelling and loud until 4 am! I kept getting up and looking out in disbelief because so many people were still up and walking around until then. Sunday night was much better though. I did not think we would have a positive experience in Honolulu after that first night but we did. We loved that we didn't pay an outrageous fee to stay there and still were within walking distance of the beach and all of the shops downtown. Oh, and warning...do not drink the water!! It smells like a sewer. At least in our room it did. The ABC stores have a huge container of Hawaiian spring water though for $.99 so no big deal.

Each morning the garbage trucks made such a loud racket that I found myself just getting up for the day.) 4) I had trouble getting even water temperature in the shower.

Arriving at the hotel I found that may not have made the best choice. I knew I was in trouble immediately when inquiring about rooms and the front desk clerk said ""no one stays in their rooms here"". When he described it as over 300 square feet, I felt reassured. In actuality, my room was about half that size. The room itself was on the third floor and was akin to the first dorm room I ever had--very small and sparse. The bed was literally up against the size of one wall and barely gave you room on the other side to get in. The room was very warm, as the a/c didn't work. The bathroom was tiny with a pedestal sink. There was no balcony and the windows did open slightly to the very loud main street below. I started my vacation in Hawaii very poorly.The next day, I think because of the broken a/c, I was given a room change. What a different hotel that brought me into. The room was twice the size; had a big bed; a sofa; a kitchenette; a large bathroom with counter space; a balcony and decorations. The hotel itself was a blend of differences: Lively, colorful lobby to drab hallways. Some great front desk clerks to others who seemed inconvienced they have to stop their personal conversations to assist you. A rather full contiential breakfast served in a crowded, stale setting. Their fitness area was an outdoor hallway with a couple of poorly maintained pieces of equipment.There is a ""cafe"" in the lobby which was never opened during my week there. Workers would be inside, but the doors were never opened. The front desk would tell you that there was internet access inside, but could never provide you with hours of operation.This is a hotel that could be fantastic, but just isn't.

There were some issues however. The restaurant attached to the hotel no longer offers lunch - just dinner, and in the week I was there I don't think I ever saw anyone eat there. The attached bar with internet access was 'closed for renovations' which was a joke since the owners were there almost every night with the gate up, but when asked if the internet was available for a few minutes they would say 'no, closed' in broken English. It seemed as though they would only make it available if you spent a substantial amount of money/time. The rooms are okay but musty smelling - the tiny bathroom has no exhaust fan and the balcony had only plastic chairs and was usually puddle filled from all the A/C leakage - both from the room and the ones above. You also wouldn't really want to use the balcony - the view on both sides is limited to other apartment/condo/hotel buildings and there was frequent dog barking and condo dwellers shouting loudy for someone to ""shut those dogs up!"". TV access is limited/fuzzy and there is no 'pay per view' movies for the rainy days. The hotel also doesn't offer a shuttle, though the staff are helpful in figuring out the bus schedule. On the positive side, the room had a nice kitchenette (microwave, coffee maker, small (dorm sized) fridge), and the pool area had comfy seating.

We needed an inexpensive place to stay several days before all the guests showed up for the ""Wedding"" hotel. I read about all the Aqua Boutique Hotels on-line and read the various reviews. When I found an incredible deal for the Aloha Surf, centrally located near the beach, that included free high speed Internet and continental breakfast, I couldn't pass it up. When my daughter heard about the deal, she had me book her a room too. That really put pressure on me since she lives in Japan. So, when we arrived at the Aloha Surf we were totally shocked that it was not rated as a 5-Star Hotel.It was super, super clean. The lobby was understated and beautiful. The staff could not do enough for us. They made you feel that you were a guest in their home and not a wallet to extract every cent. The room had everything that was advertised including a private lanai.I would have liked a desk in the room which would have made it more convenient for me to work. I needed an Ethernet cable to connect. The front desk simply handed it to me and asked if there was anything else I needed. The continental breakfast was better than most and was a great way to start the day without a hassle or an expense. Parking in their lot was convenient and less expensive than other hotels. My daughter was very pleased with everything at the Aloha Surf. Our biggest regret was that we had to leave the Aloha Surf and move to the clip joint down the block that was the ""wedding"" hotel.

The rooms are nice and clean, but a little small. The parking was a little steep at $20/day and not being on the beach, but what do you do.

It turned out my anxiety was groundless...The Pros: 1) Located in the heart of Waikiki, within walking distance to a LOT. 2) The bellhop was quick to offer his assistance. 3) The front desk staffer had us checked in within minutes; the complimentary bottles of water on check-in and the free apples were a really nice touch. 4) The hotel's a bit on the small side, but the elevator is centrally located, so the walk, even from the basement parking spots to the room, wasn't that far. 5) Though on the small side, the room was clean and well-appointed; the sofa, microwave, refrigerator, dishes and eating utensils made it feel like a junior suite. We were able to save some money on food by purchasing microwaveable meals or bringing back leftovers to reheat later. 6) The queen and twin beds and the sofa would sleep four adults easily (though there were only two of us during our stay). 7) Free internet (see ""cons"" below as well). 8) Our housekeeper was friendly and efficient. 9) When we had a problem with our TV remote, we mentioned it to a passing maintenance worker and he fixed the problem within 10 minutes. 10) When we had a problem with our neighbors smoking on their balcony (see ""cons"" below), one call to the front desk resolved the situation.The Cons: 1) The (lack of) parking--Waikiki parking in general is a nightmare; had I not called ahead and reserved one of the hotel's parking spaces, I'd have had to resort to street parking or finding a lot. At the tune of $20 a day, the parking was a bit pricey, but it was worth not having to worry about trying to find parking, and the walk to the room was short. 2) The window-unit air conditioner was a bit lacking in performance, especially since our room faced the west, and heated up during the afternoon. 3) Though the hotel is a non-smoking property, the couple in the next room, upwind from us, were out on their balcony puffing away. I called the front desk and was told that clients were told they could smoke on their balconies as long as they kept the smoke from going back into their room. The smoke from that couple was making its way into our room through the glass-louver windows and exacerbating my friend's asthma. One call to the front desk fixed the problem, though (see ""pros"" above). 4) Internet access was wireless only in the lobby and by the pool. In the room, internet access was wired, and the cable provided by the front desk were a bit short, which turned our room into a kind of steeple-chase arrangement, with us stepping over the cable to get around the room.Obviously, the pros FAR outweighed the cons, and I'd definitely recommend this property.","Orlando, FL",3,5.0

However, my friends' room faced the canal, which is a major traffic route and they complained of noise. My room was small but nicely furnished and clean, It had 1 double and 1 single bed, a couch, coffee table, TV ,and efficiency kitchen with microwave, mini-fridge, sink and coffee maker. The shower/toilet area was separated from the sink area which was convenient for 2 people getting ready for the day. The hotel staff were nice and accomodating. The free breakfast was fine - toast, fruit, oatmeal muffins. My one complaint--no fresh milk for coffee, only dry creamer. Also, there is no bar in the hotel. I think they are waiting for a liquor license, but did not have it yet (I was there Oct. 2008). However, the hotel directly across the street has a bar. Another drawback - the pool is really, really small. I didn't care since I spent all my time at the beach, but for families with kids who may want the benefit of a pool--be warned.Last, the hotel charges $20/day to park and the underground parking garage is really tight. There is also a small street-level parking lot next to the hotel, which is where I parked--much easier to get in and out of.Overall, my total cost with daily parking was about US $100/night, and I thought that was more than reasonable.

The air conditioner was difficult to find, but finally did and got it to working. It did a good job cooling the room.Unfortunately, there was NO dresser whatsoever in the room. Also, the bed had to have been built over a large stone, as there was NO give in the mattress at all! Hard as a rock!! There was also--inexplicably--a very small curtain (?) in between the bed and the little table next to it. Very annoying, as it made it difficult to get to the lamp and the alarm clock (which wasn't even plugged in.) The curtain was anchored both on the ceiling AND the floor, so there was NO moving it whatsoever. Have no idea what it was there for.At least there was a fridge and a safe. The fridge was small, but adequate. The safe was fairly old, but did the job. It was locked with a key which we had to take with us anytime we were out of the room.The size of the room really didn't bother me--though it was very small--since we spent only time sleeping in it. (After all, if you want to spend your time in Hawaii in your room, why go?) The room service was okay. The bed was made every day, though the glasses that were provided were not replaced very often. The best part of the room, however, was the balcony. There was, unfortunately, very little view of the ocean. Just mainly the city. However, the cool breeze did make it decent.The hotel was about a block or two from the ocean, so it was pretty easy to get to.The staff in the lobby was pretty friendly, though one manager had told us that the elevators were turned off at 6:30pm every night 'for security'. That, to me, was pretty stupid. There are locks on every door, accessed only by an electronic room key. However, except for that first night, we never saw that manager again and the elevator worked past 6:30 the rest of the time.The breakfast wasn't great, but it also wasn't bad. At least it saved money having to buy breakfast every day. Showing our room key wasn't a big deal for us. After all, they had to make sure that not just anyone could access it. Also, except for the first day, we never had to show our room key again when going to breakfast. We had toast, biscuits, fruit (pineapple, apples and just once--oranges). Plus juice and coffee. Not a bad breakfast.We didn't notice any bugs at all.Parking, however, was a different story. I know there is a lack of space, but THIS was ridiculous. Parking downstairs, it took two of us to park the car, because there was VERY little space to maneuver. Do NOT bring anything bigger than a compact car down here, or you will be in trouble!There was another parking lot at ground level and we were told that if all the spaces were used up, to let them know and they would get us a spot. They have some spots blocked off and reserved just for this. They guarantee a spot for you. Maybe not a great spot, but they guarantee you a spot.Doubt we would rebook at this hotel, though. There were just too many annoyances to make us go back. If you want cheap, this is that, but not really a lot to recommend it much. BEWARE THE BED!!!",Illinois,4,2.0

At first I wasnt sure where the air conditioning unit was located, then I found a small remote next to the tv, and realized that the A/C units was one of those old types that stick out of the window. it took me a few tries before I could figure out how to work it, and when I finally did, the room did not reach the cooler temp I was hoping for.After checking in, my husband and I stepped out to grab a bite to eat at King's Village then headed back to our hotel. The walk back, by the way may be a little on the iffy side - as it's quite dark, and passes by an open parking lot.When we got back to the hotel, I went into the bathroom, and I saw something crawling on the bathroom door - to say the least it was a form of a bug.

I had had enough.The following day, I called our vacation company and asked to be transferred to the Aqua - a much nicer Aqua property. They helped mediate the situation, and it was a smooth transition.The hotel would have been ok if it weren't for the bugs and the a/c.

The rooms were clean, and tidied every day (although the sheets are not automatically changed every day). There is free internet access in the rooms (reception can loan you a cable) or free Wi-Fi in certain parts of the hotel. Phone calls to local and toll free numbers are free from your room phone. The rooms are air conditioned, have coffee making facilities, a bar fridge, safe, bathrobes, and bath products. The hotel is also conveniently located near ABC Stores (like 7-11 but with clothes etc) and Food Pantry (supermarket), and is close to Waikiki Beach and the shops. The continental breakfast (muffins, fruit, juice, coffee, toast, croissants) was more than adequate. The only thing I can really fault about this hotel is that the rooms are not soundproof, and the windows are just glass louvers, so the noise comes straight in. You can hear people talking outside your room (although this wasn't a big issue), as well as the traffic on the road (this was more the issue). Noise from the traffic continues through the night (although eases a little) and construction work started early (around 5-ish) so you get woken up by sirens, traffic, trucks reversing, etc). Being light sleepers, we had earplugs in and it was still noisy. I'm not sure whether there are 'better' rooms in the hotel for noise, or whether it was because we are light sleepers. Aside from the noise, I would definitely recommend this hotel.",ACT,43,4.0

We stayed one night a the Maile Sky Court a few blocks away which is a two-star hotel, so it was definitely a nice relief to see the lobby when we arrived.We stayed in a Superior Room that had a balcony and a king bed, lots of space for us. There was a fridge and coffee-maker as well as a free safe. It was well-appointed and very comfortable. We happened to be on the 4th floor, which was fine, except for the fact that we were on the corner closest to the beach above the garbage truck pick-up and the morning food deliveries. So every morning at about 7 am, the beeping, smashing metal, and diesel revving (which sometimes sounded like a good ol' smash-to-pass) woke us up among other street noses. It's not a busy street, but you can hear a lot because the windows are glass slats, not double paned or anything.Breakfast was sufficient for our needs-pastries, fruits, oatmeal, toast and drinks. There's not a lot of room where they serve breakfast, so you gotta be a little patient when waiting in the toaster line-up! But hey, it's free!The pool is small, but the beach is so beautiful, you'll only want to spend more time there. One reviewer said that the street outside the hotel is dangerous, but I never felt unsafe walking around.Overall, for a boutique hotel, you get what you pay for and a little more, especially if you're just looking for a decent place to stay.","Princess Royal Island, Canada",11,4.0

Do be wary of the parking in Waikiki as I have never seen a city so tow happy in my entire life. We watched tow truck after tow truck haul cars away and we got ours towed on the last day due to streetsweeping. Vinh at t he aqua was very helpful in tracking our car down for us and kept us calm.

I sayed here for a week aug 11-19th with my b/f and the hotel was great. We stayed in the smallest, standard room and it was totally fine. Whoever complains about the size obv. needs more space than really needed. We had more than enuff space for all our luggage and stuff. The only complaint is the small shower. My boyfriend is 6""2 and had to bend down to wash his hair. Me being 5""2 had no problem. Fridge came in handy for drinks and stuff we bought. Microwave/ coffee maker were clean didnt use them. Always saw the cleaning crew on our floor so hotel was well kept. Tuesdays they have free drinks in the lobby and free 5 min massages.Breakfast: Toast (whole wheat & white), mini bagels, cream cheese, butter, 3 types of muffins (butterloaf is the best, also had chocolate and blueberry), fruit (pineapple, bananas or oranges and always apples), coffee, tea, juice, oatmeal.Location: Main strip is Kalakaua Ave which is where Moana Surfrider (very $$$ hotel) & Outrigger are located. Aloha Surf was only a couple blocks away, maybe a 5 mins walk. So you know this was a great location. Right by the beach, restaraunts , stores (gucci, prada, fendi, louis vutton, juicy, rolex...) Bus stop is right at the corner of Aloha Surf (Kuhio ave). A tip if you're planning on taking the bus is print out the time tables b/c they're not listed at the stop. Just go to www.thebus.org and it even tells you what buses to take to popular locations. Shuttles are always available thru the hotel and flyers/attraction booklets which are more $ than the $2 bus sometimes worth it minus the hassle of waiting for the bus and just getting picked up. We personally took the bus to sea life park & Hanauma bay. (22, 23, 42 are popular bus routes for these places including pearl harbor) There are ABC stores every 30 feet literally so if you 4got anything dont worry, its basically like a CVS or Walgreens.Dining: Many local places to eat near by like subway, kfc, cheesecake factory, planet hollywood...hard rock cafe is a 25 mins walk away (1.25 miles) in a kinda run down area so stick to the main strip. Our favorite restuarant is Tiki Bar & Grill. If you go you have to order the edemame and mac encrusted mahi mahi it was so good we ate there 3 outta 8 nights! It's on Kalakaua Ave so its pretty close (10-15min walk). Walk outta the hotel and when u get to Kalakaua make a left n jus go straight til you see it and all the tiki torches. (very pretty at night). All in all it was a great stay, great location, friendly staff were very helpful booking things to do but i would say they dont give any discount since they work thru expedia so if you just look thru attraction booklets or walk in the street people hand out fleyer for cheaper attractions. Def. would stay here again!",New York,4,4.0

The hotel is clean and bright and the staff are friendly. Having said that, I would not stay here again....at least not on the front side of the building.Having a lanai was a great feature! We would get up in the morning and make a pot of the complimentary coffee and sit out on the lanai and just breathe....the downside to this wonderful scene is the hotel directly across the street. There is an outdoor bar at the pool that stays open late (or early???) and seems not to mind if the patrons have consumed more than their share of alcohol, nor do they seem to mind if the testosterone of the younger crowd is in overdrive resulting in shouting and shoving matches. We stayed at this hotel on the 12th floor for 7 nights and did not get one decent sleep. The bar usually closed up and the street quieted down around 4am which left about an hour at best before the garbage trucks came to pick up the dumpsters. If you can sleep through anything then you will find this a lovely experience but if you are awakened by 'noises' you will want to stay on the backside of the building or somewhere else. If you are looking for the larger rooms with kitchenettes etc (I could not find detailed information when booking) they are on the backside.Our experience was not the fault of the hotel or its employees and therefore I feel bad about the review, but I do not want someone else to stay here without all the facts.I have no complaints about a 'free' breakfast ever, it is quite basic but provides everything you would need to get your day started.Parking is a problem and we paid for a stall at a sister hotel 6 blocks away, but we found this to be a big pain and instead ended up circling the block for a spot on the street. This is a viable 'free' option and worst case you can always park at the Food Land lot next door for $10 a night.On a separate note for those who are renting cars and possibly not aware of the insurance policies of Hawaii, I would like to enlighten you a little. Hawaii is a ""No Fault"" state, i was unaware of what this truly meant and did not have it explained properly. For clarification, this means that ALL accidents in Hawaii are a shared fault unless a party admits fault. It does NOT matter if you are a 'good' driver or not, if another party damages your car then YOU are liable.For example: (This is a true story)We chose to waive the optional insurance as a lot of people do in lieu of the fact that our own driving record and insurance company suffice not to mention most credit cards have built in insurance. That being said, on the last night of our trip we chose to take a fishing/dinner cruise...sounded GREAT! Got to the basin a 1/2 hour early and parked in the far lot, paid the $3.50 in quarters and waited for the rest of our group. About 20 minutes later we are tolf that there is a car on fire in the parking lot but determine by the colour etc that it is not ours, however...it turns out to be the car RIGHT NEXT TO ours. A cab driver noticed a problem with his car and decided to park in between two vehicles in the parking lot where his car exploded into flames in a matter of minutes taking the sides of the other to vehicles with it. We are in the process of the determining whether or not he will admit fault. I am extremely disappointed in the car rental company who is not true to their slogan and insists instead that YOU drive a charred vehicle 16 miles back down a freeway to return it. Safety is not their uptmost concern nor is customer service as we were charged double the quoted rate for the week.This was my 5th trip to the Island and I will definately return but I may decide to take the bus and stay outside of the city.Aloha and Mahalo.

They range anywhere from a 5 star to a private room in a hostel. If something piques my interest, I will give it a try. You never know, I have had great stays at very cheap places and had poor stays at overpriced resorts. I had been reading some about Aqua Resorts and decided to give them a try. The Aqua Aloha had a small suite with a separate bedroom which was perfect for myself, my friend, and her 14 year old daughter. At $169 a night with the fifth night free, not a bad deal. I booked for 5 nights but ended up checking out after 3.I'll start off with the reason for my early departure. I originally had no intention of getting a vehicle. The next day I was speaking with the lady who helps book activities and tours and such. She kept trying to get me to pay for the overpriced transportation that was available for things such as the Polynesian Cultural Center, The Marine Park, Etc. I told her I would just rent a car. No mention whatsoever of any possible problems with parking capacity. Well, after a long day of driving around the island, hitting the Polynesian Cultural Center and the luau and show, we got back around 11 PM and were tired. My friend went in to see how the parking worked and came back out with a map she was given. We were told the garage was full and we would have to park at another property a few blocks away. I wasn't happy about this but tried finding it anyway. After a short while of driving around and not finding it, I came back. I told them this was unacceptable as I didn't book a room at another hotel and I wasn't parking at another hotel. Plus the fact that I didn't feel like walking a 14 year old girl past the hookers and drunken partiers in between. Don't get me wrong, the area is a bit sketchy but I have never felt unsafe there. I just didn't think she needed to see it. Anyway, I was told by the lady at the desk my only other alternative was the pay lot next to the hotel (or street parking of which there was none). I would have to move the car at 7 AM though. So I go over and park, pay the $10, place the receipt on the dash just like the car next to me. The only problem was that the lot is used for 3 purposes. There is restaurant parking and there are spots numbered for the paid parking, which is also available to Food Pantry grocery customers for an hour for free while shopping. I was tired and it is not so clearly marked that you have to watch where you park as even though it is one big lot, not all parking is open. Of course I get up the next morning and the car is gone. And of course I clearly see then the sign where I parked stating it was the restaurant parking. I have since come to find out that this is a common mistake, so I can only believe it is more profitable to tow cars then to put up signs where you pay cautioning people where to park. But, for all of this I can only fault myself and not the hotel in any way. My problem with the hotel is that they advertise on-site parking. They need to add a disclaimer stating: ""We Do Not Have Near Adequate Enough Parking For The Amount Of People Our Hotel Can Hold And You May Be Required To Park At Another One Of Our Properties Yet Still Be Expected To Pay Full Price But Get A Lovely Late Night Tour Complete With Hookers And Drunk Partiers"". Incidentally, even in the parking lot from which I was towed there were a bunch of kids hanging out and getting drunk. I wasn't too concerned for the car as I had rented off of my corporate account which includes the damage waiver. How was I to know they would be the least of my worries?I was pretty annoyed the next morning and promptly checked out after taking a taxi to the tow yard. The staff knew I was irritated and were very good about the whole thing. I expected to end up paying for the entire 5 nights that I booked but was only charged for the 3 that I stayed. I ended up at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for the remaining 2 nights. Unlike a previous reviewer who complained about the Aqua Aloha not being up to her standards then tried to compare the two, a word of advice. You can't try and compare a 5 star resort to a budget hotel. It's like complaining to Ford that your Fiesta doesn't perform like a Porsche. It's apples and oranges and only shows ignorance and arrogance. The reason I went there was that I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member and it was easier to call their reservation desk then spend the morning on the internet or calling different places for a room. Plus I had never stayed there and it looked cool. So, a little about the hotel itself. It does try and come off a bit more upscale then it actually is. It's a decently refurbished older hotel. It is probably one of the nicest budget hotels I have ever stayed in, in the U.S. For the price I paid, the room I was given was excellent. It was big enough for our needs and clean. We had a corner unit on the top floor which gave us a nice sized lanai with a great city view. The only complaint was from the kid saying that the sofa bed was springy and uncomfortable. Quite frankly I don't think I have ever run across a sofa bed that wasn't. Oh, and the ice machine is next to the pool, which really sucks when you are the 16th floor and want ice. Glad we brought t he kid along.The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I didn't have to deal with them too much, but when I did I was never disappointed (oh yea, except for that whole parking thing). The breakfast was OK. Fruit, pastries, bread, and juice. Nothing to write home about, but filling. I was actually a bit surprised when they asked to see my room key, as I couldn't imagine anyone sneaking into it. We actually only ate there 1 day, and the only bad thing was trying to find a place to sit.Everything said, it is a good value for the money if you are looking to do things on a budget. Clean rooms at a decent price and a friendly, helpful staff. I would never steer anyone away from there. I won't be returning. My ex-wife once said that I could be petty and hold a grudge even when my problems were mostly of my own doing. Guess she was right. Wow, who knew?","Portland, Oregon",20,2.0

The internet was free (not wireless though) and the breakfast was okay (fruits and breads). The staff was very polite and helpful with everything. The roomsize was on the small size, but as one would expect. Really my biggest complaint is the street noise. The hotel doesn't have big solid windows, they have those ""slit"" windows where a bunch of small slits of glass make up a window. So the noise just comes right through there, even when it was closed. It was fine at night for the most part but I often was woken up early in the morning by the sounds of a garbage truck.

We booked the Aqua Aloha Surf Hotel to try to save on our costs and we were pleasantly surprised by the overall value.To be honest, we have had appalling service from some of the big brands (including a disappointing stay at the Crowne Plaza, Los Angeles Airport on the way over) in the past. We got the distinct feeling that all the staff we met at the Aqua Aloha Surf Hotel are trying their level best to ensure the guests were happy. After long flights over two days from the UK and an entire day at LAX airport, we arrived shattered. Our reception was warm and friendly and we were delighted to be shown to our room and have all our baggage brought up for us. We were asked if we had a laptop computer with us and given a high speed LAN cable to enable our complimentary use of the super-highway. Next morning, I was pleased to discover that the connection was in fact super-fast!The ""suite"" was compact and spotlessly clean, but of sufficient size for two double beds, a kitchenette with microwave, coffee maker and fridge. I was delighted to see a little starter pack of tea and coffee for the morning as I had no desire to go to the shops that night!Breakfast is complimentary, but far from being a weird affair, we found it quite delightful. A choice of cereals would have been welcome, but our first taste of truly fresh pineapple was a wonderful experience. A local newspaper is provided free of charge, and if you are too early, there is a complimentary coffee machine while you're waiting. Seating is a bit limited, but you always have the option of carrying your breakfast back to your room if you want!The location was perfectly located for Waikiki Beach, the shops and for ""The Bus"" which is an excellent way of getting around. A visit to Pearl Harbour was on our agenda, so being so close to ""The Bus"" was a bonus for us.Far from being scary, we found Waikiki generally a very safe, family-friendly place. In fact, a few doors down opposite the ABC Store, is a reasonable restaurant offering a fixed price buffet menu ($11.95 per head, eat all you want!) This restaurant was packed out with families with children who I am sure wouldn't have been there if the location was ""scary""! Indeed, I have to say that we felt safe the entire time we were in the Hawaiain Islands. The Islander culture seems peaceful and friendly and, without wishing to appear a snob, Hawaii seems not to appeal to those with loutish tendencies!On the corner is an ABC store where you can stock up with a few provisions for your kitchenette. (For a family, taking a packed lunch and drinks out with you saves dipping your hand in your pocket every few minutes at the beach!) We had brought a cooler bag and freezer packs with us.All in all, the hotel was more than adequate for our needs and it enabled us to make a small saving on our holiday, having overspent our budget elsewhere!..........My only regret was listening to advice that ""Waikiki is all commercialised, like Blackpool - only with guaranteed sunshine"", which led me to book a short three day stop before moving on to Hawaii Big Island and Maui! It is a far cry from Blackpool and I feel that, one day, I must return for a longer stay and do it justice!

The lanai (balcony) was great for hang drying beach towels, wetsuits, etc. but a little small for much else. We definitely used the ""kitchen area"". Some days we heated up food in the microwave and we made use of the fridge/freezer every day we were there. The bathroom size was as expected for a no frills hotel. The room itself was immaculately clean and the free internet service was terrific! Our maid cleaned the room above and beyond expectations every day we were there.

It is better than most continental breakfasts at other hotels. There are complaints on here regarding it, but it is important to remember it is a continental breakfast.

When we arrived in the room we found a single bed and what I would call a king single. We had booked a double, so we were a little disappointed.When we did get to bed we found the beds lobsided and rather uncomfortable. The next morning though we set off to get our bearings and were pleasantly surprised to find that we were only about 3 streets away from Waikiki beach and right in the heart of the shopping and eating district. The room has a small kitchenette that includes a microwave, huge fridge and freezer and crockery and cutlery. Just 100metres down the road lies Hawaii's famous ABC store so we were positioned perfectly to look after ourselves - or dine out if we chose.While there was no mini-bar, there was free internet access. A huge plus for us.The rooms have a small balcony. The view isn't that great - just the concrete jungle of apartments and motels, but with the beach so close there's no real need to use it.The included breakfast was a bit of a weird affair.It was set up in a tiny section of the restaurant and there were very few seats available. So get in early or eat standing up. There were no cereals just breads, bagels, muffins, some fruit and beverages.My recommendation would be to pop down to the ABC shop and stock up on food and grog first. Overall, the motel was clean enough, the beds could be more comfortable but apart from that and the fact that it's hayday was clearly in the 70's, it's a good option.There are quite a few other motels that are situated in locations just as good as the Aloha surf, so if you're after comfort, check these out first.

I booked the Aqua Aloha Surf through an online agency with a special offer. I found out just before my trip that my company made a mistake on the dates and was off by one day between hotel stays. Of course when you buya promotional offer through an online vendor there is no room for error. You can never reach them to resolve a mistake and they usually will not have the promotional rate any longer. It can be quite costly to fix this sort of mistake. I called the Aqua Aloha Surf directly this time and was very pleased with the service I received. Reservations resolved the problem to my satisfaction. I had some other questions so I called the front desk and spoke with Vinh who was pleasant and helpful. When I had a special request he transferred me to the the manager Jullian. Jullian was great and readily available. I was never given the run around that I have had at other hotels and he was very helpful and considerate. This was my first time using tripadvisor and I learned that some of the negative reviews have to be taken with a grain of salt. Complaints such as noise for example are common to all Waikiki hotels regardless of price. Aqua Aloha gave me options so that I could make my own decision as to what type of room would best suit my needs.

When we arrived at the room, it turned out that my travel agent had not requested the type of room I had specified. However, the front desk were very helpful with making new arrangements. The standard rooms themselves are maybe a little smaller than what I would consider normal, but very adequate for my purposes so that wasn't a problem. There is an ATM available in the lobby, but the machine will charge you $2.50 for a withdrawal. The only problem was the traffic noise outside the hotel. It was very loud at night and early morning. However, if you're not averse to wearing earplugs, problem solved.I would stay here again if I am lucky enough to return to Hawaii!",Midlands,7,4.0

But I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. We were upgraded on check-in to a lovely spacious suite with a very comfortable king sized bed and a balcony with a view of the ocean and the mountains. The room was tastefully decorated and the staff were plesant. Like all buildings in Waikiki, it is on the older side and like alot of the buildings, the room has louvered windows. The hotel is well located, close to a supermarket, bus stops and only a short walk to the beach. We did have a couple of minor issues with the internet in our room and the toilet in the bathroom, but both these were fixed within half an hour of notifying the staff.The breakfast is buffet style, muffins, pastries, toast, fruit and bagels, but this was more than enough to keep us happy.One word of warning, you will get street noise. Having said this, you would get street noise no matter where you stay in Waikiki, it is a noisy place. The hotel is actually down one of the quieter streets you could stay on. I did't get woken once by the noise outside, but if you are a light sleeper, perhaps reconsider your stay in Waikiki.","Melbourne, Australia",2,4.0

It is centrally located in Waikiki, so you can walk to the beach in about 5 minutes. The rooms are renovated with a modern look, each having a flat screen television. The rooms are a little small, but you're not going to be indoors most of the day anyways. The staff was friendly and helpful. When I checked in to my room. My window faced construction work on the front of hotel. I could literally see the workers walking past my window on their scaffold. When I asked to change my room, they apologized and upgraded me to the deluxe room. If you're going to make reservations, make sure you don't get the side where the constructions at. They will be at it for a couple of months. Parking is $15/day for your car rental, but that is the norm at most hotels. The biggest problem was the air conditioner, which would intermittently buzz loudly. I got use to it, but may bother others.I would definitely stay here again. Its a great deal for what you get.

My home pool is bigger than this hotel's (which is really sad). The interior is cool and looks exactly like the pictures but it doesn't really entice you to hang out in the lobby. Plus a cool decor doesn't make up for the unfriendly staff or the loud noise you have to endure at night (from the traffic) or the morning garbage truck that will wake you up early in the morning. I stayed is a privately owned condo on the 6th floor that was OK but definitely no frills what's so ever. So I am not sure how the hotel rooms compare.I would not stay here again because of the noise (it kept me up all night) and I prefer nicer accommodations.

Worth the money. the staff were friendly. got free continental breakfast everyday and they store your luggage on the day you vacate.

The staff was super nice, I had tons of questions and they always got to me with a smile at that and it seemed as they genuinelly wanted to answer my questions. Even at the end of my stay I forgot my phone and thank God one of the crew members advise he come upstairs with me to look, because he had his cell phone and if he didnt call it the same time I was up in the room, I would have never found it. It was under the blankets, but for the price we paid it was clean (WHICH IS IMPORTANT) and that they also gave us FREE INTERNET access which is SOOOOOOO important to me because I go to school online and it made my life and vacation at that so much easier to finish school work. I would definitely stay here again, please dont expect a Hilton or something, but its clean, up to date (asides the bath tub--but its Waikiki and we're in the islands, whats there to expect) and NICE STAFF.

Too tired to let outside early noises keep me awake, and grateful when they did alert me to the wonderful sunshine I was missing. Complimentary breakfast got us going, took up to room each day as very busy at this time downstairs. Local buses left from just around the corner. ABC store and food Pantry nearby provided other snacks/drinks required. Many restaurants nearby. Short walk to beach and shops. What more can you ask.We bused it round the Island for $4USD - what a bargain. Saw as much as the tour buses if just scenery you want. Got off at North Shore for a Matsumoto Shaved Ice and also had lunch at a lovely little Thai Restaurant nearby. Reasonably Priced and very tasty. Had we not got off the bus would only have cost $2USD!Took all day mind you. Also took public transport to Pearl Harbour - would not recommend it. Took over an hour, then we had to wait two hours on our boat time, then another hour back to hotel. Would rather have paid the $12 for a return Shuttle - Scenery on this trip too depressing - lots of street people (or should I say Park People) - homeless.

Due to an early morning flight from Sydney we arrived at the hotel around 10am. Upon check-in we were informed that the room was not ready and to come back around 3pm. As we had signed up to receive the Aqua Resorts newsletter we had a voucher to receive a free upgrade and were given a deluxe partial city view room (we booked a superior room) for $84 per night + tax. We were both given free bottles of water and there were apples at the reception. We came back to the hotel just after 1pm and our room was ready. The room was nice and there was enough space for both of us to put our suitcases. Our room had a queen bed and sofa sleeper and a balcony. We were located on the 8th floor towards the back of the hotel. The room was quiet and both mornings we didn't hear garbage trucks or any other noise. There was a strange noise coming from the shower (sounded like it was in the pipes) but we reported it to the reception on our way out and it was fixed when we returned from dinner. The breakfast in the morning was complimentary and consisted of toast, bagels, jam, cream cheese, pastries, fruit and tea, coffee and juice. We found the breakfast to be filling and quite good. The reception area is nice with plenty of seating and a TV if waiting for a tour or to be picked up to return to the airport. The hotel has a swimming pool which we didn't use.

The lobby is very welcoming and so was the front desk attendant. Providing two bottled waters was a nice treat. As people had forewarned, the parking garage was tiny and when we arrived, there were two spaces that had been reserved by phone, but unclaimed. He told me to check back in 30 minutes and if they were still unclaimed, he would give me a permit. He was nice enough to call the room 15 minutes later and inform me that I could have one of the spaces. If we didn't have a reserved space, I could see that parking would be very inconvenient and feel a little unsafe since the external parking is dark.The room itself is indeed tiny. We had reserved superior city view through expedia so it wasn't the smallest room, but I'd still say that it was definitely smaller than most hotel rooms that I've stayed in. The bathroom clearly needed renovations as it seemed like an old residential bathroom. It needed caulking and had rusty drain fixtures. I'd equate it to a dorm bathroom. It was also very cramped - there was a sliding bathroom door separating the toilet from the sink and the toilet paper was attached to the door. There was also a small ""closet"" that was separated by a curtain rather than a door. You could clearly hear outdoor noise alhough my husband is a sound sleeper and it didn't bother him. The walls are thin, however. When we were there, they had people from the junior USTA tennis league staying there and we heard them talking and laughing pretty late into the night. The only other complaint I have is that when I woke up to get a drink from the mini fridge, I saw a roach crawling along the wall directly adjacent to my son's pack n play. That was not comforting since I wondered the rest of the time if it would crawl into his bed or our suitcases. I also didn't feel comfortable walking on the carpet without shoes on.All-in-all, I'd say it was an okay place to stay, minus the roach. I'm surprised that it is ranked as #21 in popularity though by others(I'd rank it much lower and would consider it 2 stars). Here's a summary of the pros and cons.Positives: Staff are nice, free continental breakfast (though we ended up going to Keoni's after the first day as another reviewer had recommended -- EXCELLENT place for breakfast and much more satisfying!!), reasonable price, mini fridge and microwave are nice to have, very convenient to full grocery store and restaurants and shops, friendly front desk staff, free internet (they even loaned us a new cable at no charge when we forgot ours)Negatives: Not convenient walk to the beach when you have a child and are carrying things with you, bathroom needs updating, cramped quarters, bugs/cleanlinessAlso a note - while the front desk staff are nice, don't bother asking for advice from the Expedia Local Expert in the lobby. I purchased a Honolulu Power Pass from Expedia and thought it would be convenient to run some questions and gain insight from the Expedia local expert. Boy was I wrong, she was unfriendly and I'd say rude. I presented her with the list of activities included on the pass and she wasn't familiar with half of them and pretty much said she coudldn't help me because she didn't know what I was interested in. It was a complete waste of time and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I went back to her a second time to ask another question and she was again, useless. Don't expect a friendly person who knows much about what to see and do in the area.","Durham, NC",27,2.0

While swimming at Waimea beach we had our back pack stolen, and with it all of our cash, credit cards, phones, watches, sun glasses, camera and clothes.We asked the front desk staff to book us the cheapest shuttle to the airport for the following morning as we were flying back to Australia the next day. We explained what had happend to us which was why we needed to book the cheapest shuttle possible.While we were waiting one of the staff took me aside and put some money into my hand. The staff had given us money from their own pocket to help us out. I explained that we had enough money on us to get to the airport and some food but he insisted we take it and they wouldn't take no for an answer. We were deeply moved by their generous and kind act.

Rooms have a safe, fridge, microwave, coffee maker and free internet connection. You definitely want to get a deluxe room with the bed/couch combination. The rooms are much larger, have a great bathroom layout, and a balcony - perfect for a couple. The location was within walking distance of basically everything and the beach was only 3 very short blocks away. The service was very good for the most part, but the front desk has a bad apple or two. Speak to the Asian lady - she is sweet and really goes out of her way to help you. Okay the bad: This hotel has very poor noise insulation thanks to louvered windows. The garbage truck will surely wake you up every morning. It shows up between 6:30am – 7:15am and makes an incredibly loud racket that will rudely awake you. I found it to be a common topic of conversation between guests in the lobby, breakfast area and elevators. The hotel parking lot only has about 15 - 20 spaces. I had to park at a sister Aqua property about 2 blocks away. Not that big a deal because the blocks are super short, but I was still charged the regular rate of $18 a night? Finally at night the last block just before the hotel is a little dark, it made my girlfriend a little uncomfortable.

It took us several days to find flights home and we needed the 3 extra days as we could not get out when originally planned.

We paid an additional $40 a night (a good ploy they use to generate income) for a room on top floor with King bed, plus tub/shower combo. Regardless of floor position the noise is constant, especially late at night as bar patrons head out between 1AM - 4AM and the garbage trucks pick up the empty bottles at 5AM. Window AC and louvered windows do not keep room very cool and the noise from AC is not enough to block out the din on the streets. Curtains are cheap motel style black outs without any sheers so you must keep them closed when moving between closet and shower area (unless you don't care about exposing yourself to hundreds of adjacent neighbors in apartment buildings and hotels that surround the place). On the plus side the desk staff went out of their way to be helpful and Josh at the spa gives a killer shiatsu massage. Free breakfast is a starch-fest with pastries, bagels and bananas with juice and coffee. Go to Keoki's down the street for their $3.95 special - 2 pancakes, 2 bacon strips, scrambled eggs and coffee.

This is my fifth visit to Waikiki in seven years, so just a word of warning if you haven’t been before that many of the hotels are older, and are slowly being brought up to a standard that is not so 1970’s. Having said that, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about with Aqua Resorts – Waikiki’s most honoured hotel chain by Trip Advisor.I was a little annoyed before I even arrived – six weeks earlier I cancelled my original reservation via the Aqua website as a much cheaper rate (USD88 per night) became available via a travel agent. The deposit of USD130 for the original rate didn’t automatically refund to my credit card – it took three phone calls from Australia and having to hold on the line whilst they physically refunded the card to get my money back. For an organisation that prides itself on “customer first”, I was left slightly bemused that this is the action I had to take before I even arrived.Got to hotel very early at 0830 on 3/27 and Helene at the front desk pre-registered us, and said she would rush a room for us, which was very generous. We hung around the lobby using the free wireless and they had a room for us at 1030. Given keys to #505, in a word – HORRIBLE. Firstly, it wasn’t what I had booked (Queen bed equipped with a flat panel tv, coffee maker and refrigerator ); it had a double and a single bed, the bathroom was nothing short of gross with peeling paint off the tiles, when you closed the sliding door to the bathroom the wallpaper from the previous room abruptly ended in a jagged, unfinished way; the single bed mattress was not in good shape. After a sleep and revisiting the room again, it wasn’t for me – a polite chat to the front desk had us moved to a King bed room #402. In the scheme of things this was a lovely room – fresh, airy and with a clean, updated bathroom. The lanai looked out onto Kanekapolei St and into the Food Pantry parking lot. A bit of traffic noise, but as to be expected for Honolulu and an older style hotel. Pillows however same as the previous room – flat as pancakes, and towels were very thin.During our stay, we never got to the free breakfast – the first two days there was a group in house and it made the lobby area almost unbearable between 0730 and 0900. We saw what people were carrying around, and it seemed to be fresh fruit and pastries. We did use the free wired internet in the room which was fairly quick, but had spot outages from time to time – my biggest gripe was there was nowhere in the room to actually sit and use your laptop with the internet connection. I ended up bringing in a chair from the balcony and placing the laptop on the bed. For the one day I needed to work, I walked up to the Marriott hotel and sat in their lobby and paid to use the net there, whilst sitting at a more comfortable table and chair. (Aqua Aloha Surf has no power outlets anywhere in their lobby, which makes surfing the net on wireless only as effective as the length of your computer battery).During our stay I never felt really welcomed – getting a staff member to acknowledge you even whilst waiting to check out towels for the beach was pretty difficult. Ownership and accountability didn’t seem to run high – experienced when I called the day before leaving to ask for a 0500 wake up call and a taxi to be booked. The taxi arrived, pity about the wakeup call which the staff member never documented. Thankfully I don’t sleep well before early flights, and woke at 0510 to my phone alarm realising that it was time to get up and go.Overall – for the price (sub USD100) it’s an OK property. You could do a lot worse in Waikiki. But given the Ohana Waikiki West is one block over, I would rate this property as far superior to Aqua Aloha Surf, and it’s around the same price. Do I think that Aqua Resorts are revolutionising Hawaii? If the Aloha Surf is anything to go by - hardly. It’s a slap bang refurbishment job on the cheap, a new brand name, but the same old tired, deflated rooms and staff behind the masquerade. Not for me again until they sort out exactly who it is they want to be and what it is they want to deliver.","New York City, New York",61,2.0

Staff were also always friendly and it was always nice to hear their suggestions on where to go for dinner + night life.

I had made a reservation well in advance directly with Aqua Resorts for a Superior Partial City View w/Balcony (340 sq ft room) for a AAA rate of $113/night for 7 nights. Upon arrival we were informed of the problem and were offered a Moderate Partial City View (220 sq ft), a discount of $20 for each of the 7 days, and an upgrade on Sunday to a Deluxe Partial City View w/balcony (360 sq ft). The other option was to have them check their other properties, however, we were reminded it was Pro Bowl week and everything was sold out. Recognizing the second option would be fruitless, we took the first offer thinking we are small people and a double bed would be okay for a few nights. We were given our room keys, two bottles of water, and a box of chocolates along with their apologies.  When we got to the room we were shocked at how small 220 sq ft really is. I've never been in a hotel room this small. I made a point of taking pictures, but I'm not sure the pictures will really give you a sense of the size. We both agreed that accidents do happen and we could manage for 2 nights since the hotel was offering a discount and an upgrade. I want to emphasize they were very nice about everything and we feel we were compensated fairly. The main point I want to make is that you should really be aware of what you are getting if you book a Moderate Partial City View. The bed was shoved in the corner, so whoever sleeps against the wall will have to climb over the other person in order to use the restroom during the night. The other option would be to slide diagonally off the end of the bed being sure to avoid the dresser that was up against the foot of the bed. We had two large suitcases, and there was only enough floor space at the end of the bed to stack one suitcase on top of the other in front of the dresser. By the end of our second day, I couldn't wait to get down to the front desk to find out when our next room would be ready. The next room which was a Deluxe Partial City View w/balcony (360 sq ft) was almost too big, but we were not going to complain! I'll include pictures of both rooms which were very clean and we had great maid service.  We stayed in the back of the hotel and, yes, it was noisy, but we already knew what we were getting into from previous stays in the same general vicinity. The continental breakfast did not afford a lot of options, but it was free and just enough to tide us over until lunch. The hotel across the street had a bar with great happy hour deals including use of two computers for free as long as you made a purchase. We kept up on email while drinking our cocktails.  All in all, I would stay at this hotel again, just not in a Moderate Partial City View room.",,48,4.0

It sits on the busy side of Waikiki but tucked back a bit in front of the Ala Wai Canal. So close to all the action and a short walk to the beach. We had a small room located next to the elevator on the 12th floor but it was not a huge concern. The noise was more noticeable in the mornings but we we're such earlier risers it was not an issue. I definately recommend getting a room with a lanai, we used it quite a bit. The rooms we're clean and housekeeping was very friendly. Only two issues occured but the hotel staff was quick to help. Once housekeeping poured dirty mop water out on the floor above us and soaked us on our lanai during a quick lunch, but they definately took care us and made for a very memorable trip and a good story to tell. Another problem was plumbing problems with our shower, but staff fixed it quickly. (I read a review earlier that spoke to plumbing problems and they did not quite believe it happens, well it does )We stayed for 8 nights at the hotel and would stay again and again!

Walking to the beach is easy, and sundry items like tatami mats, disposable cameras and snacks can be picked up at the multitude of ABC stores on every corner on the way.I was thinking that staying at a hotel that was not fronting the beach would be a problem and it wasn't at all. It's a short stroll and the weather is always mild (sometimes windy enough to blow your swimsuit coverup over your head!). Also glad to get a renovated room, which was on the 6th floor. Obtained our travel package via bookit.com, which automatically gave us a deluxe (renovated) room.

We stayed in Waikiki Beach for 2 nights, and after reading the reviews for this hotel, I wasn't expecting much. I'm a stickler for clean hotel rooms, and it even met my standards. As an architect, I notice a lot more details, and it has definitely been updated recently--but mostly in a cosmetic sense. New pretty curtains on the ""closet"" and shower, painted ""accent"" walls in the bathroom. We were disappointed with a couple things: we got a room on the 2nd floor, which looked over the roof of the pool & and an alley...not very exciting, and no balcony. Also, when we walked into the room we were surprised at how SMALL is was! Two TWIN beds!! So, that was a little disappointing, but nothing that ruined our trip, by any means. The beach towels are a little skimpy, so definitely ask for 2 per person. Point the shower head AWAY from the curtain, or you will flood the bathroom floor! Oh and every time I showered, throughout my shower, there would be little surges of hot and cold water--quick, but enough to notice. So either their water heaters are overloaded--or they need to pay a little more attention to the toilet flushing system, because it could very well have been doing that every time anyone in the BUILDING flushed a toilet!Oh, and if you think the pool looks a little small in the pictures on the hotel website--IT IS! Don't expect to spend the day lounging--there are a few chairs scattered around, and it's really about the size of a glorified hot tub. But, the beautiful beach about 4-5 blocks (they say 3, but it's really more like 4--about a 10 minute walk) is all you will need! Just remember, 15 SPF does NOT cut it in Hawaii! Use 30 SPF or more! We learned the hard way!The free breakfast was nice in the mornings--we grabbed toast, bagels, croissants, bananas, etc to go in the mornings. If you're looking for more than that, though, go elsewhere! We were just psyched that it was FREE!All in all, it was fine, and I might even recommend it to a friend looking for a budget stay, but I think next time I would splurge a little more for one of the beach hotels!","Venice, California",53,4.0

We had a queen bed with a pullout couch and a lanai on the 6th floor. We were travelling with a four month old infant and brought our own play yard, as the hotel was going to charge $20 per night for the use of a crib. Overall our experience there was fine--the location is good for Waikiki, as are the prices as compared to other hotels. I agree with another reviewer's opinion that the walk from Perrys Smorgy to the hotel is very dark at night, and made me uneasy when I had to walk to the hotel one night alone. During the day is no problem. The ABC store and Pantry grocery store are very close, which is great. There are also apples on the front desk throughout the day for eating. The continental breakfast was somewhat disappointing, but toward the end of our stay they added toasters with toast, bagels, cream cheese, and so on, in addition to the muffin, pastry, and mini croissant choices. Perhaps they are listening to people on this forum?!?! There is also juice, and coffee. My husband was not impressed by the breakfast, as he travels often and is used to the more hearty fare provided by Hampton/Hilton brands; however, I thought it was ok, especially as most hotels in Hawaii do not offer this service at all. We found housekeeping was alright, but we found our vanity countertop small and was not wiped down once during our 14 day stay. We thought it was because we had our toiletry bags on the counter, but we removed them two days in a row, and still the sink area was not cleaned. In all fairness to the hotel, though, we did not complain and simply wiped it up ourselves. We only had a shower stall in our room. The internet was free and fast (we brought our own laptop)--a great amenity for us. In general, we thought the hotel was average--an old hotel that has been updated, like most hotels in Waikiki. For the price, I would stay there again and would not worry about recommending this hotel to my friends.",canada,1,3.0

It was closing for renovations so our reservations were moved to the Aloha Surf with upgrades to deluxe partial city view rooms. Upon check-in, we received fast, friendly and efficient service. We were given ice cold bottles of water at check in and offered bell service immediately. The open air lobby is quite tropical and appealing and kept very neat and tidy. The free coffee in the lobby came in handy throughout our stay. Our room was perfect upon check-in and remained so throughout our stay. The rooms are not that small as I've read on other reviews. The beds are super comfy!! The bathroom counter is not real roomy but there is an entire cabinet below the sink for storage of incidentals. The closet has a free key safe for valuables -- we simply locked it up and took the key with us each day. The robes in the closet were nice for going to the pool. The room had a balcony over looking the city with 2 chairs and we had a couch and coffee table as well as microwave, mini frig and kitchen sink -- also dishes and silverware, coffee maker, etc. Our room was cleaned and re-stocked each day with coffee, clean towels, shampoo, lotion, etc. The room smelled clean and pleasant, except a slight mold smell near the bathroom sink which I think was in the drain -- so slight I did not call for service. Our friends were booked in a room at the front of the hotel (we were in a back room) and they said it was very noisy due to traffic, etc so they requested to be moved. They were moved to the 4th floor, back of hotel and things were fine except for some of the apartment dwellers across the alley who were very noisy. Of course, the hotel staff can't do anything about that. Our friends also mentioned that the maid service was lacking in their room -- towels, coffee, etc. I am not sure why because our service was awesome! All of the staff was friendly and helpful but most of all Jeremy, the bell man was the best! He went out of his way to be helpful and friendly and knew a lot about things to do on the island, checking the surf reports, places to go, etc.. The Aloha Surf is very lucky to have him! Also, on Tuesday nights is the Manager's reception, with drinks in the lobby, and Courtney makes a mean Wipeout (blue drink, aptly named!). Our flight home departed very late at night so we checked out that day but the front desk staff kept our luggage locked up for us until we were ready to catch our shuttle, offered use of the pool, the outdoor pool shower and beach towels for the duration, as well as a place to wait for our shuttle later that night. This was really nice after playing on the beach, swimming in the ocean and then having to get ready for an all night red-eye flight when we were already checked out of our hotel. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends for sure. The only downside is the walk to the beach. It is not that far but you are having to pack everything with you and don't have your room right there, handy to go to occasionally. Its about a 7-10 minute walk but I am used to staying at hotels that are right on the beach so maybe I am a little spoiled on that. Otherwise, this hotel is located smack in the middle of everything. The Food Pantry grocery store is right next door, and it's not far to walk to the International Market Place, nightclubs, restaurants, etc. Go to Legends for $2.50 Mai Tais (yum)!! Warning: bring shoes you are really comfortable in, for walking, because you will do A LOT of it! Don't bring a brand new pair of flip-flops or tennis shoes -- wear them around the house or to the store several times so you know they are comfortable. Mahalo to all of the Aloha Surf employees!

It just so happened to be the same weekend as the Pro Bowl. Luckily, I had done my research and found a nice budget hotel, which I booked a month beforehand. When we arrived at the Aqua Aloha Surf & Spa, we were told that they had had a plumbing issue and 5 of their rooms had flooded - including ours. So the ""superior partial city view"" room with balcony was turned into a standard room. Did our room really flood? Or did they decide that they could shove us in a standard room and then give our superior room to one of the Pro Bowler visitors for double the price? I don't know the answer to that, but it's awfully suspicious.So, we shuffle up to our standard room, which was basically a glorified dorm room. It was THE tiniest hotel room I have ever stayed it. I mean, comically small. There was nothing else to do but laugh. Granted, it was clean and it was close to all the shops and restaurants of Waikiki. Which is fun when you're ready to go out...not so fun when you're trying to sleep. It was really noisy. The overall appearance of the hotel was a little ragged around the edges. Kind of dingy.

We could look over the Koolau Mountains, the Ala Wai Canal, and even see the ships on the ocean, as well as glimpses of Diamond Head between the hotels in the distance.

They supplied the connector cable and when we had trouble, got it resolved very quickly by putting us in touch with their Net provider. They gave us each a bottle of chilled spring water when we checked in, and there was always a basket of delicious apples available on the lobby desk. We were given an Aqua coupon book, which we used extensively, both for restaurants and sightseeing. The coupons for the zoo, aquarium, Bishop's Museum, Mission Houses Museum, etc. were all ""two for one"". The pool, though not large, was inviting, as was the sunny deck around it. We enjoyed eating our breakfast in the canopied open area beside the pool or on our lanai, enjoying the view. There were a lot of sirens in the evening, being so close to the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, but the garbage pickup shortly after 6 AM only woke us briefly.

Not only did the garbage truck come by the first morning, but it turns out that the side of this building is a parking lot/loading zone to a grocery store on the next corner. This meant that large trucks were beginning their deliveries to this store from 6am onwards. As a note, this hotel does not have the ""normal"" type glass windows that I would expect to find in a highrise hotel here in Canada. The windows are thick fibreglass slats, opening and closing like venetian blinds, so the noise level was not muffled at all.After complaining at the front desk, I was shown a slightly smaller (but nicer) room on the 9th floor to the back and middle of the building. Once I moved there, the noise level was considerably lower and I enjoyed the rest of my stay fully.There isn't much of a view from this hotel at all. After moving from a larger corner suite to the quieter room, the only view available was to the neighbours' balconies. However, considering I spent little time in my room it was fine.The other negative to this hotel is that I found the bathrooms, especially bathtub/shower to be very old and outdated and slightly grungy. Do not expect to be able to take a relaxing bath in a luxurious hotel bathtub at this hotel.The pool is very small--enough to take a quick dip in, but it also backs into the very active, noisy grocery store parking lot.Apart from the above, my stay was great and I would definitely stay at this hotel again (booking a room at the back/middle portion of the hotel from the onset). The front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly, elevators were fast, there was a small breakfast of fruit, fruit juice, coffee and small muffins each morning (enough to get your started). The housekeepers did an excellent job and the room was kept tidy and clean.There is a mini fridge, coffee maker, and microwave with dishes in the room as well which came in handy a couple of times.The location is excellent--two blocks away from Waikiki with food stores, Starbucks, whatever you want nearby.This hotel is undergoing renovations and I think when they are completed, it will definitley be 5/5 on Trip Advisor as a budget hotel. They had just opened a spa when I arrived (great specials on massages) and were in the process of adding a small coffee shop in the lobby.","Vancouver Island, Canada",73,4.0

There are free breakfast boxes in the lobby and they often put out fresh fruit and goodies at the lobby counter. There is a grocery next door and several restaurants within a block or two. Two of the best things about the hotel are the open air lobby which reminds you that you are in a tropical paradise and the central location which is convenient to everything.

The lobby is beautiful, open walkway, nice furniture, and a great place to eat breakfast. The pool is a little small but was never crowded and the lounge chairs were very comfortable. Breakfast consisted of rolls, muffins, fruit, coffee, and pineapple juice (yum!) Coffee, newspapers, apples, and internet were available around the clock. A vending machine with pop, water, and juice was available. Ask to stay in a deluxe room or suite and in the front of the hotel. The views from the back of the hotel are awful. We asked to switch rooms and they were able to that for us that day. There isn't a lot of parking available if you rent a car so ask ahead of time for a spot. The elevators are a little small and slow so plan extra time for that. The staff was very nice, and very helpful with planning transportation and tours. Although, the 2 tours we booked through the hotel were not worth the money. Book any tourist events through the company directly. The beach is only a few blocks away and there are plenty of great restaurants near buy as well as shopping and the famous ABC store. All in all, this a great value for the money. I recommend the location if you want to be in the heart of Waikiki, you don't mind little noise (especially in the morning), and you don't want to spend too much money.","Cleveland, Ohio",17,4.0

We've stayed at various types of hotels and condos but the Aqua Aloha is probably the best value we've gotten for our money. When I pulled up to the hotel in my rental vehicle, I was in the valet driveway and was told I could leave it there while I check in. I went up to the front desk, gave my name, and I was handed my room keys and parking permit in less than a minute (like they had everything ready for me). Check-in process was the fastest I've experienced. Parking is limited but I never had a problem finding a spot the whole week I was there. When I got to the room, I realized that I was upgraded to the 16th floor corner room with a wrap around balcony. I had views of the Ala Wai Canal, the back side of Diamond Head, and a partial ocean view between the Hyatt Regency towers (where I stayed for my last visit in Waikiki). Room was very clean and had a refridgerator, microwave, and LCD TV. Staff was very nice all week except when I went down for continental breakfast with a paper plate. I was told they were not allowed and I had to use napkins to carry the pastries. But oh well, I still managed to bring 6 croissants to my room where I would heat up bacon and spam in the microwave oven. It was very convenient having a refrigerator and microwave. I never had to buy alcohol at a bar all week. At night, my wife and I would mix our drinks in the room, get wasted, then walk/shop. Every morning, we would go to the front desk for beach towels and turn them in when we return.

But first, if friendly helpful people are important to you on your trips, then you are in for treat at Aqua Aloha Surf, as the staff was friendly, down to earth and helpful.We stayed here to save a little money on the last leg of our trip. The first rooms we stayed in were the basic rooms, and they reminded me of European hotels, small, very basic, but with comfortable beds. No lanai. The bathrooms sliding doors are flimsy and a little off-putting. A little worn down, but the room was clean. As the night wore on, I felt like I was camping in Waikiki, because the louver windows didn't close all the way so we left them open. The wind rustled , heard the palm trees and the traffic, it was cool. However, the traffic and trucks are very noisy in the morning. These rooms I would recommend if you want clean inexpensive lodging and don't plan on being in room at all. If traffic noise will bother you, don't stay in the basic rooms! You can't avoid it.The next night we got upgraded to the one bedroom suite. This had a nice lanai with ocean and mountain views. Nice king bed and less comfortable pull out sofa bed. Nice kitchenette with plates, microwave and 2 refrigs. Bathroom still small with flimsy door. Windows still didn't close completely so we left them open and didn't use ac at all. Traffic not so noticeable up here, although you hear it, and I loved hearing the birds roost in the neighboring banyan tree. This room I would recommend for family travel. It is not elegant, but it was pleasant and comfortable. The breakfast is pretty bad. We made coffee in our room, as the coffee downstairs is terrible! I would eat a banana and an apple and a little juice. Muffins and pastries were not good.",US,91,4.0

It is conveniently located to almost all the places you want to go in Waikiki: the zoo, the beach, the parks, the shopping district and restaurants. This, for me, is very important. If you are a budget traveller and are enticed by other hotels that may offer a cheaper rate but is a good distance away from Waikiki's ""sweet spot"" as I call it, you will be making a big mistake that you will eventually regret. I have traveled to more than 40 countries on a shoe string budget and have learned from trial and error that it is worth paying a little more to be where you want to be. That being said, our deluxe room which was on the 6th floor was very basic. When we arrived, I was actually disappointed at the condition of the room. The walls, the bathroom, and the sofa were a bit old and faded. It reminded me of those old vegas hotels in old downtown Las Vegas. Moreover, and this might be a biggie for some people, if you are a light sleeper, than you should think twice about this hotel. There is a lot of noise coming from the surrounding area at night. I had no problem with the noise, but my wife apparently did and had difficulty sleeping. because of the sound of automobiles, trucks, and late party goers.But to be fair, there were amenities that the room contained the offsets the condition of the room such as a safe, microwave, coffee maker, mini fridge, mini sink, hair drier, A.C., free internet, and did I mention the superb location?

Because of lengthy delays in flights due to snow (no wonder we were headed to Hawaii) we arrived at the Aloha Surf well after 1:00 am. very tired and on the verge of grumpiness. The front desk attendant was efficient and had us checked in with our room keys within a few short minutes. When we turned to get our luggage we saw them already stacked on the porter's trolley. We eventually got to bed at almost 2:00 a.m. (4:00 a.m. Vancouver time). The next morning we were disturbed by the sound of garbage trucks picking up the large bins at an early hour. From previous reviews I was aware of this situation that affects rooms on the street side of the hotel and was able to drift back to sleep. Garbage pickup took place the next morning also (Saturday) but we had adjusted somewhat to the time difference and going to bed at an earlier time. We found the bed to be too close to the air conditioner causing cold air to blow straight onto our faces but this was solved by turning around so as to sleep with our heads at the foot of the bed. Our Hawaiian island cruise was scheduled to depart at 8:00 p.m and Aloha Surf was able to store our luggage after check-out time until we collected our luggage at mid-afternoon. The day before the ship was scheduled to return to Honolulu we found out that the cruise line's arrangements for left luggage were unsuitable to meet our 10:20 p.m. flight departure. We telephoned Aloha Surf from Kaua'i island and explained that we were guests a week earlier and had a problem finding a place to store only luggage from morning to night. The very quick answer from person who answered the Aloha Surf phone was that it was no problem. Eventually we were given a peek of the storage room and it was packed with luggage. The receptionist said that it is a service that they normally offer. This was a really a tremendous help to us, allowing us to enjoy Honolulu for the whole day. This, in addition to the excellent location and bargain price ($76), made our stay with Aloha Surf a great experience.",Vancouver,2,4.0

Though there was definitely some street noise, it wasn't nearly as bad for us as some other reviewers have mentioned. The location was perfect for us, just a few blocks from the beach, restaurants, bus stop, shops, and a little grocery store.

I picked Aqua Aloha Surf based on TripAdvisor reviews, its free internet service (I had to work during this trip), and its theme--I love to surf; so the theme and lobby pics were appealing, and the location's only a 5-minute walk to Queen's and Canoe's, where it's fun to paddle out, or even just hang out and listen to surf legends like Rabbit Kekai swap stories while they watch the surf. I also like the local's bar directly across the street from the hotel, because it has decent, surprisingly cheap food and drinks and it serves late-night dinners. Just be aware that this bar's a local's hangout, and the locals can get a bit boisterous, even those who are serving you! (Show some respect...kinda like being in the line-up at Makaha's, if you dare!)Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed by the hotel, mostly because of unexpected charges on my AmX bill, by the lack of internet service in my room the first two days--which were days I was supposed to be working--and by the extreme coldness of one female manager and one male desk clerk (the rest of the staff were great--total aloha). The charges I didn't expect were a $48.00 ""service fee"" from reservetravel.com and $64.00 ""car deposit"" fee. I tried calling the hotel about these charges, but was unsuccessful, so I ended up disputing the charges by writing AmX. AmX eventually reported that the hotel refused to cancel either charge. Apparently, the service fee was the result of some ridiculously vague fine print that I didn't read (who does) when booking the reservation...it said there MAY be a service fee of $0 to $5 per room/per night. The charge for the car was equally bad...I had the car for only a SINGLE night, as I told the desk clerk when I picked up the parking pass. The hotel's lot was full, so I had to park in a really grimy lot at the Continental several blocks away. I kind of expected this parking situation based on other TripAdvisor reports. But what I really didn't expect was a $64.00 charge for ONE night of parking! Because of these charges, no Aqua hotels will ever get my business again.","Carlsbad, California",2,2.0

The Aloha is just a couple of blocks from all shops/restaurants/people. I suppose if you have children and plan to spend a lot of time at the beach this location wouldn't work that well. Strolling to the beach was easy, but if we had to lug towels, mats, snacks, drinks, toys, etc., we may have found it a bit of a hassle. Finding a parking space in Honolulu isn't always an easy task either.The open air lobby was attractive and the desk clerk (Jason, I think) and the porter (Jeremy?) couldn't have been nicer. Our room, number 503, was on a corner near a store parking lot with views into neighboring apartment buildings. I have never heard so many beep, beep, beeps from trucks backing up in my life! There was A LOT of noise, so either bring earplugs, ask for a higher room, or try a different side of the building. No big deal - Part of life in the big city. That parking lot I mentioned provides quick access to the marketnext store which also has a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, donut shop, and another little pastry place inside. Handy since we never managed to get downstairs to the continental breakfast in time. I thought our room was better looking than it appeared on the internet. The colors, soft greens and blues, looked washed out on the computer screen but more vibrant in person. Nice to have a little sofa, coffee table, microwave, frig, and coffee maker in the room. Seems like they did a lot of renovating, but left the old tub and tile. Even though we tipped the maid every day her care of our room was somtimes sloppy. One day she gave us clean towels, no wash clothes, and didn't make thebed. Other little things seemed to be neglected, but nothing to botherthe management about. Pool area is attractive, though small. You can check-out beach towels from the front desk folks, which is nice.

I also have a second home in Hawaii and have been going to Hawaii since 1968. The first comment that comes to mind is that Aqua Resorts have really got their act together. I have not seen a such a combination of value, decor, friendliness, amenities and service.This hotel use dynamic sales, much like airlines, so your rate will vary depending on demand but it will remain the best value in Waikiki since demand is essentially seasonal and will affect other hotels as well.My first impression was the striking decor of the lobby and four employees at the front desk in about a 150 room hotel--you would be lucky to have that many in a 1000+ room hotel.Then to my room which was tastefully decorated as I've seen in a long time. Many of the few negative reviews complain of small rooms. I found the size well designed and more than adequate. The amenities were first class and the refrigerator, microwave and coffee are rare to find in hotels costing three times the price. The bathrobes were unique and the most luxurious I've seen anywhere--not the usual terry short white robe if they are provided at all. Also unique was having live anthuriums. The lanai was large and a view of the Ali Wai canal and the green mountains of the Monoa valley. . The beach is only a few blocks away and it is a bit quieter at this hotel location and has the only super market in Waikiki next door. The only thing I would add to the room would be a night light and small reading chair--but you can use the lanai chairs.The desk staff was always extremely friendly and the engineers , Craig and Mark, were very helpful in setting up my own dvd player and replacing a defective phone. Again for the few negative reviewers it's to be expected that sometimes things go wrong but what is important is that it is corrected. Try to get this kind of service in 2000 room hotel! It' s obvious that the employees enjoy their jobs are truly examples of the ""Aloha Spirit"".Two other extras are the free broadband connection(hotels on the beach charge up to $20/day) and the free continental breakfast.The bottom line is that you will not find a better value in Waikiki, maybe not anywhere. Of course, if you must be on the beach prepare to pay 3-4 times the price with 1/2 the experience. I am telling all my friends and neighbors in Hawaii about this hotel and since it is relatively new, most do not know about it. My friends and I rarely go to Waikiki but it is much improved over 10 years ago and I would definitely pick this hotel again.David C. Johnson","Haleiwa, HI",6,5.0

We booked a Superior room and were very happy with it. As expected, it was a little noisy (traffic) during the day but at night it quietened down. Our flight into Honolulu arrived early in the morning and check in to the hotel wasn't until 3.00pm. We got to the hotel by 11.00am and they stored our bags until 3.00pm. There is plenty of seating in the foyer and also free coffee or tea for guests. The front desk also has complimentary fruit for guests. We were on the 5th floor (room 510) and the room was on a corner of the building. We had beautiful views looking over the canal and up the mountain - just gorgeous at night. I know other people have said that the rooms are small but we found ours more than adequate. The breakfast, which was included in the tariff, was adequate for us - pastries, juice & fruit. Our room was always kept very clean and we found the cleaning staff very friendly. Most of the front office staff were friendly and helpful BUT a couple were also not so friendly or helpful!! Two people we found on the front desk who were great were Helene and Jennifer. They were always helpful and very friendly. The location is great - close to buses, restaurants, shops and only a couple of blocks from Waikiki Beach. We found the Food Pantry store next door great for supplies. The Honolulu bus system (The Bus) is great - $2 is all you will pay to go anywhere (even Hanaume Bay) - don't forget to ask the driver for a return ticket when you get on. If you get back on a bus within a couple of hours it's free! If you need a change from breakfast at the hotel, there are many restaurants close by - even a Denny's if you want a cheap meal. Parking is a problem at the hotel. If you are lucky enough to get a park it will cost you $15 per night. If you do get a park, ensure you get a permission to park notice from the front office staff to display in your car, otherwise you may get towed away! The parking lot of the Food Pantry next door is also available at night but from memory you could only park between 6.00pm until 7.00am. Each room has a safe in it and this was free. There is a laundry in the basement to do your washing and each room also has an iron and ironing board. Don't pack a beach towel as you can get these from the front desk when you need them. We had a great Thai meal at the Ohana East Hotel nearby and great pizza at a restaurant in the International Marketplace. Do the walk up Diamond Head but go early in the morning - the views are wonderful. Cost us $4 each on the bus (return) and $1 entry & take a bottle of water. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.",Australia,24,3.0

The first room we got, has a bed and a sofa, so I went down to front desk, Vinh did change a room for me, but not in a friendly way, he said that the sofa can be pulled out as a bed, so, it is indeed a two beds room. (BTW, all the times we were there, I have to deal with Vinh in several cases, he never smiles). Anyway, our new room has 2 beds, and a sofa, it is clean, has more than we need, and I am glad that there is a safety box in the closet. As everyone said, it only has shower, but that is not a problem for us. The free breakfast is not fancy, but we are not 'big breakfast' person at all, so, juice/banana/muffin is good enough to start a day. Also, the hotel provides beach tower to guests(just ask the front desk for it). Parking is a nightmare, we were glad that we insisted on having a compact car when we picked up our car at rental (they wanted to give us a minivan and other big cars). The space are very small and limited, you have to be extremely careful.Overall, this hotel is in a great location, blocks away from all the Waikiki activities, and a grocery store right by it, price is cheap, room is clean, and has everything you need.

Pre-cruise, we stayed at the Hyatt Waikiki, which was very disappointing. When I compare the 2 hotels, and their amenities, I have to say- don't waste your money at the Hyatt. Online, the Aloha Surf is about 1/3 the price. The Aloha is 2 blocks from the beach, 1 block from The Bus and has great rooms, amenities and staff. Like I said, I was at the Hyatt earlier, and was disgusted that in spite of a $300/nt room, they wanted to charge me $19/day for a fridge in my room (i had to notify them to opt out), and other nickel and dime fees. This place has free refridgerator, microwave, bathrobes, flat screen, beach towels, in-room i'net, free cont'l breakfast and even a comp manager's cocktail party on Tues. The rooms are bright and cheerful, the staff are great people and while the pool is small, the chairs are soooo comfortable. Also, there's a great ABC shop just across the street with a bigger selection than the ABC in the Hyatt. I know you'll think the Hyatt must be better if it costs so much more, but really, it's completely overpriced and neither the location (across the street from the beach), nor the service warrant such a price.Book the Aloha Surf, you won't be disappointed.","Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",97,5.0

It is a really good value hotel in a good location. On arrival we left the car in the hotel car park only to be told by staff we would need to move it, as it was full. I let the member of staff on reception know how annoyed I was that the car park was full and that the price was now $18 a night (I'd emailed the hotel 2 months before to enquire about the price, they told me it would be $13/night - a large price increase). To their credit they offered us an upgrade to my room, which made us feel happier! They allow you to use the car park in another Aqua hotel, which was about 4 blocks away. I read that it is their intention to turn this service into a valet system. That would be a very good idea. I think until this service is available they need to make it clear on their website that parking is limited.After recovering from the car park trauma we went to the room, which was lovely, recently modernised, and with a kitchenette (since we'd been upgraded). There was a locked adjoining door to the room next door from which we could hear the guest next to us coughing. Not too bad, but noisier people would have been very easy to hear.There is a free breakfast of muffins & fruit, which was a nice extra.The hotel is a few minutes walk from Waikiki beach and all the local shops.Staff were courteous but not over-friendly.All in all, excluding the parking situation, the hotel provides very good value for money (we paid $99/night) in terms of the room condition and location.","Laughton, United Kingdom",20,4.0

Priority is given to those rooms people have checked out of and if you ask the front desk for your room to be cleaned earlier you'll get a snide remark (I had to talk with a manager about this). It is clear that the cleaning crew is seriously understaffed and the poor cleaning staff is overworked. The workers at the front desk tend to be curt with their answers and not very informed about local places. The continental breakfast was a joke with two types of juice and bad muffins.

LCD TVs are a nice touch. Small key-operated safe in the closet; you get the keys from the front desk at check-in. Complimentary wired high-speed internet service in the rooms works well.

One of my co-workers had a ""standard"" room which didn't get the sofa or coffee table.The lobby area is smaller than it looks in the photos (and the chairs there aren't particularly comfortable) but it's airy and inviting. It's also outside, which you can't tell from the pictures, meaning it gets pretty warm and wet there while you're waiting to check in.The guest laundry could probably use another washer/dryer or two, since it seemed there was always a line down there.Parking is also cramped; they only have 18 parking spaces (and charge $18/day) so keep that in mind if you're renting a car (it was a non-issue for me - I bought a bus pass!)In the end, it was a ""good"" hotel.

I ran into a guy who was staying at the Outrigger ($$$$!) and switched to this hotel because it offered a better value. It is absolutely close enough to the beach. We were lucky enough to get an ocean view. I estimate there are only 60 ocean view rooms in the entire hotel, so we were very lucky. We opted for the Superior room, a step up from the cheapest room, because it was larger and higher up. Complaints: Bed was not heavenly, but was plenty comfortable for me.","Seattle, WA",18,5.0

There were two main problems. First, the bathroom was like something out of the 50’s (and not in a cool retro way, but in an old decaying way.) Second, while the PROXIMITY to things like the beach, shops and the bus line is great, the LOCATION leaves something to be desired. The area is pretty run down, surrounded mostly by low end studio apartments with broken appliances and clothes hanging off the patios. Since I noticed those two things immediately upon check-in, my first impression was one of disappointment. I wouldn’t have rated it over a “2”. But I have to say that the positives grew on me and it gained a point or so after the first day. The room was clean and comfortable, the patio and small “kitchen” were convenient, the common areas were very nice and the closeness to activities was wonderful (I have stayed in the past at the Maile Sky Court, which has - or had – nice rooms but was so far away from everything that the walk was excruciating. Don’t be fooled, you will do that walk several times a day to come down to the beach or shops or restaurants.) I was also pleasantly surprised by how quiet it was. We never heard other guests or the traffic or construction noise that others have complained of.So in the end I would have to say it was a good value for the money (we paid an average of $90 per night.) But don’t expect to want to hang out at the hotel much (either in the room or by the pool, which is small and stuck in between so many buildings that the sun never really hits it.) If you want more than a clean, comfortable place to sleep you will have to spend more money.Tip: Buy a few groceries like cereal and milk at the Food Pantry next to Perry’s Smorgy, it’s a full grocery store and cheaper than the ABC store on the corner.",Oregon,24,3.0

I didn't want to pay $250 plus for a room for a few hours. After looking around I found the aqua surf. Now my review is only valid for the room I rented Room 803. This is a condo rental property. Starting with the hotel location. The hotel is all the way against the Ala Wai canal. This is the back end of Waikiki the beach is 3 blocks away. It's really not that bad but it does get a little seedy past the cross street kuhio. The lobby is great and check in was wonderful. The pool is right next to the lobby. It is small, but kind of nice. Free coffee all day is a plus. Also free continental breakfast. Did I menation free internet ?? In the rooms you have to use a cable, but in the lobby it is wireless. Now to the room. I was in a superior with a balcony. I paid $94. The room is clean with flat panel tv. I feel that it is pretty roomy. It has a couch king bed, microwave and cofee maker. The bathroom is a bit small but works. I would say for a basic room it is above average. The only problem with cleanleniss is the shower. I think that the grout is so old, it is just the way it goes. besides the shower the room is very clean and usable. The balcony looks out to the other condo's nothing really to see but nice and big if you just want to go outside. The carpet and tile seems fairly new. You do get some traffic noise, Not bad compared to other high end hotels I have stayed at in Waikiki. WARNING : The hotel is going under renovations. You do hear construction noise during the day from 9:00am-3:00pm. I called to complain about it. The manager apologized and said the work would be done in a couple of months. She explained the work going on and apologized for the inconvienence. I understood and just like she said the work stoppped at 3:00. If you will be sleeping during the day call ahead to see if the construction is done. Overall I would stay here again for the price. This is not a high end hotel, but it is clean, quite at night and has a descent location. As I said in the begining of the review. I can only review this one room, but if the others are like it I give it 4 out 5. Good, basic, cheap. The managment and hotel staff are friendly and the hotel has allot going for it.",Oakland,73,4.0

I originally wanted to stay at another hotel, but as I procrastinated and put off booking, by the time I did, they did not have a room for the 4 days. So I checked all the major websites looking firstly at price, then quality/ammenities. The Aloha Surf was not right at the top for cheapest, but was reasonable value. I checked it out more by reading all the booking web sites review pages and making sure to read everything I could here on Trip Advisor.I waited for a week or so, then as my departure date got closer and closer, decided to book. Except that when I went to Expedia.com to do so, there was a special offer. Stay 3, get 1 Free. Hmmm. That threw up a red flag. So I emailed the property and the quickly and honestly said that there was still some construction work going on at the front of the hotel and that it would cause noise during the day. NO PROBLEM. This isnt the type of hotel you stay inside 24/7.I booked and paid online for a superior room. Looking at the different room descriptions on Expedia gave the SqM size of each room and I decided that I needed a balcony and had to have some room to swing a cat. So it ruled out the standard room, but I couldnt justify the extra cost of the next one up as the only benefit I could see was a couch and a desk. Both I didnt need. So I settled on a Superior.When I arrived in Hawaii, a friend picked me up and entertained me until it was time to check in. Check in was quick and easy. It all appeared to be ready and waiting. The swipe cards were already programmed and the welcome information neatly folded up into the card wallet. The hotel it's self was very clean. Looked fresh from a recent facelift and was not so huge that there was a sea of people always around, or queing for the elevator.Went up to my room (see my photos) and was pleased with the size, view and decor. Very fresh and modern. Reminded me very much of the rooms here in Oz by Rydges Hotels. The only thing that I didnt do (and broke my golden rule) was to test the shower straight away. And I found out the next morning that the shower head wasnt really up tp scratch. But my holiday was such a short one that I didnt worry about it and settled for a combined shower/bath experience.The noise from the street was what I had expected it to be when the balcony door was opened, but when closed, I didnt notice it much at all. I was on the 4th floor. The construction noise was quite loud (jackhammers) but I left the hotel before they started all bar the first morning, so it didnt really bother me.I found that one power point was faulty, but there were many more to use. The airconditioner is in an odd position, but it just about did the job. If you really suffer from the heat, you might need to consider this. I found it just about cooled the entire room to a comfortable temp. The corner view over the canal and golf course was very pretty, and I enjoyed to night time views of the other buildings.Housekeeping was great. Very friendly and an asset to the hotel. Two days before I left, my phone stopped working. Reception said they would have it fixed, but they never did. Could have had something to do with the construction work as the cable tv had quite a bit of interference on and off after the phone stopped working. But no big deal. Managed to watch all the season finales on Tv, about 8 in all that week. Months ahead of home!The Kona coffee was delicious and appreciated. The welcome toiletry pack was a nice touch, although I didnt use it. And I hadnt realised that there was free broadband internet in the room itself via a network plug. If I had known I would have brought my laptop, but probably wouldnt have used it anyway.Location was great for me. I HATE walking long distances and I was able to take myself out for breakfast every morning. The ABC store on the corner was terrific, and had a good range of pre-mixed alcoholic cocktails to take back to the balcony at night. And the walk to the beach and the post office was only about a 15 minute one. The International Marketplace was only a 5 min walk too, and along Kahio there is plenty of dining/shopping/entertainment options.I will probably stay here again on my next visit to Honolulu.

Its website raves it as a newly renovated ""boutique"" hotel. Their whole branding/marketing was also quite stylish. My BF and I booked a standard queen room, but had no idea it was going to be so small. Although it does seem to have new wallcovering/carpets, and furniture, there was really nothing they can do with the space limitation. The bathrooms were small, pedestal sink with no counter space, a very tight shower stall (with a faulty shower head that we had to ask to be replaced), and a sliding barn door into the bathroom because there was not enough space for a real door. The air conditioner was the worst, it was on the window wall and positioned right at bed level, the bed was literally less than 3 feet from the unit, so if you slept at night, you had a constant rush of cold air shooting directly at your face. Not to mention it was loud. We had to strategically move the guest chair in front of the unit and then clothes, bags, and anything on the chair to prevent the air from heating us. We would shut off the air, except the room gets very stuffy and also windows have no screens so we would be mosquito dinner if we had left the windows open. The staff was friendly, very helpful, when we had our rooms cleaned it seems like they never replaced our bedsheets or pillow cases, they just fixed it up, not a great cleaning effort. Parking was also a rip-off, $15/day. So we only had a car for 2 days out of the 6 days we were there. Everything is walkable or can be accessible by bus, but you will want to have a car to drive to some other very beautiful places, otherwise you are really missing the true beauty of Oahu. The only plus was the hotel was at a great convenient location. Close to public transportation and stores/restaurants. Somewhat quiet street.","San Francisco, California",18,2.0

I called the desk and they told me that the airline had delivered our luggage. They brought our luggage up to our room. That was the start of our very pleasant interaction with the staff. They were helpful with directions, recommendations. We have nothing but good to say about the staff. Even when we checked out on the March 21, one of the desk staff helped us carry our luggage to the rental car. We had a Superior room and there was more than enough room for my wife and I. The room was clean and well kept. The hotel had a good location and we were able to easily walk to most of our destinations in Wakiki. Some of the tours we took picked us up at the hotel.

You have to cross both busy Kuhio Avenue and Kalakaua Avenue to reach the beach. And when you walk down the street the hotel is on at night it is quite dark due to overhanging trees and inadequete lighting. There were also some iffy characters hanging out in that darkened section including 2 people who looked like they were about to come to blows.I was assigned a room on the 3rd floor. It had no balcony and no view - unless you count looking in other peoples windows a view. The windows in the room are the kind that are glass slats that you open and close by turning the handles. There are no screens to keep out the mosquitoes. Unfortunately when I entered my room one window was wide open and there was no way to close it as the handle was missing. My room was probably mosquito central by then. On my way out I informed the desk staff and it had been fixed when I returned an hour later.I had to have the window A/C unit on 24/7 it was so hot. The air conditioner would make a very loud noise every 15 minutes on schedule which can make getting to sleep difficult. I brought a white noise machine from home and put it on the loud setting right next to my ear, that helped some. The shower was the size of a phone booth so if you are a ""person of size"" you might get stuck in there. Also if you are over 5'8"" good luck getting a shampoo. I'm 6'2"" and the shower head was about 6 inches lower than my head. I had to sort of squat and bend over sideways to get my head wet. Also both faucets were labelled ""C"" for cold, so good luck your first time in figuring out which one is which. You might get scalded.There was a sign in the elevator saying the pool was closed from October 11 until ""a date to be determined"". I don't use pools but just an FYI in case you wanted to. It said you could use the pool at another Aqua hotel if that helps. Have fun finding it.Breakfast has gone downhill since the previous reviews. It was not delivered to my door, and there was no can of iced tea or nice yogurt. You went down to the lobby and got a piece of fruit out of a basket or muffins out of other baskets. For drinks they had those big clear plastic dispensers where you can dispense a cup of orange juice or pineapple juice. There was a coffee machine too although it said you had to pay $2.00 for some of the coffees.Some of the staff were rude and when you went to the front desk they would ignore you for a while then look up like ""Why are you bugging me?"". There was a real nice young Asian girl there though who was friendly and attentive. She was the exception rather than the rule.There is free wireless broadband but I don't have a laptop so that was no good to me. They should have some desktops set up to use for free.Pluses:Grocery store close by, modern furnishings, LCD TV with about 30 channels including MTV and VH1 (although I only watched the TV when eating breakfast in my room or at night when I got in), free internet access if you have a laptop. Fridge, microwave, coffee maker and hair dryer in room, hangers you can actually remove from the closet, price to stay there, close to International Marketplace, free daily newspapers, and a free safe in the room.

NoiseThe design of the windows meant that they didn't close properly so, despite being on the 14th floor, we heard a bit of street noise from around 6am - the noisy refuse collection (as another reviewer mentioned) and cars on the street. However, I think some noise is to be expected in a city so we didn't mind too much. In addition, the air con unit was pretty noisy. Ear plugs would be a good idea :-) Rubbish showerThe shower was clean and well - kept but the water came out as little more than a dribble and it was the worst waterflow of the 7 hotels / condos during our trip round California and Oahu! WorksThere were notices in the lobby saying :1) from October 'until further notice' the pool is closed (I think it said for safety reasons) - this didn't bother us but I expect that some people would mind.2) they are doing work to several balconies so don't leave anything on your balcony etc - fortunately our balcony was not affected.3) they are doing work to the car park, which meant that there were only 8 or 9 underground spaces available - however, we got lucky and had a space on both days. They did give us a list of other places to park nearby, although I think they were open air so possibly less secure. BreakfastAs others have said, it was inadequate (a small muffin, can of iced tea, nice yoghurt) and was less than any other hotel breakfast on our trip in the same price bracket. On the plus side, it was delivered to your room and you could choose one of 4 20 minute time-slots, starting at 7.30am. Top tip: one day we went to the Seaside Cafe on Kuhio Avenue (8 mins walk) for a v. tasty $2.99 breakfast of pancakes, scrambled egg and bacon. Good points about the Aqua Aloha : nice location (our room overlooked the canal and golf course to the side), decent price, clean, the room was tastefully and recently decorated and in great condition. The flat screen TV was a nice touch too. The reception area had some comfy, colourful sofa's. Finally, if you can, pay a bit extra for a 'superior' room - after we'd opened our suitcases there was little room for manoevre so I dread to think how small the 'standard' rooms are :-)","London, England",24,3.0

Room with a view over the Alai Wai canal to the public golf course and the residential hills above Waikiki. Street noise was annoying until we closed the windows and turned on the A/C.

The Honolulu police regularly patrolled the area and we felt safe at all hours.We had to use a parking area 4 blocks away due to construction in the hotel's parking area.The pool and pool area were quite small but afforded a nice shady area during an unusually hot spell.

Truly, the price is awesome for a stay in Hawaii. Though the location is 2 blocks away from the beach, it's really not that far of a walk. Besides, you want to see the sights. You could spend more $ to stay somewhere right on the beach, but if you want to save and use that money to actually go out and DO things, then you can't go wrong with this Hotel. Before going to this hotel, I read some previously posted reviews and I expected a small shower and mini pool, which is all true. Aside from that, all staff members were helpful to me and the group of people that went on the trip, and they provided maps and instructions on which bus lines to take to different sites.

I have been to Hawaii many times before. I used to be a flight attendant, and not only did I have layovers in HNL, but I also took several vacations there. I am making it a point to write this review because trip advisor is how I ultimately decided to stay at the Aloha Surf hotel and hopefully this helps other vacationers out there. I started planning this trip about a month and a half ago. Once I decided to go back to Hawaii, I booked my vacation package on United Airlines. Through their website, there were many hotel options. I knew that I did not want to spend a lot of money on the hotel, because I wanted to be able to use that money on excursions and good eating. My brother just went to Hawaii for his one year anniversary and spent over $1400 to stay at the Hilton Hawaiin Village. Considering all he did was sleep there, I wasn't gonig to make the same mistake. I decided to stay at the Aloha Surf because it received pretty good reviews, was right in heart of Waikiki, and was definitely financially appealing.The pictures on tripadvisor are pretty accurate. I arrived at the hotel on Sat. morning and was impressed with the lobby. The lounge chairs, flat panel TV and blue lighting were nice and inviting. I was pretty happy with my decision. Usually hotel photos are much nicer than the real thing. In this case, I was impressed (at least for now). I walked up to the front desk where three guys were talking to eachother. One guy (I am guessing he is the Manager on Duty-sits at the desk on the side) told the other guy to check me in. They seemed bothered as if I was interrupting them. The check in was quick. Here are your keys. Enjoy your stay. I had to ask HIM how his day was going. No welcome, no can I help you with bags, nothing. I didn't event get a cold face towel at check in (I thought that was part of the deal) This was just the beginning of the service I would be receiving. The hotel room was nice, with new decor, comfortable beds, and an air conditioner that worked. The flat panel TV was nice, although limited channels, no pay per view or gaming options. And no automated voicemail system. My friend who lives there called the hotel several times. On time, he said the phone kept ringing and ringing, only to be later asnwered by someone at the Front Desk who rudely told him we were not in. Another time he called, housekeeping answered the phone. Not sure if that is protocal. Actually I know it is not. I am no longer a flight attendant, I now work as a Sales Manager for a large hotel chain. That is probably why I am noticing all these points.The next 4 days would be more routine, since I was now used to the hotel. I have to admit, location wise, the hotel is great. Just two blocks from the main street and Waikiki beack. The bus system is great and can take you just about anywhere for a couple bucks. The hotel itself was nice. Here are some pros and cons:Pros:Location-near everythingPrice-can't beat itNice rooms-decor and air conditiningCons:Service, Service, Service - On Sunday, we decided to go parasailing. I went downstairs and pulled a brochure for Hawaii Parasail from the brochure stand. Again, the gentleman who I am assuming is the Manager on Duty sitting at the desk to the side, looked at me like I was in his space. I asked him if Hawaii Parasail was a good company to go with and he replied rudely ""I wouldn't even know"". You are a manager? Sitting at what one might confuse as a concierge desk? Live in Hawaii? Cater to tourists and vacationers? Must have parasailed at least one? And that is the best response I can get. Then later on he was at the desk when I asked for towels and made this face again like I was interupting him. I can tell you this. If he was working at my hotel, he would defnitely not be in a customer service position with us. Maybe dishwasher or laundry man. He needs to go!The front desk clerks just kept talking to eachother, joking around, and looking at guests as if we were at their door trying to sell them girl scout cookies or newspapers. That get off my porch before I shoot you look. NICE!No automated voicemail system and basic TV.Swimming pool is small and closed at 7pm. That's right. A swimming pool in Hawaii closed at 7pm. And one more point for the icing on the cake:I came back to the room on Monday around 2pm and housekeeping had not cleaned the room. That morning I noticed that the sheets had some blood stains. They were obviously clean sheets with older stains. No worries. I am in hospitality and understand. She came in to clean the room while I was in there, so I sat on the couch and watched TV. She went to straighten up the bed. Yes, straighten. Not change the sheets. Not change the pillow case. Straighten and re-tuck the sheets. I was in shock. I had to get up and show her the stain and asked her to change the whole bedding, which she did. I hate to think I was sleeping on the same sheets for 3 days but who knows.Well, originally I was going to say this hotel was well worth the money. For the budget minded it is definitely worth it. For someone who needs SOME decent customer service and hopefully clean sheets, this may not be the best hotel. Would I return. Maybe. If I do, I will definitely be more attentative to housekeeping and go with the knowledge that I won't get a whole lot out of the front desk. Why should I expect to? It's not like it's a SERVICE related job. Oh wait. IT IS! Never mind. I won't go back to Aloha Surf. I will go back to Aqua hotels though. I think they have a nice product, they just need to fine tune the service details. Maybe the other hotels are better. I will wait to see next year when I return. Until then, Mahalo!p.s. Not all the desk clerks were rude. On Tuesday morning when I checked out, I finally got the service I was hoping for. ""Thank you for staying with us and come back soon"" from a nice lady (pregnant) at the front desk. FINALLY! Didn't realize this wasn't going to be this long. Hope it helps.","San Jose, CA",21,2.0

Because it was worth the amount paid. It is not 5 star but then neither is the price.I stayed the previous 10 days at the Hilton Hawaiian Village at about 6x the cost and the HHV was not 6x better although still very good. The price paid was $80 per night booked via expedia. Includes internet and breakfast (the reasons i booked this place)The hotel was perfect for me, a single traveller finishing out the last couple of days in Hawaii in a different scene.  The room was small basically about 4x4m with a corner taken up by the bathroom - it was small but adequate. The fittings were the same as the pictures and more than adequate ( flat screen tv with 30 channels, microwave, coffee maker) The bathroom was average but not at all bad so overall the room is just fine if you plan to do what you should and spend most of the time exploring. Bed was fine and i had no problems sleeping. Pros:Clean room with the things you would expect TV is good and lots of channels to watch in the times in the room Free internet - cable in the room and wireless in the lobby - very easy to use and fast - with no seeming restrictions perfect for skype home etc Airconditioning - self controlled Free breakfast and paper (nothing special but free) Location - close to the action of the city and buses, resturants, abc stores etc. Lobby is nice and setup well for waiting for pickups etc.Cons: Older style windows (glass slats) which dont really help the street noise and heat that you get althroughout waikiki - if you can sleep with aircon on its worth doing it. Shower was dark when curtain pulled which was a pain. Small room - ok for one maybe 2 but no more.Other Breakfast is only available in tight range of times and not suitable times to get out to the attractions early (ie arizona you need to be there before 7.30 so means you will miss breakfast as first delivery is 7.30)No resturant, mini bar or room service - not major as there are things close Pool is small and was closed 1 of the 2 days i was there but again no consequence Parking - i didnt have a car but looked a bit of a hassle. For whatever reason this is not that well known a hotel so make sure you have the address handy for taxis etc as a lot dont recognise the name.","Auckland, New Zealand",160,5.0

The Pool was not an issue for us, we walked to the beach, and were very happy at the Aloha Surf. The Front Desk will provide Beach Towels on request. We booked a ""Superior"" room, it was nicely furnished and clean. The Refrigerator and Microwave looked new. No bugs! Although the Bathroom was not ""new"", it was clean and reasonably well maintained. The bed was firm and comfortable. We slept well once we discovered how to stop the wind from rattling our door (we used a hand towel to steady the door against the tradewinds)- and of course run the Air Conditioner to drown out Kuhio street noise. The A/C unit looked new, and performed flawlessly.The staff were helpful with our requests. Parking can be difficult in the area, but we only rented a car for three days and found parking for $15.00. We walked or took the bus most of the time. The Housekeepers are a bit quirky, and some days the room was cleaned more thoroughly than others, but we always had clean towels and TP. When I walked into the huge beach resort hotels, I was glad to be staying at the Aloha Surf. If you want a giant resort hotel with lots of service and amenities, this is not the hotel for you.

The place looked decent in the pictures and the deal was good. We spent 7 nights over there. At first, I thought the room with a queen bed in the 2nd floor was too small. It was basically 15ft x 15ft (including the bath -no bath tub, closet and the furnitues). It was too tiny for 2 adults walking among luggages that I called the front desk. They said my reservation was for a standard room and it was the best I could get because the hotel was booked up. They offered us an upgrade for $20/night. After the 1st night, we decided to stay in the same tiny room because we realized we were out most of the time and coming back only for sleeping. The room has an adequate closet size, builky new furnitures, a cooler, safe box,alarm clock and a flat screen TV. The room was renovated and was confortable despite the size. Internet is available at the looby (wireless, but it did not work for my laptop for some reason) and DSL wired at the room (but you have to have a cable for it). The breakfast was delivered in the room every morning and it was a small muffin, yogurt and canned juice for each adult. Not much of food, but better than nothing. The hotel is surrounded by nice places for breakfast starting on $3.99 and good restaurants for dinner and lunch. Check the PERRY'S SMORGY restaurant one block from the hotel. Excellent deals on Buffet with simple but good food. The hotel is also located 2 blocks away from Waikiki Beach. Be prepared to know where you are going because the front desk is always busy and has no time to answer inquiries and give suggestions. I found that some of the staff was not knowledgeable of the vicinities, but nothing I couldn't find using the free internet. Overall, it was a pleasant stay. It was a good deal for the money spent. No luxuries, I admit. If you have a lot of things planned, you will not even bothered by the little inconveniences at the hotel. Like i said before, the place is excellent for sleeping after a day full of fun. All you need is a confortable bed to crash on. Another thing I liked is the coin laundry at teh basement. Very convenient. Would I stay there again? SUre I would.",Sam Mateo,7,4.0

My first impression was mild disappointment! While the room and the reception area were decent and looked exactly like the pictures on Expedia, there was a musty smell noticeable in the hallways and in the room. We stayed in a deluxe unit which had a twin bed, a double bed and a pull out couch, and there was a bar with a microwave and a small fridge. Yes, the furniture and the bar seemed fairly new and there was a flat screen TV, but the ""complete renovation"" of the room seemed like a half-hearted attempt and did not seem to include the bathroom. We had to ask to move to another room because the first room we were in the bathroom was unacceptable! There was so much mold in the grout of the tiled shower that my daughter and I had to wear our sandals to take showers and we tried to make it as quickly as possible! And to make things even worse, there was a faint smell of urine. The second room we were in was better but still the shower did not show any renovations. The positives of this hotel were the location and the staff. We were close to the beach - about 2 blocks away - and practically walked everywhere we wanted to go. The area seemed safe enough that my daughter and I were out and about up to midnight. There is a number of restaurants around, Chili's, IHOP, Denny's, as well as many smaller family-run places. There is a Food Pantry and an ABC store right around the corner. The cab fare from the airport was about $32.00 plus tip. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, from the front desk to the housekeeping department. Every morning there was a continental breakfast delivered to our room at the time of our choosing, and it was always on time. The breakfast was just a muffin, yogurt and a can of fruit juice, but it was a nice touch and nicely presented in a little basket. Overall, it was an adequate place but I think the description on Expedia was misleading. For all the good points about the Aloha Surf, I don't think I will consider coming back here for our next vacation in Oahu.","Bay Area, California, USA",22,2.0

For the price, this is a decent place to stay, including a small breakfast and the convenience of fridge and microwave. Our room is an odd combination of old (dated wallpaper, the shower is only slightly scary, popcorn ceiling, concrete lanai that is good for drying your wet clothing) and new (internet access--cable is provided but I brought my own--, flat screen TV, granite sink countertop). The carpet and furniture in this room are not new, not old, and comfortable enough. I stayed with my 2 teen daughters, and the room is small but fine for us--a double bed (on the small side for 2 people), a twin, and a fold out couch which we did not use for sleeping. I like having the separate couch/coffee table area for computer use. The microwave, in room coffee, and small fridge I thought we would use a lot more than we did, because food in the area is convenient and inexpensive. Breakfast is an average size muffin, a cup of yogurt, and a 12 ounce can of juice, which was okay for us. We did not use the tiny pool and opted for the beach. The hotel provides beach towels. The service at the desk is okay, not terribly friendly but we didn't need much. The location is great--a short 2 block walk to the beach, 1 1/2 block from the back entrance the the international marketplace.

I took an impulsive trip to Oahu and stayed at the aloha surf from Jan 19-23 and I was pleasantly surprised. Most of the staff was extremely friendly especially this one guy at the front desk named Lance. I was on the seventh floor and I had a great view of the Ala Wai Canal and the houses on the mountain. The best part was walking around naked in my hotel room with a great view at hand. Now that's what I call fun. Newayz, the room was very well taken care of by the maids. Every afternoon, bed sheets would be folded, trash cans would be emptied, and towels would be replaced. The room itself included a tv with about 30 channels, an alarm clock, internet service for anyone who has a laptop, or for anyone stupid enough to bring their home computer, a coffee maker with coffee, a microwave, a hairdryer, and a large mirror in front of the bed for any exhibitionist out there. Every morning, complimentary breakfast was served which included muffins, juice and coffee. There were only two drawbacks to the hotel. #1 The toilet seat in my particular room looked like it had gone through world war 2 or as if a dog had chewed a chunk off the side. YUMMY! #2 I rented a car(almost a necessity if you plan on seeing other parts of oahu)and to park it for the day, i had to pay $15 dollars. Kind of a rip if you ask me. But all in all I think i got a bargain at the Aloha Surf. Hawaii freakin rawks!","Atlanta, Georgia",13,5.0

We asked for two beds and got one bed and a pull out sofa bed. I'm only 5'4 and my feet hung over the edge of the bed. Also you could feel the springs digging into your back all night long. When we brought this up with the front desk clerk he shrugged his shoulders and said all two bed rooms in this hotel are like that. That's funny because I saw the maid in another room that had two beds not one bed and a pull out sofa. Breakfast was also a problem. We were to get a free continental breakfast each morning. Just fill out the card with the time slot you wish your breakfast to arrive at your room. We had to call every morning for our breakfast and twice one morning. When you have a tour bus to catch you can't afford to wait around for your breakfast. Finally the pool was only open for use once during our one week stay. So if you are wanting a pool I don't suggest booking here.,Edmonton,24,1.0

It was perfect for us. We got the hotel as part of a Suntrips package, so we weren't sure what to expect. The hotel just finished extensive renovations into a very cool boutique 'surfer' hotel with all new furnishings and landscaping. We stayed on the 9th floor and had an excellent view of the canal on one side and the ocean on the other. The room had tasteful furnishings and photographs and wall hangings and everything was brand new. The location was perfect being only two blocks from main street Kuhio so it was easy walking distance to the beach, surfing, dinner, drinks, shopping, etc. The room was spotless and well lit (lots of windows) and the beds were very comfortable and they provided a microwave and a coffee machine and an in-room safe and internet connection and the AC worked well. The rooms are definitely on the small side so I don't recommend more than 2 per room. However, if you are the type of travelers who like to hang out at the hotel all day and use room service and use the pool this is not the place for you - you would be happier at a larger hotel such as the Marriott or the Hyatt. The lobby is large and spacious with surfer videos showing all day on wall-mounted flat screens, but the hotel definitely is on the small side and is not really designed for hanging out. But if you want a very nice and inexpensive place to sleep when we're not playing on the island, then it will be perfect for you. Other notes: Hotel is very safe since all access is through the main lobby. Parking is $14 a day so be prepared for that. Breakfast was very minimal but there are great breakfast restaurants less than a block away. Other reviews mentioned this being a bad part of town, but it seemed just fine to us. We did see maybe 2 or 3 prostitutes during our entire stay, but I think they're everywhere in Waikiki after 10pm. Waikiki has a lot to do and is very active, so it can also be noisy at night. The noise can be remedied by closing the window or staying near the top floors or as a last resort bring earplugs. But if you need a really quiet place to stay I would recommend staying out of Waikiki and staying in a B&B in Kailua on the beach.Have fun!","Capitola, CA",17,5.0

I would have liked to have been in a hotel that's on the beach, but I didn't want to pay the higher prices; plus, we were in Hawaii for the outdoors more than the indoors. After researching for a few weeks, I decided on reserving a room at the Aston Aloha Surf. A few of the reviews didn't seem positive about this place, but some reviewers stated it was just fine. First off, I was surprised at how nice the lobby area looked, compared to the internet photos. We arrived at the hotel a few hours before check-in, so the person who checked us in, allowed us to keep our luggage (with other travelers' luggage) in a storage closet, until we returned from a close walk to Waikiki beach. Once we went up to our 7th floor room, I was surprised at how clean the hallways were. The room looked as if it were recently renovated, with a nice comfortable bed (room was not too big, but not too small), clean floors, small refrigerator, cable tv, and night stands. The only thing I didn't like was the outdated bathroom, which has a shower (no tub; which is alright). We did not pay for a lanai (balcony), but we were given one at no extra charge. Since we had the lanai (our room faced towards the east), we had perfect sunrise views, views of Diamond Head, the streets below and of the ocean. Not a bad place to stay for the money. The hotel is only 2 long blocks to the ocean, and we walked a few times. Enterprise Rental car is a few blocks west of the hotel, so that was very convenient. The Alawai Canal is across the street. When I go back to Waikiki Beach, and if I don't care about being in a hotel on the beach, I'll stay there again. Being there for 4 nights and 5 days, and only spending $550 apiece, was super cheap. Good place.","Los Angeles, CA",10,3.0

The room (6th floor) was completely renovated, new furniture, carpeting,a/c, fridge, M/W, coffeemaker, and very expensive bronze art on the wall. At first, I was only hopeful that we wouldn't have the problems that other guests experienced, but this place was delightful. We called a week earlier for a non-smoking room and got an answering machine oh-oh, so called the booking agent, Travelocity, who called for us to ensure a non-smoking room. Within two hours, the manager also called us back to ensure our non-smoking room.  If you want large rooms, good restaurants, security police, go to the Hilton and pay three times the rate. If you don't want to see cockroaches and hookers, stay away from Waikiki. I never saw a roach, but you've got to wade through the hookers to get back to any hotel in Waikiki, and as the night gets late, say after 10 pm, their pimps force them to accost any male. This hotel is one block off the main drag, Kuhio, so they don't hang around here, but once you get up to Kuhio around King's Village, watch out. Other plusses--1 block from only supermarket in Waikiki, 1 block from ABC store but everything is, short walk to main Waikiki beach, Intl Marketplace, and all the activities. Minuses--rather chintzy included breakfast (Coffee not bad), almost as chintzy as I was in looking for a price, rooms certainly not big enough for more than two, Waikiki street noise had to be remedied by earplugs, but I've stayed in many hotels in this class here and have had the same problem. Last problem, if you decide to rent a car, you'll pay $$ to store it for the night in Waikiki. The concierge here was good enough to give us a couple of places to see about car storage, since they were renovating their own parking garage which is nowhere near big enough for their guests and employees. One was $7 per night, with in an out privileges for 24 hours. Bottom line, we'd return in a second.",Kailua-Kona,181,5.0

Continental breakfast wasn't our thing - too much white bread and fatty stuff - easy fix - hit the ABC and bought fruit and yogurt. Staff was friendly, helpful and we had no issues.

We walked in in the afternoon, and we were immediately greeted by an argument between a woman staying at the hotel, who was having problem with a key card, which evidently hadn't worked on three different occasions. She was livid, even threatening to ""jump back there and start tearing up that computer!"" The manager came out, and fixed her problem. We asked if we could see the room before we signed anything, and were given the key to a room which smelled strongly of smoke, and looked dirty. We told the clerk that the room was totally unacceptable, so we were given another key to check out another room. Upon initial inspection, we decided that it was too late in the day to change hotels, and it would suffice for two nights. The room was small and had too much furniture in it (a double bed and a twin, when one king would have been great, and given the room more space). The carpet was nasty, the sink had a rusty faucet. a cracked sink, and an air conditioner that even ""out-noised"" the traffic in the street.When we asked about a bellman, we were told that there wasn't one. Okay, we can deal with that. They did have a bell cart, which we were allowed to use. THEN, the real problem. We were asked if we had a car, which we did, having rented one. We were told that there was NO parking at all, none, despite all advertisements saying that there was paid parking available. We were told that we could park at a public lot about 15 minutes away, and walk back to the hotel!! We stated our dissatisfaction politely, and asked to speak to someone about getting transferred to another hotel, with parking. After a few minutes, a very nice man named David came out saying that he was the hotel manager. He asked to speak to us, and showed us where he would allow us to park - in his personal parking space. He explained that he had workers coming every day, and that was why the parking was so limited. David was the only good thing about this hotel, though we didn't complain about anything else, because the parking situation was such a major issue.Every morning we were awakened at 7:30 by the sound of hammering and banging. The room was not inviting, and just a bit creepy. It needs a new paint job, the curtains have holes in them, the carpet is dirty and the room is just too small. The advertisements I had read online before our trip stated it had been completely renovated, but they are in the process of renovation - a clerk told us that the top two floors were done, and they were working their way down. The lobby is lovely, but there it ends. Nothing else about this hotel is appealing - save the possiblity that because David is the manager, things will get better. He is a wonderful, caring man, but in all likelihood can only do what he is allowed to do. He saved the end of vacation from being a disaster, but could only do so much. The room was disappointing on all levels.I would never recomend this hotel, despite the efforts on David's part.","New Orleans, La.",10,1.0

I cannot say enough good things about this hotel and its staff. I want to say upfront that I am a 44-year-old flight attendant with less than a decade of experience. I have used my flight privileges extensively, but before joining the airline I traveled a great deal as a student and journalist and stayed in ALL kinds of places. I am anything but a spoiled traveler. (I trained English teachers in Poland in one of several previous lives, for goodness sakes! You can't imagine what a Stalinist hotel looks like when it hasn't seen maintenance in 20 years.) I read the opinions here -- every last one of them -- and the only one that made me think twice about booking at the Aloha Surf was the guy from Marin County who said the Marriott in Stockton, California was nicer. Well, I lived in the Bay Area at one time and I would guess his house in Marin is probably nicer that a lot of hotels I'd be thrilled to sleep in, so maybe he should just stay at his house next time he needs a vacation. Since visiting the hotel I am even more inclined to think he is just another spoiled traveler. (Or just spoiled.)I have stayed at several Astons in the islands, including the Honolulu Prince in Waikiki (wonderful if you're on a real tight budget) and the Pacific Monarch (nice if you want to splurge, enjoy a rooftop hot tub, and want a separate bedroom away from your kids) and at the Maui Lu outside Kihei in Maui. I will admit that I began staying there because they offered a rate for airline employees, but I'll say here that I don't believe my rate at the Aloha Surf was substantially less than published rack rates, and I think you can trust my opinions. (I have raked hotels over the coals in this forum even when they practically gave the room away to airline employees.) I have lost count of the number of times I have visited Waikiki since 1997 (my first visit).The hotel's location is FANTASTIC for access on foot to everything in Waikiki. It is also near bus and trolley stops and a taxi stand is on the block.We are aware that mornings are noisy in Waikiki. The beach is surrounded by a concrete canyon of high-rise hotels; yes, the garbage trucks and delivery trucks make noise. But generally mainlanders are awake by that time anyway. Waikiki is NOT a resort; it is more like the Vegas strip parallel to a beach with really great landscaping and no casinos. So we don't -- and you shouldn't -- expect ""peace and quiet."" That's another part of Oahu, or another island altogether. Read guidebooks instead of relying on some postcard fantasy of what Waikiki really is.My husband (age 64) WANTED a street-facing room because he is a college professor who goes to Waikiki for the street vibe, the noise, the excitement, seeing people walk by at all hours. It was still not THAT noisy. Without our even asking, Helene (a beautiful woman who works the front desk -- Helene, why can't you come work for my airline? I need more colleagues like you) granted us an upgrade to Room 1201. It contained a double bed, a twin bed and a sofa sleeper that could have held two more reasonably-sized adults. We put our 11-year-old son in the twin bed and enjoyed sitting on the sofa and reading our complimentary paper in the mornings, when we weren't sitting on the balcony watching the moonlight, the sunrise, the lights of Waikiki come on or go out. The room was positively IMMACULATE. The mini-frig and microwave, big TV (with cable) and wallpaper and carpeting were all apparently brand new. The cabinetry had been repainted, the sink was shiny and the water pressure was strong and water always hot. The AC was on and the room cooled to 69 when we walked in. My only suggestion would be to replace the rather worn and narrow curtain in the shower stall. (There is no tub.) Yes, the towels might be thin, but the wonderful maid (who introduced herself by name, shook our hands, bowed, and explained very apologetically on Wednesday that we would not see her again until Saturday because she would be off until then) would give you as many stacks of them as you wanted. (And there were substitute maids until Saturday; from the regular maid's apologies we thought there might not be!) There are dishes and dishtowels and cutlery and a coffee pot, mugs and plastic cups and even a couple of pkgs. of coffee to make your own if you wish. There is a complimentary continental breakfast downstairs (near the small but beautifully maintained pool; how big does it need to be for you to rinse the sand off your body?) beginning at 7 am. They have coffee, several flavors of mini muffins, very very good mini croissants, breads, OJ and passion/mango/guava juice which I LOVE. (It is great with rum or vodka; bring a bottle with you and buy a carton of juice at the Food Pantry, a 24-hr. supermarket whose back parking lot is next door to the Aloha Surf. Grab a made-to-order deli sandwich, bottle of wine, beer or booze there too; also sushi to go and fresh fruit. A carton of eggs and some tortillas made the heartier breakfast my son needs and all I needed was one of the small bowls and fork that were provided, and the microwave. I had a papaya on my balcony every morning before going down for the official ""breakfast"" and they were 79 cents a pound at the Food Pantry.)During my stay I needed to email my airline and started to use the pay-for-use computer in the corner; the hotel lobby staff stopped me and warned me how inconsistently it worked. They directed me right across the street to an internet cafe where, for the $2 a Starbucks bottled cappucino cost, I got free use of the internet. There was safe in the room; we did not use it and did not get charged for it. Like every place, you had to sign a waiver. This is just defensive hospitality, it is not unusual.Some general tips for first-time visitors: Do not take the shuttle from the airport; it is the same price as a taxi ride and you have to stop at everyone else's hotel along the way.Take the number 22 or 58 bus for $2 to Diamond Head and hike up to the crater. It costs a buck to get in and $2 for the certificate at the top. Wear good shoes and socks and carry water and a camera and a cellphone so you can call home and leave yourself a message!We never fail to have breakfast at least one morning at the Pacific Beach Hotel, a very short walk from the Aloha Surf. This is the first place we ever stayed in Waikiki because we were attending an academic conference. The hotel is overpriced, we think, but breakfast in the Oceanarium is not to be missed. Go hungry...preferably before your hike up Diamond Head. My husband always wants to visit Duke's Canoe Club for happy hour and I always send folks to Iolani Palace in downtown Waikiki. Be sure to watch the video before your tour. Take your picture next to the statue of Duke. Every Friday night there are fireworks over the water (and there were on Thanksgiving night too) and the second Sunday of every month Waikiki shuts down for a food festival you will not want to miss. Splurge at the bar called House Without A Key; it is at the Halekulani Hotel (one of the most expensive in the world) but at House Without a Key you will enjoy the best Kona coffee, cocktails and coconut shrimp on earth while listening to a Grammy-winning band play Hawaiian tunes and watching Miss Hawaii hula dance. Worth every penny while you watch the sunset over the waves. If you're from the mainland you will wake up early and go to sleep early; do not cheat yourself by trying to acclimate to the time change (unless you're staying a long while, you never will). As soon as you wake up, GET UP; early morning in Waikiki is the best time to walk down the street or down the beach. Wander through the gardens in front of the Royal Hawaiian hotel (the pink one); they are incredible. To conclude about the hotel: If you let anything on this website sway you to stay away, you will be missing out and probably paying too much. We three agreed that is THE place for our next ""family honeymoon"" (that is what we call our vacations) and it is hands-down the choice for our next visit. (Spring break?)

I must say that I was nervous because of some of the reviews I read about this hotel. But I realized quickly that every hotel I researched (a whole lot) had some good reviews and some bad reviews. For starters if you are on a budget (like me) this is a great hotel. My room was clean and decent. It was fine for 2 people. The rooms are small-ish, but I found that to be the case at a lot of the hotels in Honolulu. Some of the complaints I read about in the past I realized were quite anal when I finally saw things for myself, such as: the noise level from the street- ok-there is noise, but this is Waikiki! People are walking, driving and just plain outside all of the time! If street noise bothers you then you should never leave the muffled safety of your house. The prostitutes-ok-well I have never been to a city that didn't have them!, The ""no-frills"" of the hotel-well I went to Oahu to see the island not to sit in my hotel room and contemplate on the thread-count of the sheets. I had a clean room, plenty of fresh, clean towels, a shower, toilet, sink, fridge, tv (which I turned on maybe twice), coffeemaker, safe, and a lanai with a decent view. Continental breakfast was cool, donuts, muffins, croissant, fruit, coffee & juice. A store in the lobby, Foodland next door(grocerystore), Zippy's, Burger King, Pizza Hut all within 1-2 blocks,ABC store on the corner, and best of all a short walk to the beach and all the shops! I came on a hotel budget-meaning I would rather spend my money shopping, dinner, clubbing, sightseeing and fun stuff, than spending it on a grossly overpriced room that I pretty much only plan to sleep and shower in, like most everyone, I just need it to be clean and safe! I had a wonderful time and I would stay at this hotel again. If you need to surround your self in luxury for the 8-10 hours your eyes are closed at night, go to the Hyatt or somewhere else ridiculously priced like that. (what? are the towels fluffier?your just drying off, relax)The staff was nice and courteous also. Had a good time and I am going back in February. Can't wait. (I did stay away from the Parrot guy tho, thanks to all the tips on that here, I saw him harangue a lot of people)","Rochester, NY",10,5.0

The rooms a fairly small but you won't want to spend too much time there anyways. The pool is a joke, but who goes to Hawaii and swims in a pool? The rates are pretty good and the room I had a balcony with a great view, cable tv, great air conditioning, a safe, a microwave and a fridge.

The headboards for the bed need to be bolted either to the beds or to the wall. Every time any one in the next room made any kind of movements on the bed the headboard would bang up against the wall waking me up. Also I do not know when they last cleaned the filter in the air conditioner it was filthy.

While the outside and lobby appear aesthetically pleasing, the rooms themselves (at least the one we had) were shabby. Why was Waikiki built with so much cinderblock? Admittedly, we booked a short time ahead and got a budget class room but that shouldn't mean an experience that's shortchanged. We got what I am sure was their dumpiest room on the 3rd floor that had 2 Murphy beds and a carpet whose color reminded me of baby puke. The bathroom was microscopic. Other negatives: parking was 10.00 a day in slots so narrow it took a shoehorn to squeeze into, street noise, flimsy louvred windows, a pathetic pool and THE LONGEST WAITS for an elevator that I have ever endured. We finally gave up and used the stairs....probably a good thing as the exercise would do one good. Positives: a grocery store right next door, easy access to H-1 and plentiful variety of restaurants along Kuhio. If you stay here, caveat emptor! You can do better for your hard earned dollar.","Portland, Oregon, USA",138,2.0

Carla here~~> ""Should you find yourself staying here, I hope you find all the Aloha many of us happy guests at, ""The Aston Aloha Surf"" have"" ;-) ... It was by mistake we ended up staying at the ""Aston Aloha Surf"", but one I would surely do again...Where I wanted to stay was all booked, well into August...I was scrambling for a place, at the last hours...I researched and researched, but wasn't finding anything, and then I ran across one of the best mistakes I have yet made! ;-) Upon our arrival, we were greeted by a real sweet man (sorry I have forgotten your name) (Lance)? You were so sweet and had a country-mile-wide smile; you let me check out 3 different rooms, before I made up my mind ;-) Our room was more than I expected after reading the many negative comments about ""The Aston Aloha Surf"" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~We stayed in room 801 05/19/04, and sadly left May 28, 04 ;-( ... I almost questioned myself about noise levels (It was almost too quiet) -- Having lived on Kuhio Ave. in 1982 (2465 Kuhio), I had expected there might be some noise...After a long flight from Sioux City, Iowa via Minneapolis (8 plus hours) ~~> I was quite pleased to stand in a hot shower for a good 20 minutes at least~~Each morning I had a great shower, as well as a few at night...(loved the water pressure~~That is very important to me, since I love hard pounding water, and soft flowing, too--one can get several flows from the shower head--which was real nice) ... My honey loved his showers, as well ;-) We smelled only our sweet lei's for the first few nights, and then, had our candle going when in our room and getting comfy, after many fun long days and romantic evenings, of enjoying beautiful Oahu ;-) My honey still has his first packet of Kona coffee we received the first day (we are saving it)...I brought coffee along (which we never even used--IMO, A good hint for guests who don't want to buy coffee while there (after the first night) at the wonderful ""Aston Aloha Surf"" ;-) It is true the kitchenette is very small, but we didn't really need it, with ""Perry's Smorgasbord"" just a good softball throw, (or maybe that's a Sammy home-run) towards the Ocean, from the front steps of the ""Aston Aloha Surf."" (""Perry's"", Very reasonably priced, tasty, and a pleasant atmosphere--Waterfalls, candles, etc.) 9.95 for Dinner or Supper as Ken calls it...I challenge anyone to say that they can't get enough filling food or find something very tasty there--in other words, ""Perry's"" gets a 4 from this ole gal;-) The hotel staff was more than accommodating during our stay. One night I did laundry well into the wee hours; The laundry area (which is in the basement) is opened 24 hours and one uses a key to enter the small tidy area, making it a relatively safe place to do laundry late at night, or in the wee hours of the morning--There's 2 W machines and 2 dryers, I believe--Both 1.25 to use--I suggest going to (""The Grocery Outlet"" 1199 Dillingham Blvd) which sells frozen and canned foods as well as housewares, health and beauty care products, and other such items--yet, not in bulk like other discount stores, but individual sizing, etc. -- And, there's (""Price Busters"" 1505 Dillingham Blvd) too, for checking out reasonable prices for your laundry soap (I bought a bottle for 1.00 and left most of it in the room ;-) -- I brought along fabric softener sheets to keep our luggage smelling fresh, and for laundry I anticipated might need to be done...""The Grocery Outlet"" would be for checking out the reasonable prices for food (if you plan to use your kitchenette) --- There's also a store not far from ""The Grocery Outlet"" that has a 10 dollar annual fee, with many great buys...Can't think of the name of it, but ask a local, they'll tell you where it is ... Another tip: Instead of buying block ice for days you may plan to spend a day at another beach or another area on the island, freeze an empty juice or milk carton, and that will work well in your ice chest, it's less messy, and will leave you with cold water, should that become necessary ;-) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the wee hours of doing laundry, I had a great conversation with the neatest lady. (Nikki, thank you so much for putting up with me, and turning me on to Hawaii's (""IZ of Hawaii"") Your Aloha spirit will live with me always! ... I know I have spelled your name incorrectly, but you know I know, you are one special lady!!! I do hope you enjoy the little song thing I put together for you on my webpage about your most wonderful hotel and excellent hospitality from the whole hotel Staff! ;-) Mahalo!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~We had no problem at all with our air conditioner--Kept it at 60 degrees and actually had to turn it off a couple times ;-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Many have remarked about about how small the rooms are at ""The Aston Aloha Surf"" ... Ken and I are not newlyweds~~> However, being in a smallish room (not that small--if you know Waikiki) We felt like newlyweds, I must say, ;-) ... We never used the pool; (I did look at it one morning after our daily free continental breakfast, and the pool looked very clean and inviting) We were lucky to hit the beach just one day the whole duration (went to Kailua Bay Beach--A very pretty beach--check it out, is my suggestion) ... We were too busy driving around the Island; I had to show Ken the ""Leeward"" side where I lived in Nanakuli, Makaha, and things from the past, that most tours won't take you to or show you ;-) If you are renting a car-the garage is easy to get in and out of, we never had any problems, and we were in a Grand-Am, -- true the parking is 8.00 a day but that is also true for most of Waikiki--and many hotels costs more than 8.00...Renting a car one can check out the Leeward side, all the way to the last beach (As far as one can go--just a little past that) IMO, The Leeward Side is not only interesting, but has some of the prettier beaches IMO, and there is an excellent golf course in Makaha Valley...There's also an interesting cave almost at the end of that side, with a marker across the street that explains a little about the cave ;-) ... That cave saved my life back in 1982--Long story ... I was real happy to read the marker that is now across the street; I now believe I know why the cave was my protector way back when...There's a lot of interesting history all throughout Oahu, ancient folklore, taboo's etc. --- Locals are happy to talk about such things if you ask them ;-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~One night while walking down the main street ---The one by the beach--We were lucky to watch a man with beautiful McCaw's, and a beautiful young lady holding 4 or 5 of them; maybe it was 6 very colorful birds...Ken held a brilliant green one, which fell asleep on his finger ;-) ... The fascinating experience found me chatting with a very nice couple...Strangely, the man knew my ex--The friendly tourist worked for World Airways when World Airways was still in Oakland, Ca. (My ex was W. A. Stores Super/they knew one another because of that)... That couple had to leave in the morning; I sure enjoyed talking with them, and talking about Bob. Bob is with God now (1991)...That was really neat crossing their path and sharing our journeys! That is something that is really neat about Oahu, IMO--All the people one meets, all the journeys traveled, and shared ;-) Many fine people shared their wonderful experiences with us, with respect to the ""Aston Aloha Surf"" and other things Oahu~~Belle, if you ever read this, it was a real pleasure meeting another happy guest from ""The Aston Aloha Surf""--Hope you made it to the airport on time! ;-) For all of you lucky enough to stay in room 801, as you well know, it does in fact face the street~~> We never heard any noises that woke us up or disturbed us. I had no clue the walls are ""hear through walls""; hope we didn't offend anyone, hehe ;-0 ... We would definitely stay again! IMO, Spend the extra money one would have to spend (for a room on the beach, or across the street from the beach) to enjoy lasting heartprints you'll cherish always, is my thinking! ;-) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~We never waited 15 minutes for either elevator--There are two, that is true...Actually, when they were a little slow (which wasn't very often) we'd get in an extra kiss, breather, or remember something we may have forgotten had we been rushing. In Hawaii, ""Take it Easy, Enjoy, Hang Lose"" ... That's my thinking ;-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I would like to suggest something to any family of 4...Where I was going to stay is a real decent place IMO, and has plenty of room for a family of 4, IMO...It varies on the price, but averages around 600. for a week per suite (different people own units in the Condo) There are several webpage's on this particular Condo. However, They are booked well in advance, I learned! I have stayed there (past tense) with my Mother and a young lady (friend) ... Each unit has it's own full kitchen/dishwasher/full frige/W&D/FREE parking/many things not at the Aloha Surf; The units IMO, are great for a family, or guests who like to stay in (more or less) or cook, etc. ... You will not find the Aloha Spirit there that you find at The Aloha Surf, unless it's different now, and or you totally make your own/That's always a good possibility, too ;-)...There is a guard at the front desk area (A very small area) They have a nice pool, and barbecue area, if it's still the same as in 98 or 99...I have omitted the name so as to not break any guidelines with this write-up~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I did LOL about the curtains at ""The Aston Aloha Surf""...I noticed that ours gave us a light show, hehe ... But, like I told Ken, ""If I was going to stay in during the day, why be in Hawaii on vacation?"" ;-)...It just added to the sweet uniqueness of the Aloha Surf--When I did notice the peculiar light show (one early morning, I realized I wasting time sleeping ;-) ... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~We had a wonderful stay at the ""Aston Aloha Surf"" ... Great people and I have only Mahalo's for all of our hosts and the excellent staff, etc. ... I only wish it was longer! The thing we liked most about the Aloha Surf is the such happy-go-lucky smiling hosts, ~~ Location, location, (Close to the beach, restaurants, shopping, excitement, etc.) ~~ and the continental breakfast hits the spot for coffee, juice, muffins, toast, etc. (I only went twice; Ken went every morning/I'm a night owl--too early for me-7-9 AM?)...There at The Aston Aloha Surf lives a special feeling of true Aloha in the air!--It is a pleasant motel for the money, no doubt! ... If you are going to be driven anywhere, rent a car (which I highly recommend as previously noted) ... The reason I highly recommend driving yourself, are at least two fold...""The Bus"" is slow, and impersonal, and it doesn't go to some of the more remarkable places, like the last beach on the ""Leeward"" side...I think ""The Bus"" only goes as far as Makaha Valley Plantation--I could be mistaken, too...I know it takes a long time to get there via ""The Bus""...The bus is slow, oftentimes very crowded, and at best, it's difficult to take along all the things one might want to take for a daily discovery adventure, such as beach wear, ice chests, etc., not to mention any shopping one might do (finding treasures along the highways and byways of beautiful Oahu ;-) And, if you are a smoker, why put yourself through all that, too? ;-)Anyway, Try driving out of a Beach front Motel parking place to go somewhere on/from Kalakaua Avenue, (if you find a parking space--and forget what it will cost per night to park--much more than the ""Aloha Surf"")---<eeks> ... And, if you are out of shape like we are, try walking to ""Kuhio Beach"" from a hotel on the end of the beach where it begins from the Ala Moana End--where many of the more expensive hotels are ;-) (Kuhio Beach, being the beach I prefer--it's better for swimming, and watching the young ones catch a wave, etc., IMO)... I could write and write why the ""Aloha Surf"" is one of the better places to stay for a short stay, IMO, but this is plenty long...I will be updating my noncommercial webpage soon (personal page about my experience at ""The Aston Aloha Surf"")... More tips, etc. -- Keep in mind, ""To each his or her own"" ... I think we all have different reasons and taste, so who am I to say that one might be a happy or unhappy guest if one stays at ""The Aston Aloha Surf""--I think it is sad to NOT just enjoy and be happy to be in paradise!!! ;-) Mahalo!Thanks again Nikki, for making our Stay even more special than it already was...I love listening to Hawaii's ""IZ of Hawaii"" ... You were right!!! For anyone reading this, If you like my ""Aloha Surf"" personal noncommercial webpage, you'll love and feel the Aloha Spirit at ""The Aston Aloha Surf"" ;-) I would love for you to sign the guest book on my webpage, if you stayed at the Aston Aloha Surf~~>Especially, if you stayed in room 801...Or just sign it if you stayed in Oahu or want to, etc. ;-)In Wyoming (several years ago), this motel had a guest book in the room (one in each room) and called them a dream book--I thought that was so neat! It was real interesting to read where people were from, their travels/journey, and what was on their mind, etc. ... I believe that is what I love most about the ""Concrete Jungle of Ohau""--One gets to meet and mingle with folk from all over the world, everyday, and everyday it's someone different, usually. Ha! -- Though it's a mass of concrete, it's always alive with all of our dreams, and the Aloha in the air, if we just look for it, and do it, IMO--Which IMO, is all found at ""The Aston Aloha Surf"" ;-) Oh, and the weather--that's just an added bonus!!!""IZ of Hawaii"" says it all, ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What a Wonderful World""...Mahalo to all at The Aloha Surf!!!I would list my URL listed but maybe that would cause my write-up to be unacceptable? I just don't know, so I won't put it in this write-up ... Sincerely,Ken & Carla, Very happy guests of ""The Aston Aloha Surf"" ;-)PS Don't forget to pack your daily delivered newspaper to your room, in your luggage--I'm still reading my nine newspapers ;-)Aloha and Mahalo! ;-)","Sioux City, Iowa",7,5.0

They allowed me to retain this room for both nights of my stay, while charging me only for the standard room rate. Ahhh, Aloha at work already! Yes, even the junior suite was small, especially when compared to the other major hotel chains. And yes, the noise from the garbage trucks was clearly audible up on the 16th floor - but keep in mind that this is a common complaint that applies to nearly all of the non-beachfront hotels in Oahu! I found the hotel staff (receptionists, maintainance workers, and room attendants) to be quite friendly and helpful - they even suggested (local, inexpensive) places to shop to avoid being ""gouged.""

The way I look at it is that if you are an extremely picky person you will not like it, but if you are not so critical you will find it okay.The higher floor you get the better, we stayed on the 15th floor where the noise is not so loud up there but you can still hear music and noise from people partying all night. The music was not loud everyday during our stay, it was particularly louder during Christmas Eve and Christmas. I was not impressed with the continental breakfast and decided to skip it a few times. The beach is very close only 3 blocks from the hotel, the grocery store is next to the hotel and the Intl. Marketplace is about 4 blocks from the hotel so we didn't have to drive to get something from the store or to shop for souvenirs. There are many choices of places to eat around the hotel from sit down restaurants to fast food places. Overall this hotel was ok for the price.Aloha","Indio, CA",3,3.0

As previously posted, the garbagemen were out collecting refuge in the early hours of the morning. According to other guests that we spoke with, we were very fortunate to be on the 11th floor as the noise from the partiers on the streets at night was disturbing. The smell outside of the hotel was GROSS...it smelled like rotting something ALL THE TIME!!! The hotel gives you one package of coffee for your first day and after that you have to buy the packages. The rooms were clean, however the kitchenette in the deluxe rooms are a joke! The countertop was peeling and very very small! The hotel staff were not one bit accomodating to our very late departure from Honolulu. We asked for a later checkout, but were told that we had to pay for an extra day if we wanted to have the room after 12p.m.Bottom line here is that you get what you pay for....","Edmonton, AB",3,2.0

My room was clean but small. One other problem was that the air conditioner really did not work too well. Thank goodness it was peak summer.I'd recommend this hotel for the following types of travelers:1) College students who have some free time in the summer and want to get away without paying a lot of money. No frills come with this hotel, but for me, cleanliness is the most important thing, and this place has it (at least in my room). Our room rate was only $69/night for a double.2) People who want to be in Waikiki and are only looking for a clean hotel, but not necessarily one close to the beach. (This hotel is not within easy walking distance to the beach even though it is not geographically far from the ocean.) Staying at this hotel will allow the traveler to not spend a lot on lodgings and can put the money saved toward other things.-Mondetraveler","Los Angeles, CA",3,3.0

This was our first trip to Hawaii and were planning on seeing paradise. But Waikiki was everything but paradise. So if you are looking for quiet away from every day city life stay out of the Honolulu area. The hotel staff was fabulous! But like most of the other reviews we have read here the rooms were not. The pool was a very sad site. It reminded us of the movie Vacation. It looked very dirty! Be prepaired, the view from any window in this hotel is going to be of high rise apartments with washers and dryers and hanging clothes from every single balcony as far as the eye can see. But if you look straight up you can see the beautiful blue sky. The walls outside the hotel on nearby buildings are ridden with graffiti. Yes it is close to the beach, 3 blocks. And many stores and restaurants close by as well. But every hotel has that. Our first room which we spent a whole 10 minutes in was so small that when we got our 4 bags of luggage in it we had to clime over the bed to get to the door! The bathroom was so small you could touch all 4 walls without even moving. We were lucky enough to get a 2 level upgrade. Unfortunately the room smelled like someone had a college party in it the night before! We went out and bought insensce to help. This wasn't something we even expected to have to deal with on our paradise honeymoon. But it was the only alternative and it was quite a bit bigger with a sofa area and small kitchenette equiped with a microwave and fridge. The staff was great and when they found out it was our honeymoon they sent up a bottle of Champagne and a box of Chocolate covered Macadamia nuts. This hotel was so bad we decided to leave the do not disturb sign on the door all day while we were out becuase we didn't want anyone touching our stuff. We may have been a little over paranoid but better safe than sorry. Thank God we were only there 2 nights. BEWARE!!! If a man walking on Waikiki beach asks you if you want your picture taken with his parrot. RUN! He assaulted me! Our first day in Paradise was not even close! But everything got much better after that day.","Minneapolis, MN",2,1.0

(Thank you, Travel Agent!) Yes, the staff was friendly and helpful, but that hardly makes up for being waken at 7:00 a.m. every morning to the sounds of the Honolulu Waste Disposal department trucks taking trash away from all of the establishments on the street. If you are unlucky, as we were, to get a room facing the street, then you will find out exactly what I mean. The noise was incredible. The rooms, especially the windows, were not soundproof at all. Many of the room features are outdated. I would never stay here again. Spend the extra money to stay somewhere else, and make your entire vacation a positively memorable one.","Reston, VA",1,1.0

You have got to try the Ahi Steak Sandwich at Chili's which is near the hotel. There is a grocery store next door to the hotel. The bathrooms in the rooms are very small with out of date fixtures, but I uess the price of the hotel makes up for this inconvenience.

Room was small, but very clean. Staff was friendly and responded quickly to a problem I had with the safe. Parking is a problem. They only have 36 parking spaces and 200 rooms. Everytime we went somewhere, we did not know if we had a parking space or not. If no spaces are available at the Surf, you can park right next door in the Food Pantry parking lot. Fee is $7.00 if you park after 6:00PM. If you are looking for a clean room that does not cost much, then this is the right place for you. There are a few ""ladies of the night"" in the area, but they never presented a problem and I never did see one of the ""working girls"" around the Aloha Surf. I would stay at the Aloha Surf again.

Upon check in 2 hours early, was given a free room upgrade from a standard to deluxe without even asking. The room was on the 8th floor, and though small, had two double beds, and a futon(pull out bed). The bathroom and sink area were very clean, and the view from the lanai was beautiful. I was more than pleased with the room after reading some of the reviews on this hotel. The staff was friendly, and I drank the coffee supplied to my room every day, and didn't have to pay extra for it. The lobby was beautiful, and open aired, and the continental breakfast was OK. The best part of the trip was that everywhere we went the people remembered us from our last visit in March(see review Ohana East Hotel). For those coming to Hawaii in the near future, there is no city transportation att. The BUS is currently on strike and has been for over three weeks and there is no end to the strike in sight for the forseeable future, so if you come you better know the Hawaiian directions because there is no I repeat no North, South, East or West, nor will anyone use those words, and I will not give you the Hawaiian words. If you want to learn these words buy a Fodor's or Frommer's to learn them and I guarantee, with no bus transportation, you will definitely need to know them. I guarantee you will not want to use the Waikiki Trolley at 20 dollars a day, so you will be spending a great deal of time hoofing it (taxis are expensive). Because of no citywide transportation, we decided to to to the free breakfast sponsored by Aloha VIP tours. The breakfast was great and we learned that by attending this breakfast we were able to get substantial discounts on the tours that we took. My son won a free luau at Germaine's and I bought my ticket for the luau ( we weren't planning on going to the luau, but I am glad we did). The food and show were great and I would do it again. On Monday, we went on a 2 hour horseback tour of the Kualoa ranch (I won that ticket for two at the breakfast) and the tour was perfect, after that we took the 2 hour ATV tour of the ranch( I bought that tour because my son wanted to ride horses and since we won the horseback tour we did the ATV at the same time for the same price at the tour we won). Both tours took us to where they filmed Godzilla, Mighty Joe Young, George of the Jungle, Tears of the Sun, Jurassic Park and others, we even walked in Godzilla's footprints. On Tuesday we did another circle island tour, this one by Robert's tours of Hawaii, a reverse of the tour we took with E Noa in March. On Tuesday evening we participated in the ""Great Waikiki Beach Endless Summer 2003 Pub Crawl"" where we hit 24 nightclubs in 12 hours. It cost us 35 dollars each but each bar gave is one mixed drink ($4.50) or a beer, your choice. My son had 28 mixed drinks (rum and cokes and one 180 proof tequila and I had 40 mixed drinks 36 rum and cokes 3 blue hawaiis and one fuzzy navel). We started with 63 persons and at 4 in the morning when the crawl ended there were only me my son and two young females from Sacramento standing. The reason we were standing is our martial arts knowledge of the Dim Mac (presure points) which enabled us to move the alcohol from the drinks to various points of our bodies enabling us not to get drunk. My son won 50 dollars of a cop because he bet him that with what we drunk we would come in under the .08 that Hawaii uses to consider a person under the influence. I was .05 and my son was .03, and the amout of drinks we consumed was confirmed by our pub crawl cards that were punched at each pub stop. on Wednesday we took a hikeing tour in the Koolau range near the Pali lookout. The first tour was on the Hono side of the lookout and the 2nd was from the Koolau golf course just below the Pali Lookout to about 150 feet below the lookout a climb of about 1050 feet. I highly recommend this tour through Hawaii echo if you like hiking. We saw the Don Ho show again and it was outstanding, He didn't try to promote his kids as much as last time, but he did show Hoku's new video. He didn't sing one of his normal songs that he always does, and I mentioned this to him and he gave me and my son free tickets to see his show two nights later (Saturday the 13th) and I wound up singing that song along with another song on stage with Mr. Ho., plus receiving every CD that he ever did. We also continued to start our days at 4am by getting up, going to the beach where my son worked out, and I surfed before the beach got crowded, then going back to the hotel about 5:30 to change and eat breakfast and do what we wanted to do before 10. We also did some snorkeling at Hanauma Bay (highly recommended), and lots of shopping at Ala Moana and the IMP. With no bus I do not recommend going to Pearl unless you can get a tour to get you out there by 6:30 so you can get on the first couple of boats out (Good luck), or rent a car. If you get there much after 7, you will probably have a wait of at least 2 to 4 hours just to get a ticket for the boat. I am not trying to scare anyone from coming to the islands, but as I said at the beginning, with no bus transportation around the island, you will need to know the Hawaiian directions because they will not use N S E W nor can you get them to say those words. They also use those words on the news and for the weather reports, also be prepared for major traffic backups if you rent a car, no bus means everyone is driving to the city. Good luck on your trip to the islands and I hope this helps somebody out. The reason I mentioned Fodor's and Frommer's is because If you buy one of these books at least you will learn the directions and not get lost, and you will also learn a little about your hotel before you get there.

Beds were not very comfortable and pullout was so we hard got a backache from sleeping on it. Also I would not advise anyone with a car rental to stay here. When we checked in on Saturday I was told there were no spaces available in their lot till Monday even with $8 a day parking fee. I was told I could have the first available parking space on Monday. Had to get up at 6 A.M. Monday and drive around for an hour and a half till one was available to avoid paying twice at the lot next door as they charge a day fee and a night fee.

There was noise, but c'mon -- you're in a hotel. (Travel with earplugs and it won't be a problem.) The staff was courteous and helpful: They made phone calls and reservations for me, stowed my bags and gave me in-and-out privileges from 6:30 AM until I finally for the airport at 8 PM. I wouldn't book my honeymoon there, but when the object is hanging out in Waikiki, you can't beat it.

It was below our expectations. The front staff (Helena) was very courteous and helpful, but the rooms and amenities left a lot to be desired. Our room had moth eaten curtains, that the sun shined through all day, windows that wouldn't shut all the way, with no handles to shut them. Our bathroom had an old hanging bowl sink with a big crack running through it, with no counter space at all, and a shower that only trickled water. The pool was only slightly larger than my hot tub, with warn, shredded and missing carpeting all around it, with chipped concrete and paint. That is, when it was even open. If I owned the hotel, I would have been embarrassed. The parking lot spaces were so close that I had to let everyone either in or out before I slide it into the space. I could barely get my door open to get in or out. There was only one elevator, so we wasted a lot of time waiting for it everyday. All in all, we wished we would have known all this is advance. We would have spent the extra money to stay at a better place. We really didn't think that travel agents booked places like this, if they actually seen them or stayed there themselves. For now on in our minds, Aston hotels will be place we remember to avoid.","Pittsburgh, PA",4,2.0

(Ohana East's cheapest rooms usually start around $92/night.)They apoligized relentlessly, gave us a free box of chocolate covered nuts, and arranged for a cab--fully paid for and tipped by them of course--to take us to our new location which was a block closer to the beach.It was a great deal since I had booked for a Studio Deluxe via Expedia, for an average of $64.50/night, and had received a similiar room at the Ohana East which had a great view of the city and hills. Unfortunately, their customer service wasn't as good as the Aloha Surf. (Read my Ohana East review for more info.)Though I didn't stay a single night at the Aloha Surf I would book with the them again in a heartbeat based on their great customer service. Their lobby also has a very laid back, un-hotelish feel to it and since the Ohana East didn't offer free continental breakfast they offered us the option to come back anytime during our stay to eat theirs. I also love their location since its slightly off one of the main streets (though still close to the beach) which will reduce the noise of traffic and pedestrians at night and in the early morning while trying to get some sleep. All in all it was a great first impression and I'm looking forward to staying with them the next time I visit Waikiki.","Los Angeles, CA",18,4.0
