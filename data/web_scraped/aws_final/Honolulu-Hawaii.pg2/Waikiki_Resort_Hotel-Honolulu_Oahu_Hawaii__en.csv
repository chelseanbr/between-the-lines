He directed me to the bellhop who was very surly taking my bags. On return the female front desk staff member checking me in was plain rude. I requested my luggage be taken to my room and this bellhop was a lot nicer and offered some great tips on local things to see and do in the area. The other standout was your housekeepers. They were always friendly and did a great job servicing the room. The breakfast was worthwhile if included. The pool was freezing and not usable.

At first I was super excited- had booked a king size bed with what seem like a whole other room with a pull out bed. Two decent size TVs in each room. And the free dvd service is an interesting touch. I even had 2 lanais.What they absolutely lost me was their bathroom. It does not match up with the feel of the “resort”. The sink is the cheapest and smallest sink you can buy that is only meant for washing your hands. The mirrors are awkward and faces each other but not you. There is virtually no counter space! What kind of bathroom is this? They could have easily taken some space from the extra room to make a bigger bathroom.Oh and so the hotel room also has a kitchenette with a sink. Brilliant me thought to myself, let me use the sink there instead (because I felt like I was going to bash my head on the sink whenever I wash my face or brush my teeth). The kitchenette’s sink doesn’t even turn on the correct way! I took a video to demonstrate the awkward way to turn the faucet on.After 3 days I couldn’t stand the sink situations and asked the front desk on a Thursday if I could change my room. The woman responded that they are fully booked (ok I can understand that) but also “all the bathrooms are the same. I can try to get you another room but the sink is the same”. I told her I saw the website, that is not true. But she insisted and said she will look into it but I highly doubt it. I can’t wait to get the hell out of here. All the amazing reviews here may be true but was not my experience. There are pros and cons but the bathroom is too big of a con for me.

I was surprised that I was upgraded to the nicer corner room with an amazing view of the ocean. I realized that other oceanview rooms may not have as nice of view as mine because of the high rises blocking some of the rooms. I was high enough to see above and peak between 2 buildings. The hotel was situation about a block from the beach which made it nicer than the hotel where the conference was held. The room came with a free DVD rental from downstairs (DVD Now). I didn't frequent the restaurants in the hotel, but I also got discounts for those as well as for in-hotel car rental. I was really close to so many nice restaurants that I hit Morimoto on my first night and concluded my trip with Momosan (should've tried here more!). These were few minutes walking distance. I was near everything! I was close enough to Queen's beach for morning yoga sessions. The room was so spacious that I was able to do morning yoga in my room while looking at the ocean from the balcony. I wish I could've heard the waves, but I think that's impossible in Waikiki with so much traffic and people. The staff was pleasant, and I had daily housekeeping. The room had a fridge and microwave which made my life super easy. I checked out the pool, but I really loved hitting the beach.","Santa Clara, California",14,5.0

The reason it wasn't a notch higher is the fact that 1- the shower doesn't have hold bars in it and 2- you only had two elevators working which caused several long back-ups.

Nancy at the desk was wonderful and very helpful. They have 2 places to eat in the hotel one is a basic breakfast lunch and a Koren place that was very good, and bar that serves small plates. They also have Massage Spa too! We did the Pearl Harbor Tour of the Arizona and it was great! We loved the tour guide as he was fun and very knowledgeable. I learned a lot about the history of Hawaii which was cool! However, there are a few things that need to be addressed, There towel system is the pits! You must go down to the basement to get and return towels which is a pain especially if have with knee injuries, as i do. I suggested they put a hamper near the stairs to return towels so you are not going up & down. I forgot to get our towels a few times because it out of sight and had to go all the way back to the hotel to get them. On our last day I took the towel from the room so I did not have to go back and forth. Worked great! The other issue we endured as my husband has back pain now and cannot walk very well. They are not well equipped to cater to the unimpaired or handicapped. There was not one holding bar anywhere in the bathroom and my husband feel in the tub because there was nothing to hold to & he broke a few of the plastic shower curtain hooks and the towel rack because there was nothing to grab. They were very good about as I did report the issue and they fixed those items right away with any hassle. Another thing is the toilet was too low and hard to stand especially with anyone with a disability, & the door was so close to the toilet you could not open the door inward, you can only close it all the way unless you are using it. Poor designing there. The pool are is nice & they have nice loungers, but the water is SO cold you cannot stay in too long and they have no spa tub. The sun does not hit the pool til like noon as the building block it until it comes up. Also beware you must pay to use the chairs & umbrellas on the beach. 2 lounge chairs and umbrella will set you back back $60 bucks! Way too expensive if you ask me. We did it the first day but when I went by myself I asked for one chair only they charged me $25.00. They next time I went it was $20.00......then $15.00 as I only stated 1/2 day only. But they guys there are very professional and nice. Other than that a Lovey place to stay!","Las Vegas, Nevada",6,4.0

The room istelf had a decnt amount of space, but it was evident the room photos on the hotel's main website are somewhat dated and the rooms have aged to some degree. They are, however, kept clean. The beds were smaller than they looked on the website also. Not much comfort or room if sleeping two to a bed. The shower/bathing area is also quite small. Nonetheless, the hotel does have its charms. Its proximity to the beach, nearby restaurants and shops; as well as being along all the major buslines, certainly helps its case. It does have a nice library of movies to rent at no charge to guests, as well as offering to lend boogie boards, beach towels, accessories, etc. at no charge.

Yes this hotel isn’t as modern and flashy as some of the hotels, would say it need a freshen up with light colours on the room walls rather than the yellows they tend to use. Couldn’t fault the cleanliness at any time of the rooms they were spotlessly clean daily. Pool area was excellent but maybe they could do with some music playing for atmosphere. The location you couldn’t fault everything easily accessible and close to the trolley and bus stops. Only one drawback we found on the 12th floor was when the wind blew the patio doors rattled and banged ended up putting a leaflet in the door to stop it. The wi-fi well yes it is frustrating at times when you can’t get on it and it is slow at times.

It was an accumulation of little things that we experienced that will not encourage us to return or to recommend it for the money we paid. Firstly, the bathroom had a half size bathtub with the shower, normally a deal breaker right there as I will often struggle to get in and out of it because I’m not tall. To add to that the grout was mostly brown and needed a good scrub. The safe was too high for me to see what was in it. The quality of the food for breakfast offered was ordinary. Lastly, and this is something trivial I know but we had read that kettles were available for tea and coffee which we hadn’t had at American hotels before. A new kettle arrived which was great but they only supply 1 bag of green tea and earl grey tea. So I asked for black tea and was told no that’s it. We are very spoilt in Australian hotels where we have a selection of teas, instant coffee, sugar etc even real cups and spoons.

For this trip in August we chose the Waikiki Resort Hotel to be closer to the beach & for better views; We assumed that accommodations would be similar. There is NO comparison. The Waikiki Resort rooms pictured are EXTREMELY enhanced and this place is maybe a 1 Star at best and very misrepresented in its advertising. The curb appeal of the property says “vintage” but at a closer look vintage begins to look more like significantly aged and in desperate need of an update & repair. The hallways are dingy, poorly lit, excessively humid, noisy, and brimming with various pungent odors. Yes, the halls are open-air exposed at the ends but the air within them is not circulating at all.  As for the guest rooms. the door exteriors are scuffed with black marks and dirty. The interior carpet is vacuumed and the bed neatly made but the carpet, headboards, bedspreads, wallpaper & most of the other decor is circa 1970’s, extremely “weathered” & very well worn in appearance while screaming I contain 50 years of dust mite debris. Our room view was even better than we expected but unfortunately the hotel ventilation and extreme humidity problems go beyond the hallways and are a significant concern throughout the building; especially in the guest rooms. The air handling system does not appear to be able to keep up with/control the demands of the island humidity and when viewing the room vents for the air handler (which are also broken & bent) extremely dirty & lack of maintenance to the system is easily visible to the naked eye. Upon entering the bathroom We were surprised (shocked) to see that the original scratched and worn shower basins were in place with the old-time rubber mats to stick in the bottom of the shower (gross) but we were even more appalled to discover black mold on the ceiling. Due to chronic illness black mold exposure will hospitalize 1 of us (me) & completely ruin our trip. Fortunately the staff was EXTREMELY kind and understanding. They attempted to show us another room but the same black mold problem was still there. The staff SINCERELY apologized and asked if there was anyway they could rectify the situation to accommodate us; when we explained that once it is airborne it’s just to big of a risk, especially for a 9 day stay they fully understood & gave us a full refund. As 20% of the population suffers from a genetic weakness causing severe mold toxin illness, anyone who has been through cancer treatment, has other illnesses that has left them with a compromised immune system, or a sufferer of airborne allergies the air quality and age of the living decor absolutely matters! This hotel really needs to update the air handling system, replace room carpeting & eliminate the “grass-textured” wallpaper as these can all readily hold mold spores to regenerate & the age of them also significantly increases allergen issues as a whole.... The property is in a great location but “buyer beware” the Waikiki Resort Hotel is completely unfit to accommodate anyone with a compromised immune system or airborne allergies! Lastly, this week is extremely busy on the island of Oahu, there were literally no rooms the 1st night til I’ll called around and found a cancellation at 7:30pm at night... we almost ended up sleeping in our car! Beyond that they’re were 2 hotel options for the rest of the week at 3 or 4xs the $$$... our budget is blown but our accommodations look like what we expected at the Waikiki Resort Hotel... however it’s called: the MARRIOT!!!","Hollywood, Florida",2,1.0

Check in was quick and easy- however I had called and requested a crib and “quieter” room a few days before. I also confirmed my requests during check in. Neither of my requests were made. We were right next to the elevator and could hear people coming and going through out the night. Regarding the crib, I at first thought maybe they were all out, but I saw a bunch in their storage area so I think they just forgot. Room also did not have a tub, we made do and bathed our son sitting up in the handicap chair. Room was adequate and clean- 2 full size beds, flat screen tv, fridge, safe. Fridge settings did not work, we couldn’t make it colder. Big patio that faced Alohilani hotel and their beautiful infinity pool. Hotel is surrounded by other high rise hotels so I don’t imagine you’ll get much of a view unless you’re at the very top. My biggest gripe about the room- no fan in bathroom, I could see mold growing in various places. There is also a large vent right above you, that I couldn’t help but stare at every time I brushed my teeth, hoping no bugs would come out of it. AC worked fine for us, kept our room cool. Didn’t check out their restaurants but they give you discount coupons for them. Parking was easy. $28 + tax daily. There are 2 lots- one indoor, one outdoor. I can’t recall the exact amount of the resort fee- maybe $21+ tax? Both parking and resort fees combined for a 6 night stay cost us an additional $300. My advice- look into renting a condo if you’re renting a car. Or skip the car rental and just get it for a few days during your stay. You don’t need a car in Waikiki but we like to drive around the island. Location was great and the only reason I’d come back here again, if the price was right. It was less than 5 min walk to the beach, which was perfect for our 14 month old. Walk a short distance to the right and the waves were perfect for our 11 year old. Plenty of food and shopping nearby. The employees we did encounter were all nice, front desk staff were friendly. When I called about our tub and room situation, they informed me they had no available rooms but I could call back in the morning to see what would be available. It was just too much of a hassle however so we just made do with the room we had. ",,1,4.0

Checkin - Is normally at 3pm. We arrived at 11am and asked if we could get our room quicker as we were really tired after a long flight. We were told it would be prioritised. We went for out until 1.30pm, room still not ready. Checked again at 2pm to be told that there was a computer glitch and nobody could be checked in. At 2.30pm we were checked in but they couldn't validate any credit cards so were we had to leave our card with them. We went down about 30 minutes later our card was given back.Room - Ocean view room on the 16th floor. Reasonably good view given that the hotel is one block back from the beach. Bathroom is a bit dated and could do with a bit of TLC. The room was clean, comfortable, housekeeping was great, king size bed was quite comfortable and there was an armchair with a footstool plus a desk and chair. Also a Keurig coffee machine - not the best if you are a tea drinker. Good amount of tv channels, wifi was free and pretty good speed (had to connect to other room's wifi though and sometimes got a message saying it was unsecured so I just switched which room I was connected to).Sleep Quality - We were right by the lift which didn't seem to be noisy, but there was a reasonably constant background noise which affected our sleep. Not sure what caused it - the airconditioner? the lift? the wind outside? Sirens from emergency vehicles are easily heard from the 16th floor and some mornings I could hear the trucks loading/unloading/reversing.Location - great location one block back from the beach, 2 minute walk to the beach, a short walk to Duke's Statue to catch the trolleys and cafes/restaurants, the Zoo is close by.Tour desk - We booked 3 tours through the desk which is run by Expedia. Good service but I think we could have got better deals elsewhere.Pool - Very basic on the second floor, was clean and a good temperature. Pool towels are available in the basement and can be taken to the beach.Laundry - Coin operated washing machines and dryers are in the basement/car park. Cost is $2 per load and change is available from reception. Machines did not wash clothes very well.Eating - Cafe for breakfast and lunch and a restaurant for more formal dinners. Also a food truck in the car park, which does quite nice food. We didn't eat at the hotel.They handled the hurricane threat well & kept us informed.

Every single time I bring my family/friends along, it always ends up being a memorable and eventful time with not one single dull moment for everyone to remember. I had booked a weekend at the Resort and my reservation was obscured in the process and was booked a day before my actual arrival. I arrived on the date not knowing that I did not have a room available for me since the reservation accidentally got pushed back a day. The staff jumped to the situation and helped resolved the problem and was able to rebook me a new room with no charge at all. I must say the short time it took to re-book a room for me was quickly completed within the time it took my family and I to have brunch.The hotel is in an unbeatable area, you are welcome to the pool on the 2nd Floor or take less than 5 minutes to Waikiki Beach to take a dip in the pacific! The location is quite central from a large variety of shopping, restaurants and bars! All of Kalakaua Ave is available to all of your endeavors from shopping at Hawai'i's tiny mom and pop souvenir shops to browsing some of the finest shops in Waikiki! The hotel itself is a wonderful place to stay and the staff really make sure our visits there feel at right at home! Their hospitality make staying there such a welcoming environment for all of their guests to enjoy. Quick to respond to room service requests, very accommodating to many different situations and customer service is just always A+. The cleanliness of the room always exceeds proficiency, the room never has that odd, stale odor that some hotels possess. A great thing about this hotel is it offers many different comfortable and inviting rooms at different affordable rates with the same customer service as a luxury room would. The hotel ranges from many different affordable room rates, featuring their very own array of Waikiki Resort toiletries! These rooms do include In-Room and Lobby high speed internet, as well as a dvd kiosk to borrow at your liking for the entertainment system, we used that to our advantage quite often. The children that travel with us definitely appreciated it when they travel with us. A thousand Mahalo's and Aloha's to the GM Glenn Vergara and family favorite, Brandon, for always creating an ambience filled with Good Vibrations, Aloha Spirit.

So we went out for breakfast and a walk. We then came back to the hotel, and checked again. We were asked to wait. We saw 2 to 3 groups of Koreans checked-in, we saw 2 groups of flight crew checked-in. We saw a small Asian family checked-in. By then it was 2:30pm, we again went to the counter and spoke to a man, Connor. After confronting him, he gave us a key which was already ready to our room.

We arrived late at night & very tired, to find the guy on Reception very helpful. But no-one to help with our luggage and the trolleys all locked up so we couldn't use them. Finally he found someone out the back who helped us with the luggage. The hotel room was large but decor quite dated and the air cond not on when we arrived so we were hot AND tired. However, the bed was very comfortable I have to say. There was a coffee machine but no milk, and only paper cups with a plastic straw to stir, which I felt very poor quality.The bathroom must have been divided up at one stage as there was a large wardrobe area with a safe, washbasin and the fridge (with no cold water or glasses)!! Then the toilet and shower area. The toilet was very low (I have mobility issues) and the step-over shower recess had no hand-rail or anything for safety. The towels were thick and fluffy and the amenities changed daily.What I found odd was that there was no bar in the hotel, & the restaurant was only open for breakfast and lunch and no room service!! There was also a Korean restaurant but that was ""it"". If you wanted anything to eat you had to go outside down the road (not far though)The breakfast was ""OK"" but no choice in eggs (usual scrambled), there was an assortment of hot dishes and Asian dishes plus fruits & salad (???); the coffee very ordinary (and there was plastic sachets of milk on the table). I asked for cream and was told they didn't have any. We had to take some sachets of milk for our in-room coffee machine.They need to add in extra glasses in the room (only 2 small glasses kept in the bathroom); some cold water in the fridge and proper cups with milk left.We would stay again simply for the location and comfy bed but be aware all hotels in Hawaii have added daily taxes plus plus so it was NOT a cheap option really (and car parking another extra if you needed it).

Upon arrival I was informed that there had been an issue with my room and that I was unable to check-in at the time. I had just arrived from mainland US and it was about 11pm. The staff were very apologetic and I was gifted two vouchers for the breakfast buffet. I was also given a room in the hotel next door. So the inconvenience was minimal. The staff did a great job facilitating my check-in of the new hotel and offered their assistance with anything I needed.Upon checking into my the following day, I found the room to be spacious and open with a view of Waikiki Beach. I had booked a corner suite. The room had a king size bed, fold out lounge and kitchenette. The bathroom was old and in need of renovations, everything was outdated. The lighting was poor and there was no curtain on the bathroom window. I was on the 9th floor and it was pretty quiet, the major noise I noticed was from other rooms on my floor, this could not be helped and it didn't bother me. When I checked in I was advised to try and attend the breakfast buffet around 9:30am as this is when most of the guests had already eaten and it would be quieter. As I had a lunchtime flight on the day I left I went to the buffet from breakfast around 7:30am, expecting it to busy. It was, however what was disappointing was that fact there were empty tables for the people waiting, just not enough staff to clear the tables and seat people. If the hotel knows it will be busy why not have extra staff assigned to the dining room. This would have made a 40min wait around 20mins. While this did not have a major impact on me as I was expecting it, it is easily solvable by the hotel.The pool was not much, very simple but the Hotel is a very short walk to the beach and in my opinion one of the better places to stay off the beach in Waikiki. It was value for money and the staff were very friendly. There is a coin laundry downstairs for hotel guest use also. My room also had multiple USB chargers which came in handy.All in all a nice place to stay.","Newcastle, Australia",19,4.0

After all, it was only a place to sleep at night, since we were out and about during the day.Breakfast at Ilima restaurant was good and had a good choice at the buffet. It's included if you book directly with the hotel.Despite several requests for a room on the upper floors, including at the time of booking (numerous months in advance), we were given a room in the lower half of the building. When I book a seat on an airline, I have the opportunity to choose my seat at the time of booking. Obviously, the earlier I book, the better choice of seats I have. I can't wait until hotels start doing the same thing - allowing me to choose the room I want to stay in at the time of booking. As it stands now, it doesn't matter how early you book, you are at the mercy of check-in staff as to which room you are allocated, regardless of how early you book.Overall, this is a reasonable place to stay.

We enjoyed all of our meals for breakfast and lunch that we had at the lobby restaurant(Llima). There wasn't a huge selection but it was adequate and reasonably priced and using the 20% off coupon the hotel gives their guests is a bonus. If they had been open for supper we would have used that option as well because of the prices and convenience. Having never been to Waikiki before we found the restaurant prices and just about everything else very expensive compared to home. Also being there over Christmas made it hard to find a place to eat in Waikiki at night that didn't require a half hour wait or more. The only thing we didn't like is the constant street noise in the room day and night and screaming guests using the pool at the hotel across the street. We are used to double pane windows at home so I imagine most of the problem is from the single pane glass door and window. There is also a metal panel on the other side of the street that bangs twice every time a vehicle goes over it and echoes up into the rooms.

At the last minute, my gut told me to select Waikiki Resort Hotel, and I am glad I did. I had called reservations after I confirmed to request a special room. My wife has been going through recent challenges, and I wanted her to have a great experience, it being her first time in Oahu. They told me they would work to honor the request, but couldn't gaurantee. Understood. It was just a request.Lo and behold, when we checked in, they were able to accommodate my request! David was fantastic. He checked us in, was not only efficient, but worked to build a relationship. He was not only a great ambassador for the hotel, but for Hawaii in general. He also recommended two great places to eat and made adjustments to our reservation seamlessly, as we were able to extend our stay for a day. We didn't have to change our room, and got a better value than we would have changing hotels. He is a true hospitality professional.The hotel is in a great location, central to all things by the beach and is accessible to everything you'd want to do within a short walking distance. This hotel, in essence, is a renovated motel, but the service is well worth it when you combine the price. It is a great, great value.It would have received 5 stars but the concierge was a touch rude (supposedly set up a dinner reservation for us that was non-existent when we arrived. It was suspicious mainly because she unnecessarily cautioned us about not honoring the reservation we requested) and the young lady running breakfast was very efficient, but not super friendly (side note...if you have breakfast vouchers, tell her ahead of time or you will get scolded). These small instances were not enough derail our positive feelings regarding the hotel, David, and the team. I am a 15 year veteran of the hospitality field and was a corporate trainer for luxury hotels. I currently run my own hospitality and service consulting firm. Genuine hospitality is not easy to come by, and I am pretty adept and knowing the difference. You will find it here at Waikiki Resort Hotel. They care whether you really are enjoying your experience.

My flight from Japan came in early, and staff managed to get me the room before ordinary check-in.The building has some mid 20th century charm, but everything is well maintained, and there are the contemporary electronics and an OK wifi set up. Basically, everything you need for staying short term. The location is great; however, you should know that later developments built up around the hotel, which obstruct what must have outstanding views at one time. (I didn't mind, since I don't stay in a place to be sitting all the time in a hotel room.) I know a downstairs restaurant is sometimes important, but the one available was a little too crowded for me with tourists who seemed to be on a package. Also, Waikiki, like many southern Japanese cities, are magnets for Far East Asian tourists, and sometimes I feel there can be cultural misunderstandings when they are staying with someone who is not also on whatever group they are with.Location is really good, it's just one block north of the main avenue, and three beaches are within close walking distance. There is also a supermarket about 8 minutes away on foot, if you are gluten-free or don't eat restaurant food.Sequels are never quite the original, but I would definitely stay at Waikiki Resort, just for the great service and atmosphere.(P.S. the hotel across the way had some construction going on, which may be noticeable depending on what side of the hotel you are on. I noticed it, but it was not a nuisance.)",,31,5.0

Always welcoming and friendly staff. If you're looking for a reasonably priced stay in a prime location just a block black from the boulevard this is ideal. I like the retro feel of the hotel decor - some may call it dated but I think it adds character. Room was always clean and when I asked to be moved room as we were in a twin Scott at the front desk was very accommodating and sorted it out straight away. I wouldn't pay extra for an ocean view as the hotel is dwarfed by larger structures on every side. Beds are great and rooms have all major amenities. Our room this time didn't have a bath but some of them do. Worth noting if this is important to you. Liked the addition of the DVD rental. Perfect if it's raining! All brand new releases. Nice touch. There's a convenience store in the hotel with everything you need and of course an ABC store in every corner. We've never dined at the restaurant but there's so much more in close vicinity you don't need the hotel to provide you with this. Some investment could be made at the pool area. It's always been empty every time we've stayed. Yes the ocean is just a stones throw away but it would be great to have a place to grab a cocktail in the veranda. The general area looks quite run down. Even something as simple as upgrading the sun loungers would make a big difference so as it's not wasted space. Not a big issue for us though - just an idea!We are repeat visitors so it would be nice if breakfast was offered as an incentive to book again. Buffet on offer was a perfect mix of Asian and Western cuisine. I think this hotel is owned by Korean airlines so you'll see lots of their staff staying. Would book again. Always a pleasant stay and location is a winner. Also worthwhile to note that MacDonalds is right on the block in front - Waikiki is expensive so it's nice to be able to pop in before a bus trip for something reasonably priced. ,,17,4.0

One only has to walk out the front entrance and two or three minutes later you will hit the beach!Stayed for two weeks with family.From this end of the Waikiki beach strip you have to swim out a bit before you see the beautiful Diamond Head. Alternatively, it's about five or ten minutes walk along the beach (towards the Royal Hawaiian Hotel) before you can see Diamond Head from the shore. At this end there were some cute schools of fishes in ankle-deep to waist-deep water (I saw about four different kinds). No waves at this end, so good for the kiddies, oldies, or just the super relaxed. The less good: there's not a lot of restaurant variety in close proximity, other than Eggs N Things, McDonalds, Burger King and takeaway places. It was difficult to find half-way healthy food without having to walk at least twenty minutes or more along the main strip. However, the Korean restaurant at the hotel was great. Hotel breakfast buffet was pretty standard - no complaints. Overall we were happy with our city view floor on level 17. Alas, at this stage of my life I cannot yet afford an ocean view hotel in Hawai'i. Next time!! Special mention to the Filipino maintenance man (I wish I could remember his name). He was super friendly and hospitable (he helped us with setting up internet and fixed a faulty light). He would always greet us kindly - his bubbly personality is an asset to the hotel. P.s.

We stayed on the 10th floor, didn’t have a view of the sea but we were happy with the view we had. We had a roll out bed in our room which was surprisingly quite comfy. Amenities DVD rental is great; they have a good variety really handy for those lazy days.Towel rental is really good and convenient. Swimming pool is small, but as we are so close to the beach not maybe people used it so we found it to be quiet most of the time. WIFI, no issues in the room or hotel lobby was able to facetime friends and family in England with no problems. Only downfall is that WIFI is not available by the swimming pool. Fridge, Safe, Iron, Kettle- usual stuff in the room, all very convenient and worked well. Breakfast:We tried this out twice it was ok, I personally don’t think it is worth the price. Maybe a little more fruit and variety of cereals. As hotel guests you get a 20% discount, but as it is attached to the hotel it is a convenient. Didn’t try the other hotel restaurant. Staff:Front desk, maintenance and especially housekeeping were all very helpful, friendly and work really hard. Location:Fabulous, Waikiki beach is a few minutes away literally half a short block. Hotel is based in a popular tourist area and there are lots of the usual shops/restaurants around. Activities: We didn’t book anything through the hotel so I can’t comment on their concierge service. We booked either directly with activity provider or used one of the reps on the beach front. Luah- Paradise Cove was amazing, entertainment, food, activities all were greatWater activities: we did Jet skiing and parasailing with H20 sports, staff were great and made the day enjoyable. Island Tour- nice way to see lots of things Big Island-helicopter tour- unfortunately the helicopter part of the tour was cancelled due to weather conditions but going over to the big Island was a great experience. Hanauma bay- is a must see Getting around:We didn’t hire a car and opted for public transport which was both reasonably priced and very convenient. Local bus stop is half block away serves many useful bus routes.

I was given a room upgrade where I just had to add over $100.00 something. And it was the Penthouse with 2 rooms and a living room! I was elated and thankful for the accommodation.My only complaint is the Shuttle that took us back to the airport the next day was not very nice. He drove us to the airport with a few other people. This was on the 26th of August. And I was with my grandbaby who is 5 years old. We have 3 big suitcases and few carry ons. And I take the wheelchair because of my knees. The driver dropped us off in between Delta and United. There is a walk to the check in area. The driver said because there were cars at the drop off area. He could have waited a minute to see but he did not. I had to beg people to watch over my luggages while I had to find someone to pick my luggages. This had caused me to get aggravated. All the nice experience I had with Hawaii just disappeared. The driver should have been more helpful. He wasn't.I would like for this driver to know he made our stay very unpleasant.

However, the rooms are another story. I looked at several hotels in the same price range as the room I chose and I can honestly say that I don't think the price I paid represented what I should have seen in the room. The room was clean and comfortable as you would expect, but despite the ""ocean view"" I paid extra for - the room is anything to be desired. You are cramped in like sardines on two double-beds and there is very little room to spare besides the bed and a small desk and dresser. With the price I paid I would have expected some other piece of furniture to sit on besides the desk chair. The maid kept the place looking nice and the beds were comfortable yet tight for two average size adults. You have to be very mindful of all the hidden fees of this hotel. There is a $10/day amenities fee that covers phones, internet, etc. which is about average for this type of fee - however I meant to mention there is a catch with the amenities. You cannot use the ""Business center"" which has two computers for that included fee. You must use a credit card to use the Business Center computers. The more frustrating charge that although disclosed on expedia's website is a total joke - in reference to Customer Hotel Parking fee. Parking in general in this hotel's general geographic area is very tight. They offer ""hotel"" parking for you as a guest for the ridiculous price of $25/day. What is ironic that for a hotel with 19 floors, there are only 30-40 total space available next to the hotel and underneath the hotel (in total). If you happen to be out late - you can forget getting a chance to park there. Also they have a weird ticketing system for this parking that is problematic from time to time. You must use the ticket to both enter and leave the parking areas. For those of you who don't rent a car the hotel does happen to be within walking distance of both the beach and several other shops and restaurants. So if you do not have a car have no fear. I would also comment in general that if you are used to to big city streets this town will be no surprise to you, however coming from a smaller town i was overwhelmed with the number of one way streets, buses, and people traffic in general. You can take any estimate on Google Maps and about double it if you are going to travel anywhere by car inside of Waikiki Beach.","Monroe, Michigan",0,3.0

We had a bottle of wine and some lovely confectionery in our room on arrival as I had mentioned on the booking that it was my birthday and our anniversary. A really lovely touch. We were on the 18th floor and we had the end room which was lightly larger than my mother's. The rooms are spacious and the view from the balcony, just wonderful. We had breakfast included and this was a buffet. There was an excellent selection but if there was something from the menu you would rather (can't see why you would though) the staff were more than happy to oblige. After such a wonderful breakfast, we didn't want anything until much later. Big saving on the food budget!! The hotel is just one block from the sea and the main walkway. There are numerous high class shops and plenty of places to eat but mainly the best places are in the hotels. We did not eat at the hotel in the evenings and there is no bar in the hotel.

The horrible part was the extra $90/night to get a room with a view. A bit steep for a room upgrade. The room was nice, the refrigerator, coffee pot, small kitchen sink (no dishes or silverware) and coffee cups wonderful. As always, there's an enormous tv screen across from the bed - like you're going to spend your days in paradise watching tv. The pool was nice but it was annoying to have to get a pool towel in the basement and then have to return the towel there instead of leaving it for housekeeping. Don't eat the scrambled eggs at the breakfast buffet- they taste like whatever shortening they use to keep them from sticking has diesel fuel in it. There is a nice selection of breads for toasting and the toaster works well. Maid service didn't check the balcony so if you're staying for a few days you are in charge of tidying that area up. Very friendly reception desk staff - a huge plus! And the $12 shuttle to the airport is wonderful. Tip the bell desk guy and he'll put your luggage on the shuttle for you. But, I asked him to let me know when the PCC van arrived and he dropped the ball on that. That was the truly outstanding day of my vacation- book a trip to the Polynesian Cultural Center and they pick you up and drop you off at your hotel. Go ""Super Ambassador"" and you'll never forget it.","Eureka, California",23,4.0

Cons:1) The pool was not heated and it was icy cold. That’s why it’s always empty. I guess they just thought you would go to the beach instead. 2) It’s a no frill, plain looking room.

Lanai had decent space, regrettably no ocean view but the city view on the 16th floor was not too bad. Rainbows looked great. :)Couple of issues though...location of fridge on floor, under sink in bathroom area is not ideal. One, as it is the bathroom area, upon our arrival, the fridge had several long hairs inside of it, which was kind of gross. Then the amount of bending required to put things in and take them out was annoying. You could not see into the fridge properly without getting on the floor. Elevating the fridge and relocating it out of the bathroom area would be fantastic. The addition of a microwave to the room would be great too (hint,hint)Full disclosure, there was a roach sighting in our bathroom and in one of our friend's rooms which lead to intense scrutiny of our luggage and clothes in an effort to make sure nothing followed us home. Yes, it is the tropics and bugs are to be expected but no one ""wants"" to see them.Thankfully, there was only the one we each saw, so as to not be creeped out completely.Hotel was perfectly situated for everything we wanted to do in Waikiki which was great. Even walking distance to the car rental office. Very close to the beach with a nice protected area for kids to swim in.Front desk staff was very helpful in sorting out who was smoking (in a non smoking hotel) so that we could breathe in our room as well as helping with our Buffet ticket issue for our child.The Daily buffet breakfast that was included was in the restaurant in the lobby and was good. Decent variety, some dishes had more of a Korean vibe but to be expected as it seems all of Korean Airlines staff stays there when in town. We would have liked the scrambled eggs a little less watery and bacon a lil more crispy but that is a personal preference.Overall, I would return to the Waikiki Resort.","Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania",2,4.0

The room was just a standard room, I accept that, but all we had was a view to a small back road with apartment buildings. I would never pay extra to have a partial ocean view room let alone an ocean view room, I just don't believe this hotel would have any rooms with such views. Apart from no sheer curtains on the balcony doors I did see a couple of baby cochroaches in the room, there was no other mirror in the room apart from the bathroom which made it difficult for 2 people to get ready if someone was using the sink or hairdryer and someone just needed a mirror and the toilet blocked up completely on the second day. House keeping was a bit hit and miss, it seems it depended on who cleaned your room on a certain day as to wether or not all tasks were done...The pool was on a deck on the 2nd floor and although there was no view (which is often the case in Waikiki hotels) it was a very nice pool, clean with lovely outdoor lounges around. The hotel has a small convenience store in the lobby which was handy but the Japanese (?) woman running it needs to take some 'friendly' lessons, I don't think I got one word out of her during my several visits in there. On the plus side the hotel is in a wonderful location. There are nice places to eat nearby, 2 small blcoks to Kuhio Ave where the buses run and 2 small blocks to the front street and the beach 'lagoon'.The one shining light in the property is a wonderful man called Leo at the 'bell desk'. He was delightful, funny, helpful -going out of his way to find out some information about a transfer to a local tourist destination. He worked hard and always had a smile on his face. Not surprising he used to work at the Mirimar! Thank you Leo for all your smiles and help.","Adelaide, Australia",0,3.0

The patio style doors to the balcony are older and not as soundproof as you might like. The breakfast buffet was very good and the small underground parking was convenient.

The Waikiki Resort turned out to be a great value for us based on location, amenities, and cost.

The room bathroom is small and the bathroom light illuminates the whole room, not just the bathroom. The lanai is cool, if you're a smoker, but not so cool if you're not due to smokers on other room's lanai. The in room complimentary wifi was fast enough and didn't drop us once. The buffet breakfast was very good, fast, convenient, and reasonable versus other choices in Waikiki. Elevators were fast, which made the ice machine on the second floor seem not quite so far away. The tiny in room refrigerator froze everything we put in it overnight regardless of where we set the dial. No microwave. We saw mostly Korean patrons here versus seeing mostly Japanese everywhere else.Don't miss the free activities: shows at the Duke Kuhanamoku Statue, beach volley ball tourneys, surfing, etc, right at the beach. We were able to walk to the zoo and aquarium. We took a shuttle to hike Diamond Head, but walked (quite a ways) back to the hotel from there. The Ala Moana shopping center and Beach Park is about the same distance in the other direction, and I suggest paying the $2 each way for the trolley. It's $2.50 and over an hour one way on the city bus to Pearl Harbor, and $22 rt (+$7.50 entrance fee) to Hanauma Bay including snorkel gear. Alas, we didn't find much good local cuisine in Waikiki. Burgers in Paradise (next door) was an exception. Rainbow Drive Inn is a little far to walk, but very popular with locals. There is always a crowd and a line-up for food at Murakame Udon (noodles.) Otherwise, after a few mundane and overpriced meals at local venues, we took solace at Subway and KFC.So, get ready for a busy, fun vacation complete with beautiful sunny weather, awesome sights and sunsets, beach, shopping, and luaus, in a big, expensive resort town full of crowds, traffic, and foreign tourists.",,7,4.0

Primarily we need a hotel that would allow for a single night stay during the New Years Eve timeframe, The location is great, short walk to the beach, lots of places to eat and shop. The lobby is nicely appointed but the rooms themselves were old and outdated. Canvas wall paper, old carpet. The room was fine for 2 adults and one child - although I still don't understand why when you have toilet/shower and a separate room for the sink, closet there is only one light. If you use the bathroom in the middle of the night you have to turn on the light and it wakes up everyone. Also the shower was small and short - and the handles for turning on the water where confusing and cheap. Overall it was an average room at an expensive rate.

There was no one there to help us with our bags. Although I am more than capable of carrying my own bags it would of been nice for at least a staff member to batter their eyelids and offered a helping hand or a greeting.While checking in (there was 4 of us, 2 couples, 2 separate rooms) the staff member gave us keys to a different room as to what he had checked us in on the system. This resulted in our account getting charged for parking.Hotel room is nice but the bathrooms can use a facelift. It is TINY. How tiny is it? It is so tiny that in order for you to take a shower or go to the bathroom you must first open the door, step inside the room, lean against the wall while holding your breath as you close the door! My husband who is 183cm tall struggled with the shower and found it beyond a joke that such small confined bathrooms like this still exists. Even NYC or Japan bathrooms were bigger! Walls are thin which means you can hear everythingAir con is exceptionally loud but if you put it down low then you can't feel anything. If you put it up then you can't sleep due to the noise. When we brought all of these issues up to the staff member they said there is nothing else available except for one other room which was a downgrade to what we had paid for. I found this very hard to believe as our friend had the same issues and later on was upgraded to a better room. Maybe we were not assertive enough? When checking out we got charged with the extra resort fees however, when our friends checked out they were told not to worry about paying for the resort fee. To charge 1 customer resort fees and choose not to charge another within 5 mins of each customer checking out is unjust and I will never be coming back here nor will I be recommending this hotel.

For example, McDonalds Restaurant, Burger King, Subway, etc are all within a block radius. Japanese & Korean restaurants are abundant and all around us. The hotel itself is clean and noise was not a problem because we're facing North-East. The view is that of another hotel (Kuhio at Waikiki). Some things to note: The mini refrigerator is tiny so I would not recommend buying anything in bulk if want them refrigerated. TV was definitely in HD and we had better channel selection than our previous stay at another hotel in Waikiki. There is laundry facility is at the parkade downstairs of the hotel and parking we found was a little tight. If you're driving a mini-van... good luck navigating those tight spots.

And plenty of shops/restaurants to go into on the walk towards the center, if you wish to do that. The hotel is NOT on the beach.

The parking and daily fee is a bit excessive, in my opinion.. On top of the room fees we paid an extra $70 in fees and parking, and that was only for two nights! So take that into consideration when looking at costs. That is really the only complain that I have. Everything else was great!","Kailua, Hawaii",0,4.0

Top of the positive list is the location it is perfect, a very short walk to the beach, shops and restaurants. My second positive is the hotel staff, I had read in a previous review that there were no full length mirrors in the rooms and to my dismay, there was none in our room, We only had one medium sized mirror in the bathroom which is not great for 2 ladies trying to put on make up etc. I went to the reception to ask if there were any full length mirrors we could have and was told that they had none, I expressed my disappointment and went out for the day. On our return to the hotel low and behold a full length mirror appeared, apparently the receptionist a very nice lady called Nancy had organised someone to buy one and fix it in our room. Nancy I applaud you as you went the extra mile to make sure our holiday was perfect and I hope this review gets back to her. The breakfasts in the morning were reasonable with the 20% discount you get and it an all you can eat buffet, which isn't bad. I agree with some of the other reviews that the rooms could be updated and they charge nearly 10$ a day for wi fi in your room, which is expensive, you can get it free in the lobby but that can be inconvenient. One positive regarding the room was the view from our room, loved waking up to it every morning. So overall a great 6 night stay and I would go there again.","Manchester, United Kingdom",14,4.0

Well, the first didn't disappoint,the location is incredible you are literally less than a minutes walk and you are in the bluest water I have ever seen. The second, well......our first experience at the hotel wasn't great. Before we left we had emailed the hotel requesting early check in (yes we understood it was a request only), a high floor and telling them that we were coming to celebrate my birthday. We arrived at 8 and was told that in a kurt way that check in was at 3 and to check back at 2. I explained that we had requested early check in and was told the same thing, after a long flight all we wanted was a shower and to rest for an hour - the kids were exhausted. So we accepted the rudeness, and sat in the lobby. Then we saw other guests being served by a different person, who were also told the same thing, but in a much nicer way and they were having their registration forms done - we weren't offered that. I then went back about 1130 and asked if there had been any change, by this stage another staff member was there and the original staff member was now being very nice to me - wishing me a happy birthday doing my registration and said my room was being cleaned as we spoke. Our room was fine, it had 2 double beds, and a small balcony. The bathroom was small and adequate. Then we discovered a couple of small things that that cleaners had missed but that was enough for me to ask to change rooms. This is when our holiday got much better, I met Branden - he is the most amazing and kind person I have ever met. I explained what had happened to me this morning and the concerns I had with our room. He listened and then went and saw the manager to see how they could make our stay more enjoyable. They upgraded us to Penthouse A, which was incredible. We were more than happy - and very grateful. We then received champagne and those yummy Hawaiian biscuits as a birthday gift - once again so appreciative. Branden continued to check on us during our stay, to make sure everything is ok. He is a great ambassador for this hotel - he turned our average start to the best holiday ever. I have to mention the beds were the most comfortable hotel beds that I have ever stayed in, and we travel a lot!!

Unfortunately, I ate my words as soon as we got there! At first sight, you can tell that the hotel is older and in much need of a renovation. We pulled up and immediately noticed that the hotel did not have valet parking! In fact, there are 2 self-parking places to choose from (basement or outdoor in the lot). Parking is scarce and $25 a night. When my husband and I would return late at night, we would be lucky to find any parking in their tight spaces. In addition, I didn't think the service there was anything special. I actually found their service rather slow and was hesitant to ask the front desk of any questions in fear that I would have to stand there for too long just to get an answer.The hotel itself doesn't have much to offer. The pool is tiny and was always packed whenever we checked it out. There's a convenience store downstairs next to another small vitamin (I think it was a vitamin shop) store, bar, and restaurant. In addition, the rooms are pretty small with an even smaller bathroom! If you have a fear of tight spaces, I wouldn't recommend this hotel for you.The only positive aspect to this hotel is its location...other than its price in comparison to nearby hotels!

The view from the large balcony that spanned the length of the entire suite was pretty good too...Facing West towards Waikiki. There was a small view of the ocean over the parking garage across the street.

I left my book at the pool again it was returned by housekeeping. we arrived a day before our booking but were catered to immediately (late flight in). Brandon on front desk gave excellent service to our needs from this first night until calling for our taxi to the airport on last night. This hotel situation was perfect for our needs & central to all that we wanted. Yes some noise from buses outside and the doors do make a clanking noise on closing but hey for the price we paid I have no complaints. Would stay again.","Whakatane, New Zealand",1,3.0

I let the attendant know there was no where when booking directly through the hotels website to specify what bed I would like or that we were a couple travelling together. I was then offered a room upgrade at a cost to me and declined this. I was then offered another room that myself and my husband went to look at but this room only had 1 double bed and was not appropriate as it was next to the elevator. Finally after a long period of time they were able to locate a room for us in our price range. The service was fairly average and I don't agree with offering upgrades to people on arrival because they are in a room with 2 double beds at there own expense, if I had wanted a better room I would of booked it. The room was adequate although I stress this that the hotel is the nosiest I have ever stayed in. You hear everything, including the elevator and we weren't all that close to it, anyone in the hallways and every door closing. I had a few awful nights sleep and was woken up early everyday.Breakfast is advertised to be served until 10:30 am in the elevator although my husband and I arrived before 10 am and they were packing everything away and we were told we would have to get only what was left and could only go up once to the buffet as they were packing it up. WiFi at the hotel is good in your room but you have to pay extra for it.On that note you have to pay extra for everything. I wanted to print off our boarding passes for our flight home and had to pay $4.00 to access them and print them in there internet centre even though I had already paid for internet in my room. They also charge you to mind you bags so I didn't bother with that. Lots of little add on extras, nothing is included.Good location to everything however very windy around the hotel.Staff service is fairly average, and had to go down to the car park to get some pool towels not ideal. Leah in housekeeping was lovely I left my safe open by accident and she made sure security came up and locked it just in case and a note was left to let me know. I spoke with her when I went down to get towels and she remembered my room number and told me again about the safe. A no frills hotel, don't expect too much if you decide to stay there, however is one of the more affordable hotels for it's location.","Melbourne, Australia",7,3.0

The pros of this hotel are that it is a very affordable place to stay in Hawaii, it is close to the beach and shops/restaurants, the room was clean and beds were comfortable, the front desk staff, bell man, and restaurant (Ilima Café) staff were very friendly. The Ilima Café had a great breakfast buffet for a good price. We received a discount since we stayed at the hotel. Matt at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. I cannot remember his name, but my receipt says C. Barnett was the one who helped us book our day trip to the North Shore. He was full of helpful information and very friendly. The bell man was nice enough to store our luggage for free on our last day since our flight didn't leave until 7PM. This made it possible for my family to spend our last day on the beach instead of worrying about our things. This restaurant is within walking distance of many stores and restaurants. You are literally 1 minute away from the beach. The only cons that I can think of are that our refrigerator in room 612 was not very cold, and I didn't see a setting to adjust it. I mentioned this to the front desk and the man didn't act very concerned. My husband and I chose not to worry about this minor issue since we were eating out everyday anyway. The one and only time we did put food in the fridge it reeked the next morning. There is no microwave in the room, but maybe it is a fire hazard. The noise coming from the street may be an issue for light-sleepers. It wasn't an issue for my family since we were all exhausted every night and slept like rocks. If you want less noise then you may want to move to a higher floor. And the pool was clean, but ice cold. My kids were a little disappointed that the water was freezing, because they usually love swimming in the pool, as well as the beach, when we go on vacation. Over all, we had a good stay and would return. The front of the hotel is beautiful since the lobby is open and the nice, Hawaiian breeze can be felt. Free wifi is offered in the lobby, but not in the rooms. This hotel is not ""luxury"" by any means but it was exactly what my family was looking for. Through Expedia my flights and hotel were booked for less than $4,000 and this is the type of mid-range hotel that you can expect in Hawaii for that price. If you're looking for luxury, then expect to pay about $10,000 for a weeks stay. My family spent most of our time on the beach and walking around, but it was nice to have a clean, comfortable room to return to.","Bowling Green, Kentucky",26,4.0

Waikiki Resort Hotel fit that bill very well. From the hotel lobby, it's a short block to Kuhio Beach Park, so there's no excuse not to hop over to the beach and enjoy some sun and surf. You also can't walk more than a block without encountering shopping and restaurants. The shopping ranges from the always-present ABC stores (which are actually quite convenient) to top-line designers such as Ferragamo or Harry Winston and brand names such as Coach, Crocs, and many others. The hotel is located about 2-3 blocks from the Royal Hawaiian Center, so if your idea of vacationing is spending a lot of time in a beautiful ocean-front shopping center, this is a good venue for you.The rooms were average (and the bathroom less-than-average) and the interior furnishings are pretty dated. The carpet in my room had definitely seen better days, and given the close proximity to the beach, it probably would have been better if the room were tiled. As it was, every time I came back from the beach I tracked sand into the room, and although it was vacuumed each day, it never felt clean. Although I have to say, even the tiled parts of the room (bathroom and closet) were not cleaned well and lots of sand was left on the floor. I'm not sure why they didn't do a better job of sweeping or vacuuming - I mean, this can't have been the first time someone tracked sand in.My room had a sink/closet area with separate toilet and bathtub. Well, I think it was a bathtub - I've literally never seen one so tiny. If you wanted to bathe small kids in it, it would be fine. For an adult, however, there would be no way to get into the tub for a relaxing bath.Housekeeping was so-so - it definitely depended on the day and the staff. Some days, the room was cleaned well and supplies restocked. Other days, they missed the trash and didn't leave me any coffee.The bed was comfortable, the flat-screen TV worked fine. I had a balcony with a ""City view"" which basically meant that I was not on the ocean side of the hotel. However, I was 14 floors up and there was a lot of wind, so I was not comfortable sitting on the balcony.Parking was available in a garage below the hotel for $25/day, with unlimited in and out. Apparently, there is other parking as well but I never figured out where it was. There is also a small laundry area (wash for $1.75, dry for $1.75 but you get 54 minutes on the dryer so that should be plenty).","Washington DC, District of Columbia",16,3.0

The parking every night for your rental car was crazy they say u don't have a resort fee but the parking makes up for that.

Water pressure was good too.There was a small fridge and also a safe in the basin/wardrobe area which was convenient.I would have ranked the hotel a 5 except for the fact that to get wifi in your room you had to pay a daily charge of $10 or so.

It was a very convenient walk to everything we needed in Waikiki, with a nice close bus stop to get to Ala Moana etc.This is our third different hotel (roughly all in the same price bracket) on our third trip to Hawaii, but it would definitely be our favourite.

This is the biggest advantage to the hotel for it's price point.The breakfast buffet offered is very good (fresh fruit, salad, eggs, meats (at least 2 options), cereal, miso soup, plain rice porridge/juk/congee, cereal, various baked goods, juice, coffee) - So if it's part of your room rate/plan, then go for it. Most rooms have a small balcony with 2 chairs (called a lanai in Hawaii). The Korean restaurant on-site is good/tasty (moderately priced in my opinion - good portions - don't order too much, Korean dishes come with several small sides and rice - there is a small discount on most dishes if you stay at the hotel (certain deals/specials are already discounted)).Cons: The rooms are dated and need refreshing. Although it seemed clean and well maintained enough. The breakfast location is small - Get there right when they open or wait at least 30 to 45 min after they open for the initial rush to die down. I think there was free wi-fi in the lobby only (I didn't use it). The staff were friendly and helpful.We stayed there a few days just before the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor (Dec 2014) so there were several American high school bands staying in the hotel at the same time. The students were a bit rowdy and a bit disrespectful of the other hotel guests (at night and in the lobby). Thankfully, the students did not eat breakfast in the breakfast location.This is not really the hotel's ""fault"" per se but I have the strong feeling that based on the hotel's price point and location, it's popular with for tour groups or other groups. So I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of guests at the hotel on a regular basis.I did not use the pool or the spa (I think there was a spa on-site...).Other food recommendations close to the hotel: 1) For Spam Musubi fans - Musubi Cafe Iyasume - It's in the Aqua Pacific Monarch Hotel (literally a block or so from the hotel) - Next to Jinroku (Japanese restaurant - I did not eat here) - On Kuhio Avenue - Very tasty spam musubis - Cheap (abt $2.50/musubi) - Good for breakfast or a snack - The musubis are made by little old Japanese ladies - Cute place - I only tried the regular spam musubi and the bacon/egg/spam musubi, both very tasty.2) Sansei - Good and creative/interesting Sushi/Japanese/Asian fusion cuisine - They have a few locations in Hawaii (Maui (Kihei), Waikiki, etc). It's about a 7-10 min walk - To the Left after you reach the main street - On the 2nd or 3rd floor of the Marriot. 3) Cheeseburgers in Paradise - Good comfort food with some Hawaiian twists/ingredients.4) Honolulu Cookie Company - Very tasty cookies!!! - Shortbread cookies shaped liked a pineapple.There are ""ABC's"" everywhere if you need a quick convenience store. ""ABC"" stands for ""Aloha Brings Customers"" but most Hawaiians refer to it as ""All Blocks Covered."" :-) I am NOT a fan of Honolulu/Waikiki overall. It's too touristy, urban and busy. The traffic is very busy. But if you are looking for an urban location with lots of shopping, restaurants, and nightlife but next to nice beaches, then Honolulu/Waikiki is a good choice. Otherwise, I personally prefer Maui (Southwest Maui/Kihei/Wailea area) or Kauai. Overall, I gave this hotel 4 stars because of the location, friendliness of the staff, and price point. I would be willing to stay here again if I ever returned to Waikiki/Honolulu.","San Francisco, California",68,4.0

Room was basic and mostly clean aside from a leaky shower stall, part of the bathroom door was rotted off and also we managed to kill a small cock-roach crawling around on the desk. Staff were kind and courteous and no complaints there. Just that the room was not as good. They do have a nice delicious Korean restaurant on the 2nd floor that was nice. This was not by choice since we did a tour package so I do not have exact pricing for this place but if you spend all that money and time to fly to Hawaii, I personally would prefer a nicer place for a longer stay.

We didn't really pick the Waikiki Resort Hotel, as it came as part of a package tour we bought. Having said that though, we couldn't say we were unhappy with what we got.The Waikiki Resort Hotel is located just one block back from Waikiki beach and, therefore, very well located. It is also within walking distance of all the shopping and restaurants in Waikiki and, is well serviced by the hotel pick-up services used by the local tour organisations.Having not used any other hotels in Waikiki, it might be a little unfair to call it a B-grade hotel. I would say that it is a little older than some of the other hotels we saw; it is a little smaller [maybe that's a 'plus'].The Waikiki Resort Hotel is, though, very comfortable. The staff we dealt with were great. The rooms were very, very clean and the daily house-keeping did a wonderful job. The bell desk guys were friendly and helpful, as was 'Steve' who helped us with booking a tour.There is a very good 'convenience store' on site too.Would we stay there again? Most likely. We're not 'luxury' travellers, and like to get good value for our money. Normally, we treat hotels as just somewhere to lay our heads for the night, so we look for reasonable value.Any negatives ... specifically to our room (#1111), the toilet wailed like a banshee at every flush, right up till the cistern was fully refilled! Only a big issue if used in the middle of the night.Little niggles ... the doors to the rooms closed with a decent slam. Again, only an issue if you or your neighbour came in or went out during the night. And, the rooms could do with another mirror. Maybe a full length one behind the door, or opposite the bathroom door on the wallOh, and totally out of the Waikiki Resort Hotel's control, the Pacific Beach Hotel, which our room faced, played music into it's outdoor reception area late into the night. NOT loud annoying music; kind of at 'background' level, but still able to be heard where we were on level 11. Maybe the music lulled me to sleep, I don't know.

We found all employees in the hotel to be exceptionally friendly and accommodating.The rooms are somewhat dated and small, but quite clean and comfortable. They have exceptional pillows and mattresses and the AC works very well.

Inside lobby is just as nice! I rate it as a five since it is well maintained, room service was great and room was better than expected. One quick minor complaint though. We arrived around 1:00 p.m., which is early since check-in is 3:00 p.m.. June , the receptionist, informed me that our room wasn't quite ready but would be soon. That was fine with me. I told her that I would wait with my family in the lobby seated since we were tired from the flight and just wanted to relax. Mind you, the seats are in direct view of the registration counter and there are four of us total. About 2:30 p.m., I went to the counter to see how much longer to wait. June was busy with another person, so I asked another employee, an older gentleman without name badge, The gentleman said "" oh, it's been ready for some time."" Why then could June not inform us earlier? It wasn't busy at any time since. Good question! Anyway, we got our room , which was 1515. The room was awesome! Two double beds with a rollaway placed in between if we wanted it. We were told that if we didn't, just roll it out to the hallway.Two teen girls did not want to share a bed so it worked out even better! That was good planning and thinking on the staffs part in my opinion. Kudos to them !! The view was impressive both for the water as well as Diamond Head. Plenty of room in the wash basin area. Bathroom isn't large but not uncomfortable to facilitate. Shower was more than adequate. Small tub not designed for bathing but that was fine with us! Small refer, closet, coffee maker ( Wolfgang Puck coffee, excellent, ooohhh!) , safe, hair dryer and iron , located in basin area. Plenty of towels, too. Nice t.v. and clock radio are in the room. Pool is on the second floor, not huge but big enough, and is great for kicking back and relaxing after a long day. Plenty of lounge chairs and was never crowded. If you needed towels for the beach, just check them out from the basement and return them afterwards. Real easy!!! Newspaper every morning in the lobby. Overall, I feel as if I got my moneys worth and MORE here at Waikiki Resort. I would definately recommend the upper rooms as there is street noise early in the morning. Not bad where we stayed but I'm sure it would be worse on lower floors. Two blocks from the beach, so its a real short walk. Oh, did I mention room service was great? Worth another mention!!! One odd quirk though. We received a flyer, left by the maid, informing us that there would be a drapery inspection between 9:00-10:00 a.m. the following day. Is that odd or what ??? We were gone at that time, so I do not know if they actually did this but I found that really strange !!! I felt as if they were checking up on us instead. Peranoid I guess. Never had that happen in ANY hotel that I have stayed at in my LIFE ! Why could they not do that in between reservations? Or why not when the maid was in our room? She was there usually mid-afternoon. Oh well, thats life. Otherwise, great place stay, disregarding the two incidences. Book way in advance to get best rates !!","sacramento,ca",36,5.0

Nothing super fancy, but had all the basics were included. Wifi is only at the lobby, as you have to pay extra to get it in your room. I can see how this might be inconvenient for some, but it didn't bother me. You also need to pay for parking at the hotel (which hotel doesn't in Waikiki?) but you're really close to the Zoo and Aquarium area that you can manage to find free overnight parking there if you are okay with walking 10 minutes or so. It's a nice comfortable walk along the beach in the evening anyways, so why not enjoy it? There are two restaurants at the hotel, which we did not eat at. Given that the hotel is owned by Koreans, it's not surprising that one of the restaurants was a Korean BBQ at a very competitive price.

Some of the pictures that were shown didn't match what we got at all. Essentially, a corner room gives you a slightly larger mini-refrigerator, microwave and a sink with a few plates and utensils. The room is also slightly larger than a standard room. The hotel is older as is evidenced by the upgrades made when an automatic fire sprinkler system was installed in the building. Also the rest of the construction says 60s at least to me. Fortunately, we did not go to Hawaii to stay in our hotel room.Check-in was fast and the staff was friendly. You have to pay $22 bucks a day for parking. Wifi is free in the lobby but if you want it in your room, you have to pay about $10 a day per device. Come on. This, today, is liking charging extra for sheets on your bed. One of the biggest headaches is that the street outside is so busy and so noisy that using the balcony or leaving the sliding glass door open is next to impossible unless you just want to drown out the noise from your significant other. ... Ouch! She just slapped me... The street is a one way street and there are service vehicles and tour buses using it all day long as well as regular traffic. The street is narrow and it is amazing that they can actually get two buses on the road side by side. One morning, a food truck stopped on the street to deliver to the hotel next door and the noise from his cooler was just unbearable. The next day, someone was jack-hammering on the parking structure next door. The noise was a real downer for me.One other minor irritation was the bathroom layout. It is the type with the tub and toilet in one room while the vanity is in another open to the bedroom. I'm an early riser and I don't like to turn on lights to wake everyone else up. The vanity room needed to be separated from the rest of the room by a door. Oh, and there was only one light switch for both the bathroom and the vanity room. It was all or nothing. speaking of baths, here is a tip when in Hawaii. Open a window in the bathroom and take a bath/shower with just enough hot water to not make it icy. I took a hot shower the first day and just couldn't cool off enough to get the water off of me so getting dressed was no fun with clothes sticking to my wet skin. The rest of the week I was just fine using my own tip.All in all, it was o.k. but next time I'll probably shop around for a different place.","Lindon, Utah",31,3.0

However, be aware that the check in time for this Hotel is 3pm, so if you arrive in on early flights ie 7am as some flights from Australia do, be aware that a room might not be ready for you as the hotel is very busy and you have a long wait after a 9-10 hour overnight flight, so would suggest when booking ask for an early check in or pay for one night's accommodation, especially if you are of the older generation. If not busy the hotel reception will try and accommodate you, but as previously advised it is a very busy hotel.",Canberra,6,4.0

The beach is only a 30 second walk away and the hotel is in a very central position to walk around Waikiki, with the bus stop into Honolulu only at the next block.

Since it was just me staying I emailed the hotel and asked for a room with a king bed. When I checked in I was informed I would be staying in a king suite for my stay. This was really great of the hotel to do. I was on the 6th floor and had a partial ocean view. I could also see Diamond Head. The rooms all have nice patios with chairs and a small table. I was worried the noise would be loud from the street but I did not have any issues. The noise in the resort was also minium with people coming and going at different hours. I've read reviews about the showers and tubs being small but I did not notice that, and I am not a small guy. I tried the breakfast buffet at Ilima Cafe and it was pretty good. They have your typical items like bacon, scrammbled eggs, Portuguese sausage, fresh fruit...etc. It was enough to get the day started. For dinner I decided to try Seoul Jung as guests receive a discount. The prices are a little high and I am not exactly sure what everything was. I tried the BulGoGi or marinated beef, and it was outstanding. You also receive 6 little sides and a bowl of soup, so you definately do not go hungry. I would have dined there again, but I had to try other restaurants. The pool was never super busy so it was a nice place to lay and relax in the sun, without the noise of the beach. If you did want to go to the beach it is just a short one block walk. Everything at Waikiki Resort Hotel was great, from the front desk staff, bell desk, housekeeping, and location.

This is not a 5 star luxury hotel, but a very decent and comfortable hotel and priced very well and rated 5 out of 5 accordingly. A very short stroll to the beach, as convenient as being beachfront but without the noise and traffic. Staff are nice , and the breakfast buffet is very decent with a good range (fresh pineapples were awesome) and 2 adult brekky coupons are usually included when you book on their website, but if you have 2 kids like we do, dont worry, kids under 12 are half price at $7 each. They also have self service laundry facilities in the basement which is so needed for young families. Pool was good as well, although the beach meant we hardly used it. Given the location, and quality of facilities this hotel has got to be the best value for money hotel in Waikiki, and really conveniently set up for young families where one room can accomodate a family of 2 adults and 2 young kids and with a good breakfast buffet set up with a good range of healthy stuff as well. I would highly recommend this hotel to young families who want a very decent place for a good price (if you want 5 star luxury...look elsewhere) located right next to the beach, and also anyone else for that matter.

Instead, they gave me a suite on a lower floor with a small kitchenette and much more space, so in a way I got something for the extra money I paid.The A/C was very quiet, but took several hours for my room to reach the desired temperature.The sliding glass doors to the balcony had a quarter inch gap between them when fully closed, so a lot of city street noise was leaking through into my room.Their on-site restaurant that serves breakfast is very tasty, and the waitstaff is very kind.Beware of the ""make shift"" underground parking garage if you need parking and you're driving a large vehicle.

The penthouse was as dazzling as you would expect with a fabulous view from the balcony at top of the tower.

Our (city view) room was very nice and the housekeepers did a great job of keeping the room clean. Only thing I would have added to the room would be a microwave, and free wifi in the rooms should be standard, though it seams very common for Waikiki hotels to charge an additional fee for wifi in the room.Our room was on the 17th floor, but the elevators are fast and smooth, and we never had to wait more than a few moments for an elevator to arrive.We ate breakfast at the hotels buffet breakfast, which was better than we had expected. The service was also very good.We always rent a car when staying on Oahu, and were concerned about parking. We have stayed at other Waikiki hotels were the parking was very limited and often full, leaving us to search for parking outside the hotel. The underground parking at the Waikiki Resort was limited, but they also have an additional uncovered parking lot, so parking was not a problem. The hotel location is excellent and about as close to the beach as you can get without being “beach-front”. Restaurants, shopping, surfboard rentals, etc. are all near the hotel. This was our first time at the Waikiki Resort Hotel, and is now at the top of our list when we are back on Oahu.","Hilo, Hawaii",1,4.0

But also you have the two restaurants in the hotel that offers good food. The swimming is a bit small, but hey, the ocean is right there so I really don't see that as a problem and since not a lot of people using it. A great hidden gem to get yourself away from the crowd and still enjoy the sun in the water. Super nice front desk staff. Courteous and professional. Full of knowledge of local attractions and foodie goodies. Told us about a 24 hours Japanese super market, Don Quijote close by, driving only 10 minutes. The room itself is nice and spacious, has everything you need and then some. The room we got had an obstructed ocean view.

Tyler at the EXPEDIA tour desk was very sweet and helpful as well.They are located about a block (if that much) from the beach. It was just awesome.

They also NEED another mirror, which can be placed in the room. Only 1 mirror and it was in the bathroom. The so called bath tub :-) was like a shower/half tub, it looked like a small child's bath. The beds were to die for. Very very comfy. I stayed in room 1815, a floor below the PH. They have a pool, vending and ice machine on the 2nd floor along with a couple of restaurants.An internet center, breakfast room, gift shop ect on the main lobby floor.McDonald's on the corner. Eggs n Things and then another block and half a lot more food places and stores & International Marketplace where you can get souvenirs to buy.I found that on the last evening before checkout, housekeeping did not wash or give us new drinking glasses, nor did they wash our sink. I thought that was a little tacky and not because it was our last evening that things should not have been prepped. Overall the room was always clean and prepped. The view I asked for was fantastic. Got to see sunsets and the surfers each day on the ocean. 2 birds kept visiting my balcony daily.

What we didn't like was the same breakfast every day, and we were there for a couple of weeks; nothing changed at all in that time!

The hotel was quite nice but there were so many groups of students from Korea and Japan and it felt overrun with teenage school kids and it was annoying when trying to wait for an elevator. The hotel was a block away from the beach and about a 7 mins walk from the main tourist streets within Waikiki.It is an amazing part of the world to travel to, and I feel like for what we paid, we got quite a nice deal as there were many more hotels that looked more outdated and similarly priced. It can be quite difficult to choose hotels within Waikiki because many of the newer, 5 star rated hotels were much more than if it were in another location.","Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",7,4.0

They are still pretty basic, but nice and comfortable. I liked the free wifi in the lobby, but having it in the room would have been a great plus. The rooms are clean and I still like the hotel, however, don't expect any help from the front desk:My main complaint is - We desperately needed to rent a car one morning and woke up very early to do so (we had to get to the north shore by 9:00am but it wasn't until that morning we'd realized our tour was on the North shore, we were originally planning to take a taxi. Yes I know, bad planning on our part but still...) So we called down to the front desk and asked if they could recommend a nearby rental agency to us, and they said, no problem, we have a car rental service on site, but, they don't open until 8am, don't worry none of the others do either. We thought ""ok, that seems the quickest thing, we'll just get a car here"". So we waited patiently until 8am, then the car rental desk opens, we discover that the agency is not onsite, it's just an expedia booking desk! So we pay for a car and then still have to take a taxi all the way to Ala Moana Discovery centre to pick up the car. Upon arrival, we see that there are actually 4 car rental companies all located in the same building, and they all opened at 7am! This caused us to miss our scheduled time and we had to wait all day to be fit into the schedule again (we were skydiving, in case you are curious). If the front desk guy had only just told us to go to the discovery centre - where all the car rental places are - we never would have been late. Or if he had even been helpful enough to call one of the agencies to see when they open instead of just taking the lazy way out and assuming they are closed.

We had a ocean-facing room on the 18th floor (room 1817) which I do recommend. The 19th floor is the penthouse rooms. From the balcony, I had great views over the ocean and beach, and could also see Diamond Head. The room was on the smaller size (but still manageable. Everything was clean and the beds comfy. There was a letter in the room saying that there would be pest control on 3 floors in the hotel the following day which included our room. The room was sprayed while we were out. We didn't see any bugs before or after the spraying. There's 3 lifts in the hotel and they are super-fast, no hanging around waiting for lifts at this hotel! I didn't use the swimming pool (looked nice) or restaurant. McDonalds is just around the corner, and so is Waikiki Beach, from door to beach, about 1-2 minutes walk, great location. Check-out is 12pm, we were able to check-out at 1pm for no charge. Anything later would incur a charge. The hotel has wifi but you have to pay, it's free in the lobby though. I think all hotels should include free wifi in the rooms! I think it costs $10 a day, $70 a week (no discount), but I searched around for wifi services elsewhere in the room and found skywave(?) which was about $8 a day, $24 a week, and about $32 a month. So better to use that than the resorts own wifi.This hotel is fine and what was expected, next time I may try somewhere else.... although not sure if there's anywhere cheaper or the same cost that is closer to the beach, so I'll have to decide later.

The whole hotel is aimed at Koreans, Chinese and Japanese holiday makers, It even has a Korean Travel Agent in the hotel, a Korean resturant and bar. The Pros:- Comfy beds & pillows, clean room, good view although we had a city view it was very pretty at night. Fridge in room.The cons:-Not enough storage for clothes, coffee was provided but no Tea, no internet in room, no full length mirror (only one mirror over sink). The patio doors are single glass so you hear every thing out side early in morning and at night.We got this hotel at a very good price and when we arrived we were told we were in the penthouse - BUT not what we expected for a penthouse, we actually had a bedroom attached to a suite with two bedrooms so the people who were in the suite did not want two bedrooms hence why we had one. It was just a bedroom nothing special at all.There was supposed to be Internet Free in the Lobby we has 3 devices with us my phone, an Ipod ad computer none of them worked beacuse the IT dept had not put the IP Addres on the system properly so no ne could access the internet. You had to pay if you wanted to use it in the internet centre in the hotel - they are not silly. So I was not a happy bunny as I picked this hotel for the internet to keep in contact with home. If you wanted to use the internet you had to go to MacDonalds or Starbucks not convenient but a must.2 days before we were leaving we had a not left in the room saying they were upgrading the internet to WiFi and upgrading the TV to HD between 8 and 4pm and if you did not was to be disturbed ring housekeeping which I did and told them not to disturb us until we had left. I might as well have spoken Japanese and thye took no notice and on the day before we were due to leave they came - BUT my husband had left some change on the bedside cabinet and when we returned it had gone, we presume stolen by the workmen. We told reception who did not seem to be bothered but sent a Security guy up who was not bothered either so that was then end of that.I personally would not stay at this hotel again but thats my choice.","Surrey, United Kingdom",82,3.0

We were on the sixth - we asked if there was anything higher and something possibly with a kitchenette. We were SO lucky to get upgraded to the 17th floor...we had a one bedroom suite with a kitchenette and a view. The decor was lovely and we had lots of space to spread out plus 2 balconies, one off the living room where the sofa bed was and the other off the bedroom. My only negative (if you can call it that) about the room was the size of the bathroom sink and counter area - it was super small. There wasn't a spot for cosmetic bags or anything like that.We looked down over the pool and several time thought we would go down and lay there as the area was very inviting BUT the window of opportunity for sunshine must have been small. It seemed to us that it was in shade all the time or at least every time we looked - I guess from the surrounding buildings. So we spent all our time at the beach. Our only other issues were that there was wifi in the lobby but while we were there we had trouble connecting a number of times...which is frustrating. One time it was not available until the following day. Our flight did not leave until late in the evening and we asked to leave our bags with the bell concierge - we were charged to do that.

The car park under the hotel is readily accessed and easy to use, down there you will find a launderette which is good value. Get a good map of Hawaii, it is quite confusing.

This time we spent a full week enjoying our room, the ocean and mountain views, the incredible location in the heart of Waikiki just half a block from the beach and the sincere hospitality of the hotel and staff. Another couple joined us on this trip and they, too, had a terrific time and loved the comfort and amenities of their room as well as the impressive views. Most mornings we got up early and went for a brisk walk along the beach-walk passing by the Aquarium and the Zoo before returning to the Ilima Restaurant downstairs at the Waikiki Resort Hotel for a buffet breakfast. The food at Ilima was excellent, as was the table service. The restaurant staff is very friendly and attentive. I am watching what I eat these days so I avoided the breakfast meats and the pastries and muffins but there were plenty of other healthy choices available. I definitely got my fill of great tasting fruit each morning. The melon and the pineapple were consistently excellent. We also dined twice at the Seoul Jung Korean Restaurant on the second floor of the hotel. The food was so good the first evening that we ate there that we had to go again two nights later. The mouth-watering Gal Bi ribs were unbelievably good. I had those on both nights and I will return for those ribs again in the future. With all of the trips we made up to our room and back down to ground level over the week I noticed how convenient the elevators were to take. We never seemed to have a long wait for an elevator which isn't always the case in high rise buildings. You'd push the button and just moments later the elevator would arrive. A small thing I guess but it made for more more enjoyable, frustration-free experience.One thing different on this trip was that we did not have a car the entire week so we learned about the bus system and the trolleys, which were actually quite convenient. Plus it was nice having someone else drive while navigating busy Waikiki. We managed to get to Ala Moana Shopping Center, Pearl Harbor to see the memorial and exhibits (the Missouri Battleship was awesome and inspiring), and even Hilo Hatties with relative ease. Another day we walked to the near-by Diamond Head Recreational Area and watched the windsurfers with their colorful sails riding the waves in and then letting the powerful winds carry them back out past the waves to do it again. This is near the historic lighthouse and many of the homes in the area are quite stunning. From there we could see the “ant-sized” people up on top of the Diamond Head crater rim, which is a great hike that we made the last time we stayed at the Waikiki Resort Hotel.Wow, the week went by so fast – that is my only “complaint” for this trip.We love staying at this Hotel!","Hilo, Hawaii",2,5.0

They were helpful with questions and quick to respond to requests we had throughout stay. We had a mountain view room with 2 double beds on the 16th floor. The rooms were a bit small, but that didn't bother me too much as I didn't spend much time in my room anyway other than to shower or sleep. The bed was okay and the room was fairly clean. I did notice that there were lots of sirens throughout the night. I would not want to stay on a lower level floor because I would imagine the noise would make it even more difficult to sleep. The location of the hotel was what I liked most. We were 1 block from McDonald's (where we ate breakfast every a.m.) and beach. Also, quite close to International Marketplace (about 3 blocks away, which was good that we were far enough away from noise at night but close walk for shopping) and Duke's restaurant (where we went nightly for our favorite...

Having another mirror in the bedroom area would have made it a bit easier for all 3 of us to get ready at the same time because the one in the bathroom area was barely large enough for two.

We were in Honolulu for 6 days and this hotel has a fantastic location! It really is 1 (very short) block to Waikiki beach! It is just off the main drag along Waikiki beach, where there are lots of shops and restaurants. The lobby is bright and open-air, with colorful stained glass on one side. We booked a mountain/ocean view superior room and were located on the 17th floor. The room was a good size and very clean. The bathroom was separated into the sink/closet area and then a separate toilet/shower room. The toilet/shower room was very tiny, you had to squeeze in to shut the door behind you, but no big deal. There was a mini fridge in the room which we found helpful so we could keep snacks/drinks cold for the week. The bed was comfy and we didn't find noise to be a problem at all (from other rooms, the hallway or outside). We overlooked the pool and since we were so high up we could see Waikiki beach and the ocean from our room/lanai. The pool was small but a nice spot to go to if we didn't have much time between activities, or if we didn't feel like heading to the beach. They have towels for you to use at the pool and beach. There is a shop off the lobby with basics in case you forget anything, or there are ABC stores on almost every corner where you can pick up essentials or souvenirs. The front desk staff was helpful and friendly enough, nothing over and above though. The bellman was very helpful with getting us taxis (and pre-negotiating rates), and writing up bus routes to and from various destinations around Honolulu. We had a car for a couple of days so we parked in the garage 1 night. It was small and crowded but did the trick. Our only suggestion to the hotel was to have a courtesy room where people can freshen up quickly before their flight. We checked out at noon and didn't fly out until 11pm so we would have appreciated a quick shower/face wash/teeth brushing after the afternoon in the sun before we got on the 12 hour jouney home.

For example, one person reviewing this hotel noted that the bath tub is shallow and small. In my case I didn´t mind at all.Being my second time in Hawaii, I knew what to expect and I chose this Hotel because the streets around it are more quiet and more discreet than just one block away. Also, if you stay in the lower floors in the streets near the Hilton, you are more likely to hear everything that is going on in the street at night. People arrive from all over the world in the afternoon and many stay up until late at night in the streets making noise. Also, the guests at this hotel are mostly asian families and they don´t make much noise. But again, if you are young and don´t mind late night noise there are many other places to choose from.But as a matter of fact it was so quiet at night that I had to open the windows to hear some noise to sleep. I was staying on an oceanview room the 16th floor . This time I didn´t hear the garbage truck at 3 a.m. and didn´t see many homeless around. I woke up early everyday and didn´t go out much late at night, so I didn´t get to see any hookers. It´s best to enjoy the beach and shopping early in the morning before the crowd and avoid trouble being out late. Even though I think it´s rare that something bad would happen.

Amenities - you have free access to a mini-fridge where you fill it with drinks/snacks purchased at an ABC store (literally, there is 3 or 4 ABC stores within a 5 min. walk) and an in-house safe where you can place your valuables. The staff were helpful and friendly (I was given a free upgrade from partial to full Ocean view on the 18th floor). The additional perk being in this room was that I was able to receive free wifi access (via. shakanet). The rooms were clean, bed was comfortable, there were ample towels, loved the view from my balcony and the great air conditioner control system.I really don't have anything bad to say about the hotel. Just realize because of it's great location, expect some traffic/noise (if facing the beach). It's an ""older"" hotel that was remodeled and contains only a shower tub. I found the alarm clock radio a little confusing to use so I used my IPhone alarm instead.I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

They were friendly in 2005 and even more friendly when we got there in early March this year. There are so many faces that are the same as in 2005 and all seem to remember us every year(June and Erna have been there a long time and always can give a history lesson).

I used the free WiFi in the Lobby and it was suitable for my needs. We were on the 4th floor (Room 404) away from the elevators. It was a small room but adequate. The washroom door opened on to the toilet bowl - no big deal. Street noise was OK but it is located in an active area, there is always something going on. Door slams from other rooms were annoying but I think this was more a factor of inconsiderate patrons. There are ways to close your door to limit noise. On windy days the lanai door rattled as did the adjoining room door. Stuffed a folded piece of paper in the crack - problem solved. People were up and about very early to catch tour busses, thats just they way it is on holidays, good luck on trying to sleep in (bring ear plugs). Maid service was good and they were extremely friendly. Front counter service was adequate. As previously mentioned this hotel caters to Korean Airlines flight crews and Korean visitors. They tend to keep to themselves and seemed to go out of their way not to interact with other Patrons?Location: Excellent. Close to all amenities. Stores, restaurants and bus stops. ABC stores everywhere. Varied selection of restaurants, budget and higher end. ""The bus"" system is good, used alot by tourists and locals. You can get schedules on-line or from the McDonald's restaurant 1 block towards the beach. Be patient on the bus it is cheap but not speedy. If you choose to rent a car use www.discounthawaiicarrental.com they have a Budget Car Rental office 1 block away at the Hyatt regency Hotel on the second floor. Rented a car for 2 individual days and drove the North shore. I did not want to pay the high car parking fees.Misc: Stayed on the Diamond Head side of Waikiki Beach. Not as busy. Snorkelled and saw a large variety of fish. Bring water shoes as the bottom is rocky. Bishops Museum was good as i learned alot of Hawaiin history and the Geology of the Island. Pearl Harbour was Ok. I enjoyed the displays before the USS Arizona memorial the best. North Shore was lovely and more layed back. Snorkeled at Kuilima Cove (Turtle Bay) and had Shrimp Scampi at Giovanni's Shrimp truck, just past (East) of the Turtle Bay turn off. Used Speedy Shuttle to get to and from the airport. Very good service. Snorkelling at Hanauma Bay was good. Saw green sea turtles, eels and a large variety of fish. Take bus #22 on Kuhio street. The bus tends to fill up.

By far this hotel was the best in this price range. I found the front desk staff helpful, rooms clean and comfortable, and an excellent location one block off of the beach. What was even more of a surprise is the availability of parking included with your room which is a premium in Waikiki. Though the rooms were a bit on the smaller side, they are comparable to most in the area. The biggest drawback is the bath configuration being a bit awkward to move around with the location of the door, shower and toilet. Other than this minor inconvenience, this is an excellent location for a business traveler, and a short walk to the beach or fast food restaurant for coffee in the early morning.

They offered a special online discount. Pay for 2 nights get the 3rd free which helped me to decide on this hotel as the other hotels in the area were so expensive, and I was not there to spend time in my room. The 18th floor room had a good view of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach and the ocean. The room was very tired looking. The carpet and bedding has seen better days and we did make sure to keep our shoes on when walking on the carpet. We booked a junior suite and it was good size and had a small kitchenette which we used to keep cold drinks and snacks in and to make coffe and tea in the morning. Bathroom was in dire need of an update. The location was very close to everything in Waikiki. I did find the staff pleasant and helpful and buffett breakfast was good but would get boring if you ate there everyday for a week, as it didn't change at all. I did hear some traffic noise at night but we were in the middle of a big city, so it is to be expected and it wasn't bad enought to keep us up.We did try the pool one afternoon and it is not heated and was so cold we didn't get past our toes. Since I paid alot of money to go to Hawaii the last thing I wanted was a polar bear dip!All in all it was an OK hotel and served the purpose, but I think the management should look at replacing the bedding and carpets and freshing up the decor.","Cochrane, Canada",77,3.0

What willed us to stay here? Location. I cannot express how greatly located this hotel is, but due to several issues such as customer service, cleanliness of rooms etc, it heavily weighs down the hotel to be nothing but very average, if that. As stated in the title, the hygiene and cleanliness of our rooms were very questionable. The carpet was of a colour and texture that encouraged us to keep our flip flops on whilst staying in the room, the shower was moldy with a hair on it when we arrived and the bed sheets had holes in it. Now thinking about it, the hygiene of rooms being questionable may be an understatement. We may as well have been staying in the same room as our neighbours due to being awoken at all times of the night by them. I'm not blaming them for the noise, but simply to the paper thin sheet that divided us and the adjoining room. Now, should you ever need help for entertainement or cuisine options in Hawaii, look no further than Walter the concierge located by the front desk. But do not be allusioned by the fact that he works for the hotel - he works for expedia funny enough. He has a vast range of knowledge, especially of Waikiki and knows the Island inside and out. Walter was indeed the highlight of the hotel for our family.Overall stay here if you want to save that extra cash for shopping but are willing to compromise on hygiene, are never acknowledged or helped by the front desk and are willing to live all cozied up.

We had problems with the parking access every day and had to constantly get assistance from the front desk to let us out of the hotel parking.

He was friendly and was always happy to chat, pass on tips and good deals on activities. What's more he is just a very interesting and cool guy to talk to. Ironically he works for Expedia, not the hotel.As for the front desk staff. Well they were unfriendly to the point of being down right rude! Some of them obviously do not want to be there and don't deserve the job. The housekeeping staff were always friendly and smiling, but the housekeeping itself was very average. The Bell staff were also friendly and helpful.We stayed for two weeks and had a standard room with two double beds. It was a bit small for a family of four but we weren't in the room that much so it didn't really bother us. The room had a door to the adjoining room which must have been paper thin. A couple of times I woke up in a panic early in the morning thinking a Chinese market had opened up in our room but it was just the racket in the adjoining room!The hotel is quite tired an worn out.The manager advises on this page that they intend to spend some money on refurbishing and updating. That will be interesting but they should also invest some money in customer service and house keeping training.On the whole, as the heading says, don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. We chose to go the budget route to have a bit more spending money so didn't expect to much. Having now seen the location of some of the more expensive options we considered, I am happy with the choice. Would I stay here again?

I arrived a little early (12:30 pm) and was still able to check-in to my room on the 11th floor facing the Hyatt Regency - a city view rather than partial ocean or mountain view. The room included a free safe that I was encouraged to definitely use, an iron and ironing board, coffee maker, hair dryer, microwave and refrigerator. In the lobby there was a very costly Internet computer with printer (I found a much cheaper place just around the corner), a laundry, coffee shop and bar. The room, in my opinion, was clean but the decor definitely needs updating. There was some noise between rooms and even on an upper floor I could still easily hear street noise because of a gap between the glass doors leading to the balcony.The room was a little small and the shower was very small but the bed was large and comfortable with mushy pillows. The room also included a flat screen TV with a very limited range of channels and no premium options but then who goes to Waikiki to watch television.The hotel was located in a great area just off Waikiki Beach between Kalakaua Avenue and Kuhio Avenue so getting to the beach was literally only a 1-minute walk. Also, all the buses to Diamond Head, downtown, the Ala Moana Shopping Center, etc. run down Kuhio Avenue so the entire city is also only a 1-minute walk and $2.50 bus ride away.I took the Robert's Hawaii bus from the airport to the hotel in less than 60 minutes. I made my reservation and paid the round trip fare ($9 from the airport and $6 to the airport) online but you could just get on the bus at the airport and pay the fare in cash (most did it this way) and then call at least 24 hours before to arrange the return pickup. Since this hotel is located at the far eastern end of Waikiki I was one of the last off from the airport and one of the first on for the return trip. Both trips were on very large, clean, air conditioned coaches and was a nice stress-free and cheap way to get to and from HNL.I enjoyed my stay at the Waikiki Resort Hotel and would return. The price was very good, the location great and everything was as I expected it to be - this isn't a 5 star resort so don't expect that. This is a good value hotel with clean rooms in a good location.","Scottsdale, Arizona",2219,3.0

We stayed there for (sadly) only four nights in September and it could not have been better. I always use Trip Advisor to check out a hotel before we go, but the golden rule is: read as many as you like but take a balanced view! One review I read complained about the room/food/service etc on TA before speaking to the manager and giving them an opportunity to put things right.We arrived quite late at night after a very long flight from England (30+ hrs) so we were very tired and not in the best of moods. The check in staff worked quickly and efficiently to get everyone into their rooms with the minimum of fuss. The room was quite high up, 16th floor, which was a blessing because of a little traffic noise, and first impressions were excellent. The main thing is always cleanliness….if a place is dirty; you are not going to enjoy it. The room was immaculate, with two Queen beds, a washbasin area and a separate shower. The beds were comfortable, the aircon was good, there was a TV if needed and a small balcony. We stayed for four nights and I can honestly say it was superb. The only (small) problem we had was with the safe….it wouldn’t lock. A guy from customer services came within minutes to fix it and although it took another couple of visits to sort it out, this was again done with courtesy and efficiency. I truthfully believe a lot of reviews on Trip Advisor are from serial complainers. If you want five star service, go somewhere else and pay a hell of a lot more for it. In our case we want a good clean hotel in a nice location, with friendly staff and at a good price. The Waikiki Resort ticks all these boxes and more. We will definitely be returning to Hawaii for another longer stay at some point and we would be happy to stay at this hotel again. Thank you and well done to the management and staff!","Telford, United Kingdom",29,5.0

Waikiki is the most amazing place and your stay at the Waikiki Resort puts you right in the heart of it. Access to the zoo and parks, the Aquarium, Diamond Head (exceptional 360-degree views from the top!), shops and the International Marketplace is unparalleled from this location. Everything (except Diamond Head - take the trolley) is within easy walking distance and the people watching and sight seeing make every step enjoyable. Returning to Waikiki Resort felt like we were returning to our home away from home. It is the best of all worlds when comparing location, views, price, hospitality and amenities. It has to be the best deal in Waikiki!Our room was lovely, comfortable and most welcoming. While not quite oceanfront views ,at just half a block away, we still had exhilirating views of the ocean and mountains. We made sure to spend adequate time lounging on the balcony to enjoy the views.We love living on the Big Island but visiting Waikiki is special even for ""locals"". Waikiki Resort maximizes our enjoyment while keeping it affordable. We now hope to return annually. On this trip we purchased the tourist's bible ""Oahu Revealed"" and we will do more pre-planning to get the most out of our future stays.

I booked the one bedroom unit as it had the small kitchen and we wanted two rooms. I booked through Travel-Hawaii which always has good rates. I specifically requested the one bedroom King, I booked and paid for the 1-bedroom penthouse, listing all four of us. When I received my hotel confirmation, it listed two double beds, but because I looked at the hotel closely I knew the one bd units were one queen or one king only. I wrote Travel Hawaii, the rep promptly called the hotel rep and got back to me that I was in the right room but it was two doubles only. I called the hotel to double-check because this made no sense to me. Someone at the hotel had indeed decided to book us into a Jr. Suite instead of the one-bedroom: much lower floor, only one room, and no kitchen. There had not been any mention of charging me less either or any attempt to let me know they had changed the room. I told the woman I had booked, and already paid for, the one-bedroom penthouse. She told me that the hotel felt I needed the Jr. Suite because it had a sofa bed, so they changed my reservation. I told her I have inflatable beds for my children that I bring with me, we wouldn't need the sofa bed; we needed the extra room and the kitchen. She was very nice and said she would work on the problem. I wrote to Travel-Hawaii, the rep talked to the hotel rep again, and in the end we arrived and got the one-bedroom. If I hadn't followed up we would have been squashed into the smaller room without notice, because there are only a few one-bedrooms in the entire hotel, all on the top floor. After our stay I think the hotel changed it's room capacity for the one-bedroom units to two people only, which is a shame; we would stay again as a family if they hadn't. We'll take our own little inflatable beds over a used sofabed anyday, and they take up about the same amount of space. If it's just my husband and me we may stay there again someday.Other than this: the rooms were good size, the parking was easy, which is a huge plus to us. The staff very pleasant, we never used the pool because the ocean is one block away. No hot tub, but that was less important to us than location: this hotel is right by a great beach for children. The breakfast is expensive for a family so we never went to the restaurant. There are so many other places to eat and with the small fridge/microwave, dishes, counter space etc, we were set up to eat comfortably in the room. The hotel does not recycle, but the front desk told me to bring our stuff down anyway as there is a lady at the desk who takes it upon herself to recycle the glass and plastic.

Shopping and great restaurants are on your doorstep. Also public transport in the form of buses and trolleys are right there, and I was pleased I did not bother to hire a car.Service was brilliant- we needed a taxi at 4am, and the concierge made certain it happened, with a smile.

We have stayed there twice prior, living on another Island, and coming to Oahu for business and medical reasons often. Hard to believe, but we found this gem of a hotel, to be in even better shape, then the prior trips! It appears, that they are constantly redoing the place, the rooms freshly decorated too, and the restaurants so great too. Dinner at the Soul Jung Korean Restaurant, on the 2nd floor, was out of this world, totally top food, so fresh and well done. The Ilima Restaurant serves a marvelous breakfast buffet, and the service is tops too. Also, lunch and take outs. As we were there for the Super Bowl game, and had friends over to visit us in our room, we took out the caesar with chicken salads, and they were very delicious. I can not say enough great things, about the management and staff of the hotel, starting with the General Manager, Glenn Vergara, who seems to be circulating too, through out the hotel, checking on the guests needs and also the staff's. He is friendly, efficent and well liked by his staff. All in all, you feel like you are at home in this hotel, and I would highly recommend it to all travelers. Let it become, like us, there home away from home when on Oahu. May I add, that I was the prior owner, of a 4 star bed and breakfast, for many years, on the big Island,( Hilo) so I do know quality and good management. This Hotel is ran tops! From the bell captain, front desk staff, restaurant staff, you are treated like you like to be treated, not just a number.

The value of this hotel was very affordable compared to others on Waikiki. We kept the ""do not disturb"" sign on all week and just went to housekeeping to get the stuff we needed. The housekeepers were very helpful and nice. Twice, security came to our room to make sure we were okay since the do not disturb sign was out so long. Very nice. The room had a small fridge and a free safe. We were a little disappointed that the coffee pot was only a one-cup pot. Too small. And the patio door windows were really dirty, but they were offered to be cleaned for us when we mentioned it. Also, the shower was really tiny, but that wasnt a problem for us. The shower and toilet were separate from the sink/vanity which was good for us girls who were alwasy getting ready at the same time. The balcony was nice and had a partial view of the ocean.

Unfortunately, when I had booked a number of months ago, I had specifically asked for a king size bed. When we checked in we found we had two doubles instead. Two couples we were meeting arrived the following day - one had a set of doubles and the other had a king size. Interesting, that I had booked our room quite a bit of time ahead of the other two and yet did not get our king size. It would have improved my opinion. Staff was generaly helpful, but not overly so - we got whatever we asked for but no suggestions re where to eat, how to get around, etc. The only other unfortunate thing is we booked the shuttle on our last day to take us to the airport, which we did through the bell hop. The shuttle arrived, took us to the airport, and then he informed us that he wanted $1.00 per bag on top of the fare we had already paid.

Said they would have a king size open up the next day, but we were only staying two days, so we said forget it.

The Waikiki Resort is all that and more--the front desk staff was invariably pleasant and helpful when I stopped by, June (sp?) checked me in and was careful to explain that there was construction near my room and ask if that would be a problem. Since I was gone from 7am to 5pm, it wasn't. My room had a lovely lanai with an ocean and mountain view. I will say that the early morning buses lining up on the street outside were noisy, but I never travel without earplugs and they took care of that problem!Everyone was very helpful and friendly, which I know is not always the case in Waikiki. The room was very comfortable and I appreciated the safe for my notebook computer and valuables while I went out for walks on the beach. The in-room coffeemaker was nice too.

It starts with making a reservation and getting Sherrie or Derek to help you choose a room and to give you insight to the hotel. Sherrie is so pleasant. If I didn't want to book at the Waikiki Resort just talking to Sherrie would make me reserve my room. At the front desk the staff of Nancy, Branden, Mitzi, Susi and many others will make your check in, check out and stay so much more pleasant. The housekeeping staff will keep the rooms clean, well stocked and they are never intrusive.  The hotel is not a Five Star place but it is affordable, comfortable and located close to the beach and all of the Waikiki attractions. We booked a standard room and was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a Jr Suite. The room was clean, spacious and had two wall mounted flat screen T.V's. It had a kitchenette with sink,a small fridge, and coffee maker. There was no microwave. The in room safe was large enough for a notebook computer. The room had two Lanai's overlooking the city and mountains. The elevators were never a problem as there were three of them. The pool although small was clean with an ample amount of chairs. Since the beach was only a block away the pool wasn't used much. There is free Wi Fi in the lobby. There is a restaurant in the lobby the Ilima, which serves breakfast and lunch. We had breakfast there and thought that we entered another world. The service and food were both substandard. Maybe the hotel should train the restaurant wait staff in customer service. How many times does one have to request a second cup of coffee? We've been to Hawaii two other times and stayed a few blocks away at the Aston Waikiki. The Aston does not compare, the staff is not as friendly, the elevators don't work as well and the rooms are much smaller with an old fashioned Tiki montiff.  Mahalo Sherrie for driving us to the park on top of the mountain so that we could get the best view of the city. Nancy, Mahalo for the suggestion of Ono Hawaiian Foods for dinner.

We arrived a little earlier than the usual check in time but was told that our room wasn't ready yet...which we didn't have a problem with. They were able to hold our luggages while we try to kill time by roaming around the streets of waikiki and grabbing a late lunch. However, our issue came about when we came back and tried to check at around 3pm but was told that our rooms were ready yet...I guess we were just a little frustrated that we had to wait much longer considering I checked the day before to make sure the room we requested would be availabe on time on the day we arrived and the only thing we needed at time was to relax a bit after a long flight. Other than this tiny issue the rest of stay at this hotel was quite wonderful. As mentioned, location is perfect, close to everything and literally a few steps away from the beach (big +++). Cleaning staff and bell desk were extremely helpful and nice. Front desk were just so-so not sure if its because I booked our stay online through one of those discounted package sites which the first lady I spoke with at the front desk deliberately mentioned when we initially tried to check in 2 hours earlier than normal, just thought it was kind of odd. But didn't let it ruin my stay had little interaction with the front desk as they seem to be ""very busy"" all the time....I would stay here again just for the fact that it has a very nice location... quick tip though, if youre trying to save some $$$ on food, try the food court at the back of the international market place, very yummy yet wont break the bank (try the asian-hawaiian fuision and the fresh seafood stall right next to the stage - so goood!) also if you're ever going to the swap meet....you must try the ha-ling pineapple...its the best one yet....Mahalo and I can't wait to visit HI again....ALOHA","Los Angeles, California",55,4.0

It is tucked a mere half block off of Kalakaua & with easy beach access down at the Kuhio Beach end of Waikiki. It's location just off the main drag means you don't hear the incessant noise from the cars, people etc. on Kalakaua.I booked a room with two double beds via the hotel's web site for a very good rate ($84 plus taxes). My room was on the 7th floor with a partial ocean view & also a partial view of Diamond Head from my balcony. There was a large flat screen (never bothered to turn it on), a mini fridge, bureau, desk & two chairs. The hotel itself was very well sound-proofed on the interior & very quiet.Read some comments about the small size of the rooms, but I found mine quite large for one and plenty spacious for a couple, as there was ample room between & around the beds, desk, etc. Compared to most European hotel rooms it felt palatial. Personally, I can't comprehend paying twice the price for a room with more empty floor space, especially in a location like Waikiki when you're out and about the majority of the time, but to each his own.Housekeeping did a good job & there is free wifi in the lobby--which had plenty of comfortable seating. Free beach towels are provided. All staff that I interacted with were pleasant & helpful. I didn't eat at either restaurant, so I can't comment on them. The hotel does allow you to check-in & print boarding passes for flights free via a small computer room.The location is perfect & I walked all over Waikiki. The hotel is half a block from a bus stop & I took The Bus from the airport to the hotel--very easy, and also used The Bus to visit Ala Moana, Chinatown, etc. A few points that might matter to some: the shower & toilet were in a small room off of the closet/vanity/sink area which was spacious enough, but the WC/shower room was small and there was no fan. Also there is some morning noise from the trolleys & tour buses that motor down Koa. However, Honolulu is a large city, & a hotel smack in the middle of Waikiki is going to have some street noise. This hotel had much less than would be typical on a busier road as there was no late night pedestrian traffic & almost no automotive traffic.Overall a very pleasant experience & I would highly recommend it.","somewhere, here",5,4.0

Smaller than standard rooms we are used to on the mainland. It felt a bit cramped for a family of four, but we didnt spend much time there. The bathroom had the smallest bathtub I have ever seen. It measured approx. 31/2 ft in lengh. My housekeeping experience wasnt as good as others have mentioned. There were only two towels for four people which became frustrating.

I'm a local girl and I HATE Waikiki! We avoid it at all costs when we return home to Hawai'i. That said, there are very few options outside of Waikiki if you need to stay in a hotel on O'ahu. After obsessively going over TripAdvisor reviews of dozens of hotels, I reluctantly booked two rooms at the Waikiki Resort for a week (March 16-23). I'm mostly glad I did.Mitzi was amazing at the front desk when we checked in. She was friendly and competently answered our many questions... sometimes even before we asked them. (The front desk demonstration at check-in about how to use the shower fixtures seemed comical, but was obviously necessary.) Her instructions on parking, validating the ticket, etc. were all clear and precise. She and the rest of the hotel staff didn't treat we locals poorly, as many hotel employees who are ""transplants"" to Hawai'i sometimes do.Don't try to park in the underground garage if you have a large vehicle. We had a Chrysler mini-van that couldn't fit into more than a couple of spots. It's a tight maneuver around a very tiny garage. Park in the outside lot. It's easier on everyone in the car! There was a special event on the first evening and a parking attendant in the outside lot told me I had to park underground because the outside lot gate was ""broken"". (In the upright position?) I told him that I absolutely refused to park underground again since my van didn't fit the parking spaces. He looked perturbed, muttered -- and all of a sudden he made the gate ""work"". Hmm. I wonder if he was pocketing the cash the special event people were handing him. I informed Mitzi about the encounter and she said that she'd address it.Overall, it was a great stay. There was no construction going on. The hotel is small, clean, rooms adequate, bathroom and shower cleaner than most hotels. With a few notable exceptions, the hotel was quiet, considering it is in the heart of Waikiki. Housekeeping is diligent and friendly and eager to assist guests. Our housekeeper, ""Young"", was exceptional. Hotel security is amazing! I reported an unattended suitcase in the hallway that had been there for 30 minutes. They responded within 1 minute to check it out. When we had noisy neighbors one night at midnight, they were at their door within 2 minutes of my phone call. Security is seen doing their rounds regularly. The hotel's location allowed our local family members to easily pick us up when needed. Waikiki beach may be one block away, but it is too crowded, dirty and commercialized to enjoy. We spent most of our beach time at other beaches on the island.The one thing that made this a less-than-perfect stay was when a large group of teenagers checked into the hotel the last 2 days. What a racket! The housekeeper said that this band/choir checks into the hotel every year. She seemed very relieved that she didn't have to work on the ""lower floors"" where they were housed. They screamed and yelled while in the rooftop pool just to hear themselves echoing off the surrounding buildings. On our last night at the hotel, they gathered (around midnight for an hour and a half) on their balconies to chant, scream and holler in unison to people on the street. In the morning, they played their band instruments and ""sang"" on the balconies. Upon check-out I reported this to the front desk who genuinely didn't seem to know that this was going on. The front desk manager came to talk with me and apologized profusely and said that he would be speaking with the group's sponsors. He stated that he was surprised and that the hotel always adds more security when a large group like this stays there.If I absolutely had to stay in Waikiki again, I'd consider staying here. However, I'd make damn sure that no band/choir adolescent group was going to be there!",Northern California,44,4.0

Family orientated, happy welcoming staff, entire place is very clean, within one block of Waikiki beach, walking distance to shopping and the many eating places, felt very safe day or night, bus line available 1 block away and I parked my rental car on-site, self-service laundry, beach towels available. I had a standard room with two queen beds located on the 12th floor, facing east. The closest resort was across the street so that I didn't have to look directly into another resort or apartment. It never bothered me that I couldn't see the ocean or diamond head since I only had to walk 1 block to see the sunset. Expect the sounds of a busy vacation spot during the day. It quiets down at night or take a drive to another part of the island. We did and had the beach area to ourselves. My room was supplied with a small refrigerator, coffee maker, new furnishings, flat screen, new clean mattress. We had the choice to swim in the pool or ocean. Check out the swap meet for major savings on the same items sold at the local stores at a fraction of the price. It's held at the Aloha Stadium every Weds, Sat, Sunday.

This Hotel fitted the bill and exceeded our expectations by a long shot. We arrived early and as our room wasn't to be ready until 3pm, we had breakfast at a nearby restaurant and then returned to the hotel and relaxed by the pool until it was ready for us. We had booked a standard room but were pleasantly surprised to be told that we had been given an upgrade to a suite on the 14th floor. The suite was well laid out with comfortable seating and a flat screened tv. There was a small, well equipped kitchen corner and a balcony offering views across the city. We had a small view of the beach and surfers between two of the buildings, but as the beachfront was literally 100metres from the front entrance of the Hotel that didn't matter. There was a well stocked gift shop and two restaurants within the Hotel, but we were more interested in trying a variety of different places so did not eat at either of them. This Hotel is used by Korean Airlines aircrew and passengers, so the restaurants focused on Korean foods.We didn't have a lot of contact with the staff, but what little we did found them to be helpful and courteous. Best thing about this Hotel is location and cost. Only disadvantage we found was that our room was right next to the lifts and could be a little noisy because of that.

The overall deal was a real bargin especially for a hotel in a good location and so close to the Waikiki beach.Before arrival I had requested for a room on the higher floor with a nice view (I booked for Partial Ocean View Room) and got a very nice room on the 15th floor. Very nice view of the ocean (partially blocked by the 2 hotels in the front) and the room was of good size, very clean and new with flat screen TV, lots of channels to choose from, basic amenities included, but the mattress was kind of soft.

I always check every single review on al lot of different hotels so decided to write one myself this time. Before we decided which hotel to stay, I again checked many reviews. First I considered to stay in the Coconut Waikiki hotel (often number 1 on these websites). After I spoke to some locals from Hawaiian Airlines and a local travel agency I changed my mind. Both explained to me, that if I wanted to save some money, the Waikiki Resort hotel would be a much better choice. They said it to be recently renovated (which is true, and I am sure construction has been finished by now) and they told me location wise this hotel was a much better choice. Why pay more for a longer walk to the beach or centre while in the mean time both hotels are said to serve good quality? You should save the money to make some good trips. Location: After I have seen where the Coconut Waikiki (which sure is a good hotel too) hotel is located I don't regret my choice. The Waikiki Resort hotel is seriously 1 minute away from the beach and the boulevard. I haven't had any trouble with traffic or any other disturbing noices. My room was on the 5th floor.Service: Great! When we arrived there weren't any standard rooms with King bed available (which we booked) and we got an upgrade to a Junior Suite. Transfer is easy to arrange with the bell boy and saves money on the taxi. Check out time is 12, which I find very reasonable. Staff is always ready to help. Room: spacious. Has 2 flat screens, a kitchenette with (empty) refrigerator (which you can fill with supplies from the ABC shops that are located on every corner of the street) and a coffeemaker (with complementary coffe). Junior Suite has seperate living room. We had 2 balconies. To be honest, the bathroom looked good, was absolutely recently renovated, but is small. Not too small, but this is something that must be said. Shower is great however. No bath. Room was very clean. Housekeeping did good job. Save some money?- Parking at the hotel is rather expensive (as for any hotel in Waikiki I guess). Location of the hotel is good, since parking around the Zoo is free. Lots of space every day. It's a 5 minute walk along the boulevard to get there. - You will find ABC shops every 100m. Shop is reasonably priced, so you can get supplies for your refrigerator or trips. - I expected Hawaii to be expensive. This appeared to be untrue. There are a lot of restaurants and bars with reasonably priced food. - Car rental: Many reviews advise you not to rent a car. Although the bus system is good, it takes a lot of time to travel around. You won't reach the good places and you won't have the time to look around and enjoy all the amazing views. We rented a car via www.discounthawaiicarrental.com which is a bargain. It is worth it! We spend two days driving around the island, which is sufficient. Besides this, the island is great. Better than I expected! There is a lot to do and there are many good beaches.

The beach area by the hotel is protected by a lava rock jetty so its very calm and warm in the water. Shallow too. I had no problem letting my 10 yr old run around here. The only complaint I had with the hotel is that the pool is NOT heated. This is the norm for Waikiki hotels, but you know what guys that is NO Excuse!! Guests in the 21 century EXPECT the pool to be heated. The pool was useless and ICEcold. Speaking of which the only ice macine in the hotel is on the 2nd floor by the pool. Could use one on every floor.The hotel had coin operated laundry in the basement parkade which came in handy as well.This was one of the few ""Budget"" hotels that I have stayed in at Waikiki that actually had a full tub. Everything in the room was modern, we had a small 2' cube fridge that was ice cold and came in handy for snacks. This hotel is 4 blocks from the Food Pantry the only full grocery store in Waikiki.There was a business center and free Wifi in the lobby. Internet ws $10/day if you wanted it in your room. There was no gym, but there was a full 24 hr fitness place across the street that guests got a discount at. Parking was a steep $18/day for guests and there wernt tons of spots. The room also had a free large safe that could old a 15"" laptop.I would stay here again in a heart beat and for the price it was a steal.","Saskatoon, Canada",1500,4.0

We stayed at the Waikiki Resort Hotel. Overall, the hotel was nice for the money we paid - the staff was helpful and friendly when we checked in. We got a newly renovated room (clean - but we don't think the bed sheets were changed daily - just made back up daily - we had to write a note to ask for new bed sheets - we left a cherrio on the bed to test and when we came back in the evening - the bed was made up but as we lifted the cover, the cherrio was there). It is a little noisy on some mornings (garbage trucks go by and tour buses go by), but since we usually wake up pretty early in the morning, it was okay for us. It is 1 short block to the BEACH. I would skip the hotel buffet and grab the coupon and activities guides in the kiosks along Kalahaua St - main street on the beach side to find great deals on food and shopping. We found one place that was really good - Shorebirds - we went there for breakfast and the price was reasonable for a breakfast buffet (2 people adults and a 3 year old - $20). The place was right on the beach so that was an added treat. HOWEVER - the best deals were found in the Entertainment Book. I highly recommend getting an Entertainment Book before going to HI. We got our entertainment book coupons online from the travel site where we booked out package, however I think the actual book might have better deals after talking with some of the cashiers. We paid $10 to get the online access for Entertainment and easily made that $10 investment back up in one activity. We saved countless dollars using the other coupons we chose. For example, we got $45 off on the Polynesian Culture Center activity - for parasailing, it was buy one get one free ($30 value) - for the Magic of Polynesia (show only - it was a buy one get one free couple ($52 value) - As you can tell, the Entertainment Book is WORTH getting - you will get the money you spent on it back and then some since it has shopping coupons and food coupons. Restaurant Picks... Jimmy Buffett's was great, Senor Frogs was great, Cheesecake Factory is always good, if you like korean food (me bbq right behind the hotel is really good and inexpensive), La Cucaracha is okay (behind the hotel), but the service is not all that great... I would recommend staying away from the chinese restaurants in Waikiki - particularly the ones in hotels or in major shopping malls. They are over-priced and the food is not all that great. The Aloha Tower has a really good Japanese Sushi buffet - weeknights require waiting and is about $30 per person. Lunch is more reasonable at $17 per person with pretty much the same selection as dinner less lobster.MUST DO things before leaving Oahu: 1) Parasailing, 2) Jetskiing, 3) Magic of Polynesia Magic Show, 4) Pearl Harbor, 5) Hanauma Bay - Swimming and Snorkeling, 6) Polynesia Culture Center, and 7) International Market Place. Of course... also just relaxing on the beach and catching the wonderful sun rays.Make sure to bring really comfortable shoes, because I guarantee you that you will be walking ALOT. If you are into getting self-portraits - there is an Asian guy who comes out at night on Kalakaua Street (around 10 ish pm) to do drawings - his drawings are SUPERB... they are life like to the shadows. He doesn't have a set fee but rather draws for donations ! So whatever you think his work is worth - that's what you would pay him. This is a definite ""check out"" thing in case you want a real life portrait of you - looks like he uses charcoal as his drawing medium. This is NOT a caricature, it is a real life duplication of you - except he's drawing you. We were thinking wow and we wanted one - but the wait was really long.We hope you enjoy your trip to Oahu as much as we have - we really tried to highlight all the things that were fun to do... we did all of the ""must do"" things with our 3 year old - she enjoyed it all... it was a most wonderful and memorable vacation.",California,48,4.0

The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge, who we even called a few times from the road while sightseeing for directions and tips.

Very close to the main avenue with restaurants and shops. Helpful staff. They have a room in the lobby with about 3 computers with free internet service; most of the time there is a computer available. Sound proof elevators. I stayed on the 12th floor, with a city mountain view, one large king size bed. The room was clean, the bed comfortable. Good size balcony. Negatives:No Continental breakfast. They have a restaurant in the lobby. The issues is that the food is way overpriced. The breakfast meal I think was around $15 for all you can eat buffet. The restaurant of course was mostly empty, given the numerous other restaurants and fast food joints in close proximity with much more reasonable prices. The doors to all rooms, at least on the 12th floor slam when they close. Also the hotel I noticed had sort of connection to Korean Airlines, they would have multiple parties of people staying together. This was an issue for a few night as they had a large party staying in a few rooms next to mine, and when they would enter and leave the rooms the doors would slam very loud. Also there was no workout room. The TV service was terrible. Although I had a flat screen TV, the service was poor quality. There was no movie service available. The local TV programs with Waikiki activities etc. did not work. But this was a minor issue as most people don't go to Waikiki to watch TV. Conclusion: Overall good hotel, the higher the floor you stay on the better it gets. A few issues no continental breakfast, no workout room, weak TV service, and load closing doors.",springs99,1,3.0

This hotel was fantastic especially for my 2 boys. We had a deluxe ocean view studio. It had a kitchenette, nothing big but had the necessitys like a micro,fridge and even dishes. The room was able to connect to my father n laws room whos room was a bit smaller than ours but was just fine for him since he was alone. The view from the balcony was great the beach was literally right there. The beach was only 1 block away and ""hawaii"" blocks are small. ABC stores on every corner which made it great to pick up snacks on the way back from the beach. Pacific Beach hotel was across the street, That is where most of the touring companys pick up so that was very convenient for us. Overall the hotel stay was great and if you are traveling with kids and are on a budget this is the place to stay without having to worry about a run down hotel. There was flat screen tvs in our rooms as well. Ask for a corner room facing the beach or else you might get stuck in the middle and have to stare into the hotel across the street.

I'm from NYC, so I'm used to small hotel rooms, but it was not only extremely small, but it was very very outdated and rundown. We considered switching hotels until we talked to the front desk and we were told that we could upgrade our room to a larger ocean view room for an additional $30 a day. Since we already got a good deal through expedia, we decided to take the upgrade. The larger room was much better, since the beautiful ocean view makes anything better. However, it was still very rundown and in great need of remodeling. The walls and furniture have smudges on them, the wall paper is peeling, the showers are tiny and old, there's no room service or concierge, the beds are old and uncomfortable, and everything looks like it hasn't been updated since the early 90's. All this said, however, it has a very convenient location, right by Waikiki beach, it's in a safe neighborhood, they have their own parking lot, their free shampoos and soaps smell nice, and if you're in to Korean food, they have a great Korean restaurant in the hotel that serves good Korean food for all three meals a day. Also, it is affiliated with Korean Airlines in some way, so if you have Korean Airlines mileage, you may get a discount, and it's very Korean friendly, with the Korean speaking workers and the Korean restaurant. I probably wouldn't stay here again for vacation purposes, but if you want a good deal for a very average room at a hotel by the ocean, and you don't care about any luxury amenities, it's fine.","Frankfurt, Germany",1,2.0

This hotel hit a home run in both ways. They were undergoing a renovation to correct past shortcomings and to get more up to date, but there was very little inconvenience other than one of the 3 elevators being worked on while we were there. One renovatation was the addition of a nice large flat screen TV on the wall that added lots of room to the average size rooms. We got an oceanview room that had a partial view of the ocean and the surfers on the beach. It was great to go out on the lanaii to have a morning cup of coffee and to watch the city wake up to another day in Paradise. cities are by their nature busy, but Honolulu is probably the most laid back city I've ever been in, so the crowded Waikiki area isn't as bad as you would think.What made the hotel one of the best I've stayed in was the staff. They were smiling, friendly, and genuinely wanted to be of service and to please. We noticed the heavy Korean influence in the hotel and found out it was Korean owned and had just hired an California based management company. The large numbers of Koreans and the presence of a Korean Airlines office made for a nice experience in a hotel that was full of guests. The staff was so service oriented and anticipated our needs that we almost forgot we were in a nearly full hotel instead of being the only guests in the hotel. We especially liked the 2 restaurants, one an upscale Korean/Asian one and the other a Hawaiian/American style one. the food was top notch and the service was sparkling.The half block distance to the beach and closeness to the middle of Waikiki's shopping and night life make this an excellent choice in a headquarters for a visit to Oahu. All the tour busses stop there and they have an underground parking floor in the basement with an elevator that goes straight up to your room. Also, good deals can be had on rental cars and my advice is to take your GPS system with you or rent one. They are great and take a lot of stress out of driving in an unknown area with long and hard to pronounce names!The Waikiki Resort Hotel made us very happy on our trip and I highly recommend it to others who want a good value hotel near the beach.Tha Laird","Gulf Shores, Alabama",10,5.0

I was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews on this site. We booked a package deal with flight through a tour provider, so I don’t know what the rates were. I’m guessing they were about $100 a night for 6 nights in mid-February. We were primarily there for the Police concerts (which ROCKED btw) so the hotel didn’t concern us much. It’s not like we were on our honeymoon, and we don’t typically stay at plush places anyway. As long as the hotel is safe, clean and quiet, we are OK. The Waikiki Resort Hotel was all three. Prior to arriving, I’d emailed the hotel’s customer service department and asked for a room away from the elevator because I ALWAYS end up near the elevator. When we got there, the room they initially assigned to us was on the 9th floor directly across from the elevator. As soon as we got in the room, I called the front desk and explained my earlier request. They moved us to another room right away. They even let me look at it first (with a security guard). In fact, Adam at the front desk was very helpful. We took the second room on the 18th floor. It was Penthouse E. But before you get excited, the penthouse is the same as other rooms. Nothing different. We had two full beds and a fridge. The room was clean, as was the whole hotel. The AC hadn’t been turned on and was locked, so I called Adam again. He said he’d send a maintenance man ASAP. When the maintenance man didn’t arrive after about 25 minutes, I called Adam again and he apologized profusely and the maintenance man was at our door in 5 minutes. Later in our stay, the AC got locked again in the on position (a little too cold) and we called again. A maintenance man was there right away to adjust it. This time, my husband watched how he unlocked the thermostat in case we needed to do it again. The view from the room was the neighborhood and hills behind the hotel. Since we didn’t spend a lot of time in the room that was fine. At night, the view was very cool. The lights from the houses on the hills curved and reminded us of lava flowing down the hills. Very cool.Speed of the elevators is fine.The shower IS tiny. I had to figure out a way to shave my legs w/o getting water on the floor. My husband is very tall and the showerhead height was OK for him. But if you are a heavy person, the shower stall will definitely be too small for you. We left our maid $2 each day and our request for more towels on the first day was filled and we never had to ask again. We didn’t request clean sheets every day (in fact we told the maid to leave them). We don’t change the sheets every day at home, why would I waste laundry water somewhere else? We got lotion, shampoo and soap. The vent in the toilet/shower stall area was filthy inside, but since you don’t spend a lot of time in there, who cares?The good: Price, cleanliness and quiet. This is a small hotel compared to most in Waikiki or Honolulu. It’s really not a RESORT, though that’s in the title. And I was fine with that. Several friends stayed at the Hawaiian Hilton Village (HHV). Wow. That’s a HUGE resort. It kept going and going. Everything was SOOOOO expensive (food, drinks) and it was very, very, very busy. There was always a long line to check in. The HHV has a lot of bars, restaurants and shops, but it was too bustling for my taste. We were OK with the laid back atmosphere at Waikiki Resort Hotel (WRH)Location: less than a block to the beach in front, less than a block to the bus stops on the street behind the hotel. A McDonald’s and Burger King w/in a minute’s walk and Starbucks and Subway w/in a 4 minute walk. There are three ABC stores w/in a 2 minute walk, two in front of the hotel and one behind. The beach is a 60 second walk. It’s pretty busy in that area, but walk a few minutes toward Diamond Head and the park and the beach is less packed. Ritzy shopping is just a few blocks away as are the zoo and aquarium.My husband rented a longboard and the bell hop stored it for $5 a day, which was very convenient. The local surfers were helpful to him too, which he’d heard is not always the case. But surfing was fine.Refrigerator – buy beer and water at ABC, save $$$$$.The staff was pleasant/helpful each time we spoke with them. Ask for the bus map.The bad: The business center didn’t have a printer so I couldn’t print our boarding passes to fly home. That seems stupid. The hotel should get a printer and charge people 5 cents for a sheet of paper if they are worried about waste. The business center was $7/hr. I heard (but did not confirm) that the HHV was $7.50 for 15 minutes!Shower size – already discussedPool – it was nothing to write home about. Very sparse area. If you want a fabulous poolside experience, you need to go to someplace like the HHV (though HHV is very strict about what can go in the pool – no beach balls, no kid floaties, etc.)The room doors were heavy and noisy. Even if you tried to shut them quietly, they banged. This was the only noise we heard from our neighbors except when they talked in the hall. We could not hear them in the next room.Notes: The city bus to the Pearl Harbor/Arizona memorial took an hour to get there and 80 minutes to get back. Cheap and easy, but if you don’t have the time to spare, take a shuttle (not a cab!) The bus was very easy to use but we did find that there were fewer routes on the weekends and evenings so we had to take cabs a few times to get to places on time.Do not try to walk to the Diamond Head visitor’s center. It’s too far combined with the hike to the top (which is totally worth it). Take the bus there.We found a great hole in the wall for breakfast. Leave the hotel and go to the street behind it where the bus stops are. Turn left at the ABC store on the corner. Walk straight until you see a tiny little park (like a triangle) with a statue of a woman and a goose (?) in the middle. There is a restaurant called Hula Girl (not to be confused with the expensive Hula Grill at one of the beach hotels) on the side street on the side of the park closest to Diamond Head and WRH. If the waitress calls you “pretty lady” or “handsome man,” you’re in the right place. The waitress alone is worth the 5 minute walk! The food was very reasonably priced compared to other places.If you like the TV show LOST, take the Lost tour through Big Kahuna tours.

It wasn't exactly fancy, but it was clean and had a beautiful view of Waikiki beach and Diamond Head. It is located a half block from the beach and within walking distance of tons of shopping and dining. Oh, and the price. I booked through the hotel's website and got a special for $82 a night! Can't beat it, especially in Waikiki where your typical not-fancy hotel goes for at least $200/night. The staff if friendly enough and very helpful. I didn't bother with the restaurant because it was a bit pricey (but the Sunday brunch in the hotel across the street is definitely worth a splurge!) Also, if you stay at this hotel and want are looking for an awesome surfing instructor, walk about 2 blocks west (just before the King's Cross shopping plaza) and talk to Eric. He gave a great lesson, I got up on my third wave (and many subsequent ones!) and he probably stayed out there for an extra hour with me at no extra charge! He really wants you to learn and love surfing! But I digress. Simply, this hotel isn't going to be a super romantic, upscale place but if you're going to Hawaii on a budget, you can't beat it.

With taxes this room was around $100 a night.A two minute walk to the beach to see a beautiful sunset. For the price you get a big bang for a buck. This place is in the center of every place. The bus stop is around 100 yards away on Kuhio Ave. Our favorite restaurant in Waikiki is Duke's Canoe Club.

However, once you get into your room, you notice that there's a bit of wear-and-tear in the furniture and the bathroom. The bedsheets and towels are clean but they are a bit worn out as well. It is clear that the hotel was once glamorous but with the passage of time it has been allowed to slowly decay. I stayed there in June, which is the low season for Hawaii because it is summer in the northern latitudes. The price of the hotel was not cheap but not very expensive either (approx. US$95), which allowed me to spend the money saved on hotel for other things like entertainment, good food, and Aloha shirts. The hotel is in a great location: it's one block away from the beach and there are numerous shops and restaurants nearby. Since I spent most of my time outside and not so much time in the hotel room, I ignored the lack of luxury of the hotel. Overall, I recommend this hotel for a few nights but don't expect much in the way of creature comforts here. By the way, there is no internet connection in the rooms, but there are computers in the lobby area where you can use the internet for US$7/hour.","Toronto, Canada",172,3.0

The person who did check us in was almost brusque in that she really just wanted us all out of her hair. She never smiled once, in fact, no hotel staff ever smiled at us. The room - It is VERY dated, white varnish furniture from the 80's. Everything was clean, but cheap and uncomfortable. The first problem came here - the bedding had holes in it. We called to ask for new bedding and were told that they could not accomodate that. That's all they said, and anything else I said was given a response of ""we can not accmodate that"" - as if that was all the English she knew. Second problem - the gauge for the AC, or the thing that lets you control how cold it gets in the room did not work. we turned it to one end and did other stuff for half an hour and nothing changed, then we turned it to the other end and left for 2 hrs and nothing changed. We called about that and they said they could get someone to come and fix it in two days. We were only staying another two nights and so just said they can do whatever they want.Third problem - the fridge, the old mini-fridge that they said their rooms would have. well, they had one. it just didn't work. we asked for them to take a look at it and maybe fix it and surprise, they sent someone to look at it. well, the person said that we were right, it didn't work. but they wouldn't be able to put another one into the room for a week or so. On the plus side - they did a thorough job of cleaning the room everyday since we did track in a good deal of sand.The location of this place is GREAT.The parking in the place is really tight.We weren't expecting much, mostly b/c it was so cheap, but what we got was even less.

We booked our stay through a local travel agent, and I must admit, the only brief I gave the agent was that our accommodation should be central and inexpensive. He came back with the Waikiki Resort Hotel and a price - I duly looked the hotel up on their web site; it looked ok, so I confirmed my ok back to the travel agent.About a week later a friend referred me to this web site, and out of interest I looked up this hotel. After reading some of the less than complimentary reviews I 'll confess to becoming worried about my decision to stay here.However, I'm happy to report that for the most part, our hotel stay was enjoyable and we experienced no problems with our room or the service.If you're considering shelling out your hard-earned on staying here, then what you'll get is a clean, well serviced room, in easy walking distance to the beach, restaurants, bars and public transport.The rooms are of good standard (if a little dated) for what this is (3 star accommodation) - if you are expecting a room that is the standard of the Sheraton et al - then you will be disappointed - its not 5 star, and doesn't advertise itself as such. The hotel caters for all, but is heavily reliant upon Japanese and South Korean tourists, and as such, the restaurants and staff are skewed in their favour. None the less, I found the staff to be courteous and helpful.I note that someone else made a note about the pool - I can confirm that it isn't heated and is extremely cold - I'd suggest you confine your aquatic activities to the beach - the water is warmer there.If you're a first timer to Hawaii like we were, I can recommend day trips to K'uoloa(not sure of the correct spelling) Ranch (Horse riding, quad bikes and 4 wheel drive tours) and the all day snorkelling and whale watching catamaran cruise on the K'Olina (once more, not entirely sure of the spelling) which was great value. The guys operating at the tour info desk next to the car rental desk in the lobby should be able to help you.Good quality affordable dining that I'd recommend (and within easy walking distance) - Lu Lu's Wakiki Surf Club, Dukes, Cheesebugers in Paradise.","Melbourne, Australia",12,3.0

As many of the reviews mention, the Waikiki Resort Hotel has a great location, just a short walk to the beach and a few blocks from the city's bustling tourist center. It is pretty evident the hotel caters mainly to the Korean traveler--especially groups--although they treat all guest with the same friendly manner. There's a hotel store stocked with items labeled in Korean, alongside your usual sundries. There's a Korean restaurant, Seoul Jung (they have karaoke), and an unremarkable cafe, Ilima Cafe, which serves American and Asian fare (neither restaurant appealed to us). Our non-smoking, city-view room, which we paid $85/night, was on the 9th floor. We noticed problems with the elevators. They worked, but were inefficient--one time we waited for several minutes as other guests started to accumulate around us waiting, and by the time it came, only a few of us could get into it. Not a problem unless you are trying to catch a tour bus. The room was your basic budget room. No real extras, but we did have a small lanai. There was a safe in the room, but it was an extra charge of $2/day. Bathroom was very tiny, not uncommon in Waikiki with a shower/bath. But forget about taking a bath, unless you are Mini-Me. We didn't spend much time in the room. There are 2 ABC stores within a couple blocks where you can stock up on anything. Great restaurants are within walking distance. The bus stop is conveniently around the corner. The hotel has a business center, but we couldn't print anything from the Internet. If you want free Internet, there's the Coconut Cafe around the block that offered free Wifi.

The best thing about this hotel was that it was only about a block from Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean & comfortable, though the decor was a tad dated & could have used some modernizing. This hotel seemed characteristic of many of the Waikiki-area hotels in this price range -- old and outdated, but relatively clean & comfortable. We've stayed in much worse places, but then if you're looking for luxury & lavishness, you wouldn't be looking in this price range anyway... :)","Vancouver, BC",4,3.0

Did need some updating. Room was clean, once again nothing fancy. Bathroom had very small tub (more like shower only). We had city view. I felt very safe here. Security was all over. Found good rate on their web site that included breakfast. Had to choose from American (eggs, meat, toast), Japanese style, Hawaiian French Toast, Pancakes, or cold cereal. The hotel is only 1 block from the beach, about 1-1/2 blocks from the main part of Waikiki, and 1 1/2 blocks to the International Marketplace. Staff friendly. Charged extra for in-room safe. I would definately stay here again!","Lancaster, Tx",3,4.0

The staff were nice and helpful. We got a low rate, therefore the room was nothing special (like all the others). Next time I would stay higher up, since there are condos directly looking in if your room is on the back (too bad there are no sheers). I had to bring my own coffee maker and blowdryer. There is cheap laundry in the basement and parking $6 night. The dresser/vanity in the room was falling apart so we couldn't use the drawers. The TV had lots of channels and Pay Movies. There was lots of hot water all the time. The shower/small bathtub and toilet are separate from the sink which works well. ABC stores on every corner, and MacDonalds & Starbucks close. We felt safe in this area.","Vancouver, BC",3,3.0

The hotel is a block from Waikiki Beach and close to everything including the zoo and aquarium. The room was clean and comfortable. Derek at the reservations desk is very accommodating and helpful. I've already booked my next trip back for November!","Huntington Beach, CA",4,3.0

There were 3 of us in the room , and it was plenty spacious. We had a partial ocean view room with a great view. The location, which is half a block away from the beach, was within walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go including restaurants, shows, and shopping. The hotel personnel were friendly and helpful. As with all hotels, there were little things that needed fixing or updating, but that is to be expected. The refrigerator in the room worked well, and was handy for keeping beverages and fruit. It would have been nice to have a hairdryer in the bathroom, but we brought our own anyway. We will definitely stay there again.","Fargo, ND",4,4.0
