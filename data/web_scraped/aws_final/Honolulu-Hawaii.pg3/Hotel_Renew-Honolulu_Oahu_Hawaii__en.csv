I called for rates, answered by Adrian Perez, hotel GM, but by the humble, courteous way he took my reservation I would never have guessed his position. We were graciously allowed an early check in, and upon entering the lobby, I immediately noticed the immaculate cleanliness as well as the stylish interior designs. The room furnishings were the same, everything being well-made, and in a sleek contemporary style. I was blown away by how white-glove clean the entire hotel was, and I felt protected by the crisp, sanitary air conditioning. Robes were hanging in our closet. The pool is beautiful, but will remain closed through the Coronavirus stay-home orders. The bed was perfect - heavy, firm, cool, and covered by quality high-thread linens. The few staff who we encountered were all full of Aloha Spirit and old-school hospitality. I thanked GM Adrian for the hotel experience, and it was really hard to do this review, because I wouldn't have minded keeping this gem hidden and nestled out of view.",,3,5.0

We were in town for a Dr. appt. for my pregnancy and didn't have the extra funds to book a fancy resort, but this felt like one! The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. They offer some fun, free ""wellness perks"" that are included as part of your resort free. I always pay the fee anyway, so it was nice to see something come of it. I had my Chinese New Year astrology reading, and a wellness beverage. It was fun and relaxing. The best part is the location to the beach. My 2-year old daughter could walk there without being carried, and the hotel provided free beach towels, beach toys, beach floaties, and beach chairs! Our daughter was in heaven :) Good restaurants nearby including Denny's and Wolfgang Puck to go (breakfast waffle highly recommended) and mac n' cheese for the little one. It's also right next to ABC store (practically located in their lobby). Only advice I would give is to just pay the extra $35 for parking. Otherwise it's $6/2-hours on the street and you end up paying most of the $35 anyway. We didn't pay it the last day and just parked at the zoo which was $3/2-hours but we weren't parking overnight so it made more sense. Loved the layout, cleanliness and comfort of the rooms. Have a great time! Thanks to Stephanie for the wellness perks!",,0,4.0

It's less than a block away from the beach, and walking distance to so many restaurants, cafes, shops, etc. My room was clean and had a nice view of the ocean, from only the 5th floor. My housekeeper was great too - i was taking two showers a day on this trip and she left me extra towels and shampoo so I wouldn't run out! Of course not everything went perfectly smoothly: on the first morning the coffee bar attendant I guess was out sick so I mentioned to the front desk that I 'really' needed my morning coffee and they set up a self service coffee station in the lobby to accommodate us caffeine fiends. Great service on that front! I don't drink but they also had a decent group of folks partaking at the bar in the afternoons, which looked fun.As for the local area, I didn't venture too far from the hotel - had a dinner at momosan (a noodle & izakaya bar) one night which was amazing, also ventured over to the international market place and ate at paia fishmarket which was also really good - definitely better than I anticipated! Of course there are a ton of other options too which drew a lot of the tourists.finally I really enjoyed running around the local area for my daily workouts - if you go right out of the hotel up to the canal then west til you have to cross a bridge but instead head down back towards the beach and run back along the beachfront back to the hotel, that was about a 3.5 mile loop which was perfect for me. Also had plenty of opportunities to stop and snap some ig-worthy pics along the beach.overall it was a fantastic hotel with great service in a prime location. Definitely recommend and would return.","Santa Rosa, California",7,5.0

It was the calming environment I expected based on the reviews. The hotel has great midcentury ambiance and is nicely appointed for its boutique category. I would definitely stay there again.LOCATION: On the East end of Waikiki next to the zoo, the hotel is one block from the beach and 2 blocks from the park where there is ample space for yoga and running trails with a view of Diamond Head. Unfortunately it is requires navigating through various homeless camps, which can be uncomfortable for those not used to panhandling. The hotel also is on an alley that tends to be noisy, even at midnight so the earplugs I always pack were quite handy. Easy to walk to many restaurants and shops on the main streets.AMENTIES: I didn't make use of them as I was out at a conference all day, but there was a $25/day charge for beach towels (in very good condition and smelled clean), free yoga mat (and other exercise equipment) to borrow, as well as nearby yoga class, onsite tarot/horoscope readings and mini facials. Downstairs cafe had yummy looking snacks/food and beverages that appeared to be high quality. They will provide a disposable hot beverage cup with hot water if requested. Also is a water refill station that is extremely useful! Keep in mind there is no pool here or hot tub.ROOM: The decor was described, but more worn down than expected. The window shades were off track, which made opening and closing daily a bit of a pain. The thermostat/AC cover had broken rails, which decreased the overall ambiance. Lighting was sufficient, but the switches did not make sense. There are robes, no slippers, a safe, mini refrigerator, and seating for 1. Towels were clean and fluffy, and toiletries were excellent. The bathroom window did not shut completely, which allowed my hand washed items (quick dry work out clothes) to dry easily, but also gave a draft which was a bit chilly in Feb, and I imagine hot in the summer. Bed pillows were plentiful, but sheets had a very faint sour smell that perhaps most people would not notice (I unfortunately have super senses; not bad enough to request new ones).","San Francisco, California",18,4.0

I don’t see any reviews about the wellness side of this little gem. I am all into health and wellness but I would only consider it partly about your wellness. Yes there are exercise equipment available to bring into your room but there is not much room to move around. There is no gym, pool, or spa BUT There is a $15 day pass to another hotel’s gym when we are already paying the $25 daily resort fee. We shouldn’t have to PAY to go somewhere out of our way to work out comfortably. Not a good way to make up for something that you don’t have, I might as well should’ve stayed at that hotel where it may have been included in the resort fee. The staff is very friendly, cleanliness was good overall. Being that this is a wellness boutique hotel I found it interesting that there was a wellness concierge. I think her name was Tiffany. She sits near the elevator in a corner, very friendly and was very helpful with all of our questions and always smiling. Only thing I thought that was unusual is that as a concierge at a HOTEL there should be a desk? The wellness concierge is in a dark corner near the elevator in case you miss it. You won’t know that its a concierge until she comes up to you to greet you and let you know who they are, which was nice of her to do because I wouldn’t have known ONLY because...Nothing against the concierge but just the whole “Wellness concierge” at a “Wellness hotel” the set up looked very tacky being that she only had a table and 2 chairs. To be honest it looks kind of sad being it doesn’t look very professional looking like a normal concierge desk. I found it funny when another guest asked her when she was going to get a “real desk”. The owners or whoever is in charge should save up on getting a real desk and work on that if that’s what the hotel is supposedly all about. For the $25 amenity fee I wish that I would be taken in for the facial but it was so limited. HOW MANY People are staying in the hotel and we are all limited to one day and only 4 people out of how many are allowed to go. It kind of shows a reflection of how cheap management is. 4 out of 5 people would rather choose the facial than cleaning up the beach and doing yoga. There’s 2 days of yoga, there should be 2 days of facials instead. Overall staff was very nice which is what made up for some stuff. I would recommend people to stay here if its maybe just a couple nights. I thoughT that the water station was a plus. I don’t know what Shane’s position was but he was all over the place as the jack of all trades. Refrigerated items near the bar were overpriced thank god ABC store was right next door with way cheaper prices. Would I return? Maybe if I’m staying for 1 or 2 nights. I liked how close the beach was and the strip and a lot of restaurants all over the place. There could be a little bit of improvements but other than that its not bad.","Los Angeles, California",0,3.0

The decor is clean and simple, with a bit of an Asian feel. It is located one short block from the hubbub of Waikiki Beach, yet seems like a small oasis in the midst of the chaos. The lobby area is inviting and contains a small bar where you can enjoy a cocktail or grab a quick breakfast. The best thing about the Renew is its warm and friendly staff—everyone we came in contact with was exceptionally welcoming. The rooms include a mini fridge, but no coffee maker. One suggestion—it’s worth paying a bit extra to get an ocean view room on a higher floor (floors 6-9 are best). We actually stayed here twice during a recent trip (interspersed with a trip to the North Shore). Our first stay was on a lower floor and had no view; our second was on a high floor and had a gorgeous view. Unfortunately, like nearly all Honolulu hotels, there is a daily “resort fee”, which I feel should be rolled into the room rate. Nevertheless, they did provide nice beach towels, beach chairs, and daily newspapers. We enjoyed our stays at the Renew and would gladly return there in the future.","Fredericksburg, Virginia",5,5.0

While the rooms and lobby have had a refresh, the amenities advertised are actually a simple refrigerator with coconut water and the like, a few select hours for one day a week for 'astrology readings' or in-room facials (hopefully your stay lands on that day, otherwise you're out of luck) We received a letter describing the amenities, which include fitness equipment in your room, which was either stolen or non-existent. Our room had another guest's large bar of soap with hair on it in the shower. The sheets weren't a fitted sheet with a flat sheet but a flat sheet and a flat sheet, which we lifted to observe staining on the mattress coverlet, which I understand you can only bleach so much. The staff is hit-or-miss in terms of friendliness. The worst of all of this, is that I booked this hotel through my airline to receive miles, and on top of the room charges there is a $25/day 'amenity fee' which basically allows you the sparse schedule of activities and to borrow beach equipment. Not worth it, in my opinion. Our room looked out on hostel stairs, which was a privacy concern if you did not want your shades closed. If you don't mind boutique hotels for a higher price and really want to spend every day at the beach, this place is for you, otherwise, spend your money on somewhere that at least has a pool and some views.

One of the decorative panels fell off the wall while I was sleeping and onto me as I was laying in bed! My friend put soft drinks in the refrigerator in her room, and because the refrigerator was too cold, the cans actually exploded. The keys to the doors do not work well - I must have exchanged my room key 10 times and it still did not work. Finally because I complained about the panel falling on me, I met the manager. He was apologetic and fixed the panel (by going out and buying some glue to fix it) and fixed the room key. However, I must say, even though he apologized, that is not enough for me to ever stay there again nor recommend anyone stay at this hotel. I am a world traveler, and NEVER has anything ever fallen on me in a hotel and certainly a mere apology is not enough.Also, the desk staff, except for Shane, were a bust. They could care less about keys not working or being helpful. Many of the desk staff just seemed bored. Also, on my very last nite there, I ordered a happy hour drink and the bartender came running over and said I had a lobby credit of $50. I was curious about this credit, and Shane told me because of the package we booked, we received this credit (it sure would have been nice if someone had told me I had this credit upon check in and not just on the last night, since My stay was 7 nights!). Apparently this package also entitled me to 2 free drinks. So, in short, this hotel is not service oriented and things are falling apart!

So is good to avoid the excessive crowd. It seems to be freshly renovated, and it is clean. Another thing we appreciated is the water fountain in the hall.All this notwithstanding, the room was incredibly small to fit two people, and I am referring in particular to the following things:-the bed was for 1 person because we almost couldn't fit comfortably both of us without one staying on the edge.-In the bathroom you can barely turn, and there is no window, I am if a hole in the wall that you can never actually close can be defined window, then yes there is one.-If don't want to be wakened up by sunlight in the morning you'd better have worked out, because to close those things do not slide easily.What we also did not appreciate is that at check-in they charged us more than what booking mentioned, and only after we pointed this fact out they changed the price to the one mentioned in our reservation confirmation.Also, do not trust what's written in booking, they do not have breakfast, and we were extremely disappointed when we discovered it at the check-in.They only have valet parking for 35 (!) dollars a day (I get that in Waikiki parking is expensive, but 35 is a top-class resort fee)Overall summary: it is probably a bit cheaper and location in a more quiet spot than other hotels/resorts in Waikiki, but for the same price (or a tiny bit more) you can for sure get better.","Lausanne, Switzerland",16,2.0

The valet Parker moves down at least three cars before he gets to yours then moves them all back. Which means waiting time for us! Ocean view was disappointing as you had to stand right at the window to see it from waist up only so no sitting on the bed hoping to enjoy the view. The ac was center on the ocean view look out point so you get a cold blast whilst standing to see the ocean view. Shower pressure was so bad I actually wondered if I would get The shampoo out of my hair. The pillows were soft foam & the comforters were so short everyone’s feet weren’t covered. No coffee machine in the room. Our room wasn’t very clean. Plugging in bedside phone charger meant getting your hand into a slit in a fake wall & reaching way into the socket in the original wall. Slot was small & it was tricky. Smoke alarm was situated above bed with a bright yellow light that stared at us all night. Lounge bar is four stools at a tiny counter.

Breakfast was included in the price...all I ever saw was coffee. No one in the lobby when I came down for that coffee ever pointed out anything that resembled a breakfast. For the two nights that I was there, there were bags of trash, I can only assume from housekeeping, left by an exit door near the elevator. This did not help the overall impression of the hotel. The bathroom wasn't very clean...there were missing baseboards...it just felt like if they took an extra minute and paid more attention to detail, then it would be really, really good. Also, and I NEVER get this when I run across it...why charge for a room safe? To me...it makes the hotel feel cheap and that they are nickel and diming you.

I decided to try this place as I do love boutique hotels and this one seemed nice. Calling this place a luxury boutique hotel is a big stretch. It has the potential to be one based on the location, but currently is just is not. First of all, we checked in, left and went and got dinner and then came back. Our card said that our room was 603. We lug all of our stuff upstairs, go to room 603 and the key doesn't work and I can hear people inside talking - after going back downstaris, the guy told us that someone was ""pulling a prank"" and moving the room numbers (which are typing paper taped to the wall) and that the 603 was the room actually labeled 607. Then, we asked for a baby crib when we checked in, didn't get it. Called to ask, nothing. Finally, I went down to ask and the guy about the bed & he said ""oops, I sent it to the wrong room"" There was no pineapple juice or cold towel. They should just go ahead and remove that from the list of things included in the resort fee. The room looked like it has been remodeled, the furnishings were modern looking, but it looked like they did the whole room and left the tile and shower head, which were moldy and rusty.

Literally one block from the beach! I should have opted for the ocean view room; however, I knew I wouldn't be spending much time in the hotel.

They describe it on the website as a Holistic Wellness Boutique Retreat. I wouldn't come here expecting to be completely zen, pristine, and quiet. The walls were pretty thin; and, the wall a/c's are well, you know, wall a/c's. It is a 3 star hotel. So, do keep that in mind. Seems they are refurbishing this location with some of the details being incomplete. I am by no means complaining. Just describing my impression of my expectation and my experience once I arrived.

The hotel is steps from the beach and shopping. There is a Wolfgang Puck Express on the corner with very reasonable eats (highest priced item $15). Our trips to Pearl Harbor and the Polynesian Village met us on the block. There is an ABC store right across the street. In short, a good stay at a decent hotel. Another point or two----this is NOT a luxury class hotel. The resort fee is about $26 per day, in addition to the regular room charge. Most hotels in the area have a similar charge (as do hotels in Las Vegas etc.). I'm irritated every time I see that. It should be included in the room price quoted as it is MANDATORY.

There is always fresh coffee and cold flavoured water available in the lobby. I would say that the location is perfect, a 3 minute walk to the zoo and aquarium, all the shopping is within a 10 or 15 minute walk and the beach is half a block away. You can also take towels, beach chairs, snorkel masks etc. to the beach for the day as well and drop off back in the lobby when done. All in all a great choice that I can definitely recommend :-) in beautiful Waikiki.","Edmonton, Canada",10,5.0

First, lets start with the positives:-Fantastic Location a few hundred feet from the beach and close to a few places to eat-Not directly on the Main Street-Free Wifi-Free breakfast (it is not much, just some pastries and juice, but it is something)-Free Beach Amenities (Beach Towels, Chairs, Snorkel Gear, Boogie Boards)-Free water, coffee and tea in the lobby 24/7-Clean EnoughNow the Cons: The hotel was undergoing major construction during our stay so that is a major part of the following:-We tried to check in early, the front desk associate said she would try to get us in right away,,,ended up waiting almost 5 hours-Did not get the promised Pineapple Juice and Cold towels upon arrival-We only got the promised breakfast one day due to construction on the following days (They did give us a brown bagged breakfast, but it was not the same quality)-The walls are paper thin, I could hear all the noise from not only the construction on the hotel, but the construction on the street as well, music form the neighboring hotel-The rooms are in pretty bad disrepair. The pain was peeling, furniture all scuffed up, cracks in sink and tubs. They even had a wooden cover for the air-conditioning unit that was held together with duct-tape. It ended up falling on me and left a small bruise.-The TV is sort of small-Customer Shrive was hit and miss. Sometimes we got the things we requested right away, other times it took a few hoursOverall I would not recommend this hotel. yes the price is amazing, but you get what you pay for, It was not terrible, but I was disappointed in my stay.","Santa Clarita, California",0,3.0

The Prince Waikiki, Hyatt Central, Surfjack, but Hotel Renew is the one I keep coming back to. The lack of pool is a deal breaker for a lot of people, so if you need a pool, it's probably not the place for you. For me, if a hotel is within a short walk from the ocean, who needs a pool? I'd rather be at the beach. Hotel Renew is actually affordable - especially for people who have dogs. I've been to a bunch of hotels that accept pets across the mainland, but this hotel doesn't just accept pets - it's pet friendly. When I checked into my room I found a bed and water/food dishes for my service dog. I've neverrrr had a hotel do that before, it was so sweet. There's breakfast, not vegan friendly, but it's a nice option. There is always coffee and infused water in the lobby. The rooms are nice, not overly bougie, but wayyy better than other three star hotels. All of the staff is extremely friendly and happy to accommodate people.

I am a fan of boutique hotels and Renew was no exception. Rooms are clean and appears to be renovated which freshens it up. The staff were all excellent, super friendly and efficient, and it was a pleasure to stay here.The location is the absolute star of this place, it's situated right at the end of Waikiki ( goes straight into the heart of downtown) and located right across the beach. It was nice to explore around, eat, go back to the room to take a nap and continue wandering around again. Two of our fav. restaurants we discovered was Tikis Grill & Bar next door (reserve ahead for rail seating at the patio and watch the sunset!) and Arancino di Mare (try the Carbonara if you like pasta!). The zoo is also just a few blocks away. The complimentary breakfast was always a nice welcome in the morning to add needed fuel. Pastries and drinks to help yourself and bring back to your room. A few things I noted and wanted to share while I was there for 5 nights:- Our room, on the lower floor, faces a scooter rental and it can be noisy in the morning. Combined with the A/C which is an older model, light sleepers might be bothered by the sounds. Fortunately, I'm a mid-range sleeper and slept well, the temperature was good and the bed comfortable. - I saw 3 or 4 tiny ants on my side of the night table sporadically throughout my time there. They were harmless enough that I didn't bother informing housekeeping, but i made sure to keep my cup sealed and food locked away.- The water pressure for the shower was pretty bad on some nights and morning. Not a deal breaker for me, but good water pressure can be a bonus for some travelers.Overall, great value for the room and location (Waikiki is expensive place to book a room) and I would both recommend and return to this location when I visit Oahu again!",Vancouver,33,4.0

Hotel Renew you need to address this issue sooner rather than later. The breakfast did have sugary cereals but the porridge was good. It soon wore thin eating white stale bread products, maybe some brown bread and fresh fruit could be considered to be in the breakfast in the future.

It might be 5 when compared to average hotels but this certainly is not your 5 star resort. It might be partial 'boutique' but it's not classy enough to be true boutique. Having said all that, if you want a nice, clean, decent place to stay, this might fit you. It certainly is a few steps above some of the trash hotels or a motel on some side street in Waikiki. Is this a resort? No. Don't let the $25/day resort fee fool you since its missing the resort part of the resort fee. Yes, some of it is for internet access, croissant breakfast, etc. I get that they have to recover costs somehow but I certainly did not feel I got money's worth for the $25/day.

The location is perfect on a side street off Kalakaua-the main drag. The hotel is located just behind the first row of beachfront hotels, so it's very close to the water, but avoids the mayhem on Kalakaua. The hotel itself is ""newish"", neat but not too fancy. It provides all mod cons you look for on your vacation. The room is well designed and specious enough for two people, the bed is very comfy.The staff is friendly, very attentive and the hotel is well maintained.Your booking comes with a complementary breakfast. This is unfortunately the weak component of the deal, as the breakfast is somewhat disappointing-a very small range of rather ordinary foods.When you want to go to the closest beach it's only a 3 min walk. The beach is actually the hotels ""pool"", as there is no swimming pool. You don't need one as section of the ocean close to the beach is protected by a sea wall, so it creates a fantastic natural pool. If you're looking for the surf, it's just behind the wall for you to enjoy.In summary: a great proposition for a reasonably priced ""boutique"" hotel (As against the very expensive Waikiki hotels) in an ideal location. A very welcome alternative to the hugh , soulless hotels dotting the beach front of the attractive Waikiki beach.","Bentleigh, Australia",42,4.0

I live on Oahu and after my first time staying at Hotel Renew about seven years ago, I've used it as my go to spot when I get the urge to spend a weekend in Waikiki. I noticed a downturn in quality after my last stay which was in August 2017. Not enough to prevent me from returning but after my most recent stay, I will not ever book at the hotel again. It started with a relatively cold reception upon check in. I was looking forward to the cold towel upon check in but it was not offered on this stay. The receptionist was just short tempered and not friendly. Upon entering the room, there was an odd smell. Not enough to request a new room but enough to notice as slightly offensive. The bathroom was not cleaned well as it looked like ""water"" marks around the toilet. The shower doors were both jammed or off track and would not close as hard as I tried so we had to shower with the door open. Even after all of this, I would have given the hotel a 3 star rating but what happened next made me decide I would never stay here again. About 20 minutes before I departed the room, I was using the sink in the bathroom when I noticed a fast and heavy dripping from the ventilation duct above the sink. It increased in pace to a slight steady flow. It soaked my toiletry kit with all of my items inside. When I went to remove it, I noticed an odor, and I smelled the water and it had the odor of sewage. I quickly placed my toiletry kit in a plastic bad and ended up throwing several items away and washed the bag itself. If I wasn't so close to checking out, I would have immediately called the front desk. I washed my hands and left the room to check out. It was the same receptionist who provided the cold reception the day prior. She began to go over the room charges and I interrupted her to tell her about the foul smelling water leaking in the bathroom. She responded with ""OK, I'll call maintenance and get someone to check on it"". No apology, no offer to comp something like parking. Thanks for fixing that on my way out.

The pros:- Loved the location of this hotel, one block from the beach, on the quiet side of Waikiki close to the Zoo. Didn't like the busier area of Waikiki where most of the larger hotels are location so this was ideal for us. Much less touristy.- Good service, front desk team really helpful. A little impersonal but good service.- Free breakfast (even though very cheap and limited, but good to start the day)- Big comfy bed- Com cast on the TV so can stream from your phone/laptop/tablet etc.- Free DVD rentals and PS3 in the room which was awesome in the evening.The cons:- Decor was a little worn around the hotel/room- $25 resort fee per day we felt was pretty steep for what you got, especially since there is no pool. Also never received the fruit juice and towel on check in that is supposed to be part of this.- Bathroom lighting pretty dim- No tea making facilities in the room - only a coffee machine- Maid service not excellent, didn't replenish toiletries or towels even though they were dirty- Air con not great, only cooled half the room.Overall this was a good base for a few days in the city before we headed to the North Shore.

It was obvious he was empowered to make every attempt to solve the serious problem. The new manager was initially a bit cold but warmed up during the week we were at the hotel. The problem was solved by us accepting one night in a tired room at a reduced rate and by management adding another amenity to our stay. The staff transferred all of our belongings to a very good ocean view room while we were out and about enjoying Waikiki. All in all, our visit was very good and we will return.

(3) Room was fine - though dark even with lights on high, and limited availability of convenient plugs.Other than these issues, the location is convenient - just off the Waikiki main drag - so a little less chaotic, and the rooms are fine despite the low lighting (e.g., no light in closet where the safe is, so had to bring a flashlight in to open it...)","Nashville, Tennessee",5,4.0

We opted for one of the 'Urban View' rooms on this occasion, so the views were nothing spectacular, but that was expected.The hotel and rooms were clean and modern, the reception had beach chairs, towels etc. for you to borrow at no extra charge, and there was a nice spread available for the included continental breakfast (you just have to pick your timing right as there are only a few tables available in the breakfast/bar area).But what made Hotel Renew particularly memorable was the friendly staff and those little additions that made us feel extra special, like a cold face towel and juice during check-in, our choice of scented diffuser for our room, fancy lighting that you could control from the bed, and a sweet handwritten welcome note and treat from the team.I'd definitely recommend Hotel Renew, particularly for couples looking for somewhere away from the rest of the Waikiki crowd and big hotels chains.","Canberra, Australia",7,5.0

That happens. But, when we raised our concerns with the hotel manager, we were completely brushed off. So we then called then general manager, and didn't even get a call back!! This left me with the impression that guests really don't matter to them, and proved to me what we saw first hand for our four day stay- they are there to squeeze every penny out of their customer, and value is not important to them.Our main concerns were: awful breakfast experience, offensive resort/""boutique"" fee which includes genuinely broken or useless items, and an excessive parking fee on top of that. Resort Fee: It's not a resort. No justification for it at all!! The joke is- they know it! They call it an amenity fee at times, and a “boutique fee” at times! It is ridiculous, and it is offensive to the customer! This is a widespread problem and not exclusive to Renew. But, at this hotel it is a particularly nasty joke! Not only do they not have a resort, they barely have a hotel!No pool. No gym. No sauna. No hot tub. No restaurant. No activities or recreation. No business center (a computer or two in the cramped reception area that does triple duty as a dining room and waiting area as well). No views. No ""grounds""/ property to explore or stretch your legs around. Its an apartment building with an awful lobby.They include their breakfast as part of the fee.... and It is awful. Nothing warm. Unappetizing baked goods. And instead of having the server who is present make omelettes or waffles or something fresh for the guests, he makes mixed drinks for steep prices so they can find a way to profit more on the ""free breakfast"".I found the breakfast to be an awful event as everyone has to scramble for the very few actual seats! (there are literally about six seats in the miniature breakfast space) 2 of the 4 nights We were there we had NO SEATS! People were siting in the lobby, out the front door on the street, or carried food back up to their rooms! IF the breakfast was decent... if they gave you something decent to eat and an actual seat.... then the resort fee would be palatable because a nice free breakfast is something of value at a hotel. But this was a joke!!Worst of all- they don't include something actually useful in the fee like parking- they charge over $30/ day ON TOP of the amenity fee!! There's a lot one block away that charges $1/hr which is a much better deal. Plus there is often free street parking. Couldn't they have at least matched the price of the parking lot one block away to make customers feel like they are not being taken advantage of?Their ABSURD list of amenities includes things we absolutely did not get including a newspaper daily, and the “Idapt charge and docking station” (yes they have the GAUL to charge you for a plug for your devices)- the best part- IT DID NOT WORK WHEN WE TRIED TO USE IT- it was broken! (another item the manger could care less about).They round off their list of “amenities” with the cold towel they hand you on check in, a “mobile concierge” which they never explained to us and I haven't got a clue what it is, free local calls (which is useless to anyone traveling domestically), the tea they have set up in the lobby, and the “aroma” they put in the room (an oil diffuser). This is a list of things that should absolutely be free in any “nice” hotel you go to. The one and only thing that was useful on the list was the wifi, and that too should be a free service (and increasingly it is at most hotels).Listen- the only reason people are staying here is because of the location. And yes- it is close to the beach and the heart of Honolulu. But, there are little to no decent views, and you may as well stay at one of the resorts a block closer. I wish I had selected one of the larger properties with more services/ amenities/ activities/ etc. At least a gym & pool. I don’t think I’d have found a resort fee quite as offensive if more was provided to me. This was a tiny hotel, with a cramped lobby/business center/breakfast area (all in a few square feet)- and your room. Period. And again- the manager didn’t address a single problem or concern I had. This, after not getting back to me in a timely manner (I left numerous messages for him).Then I called the GM and he/she was worse! I didn't even get a call back after leaving a voicemail!!It's a shame because the rest of the staff, minus the awful management, were extremely nice and helpful. More than one employee was quite nice to my wife & I. I just wish their superiors had their level of tact, customer service, and care for their guests.

You can't beat a five-minute walk to the beach.

The staff here was exceptional. David at the front desk was delightful, as was Amanda at the bar (she makes a fantastic mai tai!). Such hospitable vibes at this hotel!The only negative things I would have to note are the dimly lit rooms and the bathrooms. I would have liked a bit more light in the room, especially in the evenings. As far as the bathrooms, we had to be careful with the bathroom sink as the drain was slow and could overflow if you weren't paying attention.

The location - just across the street from Waikiki Beach, on main road in Waikiki, but not in a crowded area - was perfect. Convenient to the beach, restaurants, the zoo, Starbucks. The room was nice and clean, bed comfortable, and the a/c worked great, maybe even a little too well. The water and granola bars in the lobby kept us energized when we were coming and going. The main highlight was the wonderful staff. We really felt welcomed, yet given our privacy at Hotel Renew. Everyone was friendly and helpful, especially Sarah and Kris. It almost felt like we were staying at a very accommodating friend's large home. Our departing flight was in the evening, and they let us stay in the room (for a fee) until it was time to go to the airport.

We had to put the ac on a continuous fan to block out some of the noise.Additionally, the hotel makes a big deal about the lighting. We found it always too dark. You couldn't read, the bathroom was very dark (bright lights around the mirror, no lights in the shower) yet at the same time there is a frosted glass wall between the bathroom and the bedroom so if you turned on a light at night the whole bedroom lit up. What's the point of the glass wall? The entry stayed so dark it was hard to see what was in the suitcases.

Loved the breakfast which was included every day( they had pinapple juice every day, selection of teas and coffee, delicious banana nut muffins, croissants with jam, and fresh fruit (usually melon, watermelon and pinapple, but get there early or else the only stuff left is the honeydew!). However, the best thing about this hotel is the staff. Everyone we interacted with was so pleasant, helpful, and enthusiastic about their work and also sharing knowledge about fun things to do in the city. I really loved their suggestions of local eating places as well. Special thank you to Sarah at the front desk, she noticed it was my birthday on check in and sent me some chocolates!

Just be aware, taxes for the rental car will run about $72. So, it's not totally free, but obviously a deal for the 8 days we stayed.We chose an ocean facing room with king size bed. The bed and pillows were great. We slept like babies. Not sure if it was because we were wiped out every day or if it was really that comfortable, but either way, we slept well.Breakfast is ""continental,"" which translates to boiled eggs, some light pastries, dry cereal, and fresh fruit. It is good for a morning, maybe 2, but after that we found ourselves paying for breakfast. In Hawaii, breakfast can be the most expensive meal of the day per portion. That's because nearly everything required for breakfast is brought from the mainland. If you are attempting Hawaii on a budget, and noticed the included breakfast, just be aware of this info.Facilities are lacking here. This means, if you need to do laundry, you'll have to find someplace else to do it. The staff said there is a laundrymat down the road (it was quite a hike). We opted to pack a backpack and take a stoll next door to the 3rd floor of the Marriot. If you need to do laundry, they have a laundrymat. It's $3.25 to wash a load and same to dry. Get your detergent at the ABC store. It's only .99 versus inside the laundrymat.The housekeeping staff did an ok job. Not always ""on point"" but did well enough.The hotel staff and valet, they were great. Super friendly people at all hours. Just a great group of people, and always willing to help.The biggest drawback is the lack of balconies. I used to live in Hawaii and figured it was no big deal since we were so close to the beach, but I was wrong. Having that little bit of fresh air and the sound of the ocean would have made this a fantastic hotel. It's a real drawback to not have the sound and smell of the island available. The windows do not open. So that's out as well.Nonetheless, this hotel was a good value for the money.

Despite a couple of unfair negative reviews I decided on the Renew, as it was closer to the beach and had breakfast included. It's not often I book somewhere without either a pool or a gym, but I'm so glad I did. Having already experienced exceptional levels of service and hospitality at the various places we'd visited so far during our trip, I was super impressed from the outset with the Hotel Renew. Sarah checked us in, and she welcomed us as warmly as if we were old friends. The check-in process was smooth, and the pineapple juice and cold towel was a nice touch. We even got to choose a reed diffuser scent for our room, which was brought up to us along with a congratulatory bottle of fizzy wine and some chocolates. The beach is really close to the Hotel Renew, you can literally see it from just outside the front door and it's less than 2 minute's walk. If it weren't for the hotel next door being in the way then the Renew would be a beachfront property. Other good points about the Renew include a free DVD rental service, with quite a few new releases, which you can play on the Playstation 3 that's in your room! Also, free lending of beach towels, mats and collapsible chairs, and free tea and coffee in the lobby. The breakfast, while not extensive, was very welcome. We'd spent the last nine days at other places having to go out each morning in search of food, shelling out a fortune, so it was nice to be able to wander downstairs for some fruit, hard boiled eggs and a selection of pastries and muffins. Our room was clean and very spacious, with a huge, comfortable bed. The shower was pretty good, the blinds keep out the light very well, and the lighting controls next to the bed are convenient. The WiFi is good too. Nowhere is perfect, and the Hotel Renew is no exception. Breakfast is served in the bar area, which is just part of the open plan lobby, so it can be difficult to find somewhere to sit. The elevators are quite slow. On check-in we were given a half-price cocktail voucher for the hotel's bar but, despite various drink theme nights being advertised on notices in the elevators, the bar isn't staffed all the time. I get why, because the hotel is small and it doesn't really have a bar scene like you'd typically find in larger places, but we did try to use our vouchers a couple of times and were unsuccessful as there was nobody around. So we settled for a cup of free lobby tea instead. That's pretty much it for the negatives at the Renew. It's a superb little hotel; excellent value, great location, and the staff really are fantastic. Sarah, in particular, was awesome. With her seemingly unwavering enthusiasm he's probably the friendliest and most helpful hotel employee we've ever encountered. We absolutely would not hesitate to stay at the Hotel Renew again if we ever find ourselves back in Waikiki.","Bishops Stortford, United Kingdom",23,5.0

I was really really concerned and considered leaving, but I stayed despite my reluctance and let me say, I'm so glad I did! The location can't be beat - the pool of a beach is literally right there, the hotel gives you free towels and chairs and there's even a bus that stops right outside of the hotel that takes you everywhere. Also, the staff is probably one of the friendliest bunch of people ever! So much so, that I ended up loving the hotel despite the fact that it wasn't all that nice. They literally went out of their way to make sure I had an incredible stay. A great example is that I asked the valet for good noodle places around the area and he didn't know, but then 30 minutes later, he called the room and did research and asked around and got a whole list for me. How nice is that? He recommended really wonderful places and even followed up with me and my boyfriend the next day to make sure we ate at a good place and asked if we needed anything else.

Rachel, you made my day! The operations seem very well-organised.The location is a real plus, at the far end of the Waikiki strip by the zoo. This makes it handy to escape from the crowded, boring commercial areas to such assets as Kapi'olani Park and Kapi'olani Beach, Diamond Head State Monument hike, Diamond Head Beach, and up Kapahulu Avenue where the better eating choices are to be found. The Waikiki beach, as well as the bus route to Honolulu, are just steps away.The room was compact, clean and nicely designed.One down side was the annoying mandatory ""resort fee"", another $25 a day plus tax, which is said to cover what is a fairly standard list of hotel amenities such as the continental breakfast, newspapers, wi-fi, and so on. Why not add this sum on to the price? (I understand that most or all of the other Waikiki hotels also have a ""resort fee"" which varies in price.) For all its merits, Hotel Renew is not really a resort, but a 9-storey hotel with an attractive lobby.I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or to recommend the place to others.

This year, we were in Waikiki for over three weeks and split our visit between 3 hotels, just to have slightly different experiences without much effort. At Hotel Renew we always get an ocean view room and enjoy the pretty, but compact space. This year we saw the New Years fireworks from our room. This is a very good location for catching the bus, walking along towards the aquarium or Diamond Head Road where there are some pretty neighborhoods, quieter than further along towards the larger hotels. They have upgraded their breakfasts since we were there several years ago. There was an excellent selection of fresh fruit and juice, pastries, granola. The staff are especially helpful and kind and because it is a smaller hotel it seems like you get more personal service. On my last day there I was suffering from a bad cold and the waiter gave my husband a large glass of the carrot, orange juice to bring to me in the room. When we went to check out at noon, staying as long as possible since our flight didn't leave until late at night, I mentioned that I wasn't feeling well and they told us that since the room wasn't rented for the night we could stay as long as we wanted, without charge - a great relief. We really like the fact that they have a computer and printer in the lobby for visitors, at no charge, unlike most other hotels. If we could change one thing about the room it would to be able to open the window a bit wider or enable the other window to open as well.

Catching the Pink Line to Ala Moana mall was a breeze, just ask the helpful staff at reception!Our king bed was very comfortable and the air con very efficient. The bathroom had plenty of room to put our toiletries on the shelving or vanity. The only issue being the lighting not being very bright (for energy saving) although the mirror surround is lit up so makeup/shaving purposes is not a problem.Breakfast was served in the bar area daily between 7-9.30am. We never found getting a table a problem. Extra seats were in the lobby if that was the case. We found the breakfast to be a really convenient way to start the day with a good selection of cereal, eggs, pastries, fresh fruit and freshly made juice along with tea, coffee, and ice water.

Much higher quality than the typical plastic-packaged junk at many places, but free. Good access to the upper Waikiki beach, a block away, and easy walking distance to the whole strip.

There are no words to truly describe not only the gorgeous interiors full of architectural details. Attention to detail....a specialty at Hotel Renew. The interiors are sleek & modern yet comfortable. The bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in at a hotel. There's even an umbrella hanging in the entrance hall to your room in case you'd like to use one! When you check in you not only receive a glass of chilled pineapple juice & a chilled towel scented with lime & ginger but you are also encouraged to choose a signature room scent. I chose the vanilla. Minutes after I arrived in my room Rey brought the essential oil reed diffuser to my room & two boxes of gorgeous Belgium chocolates as well as the sweetest, HANDWRITTEN, welcome & birthday card. Attention to detail!Breakfast is lovely in the lobby/bar area. Fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, pastries, cereal, coffee, tea etc. In evenings the bar serves wine, beer & great cocktails. The hotel is barely one block off the beach-directly behind the Aston Waikiki. The hotel provides beach gear: grass mats, towels and chairs. Since the hotel is on the south end you are also only one blockover from Queen Kapiolani park. Beautiful place to walk & I prefer the beaches here away from the crowds on Waikiki. If you are into working out a great walk or run is minutes away. Head over to the park and follow Monsarrat Ave up the hill. It changed into Diamond Head road. At the crest of the hill Kapiolani Community college is on your left. From there you have beautiful views to the west....looking back at Waikiki & Honolulu and you can see the eastern coast & Waialae/Kahala. But back to the hotel. The staff....amazing. You can always tell when people love their jobs & are treated well by their employer because they exhibit great pride in their organization & take great care of their customers. Paula, Grace, Rey & everyone else I'm forgetting thank you for such an amazing stay. I truly hated leaving you!This is a small boutique hotel. While I didn't have a great view from my room I knew that when I booked & was fine with it. Who stays in their room in Hawaii anyways??????? Being a small boutique hotel they are also able to offer exclusive extras like free admission to the Honolulu Museum of Arts- def worth a visit. You can walk (just over 3miles) or take Uber or the city bus. By the way the bus is great only $2.50 and there's a bus stop one block east of the hotel. I took the bus toPearl Harbor. Takes over an hour but you get a great tour of Honolulu on the way. FYI if going to Pearl Harbor go early as they only hand out 1300 tickets/day. Sorry for rambling. Bottom line I love this hotel. I would go back toWaikiki on my next trip to the islands for the sole purpose of staying at Hotel Renew. Again to all the staff mahalo. ","Staunton, Virginia",53,5.0

Its location was also good being close to the beach and the main strip. However be aware that the rooms with balconies on the front of the hotel face the rear of another hotel and we were bothered a lot by the sound of glass bottles being emptied in large quantities at regular intervals into dustcarts and by the beeping noise from the reverse gear on the many delivery lorries that serviced the other hotel. ( I understand there might be a safety issue but why can't the driver turn them off at night and early morning ?) The bed was small and against the windowsill. There was - as others have commented- a very strong smell of plastic which permeates the room and we suspect comes from the window blinds - but it is common throughout the other rooms - we were there for a wedding and others in our party had to move rooms to reduce the odour.  Breakfast did not start till 7.30 and we would have liked it a bit earlier - personal preference. it was all carbohydrates with only boiled eggs to leaven it so we ate out everyday. For Hawaii it was reasonably priced but to charge a resort fee of $25 per day is ludicrous. it is not a resort and we did not want to use any of the other facilities.

This trip was as a stop over en route to Denver and I was travelling with a friend.My travel agent found a little boutique hotel just 3 blocks away from my old haunt. Hotel Renew is in an amazing location, located on the Diamond Head end of Waikiki only half a block away from the famous beach. Some rooms have ocean views.The first thing we were met with was a huge ALOHA from the amazingly personable Rachel, who proved to be an absolute star for the duration of our stay! Always a big smile and full of helpful hints, she is a wonderful ambassador for the Hotel.The cooling hand towel and refreshing pineapple juice which awaited us in reception were a bonus!Our room wasn't huge but it wasn't tiny either! Well equipped, spotlessly clean and more than comfortable. The furnishings were modern and the accessories such as toiletries were wonderful! Great shower too and very comfortable beds. Each room has individual air conditioning controlsA continental breakfast is provided down stairs in the tiny tiny bar area. It comprises cereal fruit and pastries. Very nice but the bar area is so small it isn't really a great option unless you can score a seat or want to take the food back to your room.Whilst we thoroughly loved our time at the Hotel and my friend said that she would happily go back and stay with her husband, there were a couple of things that I missed.1. Only a small number of rooms have lanais. About 9 I think. Whilst this wasn't a major issue it was a bit frustrating if my friend was sleeping or having a rest as I had to either go out of the room or sit on the the bed - the ability to sit on the lanai and just enjoy Honolulu would have been a wonderful alternative.2. There is no pool. It never occurred to me that a Hotel in Honolulu wouldn't have a pool! Again, not a major issue but there were a lot of times in our 5 night stay that I would have loved to have sat around the pool had a swim and enjoyed the weather, rather than just sit in the room or wander Kalakeau Ave just because I didn't have anywhere in the Hotel to sit. (The hotel does provide beach towel which I utilised,)3. Upon check in you discover a $25 a day room fee which you pay on checkout. It covers good coffee in your room, the Wi Fi and the towels as well as, I assume, the breakfast. Whilst I didn't mind the fee, it wasn't optional and I would have preferred that it be added to the room rather than slugged it as a non optional extra. I felt that I had to pay the fee as my travelling companion didn't use any of the extras the fee covers.4. No restaurant. Again not a biggie as Honolulu is full of restaurants, but it does mean that you have to go out to eat, so if you are feeling tired or whatever and want to eat in, it's not going to happen.In summary a really great little Hotel, but I would not recommend it for families and not for a long stay - unless you don't want a pool, restaurant of a lanai. Maybe for an overnight stop it would be brilliant.","Canberra, Australia",26,4.0

The lighting in the room was also very bad - no light in the entrance hall so you had to use your cell phone as a flashlight to see inside the closet & safe at night.The great location near Waikiki beach can be a drawback if you're not there for the beach - there's lots of street noise in the area. The AC will drown out a lot of it, but if you like to sleep in you'll likely find the street noise to be a problem. Other hotels nearby likely won't be much better unless you get a room on a higher floor.The breakfast had coffee (with soy milk available - not just milk & cream!), muffins, scones, fresh fruit, and cereal.Front desk staff were very friendly and the hotel has beach chairs and beach towels available at no charge.Only one of the 2 elevators was in service during our stay. That's not a big problem except that the stairs are useless - you can't get to the lobby unless you're willing to go through a fire door to the outside and then walk back in.

Sarah, Rachel, Michelle and Cilla honestly displayed such amazing customer service that I felt well taken care of; even if they have no idea what you're talking about they make it their mission to help with I'm so appreciative of. They were able to answer every question we had and give amazing recommendations for food and things to do in the area ( Jackie has the best suggestions !) Sarah has such a warm and welcoming vibe to her that you honestly feel you're best friends by the end of your stay.When you check in they give you this delicious pineapple juice and a cool towel to really help you relax and feel refreshed. They have a complimentary breakfast as well starting at 7 and ending at 9:30 AM which is really hard to find but has your basic needs met ( cereal, muffins, hard boiled eggs, freshly squeezed juice, coffee, etc;) We were on the lowest floor which I believe was 2 and never had an issue with noise.

It was medium-size, but the space was clean, designed well and still very comfortable and functional for two adults and luggage. Actually, in addition to a mini fridge and safe, there was quite a bit of storage. We are split on whether we liked the different lighting settings. They didn't work consistently, but it wasn't a big deal. It may be less useful and more gimmick. On the downside, the room overlooked the hostel next door, where on two of three mornings there was police activity. The rest of the afternoon and night there was noise and yelling, so in addition to the disruption, it gave the impression of being in an unsafe neighborhood. That said, I would like to see a swing bar or slide bolt lock added to guest room doors as an additional security measure; they are commonly found in most hotels. The included continental breakfast was average and tended toward the sweet side. It included two kinds of granola, fruit, pastries, pineapple juice, a freshly made fruit/vegetable juice blend, hard-boiled eggs (sometimes), coffee and tea. There was usually one person staffing the bar-turned-breakfast stand and that person was always good about keeping food stocked and the bar clean. Seating was limited and sometimes guests moved to the lobby couch for more space. One of the other things included in the resort fee is use of the DVD rental machine in the lobby. Available movies were limited, though they tended to be fairly new releases, which was nice. We used it twice becausr it was so easy and convenient. For every disappointment we experienced at Hotel Renew, something unexpected balanced it out. For instance, we never received the expected welcome drink and fresh towel, but shortly after we got to our room, two small boxes of chocolates were delivered from management, along with a sweet birthday note. Additionally, staff friendliness varied greatly depending on the person and (sometimes) the day. We're all entitled to good and bad days, but again, everything seemed to balance out. Had service been consistent, it would be easy to rate Hotel Renew higher. Unfortunately, it's only somewhere between ""average"" and ""above average.""","Gig Harbor, Washington",550,3.0

So, it was very easy to walk to shops, restaurant, beach etc. Perfect!And the price was really good. My research showed that most hotels charge a lot more then Renew did.When we arrived the girls at the reception were very friendly and helpful. We got a towel to refresh ourselves and were offered a nice drink. Checkin was fast and easy.I'll come to the room in a bit. Hang on....The hotel offers complimentary continental breakfast. It is very simple, but was absolutely good enough for us. We enjoyed it, but we heard some people comment that it was very poor. Well, if you expect a 5*hotel breakfast buffet, you're in for a disappointment. But again: we liked it.The hotel promotes itself as a boutique hotel. In my experience many boutique hotels are very modern, and kinda special. This is not the case with Renew. I found the hallways dark, the room a bit dark and in general not very modern at all. If boutique just means 'small', then yes that is correct.So about the room: nothing special. A bit old-fashioned, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong: it was very clean, bed was great, fairly big room, and I don't have any complaints. But it just felt a bit old fashioned. Maybe because of all the dark colours, maybe I expected something else.Would I come back? Absolutely.

No amenities and breakfast good enough to keep most guests from complaining. Barely. All in all, a forgettable place at a premium cost.

Plus, a $25 daily parking fee if you have a car. I certainly would not have stayed at Hotel Renew if I realized the fine print pushed the price tag to $250 per night.

A real money saver since Hawaii is expensive. Also, movie rentals. It was nice to lay in bed watching a movie after a long day. Also had beach towels and chairs. Keurig in the room was also nice if you wanted coffee outside of breakfast. And toiletries were great, CO Bigelow they were awesome.

Even after checking into the room, before the bags arrived, the hotel lobby rang up to ensure we had everything we needed. This is almost unheard of in any hotel of any caliber.

If you blink you'll miss it! Just like I did and I circled the block again and pulled up to the curb for valet. This hotel is located on the right hand side of Paoakalani Ave. Valet Only (25$/night). Located on the right after Aston Waikiki beach hotel. As soon as I entered it already calmed me down...dim lights, water feature and sophisticated decor, truthfully it looked felt like you walked into the lobby of a spa. The front desk person greeted me and gave me cold hand towels and fresh juice. She was friendly and efficient. This hotel is small in comparison to its huge neighbors like the Marriot across the street but it's really a gem. With only 9 floors total, its very unlikely you'll be kept up at night by partying neighbors and kids sports teams. The room was cozy, sleek and sophisticated. The lighting was really great you can control it from bed. It was clean and the bed was Very comfortable! Flat screen TV on the wall and amazing wifi speeds. Everything was done well in the room and I have no complaints. I choose the Urban view because I live in Hawaii and didn't need to see the ocean. I was in 407 and basically faced a parking lot and had no view but I was okay with that. I would really recommend this place for couples instead of large families because of the room size and ambiance is I think more geared for couples. I would definitely stay here again. If I was a couple visiting Hawaii then would probably upgrade to the ocean view. Keep in mind there is no balcony and the window is NOT a huge one so Ocean view will be really nice but don't expect that you'll be able to have drinks on the balcony.Pros:-Less than a block from the beach. They will provide you with towels and beach chairs.-they have complimentary aromatherapy for your room. You can choose a scent from the check in desk and they will deliver a oil diffuser to your room in a few minutes -great customer service for checking in and out, they did a good job of explaining everything-location is prime! Walking distance to many great restaurants in the area Arancino, Sansei, DK's etc also close to shopping in Kalakaua and Kuhio Ave. -If you too lazy to leave the room and just want to relax there is waikiki room service which will deliver to this hotel for 5.99$ delivery fee. I ordered from Sansei and it was amazing!-Although I paid a 25$ amenity fee I appreciated the free DVD rentals in the lobby with up to date movies and the really fast wifi in the room, Keurig in the room and free coffee in the lobby and free continental breakfast.

The staff were wonderful and the location is pretty much perfect. The problem is that this place lacks some of the modern conveniences that hotel go-ers expect. First thing: there are no power outlets next to the bed. So to charge your phone (which you probably use as an alarm) you have to plug in on the other side of the room. No snooze mode for you. And of course if you want to use the hotel provided clock as an alarm, the same deal applies. (Caveat, if you want to go black ops, you can get to an outlet, but it does require pulling off a plate that is hidden under a nightstand)The location is perfect. Just off the main drag at Waikiki, its close enough to be in the hustle and bustle but far enough away to be quiet. You can walk to the beach with the hotel provided towels which was definitely a plus. Other items to note: the lanai is not anything special. Concrete platform off the edge of the building. It's not facing the water so it seems they have it just to say they have it. The view from our room was pretty great. There are others better in the area, but that was something that we really appreciated about the room. An parking is valet only at $25/day. A little steep for me but on par with the area. I liked the valet option and the guys who ran the vehicles were great. Finally the bar is basically non-existent. If you are picking a hotel and a bar-scene is a must, this is not your hotel.

Last time in 2013 - back then, besides being part of Aston, had still proper boutique feel and features. We came back 3 years later just to be disappointed - everything that was good and boutique about it is gone - except the staff. Staff is still good, friendly and do everything they can to keep the boutique vibe - unfortunately management and management policies went a long way to kill it. Before - hotel was better priced with amazing feature (which was for me a selling point - access to the complimentary room to refresh after check out before going to the airport if flight was late) - this is all gone. All they offered now was 1/2 price room for couple of hours - pretty much exactly like any other hotel... Ok it is my fault I assumed, they kept it as it was absolutely brilliant idea that made a lot of difference, should've asked before booking... my bad (hence average not poor rating). So good things: - good location (as many other hotels in the area) - free dvd/blu ray rental (not so free its part of extra charge and it is age of streaming services...) - ok breakfast bad things: - not great room service (actually - we had to ask for toilet paper at front desk...yes seriously - ASK for TOILET paper in the hotel....) - extra 25$ 'resort fee' - so whenever you see the price per room add 25$ to it - makes it in line with all other hotels in the area - and they dont even have proper restaurant etc. - no more complimentary room/place to refresh after the checkout - that's the most disappointing about the hotel (but yeah my fault should have asked in advance)So is it worth it staying in the fake boutique hotel? Maybe just for the staff - they are mostly great. But, it is just another hotel with no boutique features whatsoever, and without even a single thing that would set this hotel apart from other places in the area.

The entire staff is amazing. From the valet to the housekeeper. They are very friendly and have the utmost courtesy from the moment you arrive. They greet you with a towel and fresh pineapple juice. The rooms looks exactly like the pictures in the website. We selected the ocean view room. It is a beautiful view but you have to remember, you are about a block away and there is no balcony. If you really want a real beach view and want to be outside in the balcony, I suggest to look at another place. For us, it was good for the first 5 minutes and then we didn't care for it. For the amount paid for the room, you get free WiFi and free breakfast (bread, muffins, fruits, coffee, juice,..). You have to pay for these features at other locations. They also offer free DVD's and games to watch in your room (which we took advantage one day). Parking is $25. You could look for street parking but i don't have the patience to look around and keep driving around. There is also parking at the zoo on the other street. Its $1 per hour. We took advantage of that when we were out all day visiting places. Otherwise, if we stayed walking distance, the rental stayed at the hotel. The hotel is only a half block away from the beach. You literally walk by an entrance to another hotel and that's it. There is a convenience store on the opposite corner of the street. Overall, i would immediately book another stay with this hotel if needed.","Miami, Florida, Usa",2,5.0

This one doesn't necessarily try to replicate that. It's just a really solid boutique hotel. Location: It's in a perfect location just 1/2 a block from the beach. It's a bit far southeast which actually makes for Reservation: Fairly straightforward. Be aware of a resort fee of about $25 a dayCheck-In: Very easy. We got 2 keys and a dvd rental card. There is a DVD/Bluray machine next to the elevator that is free for rentals.Room: The room is nice with small little added features. There's an umbrella on the wall (which thankfully we never needed). All the lights are on button switches which are laid out everywhere in the room. This made it really easy to turn the lights on and off. Overall a clean room with nice little touches. We had a city-view room which was fine. We didn't end up being indoors much. The bathroom was fairly small and the shower temperature was exceedingly difficult to control. Otherwise, there is an aromatherapy option where you can choose from 4 different scents and they'll bring it up to your room.There is free in-room wifi that is fairly speedy. There is also an in-room Playstation 3 that seconds as a blu-ray/DVD player.Service: Everyone was exceedingly nice and helpful throughout the hotel. Rest of the hotel: Continental breakfast is free each morning from 7-9:30am. It consists of small pastries, fresh fruit, granola with milk, and fresh-squeezed carrot/apple/orange juice as well as coffee. This is served at the small bar that I never really saw anyone at.

The location is amazing and right off Waikiki Beach. From the moment you check in, it felt like we were being pampered. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with pineapple juice and a cold lemongrass towel. Definitely felt amazing to have that cool towel after flying all day. We got into our room and it was very nicely laid out. Although my mom or daughter did not smell anything, I am currently 6 months pregnant and have the nose of a bloodhound. There was a slight musky smell in the room (probably from a past guest) but my pregnancy hormones and super sensitive nose could not handle it. The staff immediately found another room for us and their aroma concierge (you get to choose a blend of essential oils to diffuse in the room) was a great to relax us and made the room smell amazing!The breakfast is nice and simple with fresh fruit, freshly blended smoothies, coffee, cereal and sweets. The hotel is very modern and has a nice boutique feel. The best part of our stay was the staff especially Ronald and the sweet receptionist when we first checked in. Ronald, was my go to for good places to eat and visit. He always went above and beyond to help us out during our stay. He recommended Marukame Udon which is the best udon I have ever had. We even visited Hotel Renew the following week after our stay and the sweet receptionist and Ronald still remembered our names.

There is a $25 boutique fee per day but this covers light breakfast, wifi, movie rentals and beach gear hire. The beds are super comfy and aircon works well. The balcony is quite spacious, the only thing i would suggest the hotel fix is the amount of lighting.

But luckily, the front desk was nice enough to let us check in when we arrived at 12pm. That was the best already, I had nothing to complaint about. So when the staff asked if it was our first time in Hawaii, then we said yes, it was our first time and its our Honeymoon. We travelled all the way from Hong Kong which was a long ride. I did not asked for any upgrades and when we were in the room, the staff brought us a bottle of champaign, small box of chocolates and the best was the front desk staff wrote us a card congratulating us. Thumbs up. Pros: - very close to the beach (2-3 min walk) or 5-8 mins walk to Waikiki beach- Shuttle bus ($2 USD) to Ala Moana shopping mall, but not directly in front the hotel, the bus stop is beside the hotel (10 steps away) - friendly staff (100%) - Comfy bed- Ps 3 in the room- Free rental movies and ps3 games- location I find it pretty good (not the best), so basically its the end of the tourist street (Kalakaua Avenue). So you can walk up on one side of the street and then walk back on the other side of the street, which it will cover everything. - Free Wifi (not the fastest speed, but it works, so can't complain- Good location for joining tours cause the pickup can be right beside the Hotel. Cons:- Rooms are way too dark - Rooms not in its perfect conditions- My room was 207 and it had a balcony, which I didn't use. During at night around 4am-530am, the garbage trucks are tooo loud..and will wake you up. Not a good side to be on. - The washroom's window are just glass shutters and there are gaps so mosquitoes were able to fly in.. So must close the door after using the washroom.

I kept coming back to Hotel Renew's site, and mid-December pulled the trigger and booked it for just over a week's stay.The price was right and the location was perfect. Located on a quieter corner, just a block off the beach and tucked about a block off from the zoo, the location was just close enough - but well away - from the mega-Waikiki hotel nonsense that lurks just a few blocks west. Walk-able if you want that, but you can just as easily walk east towards Diamond Head if you don't.It's a boutique hotel in that there are limited rooms and floors. I was on the 9th (top floor) facing the city/territory which was fine, as you're rarely in the room anyway. On that side, there's a few condos and hostels across the adjoining street. Other than typical city noise (Honolulu is a city) I didn't find it distracting. The room was spotless clean, modernly furnished, and had a slick lighting system. (though it did take me til the second day to touch the oddly located and labeled ""push me"" button.)The amenities are okay. Breakfast is on like clockwork every day, but it was identical every day. It's okay for a little starter coffee and fruit, but you'll want to explore the food scene available in the city. Most of the better/local restaurants are up Kapahulu, so if you want to steer clear of the touristy joints, that's easy to do with a short walk or car ride anywhere from the hotel up towards the H1.Beach gear (Chairs, mats, towels) are all available and in good shape. What stands out most was the staff. All were friendly and helpful, from the reception to the room attendants.

No going back to sleep after that and was disappointing considering the price you pay for the rooms. Breakfast was ok.

The front desk staff is all super pleasant and while they are checking you in, you will get to have a glass of fresh, cold pineapple juice and a cool lemongrass towel to take the heat off from the day. The rooms are clean and modern and there are quite a few amenities for those that need wifi, like to drink coffee or enjoy a continental in the morning and they also let you know of all the activities the hotel and the surrounding area will be doing for the week. The beds are comfy, the location convenient to much of Waikiki and the price isn't too high to stay yet. If you are Kama'aina (local ID), remember to book as such! Will keep coming back and I recommend giving it a try! ","Honolulu, Hawaii",125,5.0

Why pay $450 a night for a room you are basically only sleeping in?Hotel Renew fitted the bill and turned out to be more than a place just to sleep. Rooms were reasonably priced, even the ocean view I had was just under $200 for the days I was there. It was just a block from the beach and surrounded by stores and restaurants in the area. Positive: Great location near restaurants and stores. Excellent staff. My room had a direct view of the beach and a balcony. The hotel is sandwiched between two larger hotels but because of a restaurant and pool at one of the hotels, Hotel Renew has some rooms that directly look over that area for a great view of the beach. Breakfast is fine with pastries, juice, fresh fruit, coffee and tea. Worked for me since I stuffed myself at other places for lunch and dinner. Valet parking was reasonable and I typically got my car within a few minutes. There is a small bar in the restaurant that I saw some people use in the evening. Negatives. Easily overlooked but the wifi was questionable. Wifi is big to me since I often do working vacations and the speed was slow. I frankly don’t understand in this day why hotels don’t invest in quality wifi. The layout of the room was also awkward for me. This may be totally a personal preference but the desk was near the front door and had no view of the TV. Also the room was dark even with the lights at full blast. I actually had to use the flash light on my iPhone to see in the closet and in certain places.Hotel Renew is a good pick.","Baltimore, Maryland",25,4.0

When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly staff who presented us with a scented towel, juice and a choice of scents for our room. The overall feel of the hotel and staff is very welcoming. The rooms and bathroom are on the small side but well appointed and what we expected. We had one issue with our AC one day and notified the staff as we were leaving. Upon return it was fixed and we never had another issue with it. We found our bed to slightly slope on one side, as did the other couple in their room as well. My husband found a way to remedy the problem on his own so we did not make it an issue. We also had to ask for extra towels frequently as sometimes only 3 were left and there are 4 of us. They were always promptly brought to our room. The bath products are nice and often found at boutique hotels. There is a complimentary umbrella in the room that we found to be very helpful. We asked for extras many times and they were very accommodating. We also loved the beach towels and beach chairs that were provided whenever we needed them. The rooms and entire hotel was very clean and calming. The elevator is quick and we never had to wait on it. We ate breakfast one day and it was pastries and juices. The eating area is quite small. You can't beat the location of this hotel. You are 30 seconds from the beach and there are plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. Right next door is an ABC store which is a local convenience store. Starbucks is right around the corner as well as a Jamba Juice, Subway and a Wolfgang Puck Express for quick eats. Right next door is also the area in which tour buses pickup and drop off. Very convenient if you book any tour.We really enjoyed our experience and would stay here again.

Our fridge was pooling with a bit of water so we mentioned it to front desk - a new fridge was put into place and kept our poke and beer nice and cool for the next few days.

Yes the air-con may be a little noisy and too cold at times - but you can adjust the temperature easily. The hotel provides good quality shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion. The only thing I would like the hotel to know is the beds are on the softer side - my husband and friends couldn't sleep well.Parking: We didn't have to pay the $25 daily valet parking (in and out access included). We found plenty of parking just past the zoo every day (10-15 minute walk). Amenities included with $25 daily fee: beach mats, towels, simple breakfast (pastries, fruits, freshly squeezed carrot/Apple/orange juice, organic granola, coffee, tea)Location: the beach is less than 5 mins away.

This was our second and final hotel stay in Waikiki as we were heading back home. We arrived to the hotel earlier than the check-in time (around 11) and our room was not ready (totally understandable since check out time is 12). The lovely ladies at the front desk greeted us with refreshing pineapple juice and nice cool towels. Since the room was not ready we decided to go to lunch to kill some time, and were told that if the room is ready earlier we will get a phone call. As we were walking back from lunch we got the call (around 1 o'clock) that our room is ready! The room is very nice, clean, modern and has central air and a balcony! We were in room 801. A few minutes after our arrival we received a bottle of champagne and a very nice note from the hotel congratulating us on our anniversary. Overall, we enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Room is on the smaller side but that is fine since we did not spend much time there it was just overwhelming at times with our luggage ( as a side note, there's space under the bed to shove things under for extra walking space on the floor). Waikiki beach is a super tourist area and is rather nice. Realistically, you do not need a car unless you want to do your own excursions ( we really only went to Pearl Harbor). Shopping, dining, beach, zoo, and even Diamond Head trail is a walking distance (about 30 min walk - we took the bus back since it was raining ans it was super easy). I always appreciate a free continental breakfast and this one was nice. They had some pastries, fresh squeezed juice, fresh fruits and coffee. some unknown expenses: $25 a day for valet parking - you can try to look for a spot but its very hard with the amount of cars and cleaning. $25 a day for a resort fee - whatever you paid, you will be paying an extra $25 each day you stay there..

The location of the hotel is quite convenient as its just off the main Waikiki strip on the end closest to the Zoo and Diamond Head, there is also a trolley (bus) stop right in front of the hotel which makes getting up and down the Waikiki strip quite easy. The staff throughout the hotel were all very friendly and helpful with all our questions and bookings (for tours, care hire and shuttle bus transfers to the airport). You will need to pay a $25 USD amenities fee (on top of your room rate) for each day of your stay, which will cover your breakfast, beach towel/chair hires, dvd/ps3 game hires and a few other things. As my wife was pregnant, we took advantage of the dvd hires (pretty good range) most nights after coming back from dinner. A few opportunities we felt that hotel could improve on include: - Breakfast Times: The 7:30am-9:30am window where you could eat something downstairs is a little restrictive for people who get up early to do an early morning activity (such as a hike) or decide to have a little sleep in. Perhaps extending breakfast times to 6:30am-10:30am would be best.- Breakfast Range: The breakfast was OK (especially the fresh fruit salad), but the granola/museli from the dispensers were too sugary to eat. Would of been great to have a plain (sugarless) corn flakes or oatmeal option. - Water Pressure of Shower Heads: It wasn't 'terrible' but the water pressure when we had showers felt quite weak.- Noise of Aircon: Was a little loud at night when we slept. - Ocean View Room: We booked a premier ocean view king room and were placed onto a room on the 5th floor. There wasn't much of a view, so perhaps ask for a room on a higher level otherwise it doesn't make much sense to pay for a ocean view room as Renew is located behind the main Aston hotel.

Our room had a very good size, well equipped and there was a lovely lady, Tina, who serviced it every day, smiled to us all the time and made sure we had a great stay. Please pass on our thanks to her! It is great to meet people like that.The hotel is very near the beach, provides beach gear (towels and mats) to the guests, which was a great plus for us. They also provide a continental breakfast every day, which is great to have, although there is not a huge choice. All the staff was really nice and helpful. There is plenty of choice in terms of bars and restaurants around the hotel (we really liked the food at Tiki's Grill&Bar next door). We rented a car for a few days to drive to other beaches on the island and it was a great decision, Oahu is an amazing place.We thoroughly enjoyed our holiday and if we have the chance to go back to Hawaii for our anniversary, we would choose Hotel Renew again!","New London, Connecticut",9,5.0

Small, with shared amenities with the next door ""sister' hotels - Waikiki Beach Marriott and Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel, a little out of the way, and cheap. I was able to get a pretty good rate during off season and using AAA. The last time I visited, I stayed right in the middle of Waikiki and it was difficult to sleep because of all of the noise. I did not have that problem with the Hotel Renew. There are plenty of amenities offered, a (very) small bar downstairs, and it's just a short walk to the beach, bus stops, restaurants, etc. The beds were comfy and the room was decent for most rooms, but large for Honolulu :)Next time I visit Oahu, it'll be at the Hotel Renew.","Charleston, South Carolina",26,5.0

The service and attention to detail are amazing! Rena at the front desk greeted us with a refreshing beverage and lightly scented towelette to clear the mind of any hassles we may have encountered in our travels. After our seemless check-in, we went to our upgraded room with a partial ocean view. The room was top notch and had everything I hope for in a hotel room: clean, modern design with all the amenities. We had a comfortable king size bed, huge flat screen TV, & docking station for our iPhones. An additional feature I loved about our room was the spaciousness of the room. Many rooms in Waikiki leave me feeling cramped and in the 1980s, but not this place. I LOVED our room! We had a few minor hiccups with our bathroom (light bulb burned out and such) and the front of house staff was gracious in having the issues resolved immediately. They offered to move us, but like I said earlier I loved our room, so we chose not to move. Although they do not have a restaurant here, they do have a bar with a generous happy hour. Living in the islands, I do not typically have mai tais, but their's is worth stopping in for. Go see Amanda or Donna Marie and they will take good care of you!The customer service in this hotel is amazing. No matter who was at the Front Desk, they always greeted us upon our arrival and departure. Big Mahalo to all of them: Rena, Grace, Kealii and Lani! Additionally, they truly listen to your wants and needs. I had a special request regarding parking of an oversized vehicle. They not only honored our request, but they ensured a parking space was always available for us. Did I mention they have valet service? Those guys were awesome!!

Long story short, the staff was able to find us a room. I don't know who's fault it is but just a warning to anyone booking via Hawaiian Airline. Other than this drama, here's what I like/dislike about the hotel:Likes:- Great location, steps from the beach and bus station, convenient store just around the corner- relatively cheaper than most hotels in the area- friendly staffDislikes:- Room is very dark and dated. - The air con is very loud and smells moldy- The bathroom amenities has this cheap weird smell, and the bar of soup included just doesn't lather","Paradise, California",87,3.0

After doing a thorough research for a hotel which combined comfort, great location and a reasonable rate we finally picked this hotel.That was probably the smartest decision we ever made! the hotel not only offered great rooms, with a discreet decoration, but also was only one block away from Waikiki Beach. There were lots of convenience stores, eating places just a few steps away and we could have not asked for more.However what really, really impressed us was the hotel's staff, namely the front desk sweet girls and guys. They made our stay a very special one: there was never a ""no""or a ""maybe""whenever we asked for something. Whatever it was they delivered it with a great smile, a joke, or a warm gesture (Jessica in particular treated me and others like a real mom!).So thank you Lani, Jessica, Justin,Rey and our lovely room service lady for treating us in such a special way. We will go back and we will stay at the Renew again thanks to you.A big thank you and see you soon.Domenico Palma / Vitorio Continelli","Sao Paulo, SP",4,5.0

Valet parking was $25 per day as was the resort fee but still priced considerably lower than the other hotels on Waikiki. Very comfortable bed, quiet, extremely accomodating and friendly staff. Continental breakfast was adequate with fresh fruit, juices, cold cereal; pastries weren't worth the calories!

Breakfast was good and as space was a little limited (although we could always get a seat if we chose to), we simply took ours back to our room to enjoy in comfort. We very rarely eat (or want) a large cooked breakfast so coffee, juice, fruit and pastries were filling enough and a nice start to the morning. All in all we had a very nice time in this hotel, staff were very friendly, rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. Only one teeny tiny thing to make it better, the man at reception told me I could turn down the air con on the actual unit which I attempted to do for about 10 minutes. Much later we found the controls were on the wall :( only minor, but annoying when you're freezing.

We also appreciated being at the Diamond Head end of Waikiki, close to Kapiolani Park and the less touristy restaurants on Kapahulu Ave. Our room was clean and comfortable, with a nice king-sized bed, Kurig coffee machine and refrigerator. The complimentary continental breakfast was also good, with a tasty selection of breads/pastries, cereal and fruit, along with juice, tea and coffee. I'd recommend a room facing south, away from the street (as we had) and consider paying a little extra for an ocean view room.

I liked the fact it was a smaller Boutique accommodation and felt it made my stay a more personal and friendly experience, also travelling solo I felt very safe staying there. The Staff (front of house, housekeeping and maintenance) were amazing! I cannot praise them highly enough. They were very helpful, kind and a joy to deal/interact with. My room was spotless and immaculately serviced during my stay. I had a balcony from which you could see Waikiki Beach (an unexpected bonus which was greatly appreciated as it added to my experience).

Large TVs equipped with the play station if your that way inclined or just need some down time from the cocktails and karaoke. While like anywhere in Waikiki it's not what you would consider cheap it's definitely affordable and compares well to other hotels.

I spent time talking story with everyone from the maintenance guy (who worked on my sink, unexpectedly) to the front door guy to the cleaning staff and bar server and everyone went the extra mile to make me feel at home. In fact, not wanting to bother the maintenance guy, I left for awhile then returned and he mentioned I could request another room if I wanted. I joked that he could keep the diamond ring that must be plugging the sink all for himself that way and decided to change rooms. To my surprise, my room was upgraded and a few fees were waived! More than I could expect or wanted!I must state - I left the prior hotel because of a bug problem. I'm not a picky person. I have found several inexpensive hotels in Waikiki that are both clean, affordable and sit right near the beach. However, I draw the line at bugs and I realize Hawaii is tropical but when they're in the elevator, bathroom and room itself, I didn't want to bring them home in my luggage. Also to note - I was bumped from the airline and spent a day at a resort style hotel that sits on the beach after Hotel Renew. It was loud, busy, touristy and though it had alot to do, it was most definitely NOT relaxing nor was it as welcoming. Winner? Hands down, Hotel Renew.","Seattle, Washington",25,5.0

Once my apartment was packed up and I moved out, I booked a 10 day stay at Hotel Renew after some extensive research. Concierge: Rena at the front desk was so kind and professional when she originally booked my hotel room for me over the phone. I was delighted that I met her in person at the front desk when I checked in as well. She was able to get me a beautiful Ocean front King bed room at an affordable price! Upon check in, I got their famous lemongrass scented cool towel and a refreshing glass of pineapple juice. Valet: All of the valet gentlemen were speedy, friendly, and quick to park or get your car. Warren was the best! When I checked out of the hotel, he gave me a sweet box of chocolate covered macadamia nuts!Bar: 5:30-7:30 happy hour. Need I say more? But I will. The hotel's drinks are just perfect after a day of exploring, touring, and beaching. My favorites were the Modern Margarita and the Moscow Mule.Hotel Room: The room was absolutely beautiful with the ocean view, and sleek, modern furniture. The bathroom was very clean (which I'm very particular about at hotels). Being on the 8th floor, I wasn't bothered by the Kalakaua night noises at all. I could barely hear anything once I closed the sliding window covers. I was knocked out every night after some good food, drinks, and of course a super comfortable King bed. If you're looking for a chill night in, they have a Red Box-like DVD rental machine downstairs in the lobby with lots of good movie options. It was nice to be able to come back into my room with the sheets freshly made and towels folded by Tina, the nicest room service attendant!Overall, I was extremely happy with the hotel, the services by all of the employees and the convenience of the location, because it's so close to every restaurant, bar, and beach you want to be at! When I come back to visit Hawaii, I will definitely be staying here again.","New York City, New York",4,5.0

It's more of an adult hotel. Some of the pros were: staff were very friendly, valet was very fast, small continental breakfast, balcony ocean view was pretty, room stayed nice and cold, had access to DVDs, nice happy hour and it was very close to the beach. They also had a deal for military where we didn't have to pay the amenity fee or parking. That was an awesome pro for us. The cons were: the room was very small including the bathroom, lighting wasn't very bright, no pool, balcony doesn't face the ocean in an ocean view room, you can see the ocean from the window but you can also see the top of the hotel next to us (which I have stayed at and loved) and continental breakfast was very limited. I have stayed at two other Aston hotels and I loved them. I liked this one for the deal we received. I think the staff and deal made it worth the smaller room and no pool. I would stay here again as long as it was just my husband and I. I think the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel is better if you are going with multiple people or a family.

Given the cost of the other hotels in the area and what they had to offer thank goodness we found this hotel. Though it does have the feel of a small boutique hotel they are not shy on their offerings. The hotel is one hotel off of Waikiki so to start you skip out on the noise of the beach and everyone shopping, but still remain steps away from the action. Upon arrival they greet you with a fresh towel and juice, which for us after being stuck in traffic hit the spot. They also give you a DVD/Playstation 3 rental card that we were not expecting. There is a machine in the lobby that you can rent anything from for free (player in the room is a playstation 3). The choices are very limited but they do offer new and current titles. Though we did not take advantage of it they also offer free beach gear to use for the day. Though I am not sure exactly what it includes. Unlike many of the other hotels in the area they do offer free breakfast, nothing major but it is enough to start your day. Rooms we very clean and the hotel felt new and updated. The only thing we did not care for was figuring out what to do when we got there. It was extremely busy on the street and if you blink you miss it, there is no parking (like most hotels in the area) and if the space in front is blocked by one of the many bus, trolleys or other public transport in the area be prepared for a loop around the block. Just park out front and a valet will help you out. Again, that was the only thing we did not care for but understand it is not their issue. Clean, new, tons of extras, steps away from the beach, shopping, food, zoo and aquarium... all of this at an extremely reasonable rate, how can you go wrong.","Upper Sandusky, Ohio",6,5.0

In a market where everything is ""bigger is better"" Hotel Renew gave you the feeling that you were in a small, boutique hotel tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. The location is great - Kuhio Beach just steps from the door, and all of the activities of Kalakaua moments away. I also really liked that you could get out of Waikiki easily by exiting either to Ala Wai Blvd., or up Kapahulu to the freeway. Oh, and just a five minute drive from Leonard's Malasadas!We had an ocean view room and it was great. Good space, lighting and amenities. If I stayed here again, I would ONLY consider an ocean view room on a high floor. The view for the non-ocean view rooms were not that good.A few minor drawbacks. None of the rooms had balconies. In Hawaii, the air is everything. The design of the hotel does not allow any of the rooms to have balconies. Secondly, the breakfast was really weak. I did not need a full breakfast spread, but the items served did not appeal, so we only had the coffee (oh, and the malasadas fresh from Leonard's.) Finally, the hotel has virtually no parking so all parking is valet. The guys were great in getting your car as fast as possible, but at times you had to wait as they retrieved a few cars ahead of you.The pricing/value was wonderful.

Beautiful, modern, and extremely comfortable. White linens with a variety of pillows, tv, all kinds of ""mood"" lighting and for once, ample lights by the bed to read by! Our room faced the street but had wooden panels that closed off the light so it was very dark for sleeping. The agent was very helpful in directing us to find places to eat that were fast and moderately priced (Wolfgang Puck Express less than a block away) and reminded us we had breakfast in the morning. It was continental but really nice selection of muffins and juices. She also told us how to catch the city bus for Diamondhead so we could climb the crater and when they realized we didn't arrange for transportation to the ship they did that for us as well.

A bottle of wine and a small box of chocolates were brought up to our room which I thought was a lovely touch.

Probably the best part of this hotel. But the 4.5 out of 5 on Tripadvisor, and the pictures of the nice, modernized style of room, are completely out of the question and misleading. To give you a short description: this hotel cost us a grand for 4 nights and it was an updated dorm room at best! IF YOU ARE PAST BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT AND ARE A MID TWENTIES AND UP AND MIGHT STAY WITH A GIRL/BOYFRIEND, AVOID THIS PLACE. It is a couple steps above a European (or American, whatever) Hostel. Seriously. The views are between two hotels so very limited, and unless you are on the 7th floor or above (there's 9 floors) you're screwed. Either by the building in front, or the palm trees completely blocking everyone's view, or the 2 nicer hotels with fantastic views on each side. My girlfriend and I were so disappointed with the pictures that made this room appear to be grand, and spacious to find an updated dorm room with new sinks, a TV with basic cable and a PS3 to play movies. The rest of the room had just enough space for walking. I could keep going about the things that bothered me, but below is the detailed description of costs and other aspects. First, let's get this straight, there is so much nickle and diming going on here. Maybe they are trying to make up for profits other actually ""nice"" hotels are getting. It is $25 a night to store your vehicle or $4 an hour. You have to pay a ""concierge fee"" of $25 a night as well. I thought I already did this through expedia because those fees looked like the $25 a night, but no, they still have you pay for that fee if you booked through a 3rd party and not them directly.....Second, you get a ""continental breakfast"" each morning. Ya, if scones and fruit with coffee or a apple/carrot smoothie shot is breakfast...... I was offended this was even offered. It just furthered my irritation with the fact we forked over a grand to stay at this place.....Third, the place is cramped which was something I knew going into it with the lobby pictures (obviously the room pictures did not make it appear to be cramped), but it is literally cramped up and down throughout the entire hostel I mean ""hotel"". The hallways are cramped and hot which made us very hot and sweaty waiting for the 9 story elevator system..... We thought it smelt like salt and sweat. They say they have a bar which they do but it basically is an employee that helps out and when they have to stand behind the bar they just watch movies all day. A) because ppl realize they don't want to have drinks at a 4 seater bar and B) this hotel sucks and not appealing for a bar scene (nor big enough).Ok for positives. Like I said the staff was probably the best part. They really were great people trying to help. As for location, yes this is a good spot. If this was Vegas it would be towards the end of the strip however. Sure, it was nice to have Free DVD Movies (I was super surprised these were actually true to their word and ""Free""), but who wants to watch movies in a hotel in Hawaii lol.....? When we were winding down, this was nice though. The bed was nice, good amount of comfy pillows, linens were good, TV was big. That's about it though. Overall I was extremely disappointed with the quality, the size of our room and the overall hotel. Especially with the gimmicks and hidden fees.I would have rather just forked over the 300 a night to stay at an actual nice hotel......Good Luck!-B","Redondo Beach, California",3,2.0

Every member of their team that we interacted with (front desk, bartender, maids, bellhops) were all friendly, outgoing, and sincerely interested in our stay and comfort. Renew is a smaller, boutique-style hotel with a modern decor (albeit a bit dated). It is located on the end of the Waikiki strip, near the Honolulu Zoo and Tiki's Bar & Grill. The current rates for Hotel Renew make it an excellent value.Upon check-in we had small issue with our room, but the staff at the front desk rectified it quickly, efficiently and with very minimal impact on our stay. Additionally, due to weather on the East Coast our flight home was cancelled twice, but they staff was quick and efficient in making us accommodations (granted we were lucky that they had 2 additional nights available). The included breakfast is basic: fresh fruit, muffins, pastries but the highlight is the fresh juice, but they run out quickly!Rarely are you able to stay at a place where the staff always seems available and eager to help, is able to make quick and efficient decisions that make you feel accommodated (and special), and impacts your stay in a positive light as much as the renew. There are newer, brighter, and much more expensive hotels in Waikiki, but I would put the Renew staff against any in Hawaii! Thanks to the staff for an excellent stay! Aloha!Rental Cars: The Hotel Banyon, which is about 2 blocks away (only 2 crosswalks - both at the same intersection) offers 24hr parking for a flat rate of $20 cash only. It is a 24hr ticket, so it must be renewed or replaced by 24hrs on the dot, but the parking lot always had space on both weekdays and weekends and was very easy to get in and out of.","Newbury, New Hampshire",14,5.0

It is a boutique hotel, so it looks tiny in comparison to the giant Hiltons/Hyatts/Marriotts around it, but don't be fooled! The interior is absolutely lovely, the quality of the rooms great, and the staff really some of the friendliest and most helpful I've ever met. I will admit I'm someone who rarely needs much from the staff aside from suggestions on food to try and places to visit, but they more than provided on that front, with maps and smiles. (On their tip, check out Side Street Inn and Uncle Bo's for some awesome local Hawaiian food, both of which are delicious and none too pricey).As you're close to the beach and other hotels, you may get a bit of street noise, but we didn't find anything too obnoxious. The bedrooms were modern with fun dimmer lights, beds were great, the bathroom clean. The hotel offers you two free (Keurig) coffees per stay for your room (though there's free water/coffee in the lobby), continental breakfast, and wifi all included in a $25 daily amenity fee, which I didn't find too outrageous, considering those fees seem to be the norm of Hawaii hotels these days. The view out the window of our room wasn't particularly impressive, but we spent very little time in the room staring out the window, so it wasn't a problem for us. ;) You also get proximity to the beach and an ABC (food/liquor/souvenir) store literally next door and are an easy walk down the main street for all the tourist shops and good food (and drinks!) -- though keep in mind some of the best restaurants are off the main drag, farther back in the more residential streets. I would say parking may be your only real concern -- Hotel Renew does offer valet, if you'd like to take them up on it, but we managed to find a parking garage just one block down that offered $15/day parking, or $60/7 days. Overall, an excellent stay for the two nights. Staff always smiled and said hello, welcome back, or wished you a good day. Really lovely people who I suspect have great suggestions for anything you want to do -- whether it be low-key local exploration, shopping, checking out downtown, or hiking and more nature-related adventures.

I would suggest including that in the price of the room, and not having this be an ""add-on"" fee to what is almost necessary now (Internet access) to travelers who would stay at this hotel. My room was a little weak. It smelled a bit but I must have gotten used to it because the second day it didn't seem to smell as bad.

Most hotels in Honolulu who charge a fee like this call it a ""resort fee"" because they have resort amenities but this hotel has to call it an 'amenity fee' because it's decidedly NOT a resort. Since it isn't a resort but they want to be able to charge the fee that all the other hotels charge (which also allows them to list a lower room rate for online searchers by making it a separate fee) they cobble together a lot of lame (cool towel, juice and aroma) so-called ""amenities"", arrange with the Marriott for access to their pools and call the whole mess ""Club Renew"". Then their website misrepresents Club Renew by making it seem like it's all physically part of the hotel. Hotel Renew didn't even have the basic amenity of an on-site restaurant. It's really too bad that they have this shady underhanded way of doing business because the hotel itself, the staff and the room were all really great - even excellent. Of course even though our room was very nice I'm sure the room we wanted was even better. The irony is that had the hotel let us give them the money for the room we wanted instead of taking it surreptitiously for non-existent amenities, we would have been delighted with the hotel and this would have been a glowing 5-star review. Instead we were left feeling like we were chumps who had been duped and wouldn't stay there again or recommend it to anyone else. They are shooting themselves in the foot with this fee scheme..","Palm Springs, California",19,2.0

Great little hotel. Felt cozy, unlike some of the bigger hotels, and was still just two minutes walk from the beach. Everything is within walking distance on Waikiki, so it's actually nice that this is not right in the middle of the main street, where it's very busy. You also get access to the swimming pool at the big hotel next door (Four seasons, I think?), which is nice if you want to snack while lazing around.The complimentary breakfast was pretty uninspiring though. Fruit and some pretty average pastries. Recommend that you go out to eat breakfast (like Mac 24/7) rather than eat in.This would be okay for families, but kids would probably appreciate a place with a hotel on site.

I requested over and over again for an early check in at 7am and i even suggested to pay half of the money of a full day for this. I never got an actual response back from the hotel (i booked it through booking.com) - i just got back the automated response (i guess) that my request is possible to happen but they will be sure if this was available a few days before our visit - ok reasonable. So, the day before our visit i realized that I have not yet received any response according to my early check in. So I emailed directly the hotel and what i got as a response was that my request was not available and that i would have to book the room for the day before. Also what really bothered me is that the agent that was responding the emails for the booking asked me to write my credit cards details in the email!!!! Is he/she serious??? I eventually ended up paying through the phone (don't know either if this is secure) even though i requested to book this booking through their webpage or through booking.com. So we were arriving at 7am in the morning of a particular day of the month and they forced me to pay for the day before just to make sure that i was going to be able to check in early...!!!! To understand what i mean... when we arrived the receptionist told us clearly that he will check us out from their system for the last minute booking we did for the first day that we did not even use, and that he will check us in from their system for the 1st booking we did. VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!! They had the room available and they just wouldn't make their customers a facilitation!!Also for the resort fee ... the amenities are not even in the hotel grounds!!! The amenities are located in the Marriott hotel across the street!! They force you to pay also for the amenities even if you do not want to use them!!!

The hotel is a fairly small boutique hotel, with modern decor, although it is a little worn in some places. The hotel is very centrally located in Waikiki, only half a minute to walk to the beach and to lots of shops and restaurants. The staff at the hotel were fantastic and really helpful with rental car bookings, and in suggesting places to visit on our drive around the island. Included in the rate was a basic continental breakfast each morning, and the breakfast area turns into a cocktail bar for a few hours in the evenings (nice for a pre-dinner drink, however as it only has a few tables it can get full there quite quickly). We booked an ocean-view room, which was of a reasonable size, and did have a nice view of the ocean. It was a little disappointing however that the hotel doesn't have balconies, which I really missed seeing as it's a nice warm beach destination (it's a shame to be inside with aircon on when enjoying the view!). The hotel doesn't have it's own facilities such as gym, swimming pool, etc, however Hotel Renew guests are allowed to use the facilities across the road at the Mariott. The only other thing we were a little disappointed with was the extra cost of the amenity fee that guests have to pay per day. Although we were aware of this at the time of booking, it does add up and make an already costly holiday even more expensive. I'm not sure if this is standard practise for all hotels there, or if this is unique to this hotel. Overall though this was a good, clean, moderate standard boutique hotel in a very good location, which I think would be best suited to couples or friends travelling together.","Oslo, Norway",24,4.0

This hotel is best described as ‘narrow’, situated right on a street corner. From the lobby to the hallways, this hotel definitely doesn’t have much available space! The hallways are dark and dingy and everything seems to have been done on the cheap. The only positive thing about this hotel is the location! Located a minute walk from the beach, shopping and restaurants.Pros: So little to mention, but I’ll try. 1) As mentioned before the location is excellent. Right in the centre of the action! 2) The room sizes was decent for such a small block of land. 3) The rooms were clean. 4)…that’s really about it… sorry, I honestly can’t think of anything else that is positive to say.Cons: Now here there are quite a few: 1) The hotel space is tiny! There lobby is the same size as your room. The hallways are narrow and dark. Lighting is extremely poor in all public areas of the hotel, giving it a very dingy, depressing feel. 2) The quality of fixtures in this hotel is horrid! Our drain was blocked and slow to clear and we had a tap that constantly fell off. Several of the power outlets in the room didn’t work. 3) The hotel proclaims a pool and gym, which you may assume is on their grounds. We were annoyed to discover, upon check-in, these amenities were being leased from the Marriot two minutes walk down the road! 4) Their ‘complimentary’ wifi (which you pay resort fee for) was unreliable and slow. Logging in was convoluted and irritating each time. 5) Their ‘complimentary’ breakfast (which you also pay a resort fee for) was utter inedible garbage! It consisted of oily muffins, sugary pastries and a bowl of fruit. There were only four 2-seater tables for the entire hotel in the breakfast area! 6) The rooms stunk! They cover this up with their ‘aroma concierge’ which is basically giving you air-freshener in the room upon check-in. 7) Lighting in the bathroom was described as ‘ambient’, which means you didn’t get a lot of light in there. 8) The beds were uncomfortable and lead to many sleepless nights. 9) The fridge wasn’t great at keeping things cool. 10) The elevators were slow and one seem to be malfunctioning.Conclusion: For the cost this is one of the worst hotels I’ve ever stayed in! It was trying way too hard to appear as a ‘boutique’ hotel on a hostel budget. Charing premium fees for such bad quality left me feeling ripped-off and disappointed. Would not recommend to anyone!","Perth, Australia",148,2.0

When we entered our first room it stunk. Badly. Mostly of body odour and rotten food. Front desk managed to move us to another room without issue, however, the second room was no better. The shower tap whenever used would fall off often hitting our toes and the basin was permanently clogged. When we informed the front desk they sent engineering whose solution was to a) destroy the sink plug and b) hammer the shower tap back on...which lasted all of 5 minutes until it fell again. Add to this and the bed and pillows were by no means comfortable. I'm not a terribly demanding or entitled patron, but when a hotel can't get two basic things I pay for I get irritated.The facilities are equally disappointing and deceptive, where the hotel website would have you concluding that the gym and pool are located onsite. Not so. While it doesn't explicitly state this on their website no where does it actually clearly state both facilities are located in another hotel down the street. Moreover, the ""free breakfast"" (which you pay a ""resort fee"" for), is utter garage, serving a few oily, disgusting pastries, measly fruit, and horrid coffee. But that doesn't really matter because good luck getting seating to eat with all of 8 chairs to chose from.It was especially telling how many complaints this hotel must get when front desk staff didn't even bother to ask us how our stay was upon checkout.

Breakfast was included in the price, but it was primarily just pastries, croissants, and other 'bready' items, plus some fresh fruits. Adding some breakfast cereal or non-bread options will make breakfast less monotonous. Breakfast/lounge area was pretty tight and could get crowded. However, we never ended up having to take our breakfast back to the room. Valet parking was $25 per night. One drawback - stopping and handing off the car to the valet can be tricky. Paoakalani Ave is a busy one-way street with trolley stops and cab waiting areas, a lot of times right in front of the Hotel Renew. And if you cannot stop, then you have to negotiate a whole bunch of one ways, make a rather long trip around the area to get back on to Paoakalani Ave. The hotel was recently renovated, which was a plus for us. All the fixtures, lighting, etc were very stylish and contemporary, not to mention 'green' friendly. One downside, probably due to the renovation, there was a bit of new paint/burnt smell in the room. Not a terribly big deal. Also. the smell was kinda offset by the reed diffuser/fragrance that they sent up to the room, which we could choose from one of four options when we checked in. The bathroom had some cool lighting.

The amenties include one free drink per guest upon check in, daily continental breakfast (consisting of coffee, fresh juices, fruit, patries, and muffins).

I do feel like it should be a choice and not a mandatory thing. Breakfast was not awesome it was just OK - maybe they could add cereal and a place to heat up your bread. Having said that- I loved the smallness of the hotel, it made it cozy and you felt at home when entering.

All-in-all, I was more impressed by the service, location, and amenities of Hotel Renew and would gladly return there on my next trip to Oahu.Located at the far end of Waikiki on a side-street, the hotel is a short two-minute walk from the beach and is nicely positioned away from the bustle of central Waikiki. Check-in was friendly and efficient, with a welcome pineapple juice and towel, and a genuine interest in making sure you're properly welcomed to the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to an ocean view room and by booking through Passport Unlimited, waived resort fees. Compared to the other hotels in Waikiki, Hotel Renew is competitively priced and well worth considering.Our room on the sixth floor was close to the elevators, but well soundproofed (unlike the Modern). The room featured everything you needed for your stay, with a mini-fridge for drinks, modern iPhone alarm clock (complete with lightening cable friendly dock), complimentary internet, and a nice large TV. As part of the resort fee, you're given access to a DVD rental machine, a complimentary cocktail from the lobby bar, access to the pools and fitness center of the Marriott across the street, and most importantly beach chairs and towels.While the view is slightly impaired by the hotels between Hotel Renew and the pacific, it's well worth the upgrade to as there's nothing like waking up to the beautiful blue sea. Nearby the hotel are several convenience stores, eateries, and of course a Starbucks. For those who like to exercise, you're perfectly situated to run around Diamond Head, stopping for a quick hike to the top, and then a brief stop at the Saturday farmer's market … and of course, you're steps away from the Pacific.All-in-all, I was extremely pleased with our stay at the Hotel Renew and would go out of my way to stay there again on my next visit.

Eight of them were spent at the Hotel Renew. I have almost completely positive things to say regarding our stay here.Location:The hotel is located right behind the Aston on the main strip. You're literally 2 minutes from the beach. We didn't really mind not having a view of the beach but we really didn't care for the view of the homes behind us. I always felt like someone was looking into our window (and we had no trouble seeing into theirs!). The garbage collection at six in the morning was loud! For us, the location was great, because we were really excited to visit the Honolulu Zoo and Diamondhead. Both of these are at the end of the main Waikiki strip, and a little ways from the shopping. We didn't mind being down at that end because it was a little quieter into the evening as Waikiki is lively and loud at night! I only wore heels to walk one evening (a bad choice since we walked all the way down to Ala Moana and back) and after that, stuck to flats and sandals if we weren't going to take a cab back.Rooms:We had a room on the top floor at the back. It was nice. They're fairly new and updated, as you can see in most of the photos. The housekeeping team kept everything really clean. The rooms are small, but you don't spend all that much time in them. My only complaint about the room itself is that there is almost NO space in the bathroom on the counter. Trying to get ready for a nice dinner out and I had to struggle to find room for a blow dryer and a flat iron.Amenities:The hotel does offer a continental breakfast, which we took advantage of almost every day. It was mostly muffins, pastries and fruit, but it hits the spot when you're up and ready to go. We did rent a DVD one evening from the machine they have. No complaints, easy to use. Guests are given access to the pool and amenities at the Marriott across the street. We used the second floor pools frequently due to the proximity to the bar.All in all, I would recommend the hotel. Just be aware that there is still a hotel amenity tax on top on your price. We had booked through a third party agency and were lead to believe that it was included.","Prince George, Canada",21,4.0

The hotel the wedding was held at was completely booked so we had to settle for a different hotel. Being that we booked last minute, we has to search for one pronto. Being residents of Oahu, we tried to find a hotel with some kind of kama'aina deal but they were all ridiculously priced, then we stumbled onto Hotel Renew. Reservations were simple and easy.We asked if we could have a late check in since my fiancé & I were both a part of the bridal party and there were no ways of sneaking away from the wedding to check in. We had a little trouble finding where we could park to check in, so we called the front desk and were told that we could pull up right in front of the hotel & a valet attendant would be out and thats exactly what happened. We were greeted by the girl at the front desk. They give you a cold towel that smelled wonderful and a glass of pineapple juice, yum!! While checking in, Rena took notice that we were dressed up and we ended up talking about the wedding. She then told u about the dvd machine that we could rent, and even suggested a few movies that we could enjoy with our son since she mentioned having kids of her own. By the time we finished checking in, it felt as if I knew Rena for years from the way we were conversating. She answered all questions we had, and was very informative! Being one who deals with lots of customers for work, I feel as if she went above & beyond regarding customer service because although it was late in the evening, she reminded us thst its finally time to relax after a long day at the wedding. Our conversation felt more personal & enjoyable rather than it just being some boring business conversation.The room was beautiful and very modern. Nice bed, lovely pillow, and a big screen tv. We slept peacefully, and had no problems with noise coming in from the outside since we were on the 8th floor. I love the fact that you could control the lighting of the room comfortably from your bed!!

There's a regular public bus that you can catch at the airport that has a stop near the hotel (if you want to save & on cabs like I usually do). Very nice greeting from staff upon arrival and ocean view was worth the extra $. Beach was just across the street (the portion directly across from the hotel has a breaker wall, so waters are calm on that end if you happen to be traveling with kids). The hotel will also loan beach items like extra towels, boogie boards, etc when they're in stock. Breakfast was a little light and the area where you eat is small (so at busy times I'm sure there aren't enough tables for everyone). Down the block from the zoo, and Diamond Head not far behind.

It is described as a 'boutique hotel' which can have many meanings. The room was clean, reasonably spacious and being on an upper floor (6th) had a partial sea view - not quite as good as on the featured photograph. The public facilities were limited. A continental breakfast was provided but the breakfast area was extremely limited and it was normally difficult to find a seat. The breakfast itself was quite nice. We had a late flight departure and were initally unable to extend our checkout to a sufficiently late time, so we were intending to hang out at the Marriott next door - there is nowhere suitable for this purpose in the Renew. Eventually we paid extra for a late checkout which was welcome. In retrospect we might have considered a more traditional hotel where we could have relaxed in the public rooms prior to our departure. The hotel was quite expensive for what it offered but, in fairness, accommodation costs in Waikiki are over the moon anyway.The big plus which raises this rating to 4 stars is the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff in the hotel, not always found in larger (or smaller) facilities. The hotel was exceptional in this regard. In future, should we have a late flight, we might be tempted to look for a larger, more traditional hotel with facilities in which to comfortably hang out prior to departure.

The major con was the scrum to get the free breakfast - it is served in the lobby with not enough tables so inevitably it was not a relaxed affair. Our balcony overlooked the back of the nearby Aston Waikiki and there were trucks making deliveries nearly all day - this was very noisy.

Very refreshing.Breakfast is included in the price along with many other things such as beach mats, beach towels, DVD, play station and 2 complimentary cocktails between 5 and 7.The rooms were ok. Simple and basic and just about enough room. The lighting system was very useful tho! Air con was so noisy we would rather sweat it out than listen to it go.You can use the pool and the gym in the Marriott across the road. Both are great facilities.Location for Waikiki is great.

The staff were very helpful and very friendly. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were spacious. The issues that i have with the hotel were:the shower was terrible. The shower head was terrible on pressure and obviously has issues passing water, or has an overly restrictive, water restricter in it. After having a day at the beach and wanting to clean the salt off etc, a more high powered shower would have been welcomed.Zero to no sound proofing from the outside noise. We were on level 7 and overlooked next doors high rise hotel. Each morning they have a person who sings for their guests and it just comes through the windows and doors. The windows are not sealed, and are not double glazed. The bathroom window is also not a sealed window similarly to every window in the hotel room. IT was hard to get to sleep due to the noise and any early morning noise traveled through the room to wake you up.The air conditioner works brilliantly, however its more noisy than a freight train coming through a china store. Im not sure if ours was faulty with the noise, but it was impossible to sleep with it on, as would have been preferred as due to no sealing in the room via the windows, the rooms warmed up again quickly.I think that the valet service is crazy expensive too. $25/day to park on a street, which 1 block away has 24/7 parking is just trying to take people for their money. That plus a cleaning fee / service fee each day can make it another $50US ex tax more than the room rate. If i had known (either through it being made more aware, or if i had seen that this was the norm) i would not have chosen to stay here.That being said, the staff were excellent and are very friendly. The free beach towel service is great along with the water down stairs. I feel that the water in the room should have been free, $2 / bottle is excessive.The hotel wifi is very handy and we had no issues with this. We didnt rent DVD's as we hooked up our laptop to the TV and watched netflix, but thats a great idea for families that want movies, they were free to rent at the entrance of the elevator. We also didnt take the opportunity to goto the spa either which was apparently across the road (may have been wrong) so cant comment on that either.We did not eat / drink anything from the hotel so am unable to comment.","Sydney, Australia",6,3.0

Very close to the beach, a lot of restaurants, convenience stores and all the sights of Waikiki.

So, I called the front desk to let them know that our room had been hastily cleaned and that we'd like to move if possible. They told me they'd have to call me back - I waited 20 minutes or so, no phone call back. So, I went down to the front desk and was told they didn't have any other rooms and that I'd have to stay in that one. No offer to have the room we were in cleaned. I reluctantly returned to our room put on a hoodie, sweatshirt and socks and climbed into a dirty bed because all I wanted was sleep! We woke up about every half hour thanks to the broken air conditioner that sounded as though it was going to fall out of the wall. Worst night sleep I've ever had, I would've been more comfortable sleeping on a towel on the beach! I wore flip flops in the shower and anytime I was walking around the room, the lights were so dim in the room who knows what other filth was on the floor. Day 2 the housekeeper didn't change the sheets, clean the handprints or get the hairs off of the tile in the bathroom and the room still reeked of BO - even after I made the front desk aware of it the night before!Thankfully we didn't come to Hawaii to stay in our room and spent as little time there as possible. Pros: it's a short distance to Waikiki Beach, restaurants & shops. The hotel is located on the East side of Waikiki beach close to the Honolulu zoo and is slightly less congested than the other parts of the beach.Cons: Poor housekeeping, $25 ""Resort Fee"" per night (which they don't advertise and this place doesn't have a pool or gym so I'm not sure how it qualifies as a resort), $25 a night parking, lots of street noise. There is no excuse for poorly cleaned rooms. I'd rather stay in a clean outdated room than a dirty 'boutique' room any day.Will not be staying here again and will be weary of any Aston property.

A great contrast to the hyped-up tourist experience of the Aston Hotel next door, for example.We found the lobby to calm and inviting. The hotel is decorated in dark wood and grey tones which lend an air of serenity. There is a beautiful over-flowing fountain in the lobby next to the breakfast area. You'll even find aromatherapy choices for your room. We especially liked the heavy 'shoji screen' window treatment which are much superior to drapes in blocking out the ambient lightThen you discover that things don't quite work as intended. The wireless temp control on the wall is non-functional and you have to extract the wooden cover of the A/C unit to get access to the controls. The in-room A/C unit rattles every time the compressor kicks in, otherwise, it sounds like a hamster on a treadmill. The desk chair is impossibly low which makes you feel like 2nd grader at your Dad's office. The lobby is perpetually out of umbrellas for guests. The door man's suggestion of 'buying a poncho at the ABC store"" was not particularly helpful. The lighting controls are excessively complicated. There are nine green LEDs beneath the desk which blink like the runway approach at Honolulu International airport.

There were no balconies in most of the rooms but a large picture window overlooked Waikiki Beach, less than half a block away. This is a moderately priced hotel offering excellent value and is a real favourite amongst Australians.We were warmly greeted on arrival and offered an ice cold pineapple drink. This is basically a no frills hotel but very comfortable and staff were most willing to please.Complimentary daily newspapers were available in the foyer as was cold lemon water.Each morning a complimentary continental style breakfast was available in the foyer with a limited number of tables and chairs, with most guests taking their coffee, fresh cut fruit and Danish up to their rooms.Bathrooms were a good size with a selection of toiletries.Literally two minutes walk to the sands of Waikiki and many restaurants, this hotel was well positioned. Next door to its big brother, the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower.A big plus was a key card giving access to the poolside and gym facilities of the large Marriott Hotel opposite.A trolley stop is virtually right outside, taking one to the shopping haven of the Ala Moana Shopping Centre, a twenty minute trolley ride away.The hotel is situated at the end of the Waikiki strip, towards the Diamond Head end.There was very little to find wrong with this property except their lack of reading lamps by the bed. The rooms were not large but more than adequate for a short stay, or for those just wanting to enjoy the delights of the Waikiki area. The bar fridge was a welcome addition as was the pod coffee maker.All Hawaiian hotels seem to have added a new tax, called an Amenity Tax, around $15 per night. This usually includes free internet, which somehow does not seem free when you are paying an Amenity Tax.For those that have not been to Waikiki before, there are a plethora of convenience stores called ABC selling everything one could possibly want from beach wear to beverages, both alcoholic and soft and every kind of high quality snack food from sandwiches to fresh fruit. One of these stores is situated virtually next door and most people pop in every day.One room item that impressed me greatly was perhaps the biggest wide screen TV I have ever encountered in a hotel. The picture quality was exceptional and it brought back memories of sitting in the front row of the drive-in movies (for those readers old enough to remember same). 1 minute walk to Waikiki and great value.129 Paoakalani Avenue, Honolulu - Phone: 808 687 7700","Sydney, Australia",86,4.0

Needless to say we more or less got a series of naps as opposed to a full nights rest. On our arrival, the housekeeper did more of a touch up than a full cleaning.

The lobby was quite busy during the complimentary breakfast near the end of the service, but besides that you could easily ask a question or get help from the front desk without waiting. Additionally, the valet parking was awesome. It was SO fast cause the guy is always out there and it's just up the ramp for him to pick up. At other hotels, you'd be waiting for at least 10-15 minutes. Elevators were fast, internet was included and had no problems either.The rooms were very clean and modern and very quiet; no problems with hearing traffic or drunk people outside and slept well.

This particular room had a partial view of the ocean, but when we first arrived it had a very weird smell to it, I can't even describe it! When we let the front desk know about this, they immediately sent up some essential oils which corrected the smell within minutes. The room overall was very modern with nice finishes. Breakfast was limitet with some pastries, tea, coffee and juice. Valet is $25 per day and no self park options are offered (as expected in Waikiki). My only complaint is the noise level from that particular room. Since we were on the 3rd floor, we could hear all the delivery trucks and the bikes and all the party people making their way back at night. We had to use earplugs the entire stay. We never addressed the issue since moving rooms while on vacation sucks, but I am confident that the staff definetely would have fixed the problem. The room ended up costing us about $260 per night (booked directly with the hotel website) and thats including the resort fee and parking. Trust me, this is cheap for Waikiki. Also a nice benefit was that we were able to use the pools at the Marriot across the street.Overall, my only advise would be to request a room on a higher floor (if possible).

We loved the way you could completely cover the window in the room with built-in panels. We loved the view. The TV in the room was huge and the playstation was a nice touch. The most unfortunate thing about our stay was that the hotel sits squarely between two other hotels and for some reason the neighboring hotel serves breakfast with live music at the pool area just in front of the hotel.

There was a little noise in the street below from time to time, but this rarely interrupted a good sleep. Pool and gym facilities were available at an adjoining hotel and were of good quality and I made use of them on an unusual day of almost constant rain.Breakfast was excellent with loads of fresh fruit and lovely fresh pastries which I could eat to my heart's content! But my favourite aspect of the hotel was sampling the excellent cocktails served up each evening during 'happy hour' by barman Kasi in the cosy bar on the ground floor. His friendly and approachable manner and helpful tips on things to do and great places to enjoy evening meals made my stay all the more special.

I stayed in two different room types - the first was a corner room with balcony and ocean views from the balcony. The room itself was rather small and the bed appeared to be king single sized, this suited me as I was travelling alone, but if you had a partner, it could be a bit of a squeeze to sleep two bodies. The second room I stayed in was further along the hall with no balcony or decent views, but it was very spacious and had a king sized bed.

It was our second visit to the hotel and we really didn't notice much change since it has changed ownership other than the lobby check in desk was more modern. We were warmly welcomed on check in and the management sent up a bottle of wine for us which was a nice touch as it was Thanksgiving. This hotel is perfectly located and very quiet. We love this hotel. We like to find hotels with few children so as to have a more relaxing vacation and the Renew did not disappoint. We had a room high up, facing the ocean. The hallways get a little warm but the room itself was very easy to control temperature. The housekeeping staff kept our room spotlessly clean. Love the crisp fresh sheets every day and the attention to detail. Thank you housekeeping.I find the staff very accommodating and friendly. I love being able to go to the front desk and get towels or beach chairs. They are always available to answer questions or provide directions or help. They printed out our boarding passes for the continuation of our trip to Maui.The breakfast buffet had a bowl of fresh fruit that was replenished when needed. It was like a continental breakfast with fruit. There were carafes of both decaf & regular coffee. Rozanne Perry was assisting with the breakfast and she was so sweet and kind to us, always friendly and personable. What a special employee! She even brought a recipe for us one morning because we told her my husband had a favorite Hawaiian dessert he liked. We will definitely stay here again when in Honolulu.My only complaint would be the coffee in the rooms and the kind the hotel uses for breakfast. It really is awful. Surely with all that Kona coffee close by they could find a better blend. Please, please, please! See you next year on our way to Maui again.","Los Angeles, California",14,5.0

When we booked, the hotel was not part of the Aston group so were not counting on access to a pool that was a good walk from the hotel even though it was just across the street or the activity fee.Breakfast was the fruit, muffins and coffee as advertised but we were surprised the offerings, which did not change much over our four days, were not fresher.The staff were all most helpful providing directions for the city bus, arranging shuttles or recommending restaurants both on and off the beach where the locals ate and prices were reasonable.We certainly recommend tis hotel unless you want to stay in one of the monster hotels with all their restaurants and activities.","Toronto, Canada",15,5.0

The bed was comfy, the decor is modern and contemporary, the bathroom clean and shiny. I didn't get my white gloves out to check for dust on the top of doors or under the bed, but then that's probably because I'm not bothered about tiny imperfections that bother other reviewers of hotels (no idea if anyone has done this here either, its not important!) We happened to be there for my birthday, we didn't mention it to the hotel or anything, my wife brought some cards for me to open from friends and family, and I left them on the desk. when we got back at night, there was a chopped fruit selection waiting in our room, and a note wishing me a happy birthday. That's the type of small touch that goes a long way to make people smile. Couldn't fault it. Yes there was a resort fee, but I'm getting used to that everywhere nowadays, and did cover parking so cant complain.

The rooms smell. They offer a ""scents concierge"" to cover up the smells. If you're not sensitive with smells - it'll be fine - but really - should the rooms smell to begin with? The rooms are old and dingy - they did a good job covering it up with a facade of modern furniture, but it's only surface deep. The chair I had in my room was about 3 feet off the desk - making it nearly impossible to use. When I flipped it over to try to adjust it (eventually maintenance had to send up a screwdriver), the chair was pretty gross underneath. I wonder if they got all their furniture second hand. The battery in the TV remote was dead. The AC unit on the wall doesn't work (hint: just lift the cover and manually set it)The rooms are tiny and dark. On top of that, they charge a $25 ""amenities"" fee (funny - all their amenities are things I'd expect from you know... a hotel!) and $25 valet parking. Except the valet is never there to get you your car or to pick it up. So I usually just walk in and drop the key off at the front desk. I can't wait until the FTC comes down on these hotels with their hidden amenities fee - saying pool/jacuzzi/wifi/breakfast is a separate mandatory fee is deceptive - we *expect* that in the original price per night). The pool that you can use is across the street at the Marriott, which is the most pathetic excuse for a hotel pool I've ever seen. Internet wifi works fine except the hours of 8pm - 10pm, when everybody is on it, so it crawls (I was there for four nights, and noticed this)For $230/night ($180 + $25 + $25), I'd expect a lot, lot more. This place barely meets your expectation of what a hotel should offer. I remember checking in, and a couple was talking to the front desk about the absence of a public computer (apparently it's broken). This hotel literally offers you a room, a bed, and a shower.

The bathroom was also very clean :)We were also given a Club Renew Card which allowed access to the Mariott (across the road), to use their gym and pool facilities, however we never needed to use this during our stay. Why would you when you have the glorious blue waves of Waikiki Beach less than a minutes walk away! We were also given access to rent free DVD movies and games from the lobby, however we also did not use this facility, as most of our nights and days were spent out sightseeing or enjoying the local cuisine at near-by restaurants. Perhaps if we had stayed longer we would have ustilised this facility. The staff were all so friendly and helpful. There was no request too small or too big that they were not happy to assist with. They were able to organise transfers to the local attractions and they always went out of their way to greet us and ensure we had everything we needed. Special mention to Angie, who went above and beyond to give us a welcome call to our room and who also assisted my friends (2 males) change to a room with 2 double beds. The continental breakfast was perfect for what it was. Continental Breakfast means light, cold foods. Fruits, muffins, danish, juice, tea and coffee and that's exactly what we got. Anyone misinterpreting what 'continental' means and turn up expecting a full buffet breakfast have no right to complain. The breakfast offered at Hotel Renew was always prepared so well and there was plenty available to choose from. A perfect start to a hot Hawaiian day! We had so much fun during our stay and we loved everyone at the hotel who made our stay so wonderful. We do not see any need to spend hundreds of dollars more to stay in one of the larger resorts, as Honolulu is so vibrant with lots to do and see, you want to be out and about amongst it and not holed up in your resort. Thats why we found Hotel Renew to be the Perfect place to stay in Honolulu. We cannot wait to visit again soon and bring our families this time :)","Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",4,5.0

It is located 2 mins from the Wakiki beach (which between you and me it is just an overrated beach) and close to other spots like the zoo. We arrived very early in the morning and obviously the room was not ready. However, the girl in the reception was nice and managed to prepare a room, maybe because she saw we mentioned on our reservation that this is a honeymoon and we are coming from a long flight. She also sent a bottle of champagne in the room which was a nice gesture from the hotel along with a hand written congratulations card.The room was just right. We had some issues with the shower head which is the type that saves water and you need to stay in there for 30 minutes to actually get the right amount of water. Other than that clean and spacious enough.You will be getting a light breakfast in the morning consisting in coffee / tea, fruits and pastries. More like a snack. It was nice but light. ABC supermarket is right next door.The staff was friendly and helpful answering our enquiries.Pay attention that you will be asked to pay for a club card which grants you access to the pool of the hotel next door. We paid but never used the facility. I recommend the hotel if you a staying in Honolulu for visiting and you don't plan to spend lots of time in the hotel.","Frankfurt, Germany",69,3.0

Check-in was a breeze, we were provided with 2 room key cards along with a key to Club Renew which provides access to the Fitness Centre & Swimming Pool at the Marriott across the road (we did not use either of these facilities during our stay). We were also provided with a DVD card - they had a machine in the lobby where you could get unlimited Movies/Games which you could play in the Playstation in the room - we grabbed movies on 2 nights & it was an easy process & a good selection.The ""resort fee"" - which we were unaware of - was USD $15 per day - WiFi, Newspaper, Fitness Centre & DVD card is what this covers. This seems to be a common charge in most US hotels - why Hotels don't just add it to the total room rate is beyond me. You pre-pay your accommodation before you leave your country & then you are still saddled with a bill at check-out.As mentioned by previous reviewers, Hotel is half a block back from beach....we were on 9th floor & had a spectacular view of Waikiki Beach. No balcony though. We noted other reviewers stating rooms were noisy - we did not experience that. And yes the lighting is subdued in the room but we just opened up the shades & it was plenty bright enough.Hotel is very very clean - staff are all friendly & nothing is too much trouble. They arranged return shuttle booking to Ala Moana Shopping Centre for us & also arranged a hire car for 1 day & were generally very helpful in advice. When our Airport transfer was late on departure day - they rang the company on our behalf twice to chase them up.We took advantage of the beach towels & beach mats most days. Breakfast was only taken on 1 day - juice & muffin + scone....just enough to tide over until lunch. Wi Fi speed was excellent!!We had everything we needed at this hotel & for a first time visitor to Honolulu we did not feel envious at all of any of the other hotels along the ""strip"" - we would definitely stay here again if we return to Honolulu again.","Sydney, Australia",74,5.0

Well, let me state this, i was here last week, i stayed for 5 days. First off, the staff, amazing, extremely helpful, very welcoming, and friendly the the 5th degree. Second, amenities, you get a bed, you get a bathroom, you get a giant balcony (depending on the floor and side, you could get a great view of the ocean, as we did, you get a personal mini fridge, a coffee maker (with a complementary coffee starter pack), a well sized closet, a safe large enough for a few laptops, a comfortable chase lounge chair, color lcd tv with both free games and free movies from the lobby machine (think redbox but free), and most of all, you get to feel better about yourself knowing that just steps away from your building, at some of the other hotels, people have paid, double/triple/and beyond for rooms that server the same exact purpose. And that purpose? Well, lets see, your in hawaii, do you really want to talk about the inside of a hotel room? I sure don't, I didn't go to hawaii to stay in a hotel room, i went to experience the beaches, the restaurants, the snorkeling, the hikes, the attractions, etc, and I rented a hotel room to sleep in at night while I rested for my next adventure. So yes, these rooms aren't as giant as the hilton or Marriot, this hotel doesn't have its own pool (but with our 15 dollar a day amenity charge all we had to do was walk over to the Marriot and we had full access of their pools/towels/gym/hot tubs), but by spending a lot less money, and still getting an very comfortable room with impeccable staff service, i was not only able to enjoy my vacation more by having more funds for other activities but I was also able to relax more knowing that I didn't get ripped off in one of the most expensive tourist destinations on the planet. Would I come here again? In a heart beat. Would I recommend this place to my friends? Absolutely. Why only 4 stars then you might ask? Well the one thing I would have enjoyed, a bit more diversity in the FREE breakfast (muffins, fruits, breakfast baked goods).","Los Angeles, California",17,4.0

The best things about the hotel was the location and service. The hotel is only a few blocks from the beach and is closer to the Honolulu Zoo side of the Waikiki Strip. The service was friendly and attentive and the Happy Hour was fun. The biggest disappointment was the room. I paid for an ocean view and I could see the ocean several blocks away through several buildings. The room was very dark and depressing. I would dread going back to the room because of the ambience. I felt like was in a Hawaii jail cell but with a nice window to see the ocean.

But we stopped at the hotel first in hopes that they would have a room available early. They didn't. But we were able to drop our luggage off and get the check in process nearly finished. The staff were friendly, and we were offered juice and a towel immediately. The process was fairly quick and we were sent off on our way with the promise that we would receive a call as soon as our room was ready. We received a call around 2 (an hour prior to normal check in). From that point forward, the stay went downhill quickly. The first room we were given smelled like it had been locked up for months! The room was so dark and dingy. It looked as if the room hadn't been dusted in quite some time. We called the front desk and were given a new room. The second room had a better view, but that was the only positive about the room. This room also smelled, was dark and dingy, and had not been dusted. We decided that another move would likely be useless. So we tried to settle in. Until we went to sit down on the bed and noticed a hair near the pillow. Then pulled back the covers to find two more hairs on the bed! We called down to the front desk and were told housekeeping would be sent to the room immediately. 20 minutes later we were greeted by two maintenance men who were there to change the sheets. Much to our disgust the men clutching the sheets in their hands smelled worse than the room. Not very comforting to watch these two toss sheets across the room and throw pillows to the floor- I can't imagine what the process is when there aren't guests there to watch them. There were stains throughout the room- on the walls, on the lampshades, on the window covers, on the door frames. Upon walking in the bathroom, we noticed mold on the sink and around the bathtub. The sink handle could not be touched without the entire faucet moving. The toilet made noise when the toilets in the above rooms were flushed. The A/C rattled the ENTIRE night. The next morning, we went to check out as we had found a new hotel for the remainder of our stay. As we spoke with the manager, we were not greeted by any surprise- based on her reaction, I'd gather this happens fairly often. We also were not offered any apology. When we requested a refund of our money (as we were instructed by our third party seller) she outright refused. We then had to request a letter notifying said third party seller that we had to check out early because of the hotel condition, which she seemed frustrated by. She then wasted over 20 minutes typing up the two line letter. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS HOTEL! Motel 6 is just as nice and is much cheaper!!","Saint Louis, Missouri",14,1.0

Rooms were virtually sound proof with doors closed, we could go out on the balcony at night to take in the warm sea air and listen to the music coming from the Hula Grill next door. Breakfast was ample - juice, coffee, pastries, muffins, fresh fruit - it was enough to keep us going until lunch time. Was nice to be in a smaller hotel with less visitors and no children to be seen during our stay.

Well, I returned this October (2013) to find that the Hotel was now run by Aston, something that was noticeable, unfortunately, in a negative way. While the staff and the level of customer service were still as great as I remembered them to be, what irked me was the new daily $15.00 resort fee, which really served an ugly reminder that the hotel was now part of a big-business, money-making endeavour. Back in 2011, I felt like Renew was a shining gem, a wonderfully kept secret, and that I, as a client, was among the privileged guests staying at what was then the 2nd ranked hotel in Honolulu on Tripadvisor. Fast-forward to 2013, and it doesn't surprise me that Renew's ranking has gone down. Back in 2011, it was the little things that Renew did so well that impressed me so much. But today those little things are overshadowed by the $15.00 resort fee and by the ""by Aston"" addition to the Hotel Renew signature. The hotel somehow became less special, more like every other hotel on the block, and, as a matter of course, the property lost its magic.

Our visit to Hotel Renew lived up to the reviews and we had a great time. Yes, the hotel is not ocean front and does not have a pool. The city view rooms look out onto a hostel where people sit on the balcony a lot so if a view is important then you should get a ocean view room. The view from our room was incredible. The room was very retro modern and beautiful. All the lighting, bedding, fixtures and furniture was updated and very modern. The room was on the small side, but we knew that going in. However, there is a large closet and bench for suitcases. The lobby is beautiful and relaxing. I never heard any noise from any other room and the hotel was full that weekend, so the rooms must be very sound proof. The location was perfect for us, it is on the quiet side of Wakikki, but close to everything. The hotel gives complimentary beach chairs and boggie boards which was a great perk. Also, we really enjoyed the breakfast of pastries, croissants, bagels, fruit and ham/cheese rollups. No, it's not a hot breakfast, but we knew that going in. My kids are still talking about the croissants at the hotel. But what set the hotel apart for us was the service we received. The bellhop was probably the most helpful person we have encountered in 20 years of traveling. He was so responsive, friendly and knowledgeable. Every staff member was very nice and went out of their way. Our air conditioner broke on the first night and the maintenance was in our room four minutes after we called. They actually replaced our entire until while we were at dinner. Note that they use an air freshener in the air condition units that gives off a strong smell and was bothering my asthma. When I mentioned this, they removed the scent and recleaned the room. If you have having breathing issues, ask them to take the air freshener out.

There were many towels. Water pressure was ok but not great.The hotel has a free breakfast every morning in the lobby. Get there early because seating is very limited. Breakfast items included pineapple juice, coffee, tea, various fruit pastries, fresh cut fruit, blueberry and plain muffins and mini croissants, as well as butter and cream cheese.One of the days we were there the hotel had a managers reception in the evening where they gave the adult guests a complimentary alcoholic cocktail, in my case a pineapple coconut mojito that tasted great! They also gave us a bowl of assorted salted nuts. They even made my son a nonalcoholic version of the mojito that he enjoyed.The hotel provides beach towels and chairs at the front desk.I forgot to mention that upon arrival we were given cold glasses of pineapple juice and cold towels.

From the moment we arrived to the second we left the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The location is perfect and the rooms, whilst noted in multiple other reviews are not large enough to swing anything bigger than say a medium sized cat around - and this may bother some, I wouldn't concern yourself over it. The beds are huge and the room has everything you need - shower/bath. Big screen LCD TV, fridge and free in-room wifi that was for the most part fast and reliable. Safe in the room was free to use and this was a welcome touch.The complimentary breakfast was a great way to start the day and although it doesn't vary wildly it means you can rely on it if you are a fussy eater like I am!Valet parking was available, which we didn't use as parking was free on Kalakaua Avenue, Monsarrat Avenue and Paki Avenue (towards the zoo/park) between 6pm and 10am. Its popular though so expect to have to drive around a bit looking for a space. Watch for the red kerbs though - those are lifeguard spots and had more strict restrictions applied.If you couldn't blag a space there there is a multi storey attached to the other Aston just the next block up from the beach on Paoakalani Avenue (same as hotel) $17 is still cheaper than the hotel if you are tight like me!Seen previous reviews suggesting cars, especially convertibles would get broken in to. We didn't have any issues in the 5 days we had the car - a 2013 Mustang from Dollar (also recommended)Only negatives that I would mention would be the air conditioning in the room (whilst cold, it makes enough noise to wake the dead - but you get used to it) and the street noise early in the morning. We were on the 5th floor and it was audible with window shut - higher up may get on better)Wouldn't let either of the above put you off, Hawaii is a lovely, relaxed place and the hotel is well placed to enjoy all of Waikiki and the rest of the island!

We were presented with a bottle of champagne on our first night and were quite surprised. The hotel is small and very charming and our room was clean, modern, comfortable and adequately sized. The decor and ambience of the hotel were modern and very nice. Breakfast consisted of fresh fruit salad (pineapples, melon, grapes, strawberries, etc) and pastry (croissants, muffins, etc) and very tasty pineapple juice. This got us started on the right foot each day. The hotel's location was perfect. There is no need to hire a car. The hotel is within an extremely short walking distance from the beach (2 mins), shops, restaurants, zoo and transportation to the mall. The stop for the pink line/trolley to the mall is just outside of the hotel. The fare is $2 per person ($4 per person round trip) and it is approximately a 15 min ride to the mall. The staff was extremely friendly, courteous and accommodating. On the night of my birthday, there was a platter of crackers and cheese in our room for me along with a birthday card. On the next night, the night of our anniversay, there was a bottle of champagne, with ice and glasses along with another card awaiting use in our room. We really appreciated the personalized touch.

Near the zoo and Diamond Head crater. The rooms were small, but clean and modern with very comfortable bedding (though only double beds -- small when you have 4 people in the room). I found the rooms a bit dark. I prefer brighter lighting. You could control all the lighting from a bedside console, which was nice. I've never seen that anywhere else. Nice TV. No self parking -- only valet parking. The traffic in the area is crazy -- lots of congestion and one way streets. If I return, I will take a cab to my hotel and walk to get around, taking a cab or a tour if I need to go further away. I didn't used my car in the two days I was there except to drive up to Diamond Head at the 6 am park opening to see the sun rise from the top.

I found the breakfast satisfying & nutritious enough to hold me till lunch. I always enjoyed the friendly staff & family atmosphere of the breakfast gatherings while meeting other fellow travelers. Room;Our room had very nice decor & was absolutely clean, with pleasant fresh linens. We enjoyed a partial view of the ocean with below views of a neighboring hotel. Our room was 2 floors above that hotel's pool area. At first I was a bit worried about its proximity to our room, but it was a mute point. We could also see & hear all the happenings along that stretch of Waikiki. All of Waikiki comes alive at night, but the hullabaloo from the hotel below & beach was never a problem during our 3 days.Beach Location;Another nice thing, you can lay out on the beach just steps away from our hotel and enjoy a white sandy beach under a few palm trees.That part of Waikiki, in front of our hotel, is one of the larger sand areas compared to other frontage spots. Unfortunately each time I return to Waikiki (and this is not the hotel’s fault) I’m so very sad to see the sandy beach of all Wakiki is disappearing into the sea, its getting smaller & smaller.

I travel for work and spend too much time in business hotels and so was looking for something different for vacation. Hotel Renew met that need. It is a boutique hotel, and was exactly as other reviewers had reported. The reception folks provided a courteous and professional service that impressed me. It was appropriate for the type of hotel and for anyone who wants/expects a smarter travel experience. Our room on the 7th floor was decorated in a modern European style with an excellent ocean view. The king size bed was a comfortable, medium-firm with sheets and a duvet. Internet access was a little different as each room has its own wireless router. The resulting connection speed was excellent. Unusually, there was no coffee maker in the room. This was not a big problem as the lady that runs breakfast makes great coffee. The location of the hotel is good, 1 block from the beach. There is another benefit. The buses for luaus and Pearl Harbor tours, which the front desk staff can help with bookings, leave from the hotel next door.

We arrived very early and thought we would have to wait for our check in time but they had accommodated us with an early checkin which was fantastic. Our room was lovely, clean, perfect for the 3 of us. The bathroom was lovely and with 3 adult girls sharing 1 bathroom it was more than adequate for us. The positioning of the hotel on Waikiki was fantastic. It was down the quieter end which suited us. It was a simple walk to absolutely everything shops, restaurants, pink trolley etc. I had read a number of comments about the breakfast not being great however we found the breakfast to be more than adequate. Fresh fruit salad, pastries, croissants, juice thats all we needed and there was plenty of it.Thank you Hotel Renew for making our stay so enjoyable.

Sadly though thats about as much a compliment as I can pay. I just dont see what the fuss is about and neither did the missus. The hotel is nice but nothing fancy, once you get past the nice touches in the lobby, it becomes no better than your average UK 3 star affair. Again, it was nothing bad - just nothing to get excited about. Some hotels make you want to get back and relax, others, like the Renew - you're just not too fussed. Breakfast was a bit of a pointless affair as well, just a few snacks and some various fresh juices. Its well located, at the far end of Waikiki and a reasonable walk to get to anything you want.

The hotel was situated right in the heart of Waikiki, next to the beach, great shopping and restaurants.We would strongly recommend this hotel to anybody, but try to get a room high up so you get a view and get out of the noise. The only complaint we would have (not shared to staff at the time of stay) was the loud AC in our room (301) and the sounds from trucks reversing across the street early in the morning. We did get to borrow a room the same day we were leaving to freshen up, as we departed late. A great service, and we noted the AC in this room seemed to be less noisy, so we might just have been unlucky with ours.  Slightly ""irritated"" of other reviews rating this hotel down for not having a swimming pool, training facility or a restaurant. This is a given up front, so unfair to rate it down for something you already know is not there, or at least should have known. The good news is that they are working on getting this available soon.

The positives are the staff, everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful, the room was of a good size and the bathroom was nice but again neither were anything too exciting. The negatives of the property were the location and noise...we usually pick hotels slightly out of the way to be out of the noise of the main strip but not only was the Renew at the far end of Waikiki but it was really noisy, the room itself had the loudest air conditioner I have ever encountered and the street noise was really annoying. Also, the term ""city view"" should be considered very loosely as our ""view"" consisted of looking directly into the hotel across the road which isn't a major issue but when something is advertised as city view it would be reasonable to expect a view of the city?!?!This was our first time in Hawaii so I don't have anything in the area to compare it to, but considering the Renew has no pool or other resort facilities (we which knew and considered before we booked) and was no cheaper than many of the other properties in the area we won't be in a rush to stay here again.","Canberra, Australia",41,3.0

I'd read reviews on this site about the venue and I'm happy to report this location was wonderful. Ab. a 50 yd walk down the block to the beach (the hotel provides towels, boogie boards, beach chairs). It is away from the super noisy mid-section of Waikiki, so closer to the zoo. The local buses drive down the street every few minutes, but I did not hear them in our room (we stayed on the 9th floor). Also, took a tour one day to Pearl Harbor and our bus picked us up a few yards away, closer to the Aston Waikiki (next door). No restaurant or pool onsite, which makes it a bit quieter I believe (less little kids shrieking by). I loved the calm ambience of the lobby and small bar area. They provide a free continental breakfast each morning of fruit, coffee, teas and juice, plus assorted muffins and pastries (no bagels, or any protein so if you need more substantial fare, go to a restaurant). No coffee maker in the room, but they have one in the lobby which also makes cocoa and tea. There was a ""cooler"" as they call it in our room, but it really is a mini-fridge, just has the smallest of freezer sections. Bed super comfy, assorted types of pillows, one chair at the desk, no table to ""dine"" just the desk. Bathroom very clean and modern. A/C was in the room and we used it the first night. However it was too cold, the air blew on me also. We then slept with just the sheets at night without the a/c on and did fine with that. We turned on the a/c for a few minutes when we got back from dinner and then shut it off before going to bed. Worked for us. Hotel staff was very helpful with renting a car for the day (Enterprise, a walkable three blocks away plus a discount thru the hotel). I heard from the other guests that the Renew charged $25.00 a day to park their car, which is in line with other hotels in a serious tourist zone. One note: all of the employees at the hotel appeared to be under 35 yrs old (?) but were very professional. I wish one of them had told me about the beach area south of the ""pier"" out front. It was full of lava rocks and I cut my foot up. No signs posted on the beach to warn you, but afterward I noticed regulars going into the surf with fins or river raft shoes. When I mentioned this to the front desk person, she gave me plenty of band aids and told me where to go that had soft sand. The ABC store, Starbucks, fast food places all nearby, easy to stroll to center of everything. The Aston Waikiki in front of Hotel Renew has a nice bar, great food in the restaurant overlooking the beach for a lovely sunset view (bring money) I enjoyed the Hotel Renew as it was a nice place to recharge and regroup from the din of Waikiki.

We had all the amenities we needed in our room and everything was refreshed and cleaned daily, providing us with extra soap/ towels/ etc regularly. The hotel was very clean and looked pretty new.What seems to be really rare in Waikiki is to find a hotel room that doesn't charge extra for Wifi, and Hotel Renew does not!

They also let you borrow beach towels, mats, chairs, and boogie boards for no extra charge! How convenient! :)One night, we got home from a luau to discover that we had forgotten our picture (that we had just bought) on the bus. We mentioned this on the way to our room, and the front desk called the transportation company several times to get the picture returned to us. Another day, we got home late from SCUBA diving and missed a shuttle, and they offered to call a cab to get us to our offsite location later that night. When we were preparing to leave, we realized we needed to print out a ticket for Speedi Shuttle, and the front simply received an email from us and printed it out! We asked them a ton of questions throughout our stay, and they were so friendly and helpful, I cannot say enough about the pleasant and helpful staff!!!

We chose this hotel based on location and most importantly price.The hotel is a smaller hotel, no pool, no big bars or restaurants, no tourist desks, shops etc. Rather it's just a small reception, small bar that doubles as a breakfast room and perhaps 8-10 levels of rooms. It's about 125m (450ft) from the beach in a decent part of the strip. It is however a good walk to the key shopping areas and the glitzier part of town.The Good: Clean rooms of a fair size. Decent bathrooms, modern décor - all feels new and fresh. Staff are great. Close to beach. Free wifi. A lot to like.The Bad: Noisy. Very noisy. We stayed on the 4th floor and were woken a number of times by people talking in the hallways, people talking on the street and in surrounding car parks. Truck beepers and bins being emptied in the early morning was another treat. The worst of all was the air-conditioning. It's all or nothing with it roaring like a 747 engine all night. You can't adjust the fan speed either. Combine this with it blowing on the unlucky person to be sleeping on that side of the bed. We ended up just turning it off and dealing with a sticky night. I hate whining about things that seem trivial, but this really did impact sleep quality and the overall experience. So much so that I would say don't stay here unless you are on a high floor and are a really deep sleeper.It's a quality hotel with great staff and clean rooms.. but the noise ruined it.","Perth, Australia",59,3.0

We stayed at the Hotel Renew and it was a good hotel and location for the price. Not too fancy but in all it was good. They lend you beach chairs and towels. The continental breakfast was good. The only thing I did not like was all the homeless people sleeping on sidewalks but they do not bother you. Look around for restaurants that have cheap meals, you will find it. Rent a car, it's a must but the parking will cost you a lot of money. There is a garage for $15.00 and another for $7.00 but that one is always full. The valet in the hotels are $25.00 a day. Free parking by the zoo but you do have to walk a little. Make sure to have sandals or sneakers because you will be doing a lot of walking. Bring comfortable clothing, like shorts and tanks. Everyone is dressed down. The happy hour drinks are all watered down at all the restaurants. It's best to spend a few more dollars to get a great drink. Most people shared their food and that's what bwe did to save money. Don't do any Luau's, not worth the money. They do Luau's on the beach for way cheaper and it's the same thing. Keep in mind the time change when traveling. You don't need to buy tickets to see Pearl Harbor if you are not going inside the ships. You can see and take pictures for free. The pier in Waikiki is very dangerous, lots of rocks and some people have died or broken bones when diving or jumping in. This vacation was the best avaction I have ever bneen on.",,5,4.0

We asked them many questions / requests for bookings and they were only too happy to help, and extremely friendly2) Free wifi - not many hotels offer this, and so it was such a benefit for us to be able to look up tours / hotels and book our transportation.3) Great location - The beach is almost just across the road; its got all the benefits of being close to the beach without the price tag. All the tours / outlet buses etc depart from right outside the hotel (as it is next to the Aston Waikiki), so it makes it perfect for heading out to see something. Its also a very short walk to the main strip of shops / restaurants. There's an ABC store on every corner but one right next door is actually really helpful.4) Free beach gear - towels, chairs and beach mats5) clean!We stayed in a city view double room with 2 x double beds and it was perfect for what we used the hotel for; sleeping and resting in between shopping. the view wasn't great but i wouldn't want to stay cooped up in the room looking at the view anyway - we were out enjoying it.A couple of tips:1) ask the hotel to organise your trip to the premium outlets. They'll arrange for you to go with a company that only charges $10 return trip (with departure around 10am, and return times of 2, 3, 4, and 5pm). This is much cheaper than the $25 trolley that you can take as an alternative that are advertised at those booths.2) Go and eat at the Cheesecake factory. It's AMAZING. I would recommend if you're going, plan to arrive there 1 hour before you want to actually eat, as there WILL be a queue. Get the buzzer and then go and do some shopping during your wait. 3) Macy's has a 10% off international visitors card. You just need to ask them. 4) Go to hanuama bay. Its stunning. we ran out of time to experience it in full but wish we had.","Melbourne, Australia",20,5.0

No pool in the hotel but why would you need one with the beach on your doorstep.The staff were always very pleasant and courteous and always helpful. This gave the hotel a warm friendly atmosphere. Room was spacious, comfortable and cleaned daily. Noisy in the early mornings with the traffic, bin lorries and early risers. We were on the 5th floor at the rear of the hotel so that may have been the reason we heard it as there was a mopeds hire shop just beneath our window. But we were in Hawaii so the early start was not a problem. Wifi was free. Breakfast was a selection of pastries, tea/coffee and pineapple juice. Going to the beach we were provided with towels, bodyboards and there were chairs if you needed them all free of charge. Hawaii is a paradise and we really enjoyed our 8 night stay and our base at the Renew. The Aston had a nice restaurant and bar right next door and we only found LuLus (on the opposite side of the Aston) on our last night where we also had a lovely meal.

My reasons remain the same: style, service, and location.STYLEThe Hotel Renew was formerly a part of the adjacent Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel. It was totally remodeled in 2007 under the auspices of Malaysian-raised, San Francisco-based designer Jiun Ho, creating a Zen-like designer boutique hotel light years away from tiki torch Hawaiian kitsch, incorporating organic elements such as water, earth and fire into a total design concept that could easily hold its own in any urban city.During my first stay, I noticed the attention to detail and the cohesive bespoke nature of the hotel's furnishings and features, from the lobby and lounge area to the elevators, hallways and guestrooms. In my room, I noticed repeating patterns and colours in the headboard, shoji screen window coverings, towels, pillowcases, wool throw, robes, ice bucket, wastebasket, laundry basket and tissue holder. Some things apparently did not withstand the test of time and wear, since for this stay the towels, pillowcases, robes and ice bucket were of a more generic nature.I had specifically booked a City View One Double room because I knew this room type (the 01 rooms) has a balcony from which one can catch a view of the ocean, although it mostly faces the Marriott hotel across Paoakalani Ave. These rooms are the smallest in the hotel but do not lack any features, they just have a smaller bed. Room features include a desk with a unique lamp, another light fixture that is like a backlit piece of wall-mounted sculpture, and a mini-fridge. All bathrooms have a raised sink with limited counter space, but there are shelves next to the sink. My shower/tub had one of those curved curtain rods that allow you more shoulder room, plus one of those shower curtains with a clear top panel to allow in more light. My previous room's shower had sliding glass doors.Note that each floor (2-9) has 9 rooms each for a total of 72 rooms, no suites. Only 4 rooms on each of the top 4 to 5 floors have ocean views, since the Aston's pool area and garage block lower floor sea views. The sea view is limited on 2 sided by the taller Aston and Marriott hotels. I suppose some City View rooms have views of the mountains in the distance, but you mostly see other taller buildings. Directly across Lemon Ave. (really just an alley) are 2 rather gritty hostels and and ABC store. Paoakalani Ave. is a noisy street used by many tour buses, trolleys and shuttles, but the white noise from the room's A/C helped greatly in blocking out the traffic.SERVICEIn such a small hotel with limited amenities, personal and friendly service is achievable, expected and welcome, and it remains a strength for the Renew. As usual, I was welcomed with a glass of pineapple juice and a cold towel (with the wavy pattern all the towels used to have). By the way, I think it's nice to have an enclosed air conditioned lobby rather that the typical open-air lobbies in most other Waikiki hotels. The room was not ready, but was contacted by cell phone when it was. Staff are very helpful with directions and recommendations. Lots of beach equipment is available for use as well. The continental breakfast service has changed a bit since my last visit, although the staff was friendlier than last time, when people were chastised for trying to get breakfast before the official 7am opening. I recently took a look at photos from my last stay, when breakfast included: yogurt, sliced fresh fruit, cereals, croissants, danish and muffins (served from a tray on the bookshelves) , coffee, tea, juice, and a variety of milks. There was also a side table with a toaster and a selection of breads. For this stay, there was an increased variety of croissants, danish, muffins, scones and bagelettes (some with savory toppings like egg or cheese), and there was coffee, tea, juice, soy milk, half & half. No more yogurt, fruit, cereal or toast. The toaster table now holds one of those fancy machines that dispenses espresso, cafe au lait, tea, hot chocolate, etc. And another table has an urn of infused ice water at all times. Additional tables were set up during breakfast, since there are only 4 permanent tables.Regarding parking, valet parking is $25 per night. The valet stand is not always manned; you have to go inside to get help sometimes. I was fabulously fortunate to find street parking every night of my stay, directly across the street on Paoakalani for 2 nights, both times near the gentleman whose home is on the sidewalk outside the Marriott--he can be seen in photos from 4/13 posted by another TA reviewer. Street parking in the immediate vicinity is metered until 6 or 7 pm, but parking is free, if you can find it, on streets north of Kuhio and on Ala Wai Blvd. Be careful about street sweeping times on Ala Wai; I saw many cars being towed on one fateful day. Overnight parking can be had for $15 at the Waikiki Banyan garage on the corner of Paoakalani and Kuhio--this has been mentioned numerous times in TA forums.LOCATIONThe hotel is located on the eastern fringe of Waikiki. Parking is easier to find here.This area is slightly less congested with tourists, and there are more locals on the beach here (as well as homeless), which is wider than in central Waikiki. Plus, there are no hotels on the beach side of the main street (Kalakaua) here. Kuhio Beach is very calm because there are sea walls breaking the incoming waves, great for keiki. Adjacent Queen's Beach, without a sea wall, is favoured by locals for body/short board surfing. The 2 are separated by a wall called the Kapahulu Groin, from which it is exciting to watch youth hurl themselves with reckless abandon into the turbulent sea. And the sea was turbulent during this visit, as unusually large swells along south-facing beaches such as Waikiki brought out pretty big crowds.There are innumerable dining options all along Kalakaua and Kuhio. Our favourites for this trip were Eggs 'n Things Eggspress at the Waikiki Circle Hotel (the place is tiny and wildly popular, especially with Japanese tourists--get it to go) and Rainbow Drive-In off of Kapahulu.We also were greatly impressed by Alan Wong's (need a car or taxi) and Alan Wong's Pineapple Room in Macy's at the Ala Moana Mall.The Renew remains my hotel of choice in this part of Waikiki, despite a little wear and tear. For a splurge stay, I would choose the Halekulani, but the Renew is a great, more budget-friendly option.",Los Angeles CA,1201,4.0

The location, close to Diamond Head, is on a quieter and less crowded side of the Waikiki strip which was GREAT. But, of course, we were still close to all the great restaurants and shops the area offers. THE ROOM! Oh my god. Top floor, ocean view window and a balcony with bistro table and chairs that looked at Diamond Head crater. It was breathtaking! My fiance and I used the balcony as an extension of the room most days. We made full use of the mini fridge, stocking it with great local beers and snacks. The king sized bed was super comfortable and the bathroom had more storage space than we even needed.We used the hotel's valet service for our car and absolutely loved Adam. I looked forward to his sweet smile and greeting as we'd request our car or pull up for the night. I mention Adam, but all of the valets were fabulous. As far as hotel staff goes, EVERYONE was so friendly and accommodating—from each person manning the front desk to our room attendant, Tina. I could go on and on, but nobody wants to read all of that. Here are my final thoughts: If traffic, big crowds, drunk beach-goers, and throngs of people attempting to be upscale are your thing then please don't stay here. Keep this gem for the folks who like peace and quiet, personalized service, and a relaxing unpretentious experience. Got a ton of kids and really wanna see one of those fake luaus? Then, the big high-rise resorts are more your speed.","Chicago, Illinois",9,5.0

Of course, the location is outstanding, close to the beach, off the main strip, closer to Diamondhead and nice parks, at the quieter end of Waikiki. Waikiki is not tranquil, however, so anyone sensitive to urban noise should maybe not stay in Waikiki. The energetic and positive staff clearly work hard to make this a comfortable hotel. The housekeeping staff did a great job of cleaning my room promptly every morning so I didn't have to return to a messy room in the afternoon. Do know in advance that the ""breakfast"" is a continental breakfast with a small assortment of croissants and sweet rolls, along with juice, tea or coffee. It is a smaller, more personal hotel than most in Waikiki. I requested an upper floor room by email in advance of my trip and was given one on the 9th floor, which was great.

The Hotel Renew is NOT that. This hotel is different - its a small-mid-size hotel that feels cool and modern but still an inviting place to come back to after a day of doing what you do. In one of the world's more touristy locations, that's really refreshing.The hotel's layout and design don't follow the standard cookie cutter formulaic approach that the American chains take. The rooms, the lobby, the lounge/bfast room all have a modern and unique feel and the staff are friendly and helpful and pleasantly devoid of the parroty platitudes you get from the lodging factories. My room was kept in great shape by Tina and the valets did a great job handling my parking needs.There is a decent little continental breakfast in the lounge included in the price to get the day started. In the evening, it becomes a cool little bar that's decently stocked and with great value cocktails. Behind the bar was Kasi, one of the best tenders around - great drinks, attentive, friendly, and cool conversation. Kasi is one of the touches that makes Renew unique and a cool place to stay.To be clear, this is not a beach resort so if you're looking to have all of your entertainment, food, shopping, etc provided by the same people that provide your room, this may not be your place. But you dont need that on Oaho. Stay at Renew and with the extra few hundred per night saved over a resort, take a helicopter tour, rent a car and drive up to the north shore, watch or do some surfing, get some hot'n'spicy shrimp from Giovanni's truck and a shave ice from Matsumotos or Aokis, climb Diamond head, hike some incredible trails...then come back and hit Waikiki beach and Renew will provide you with some of the basic beach goodies like chairs, matts, and such and they are located a really short walk to the beach.The beds are comfortable, the pillows perfect, toiletries nice, lighting cool, TV good. And the wifi is complimentary and fast. The only shortcoming worth mentioning (maybe) is the view from the city side rooms which is less than appealing. This is nowhere near a deal breaker for me but I know some people who weight a view very heavily - you'd probably want to pay the extra for a room on the beach side if that sounds like you. All that said, what it boils down to is that I will stay at Renew again the next time I'm on Oahu.",,13,5.0

We booked a city view double room so we weren't expecting much as the room was concerned. We also knew that this was a boutique hotel and did not have all the stuff a resort hotel would have. First stop was picking up our rental car at enterprise which was fast and off to our hotel we go, which was about 25 minutes from the airport. We pulled up out front and I ran in and checked in. It was before normal check in time and was still able to check in which was nice. Was also given drinks and cool towels. Now, I hate the reviews about the valet cost of 25 dollars. That is standard price in Waikiki!! Know this before u go. So, after a quick drive around a few blocks, i see plenty of street parking up the block by the zoo. I'd say about 4 blocks from the hotel. We parked there all week long and saved Around 200 dollars just on valet parking. I didn't mind walking a few blocks, some days it was only 2 block walk. I suggest if u stay here park by the zoo and save!! There were no issues with break ins or parking tickets. Ok, onto the room. We walk into the room and to my surprise they gave us a balcony room with partial ocean view!! So the trip started off great! Room was very modern looking, unlike other hotels I've stayed at in Hawaii. No bright colors... Was darker with dim lighting and very modern looking. This is what i was looking for. Room was spotless and clean. Bed was very comfortable and bathroom spotless. Water pressure in bathroom was not so great but not major deal. Water was always Hott. Room was cleaned everyday. Oh and free wi fi for each room. This was nice as other hotels charge hotel fee everyday. This hotel does not. Ac in room worked ice cold and was quiet! Also was cold fridge in room which was nice.Breakfast was served every morning, it was muffins and pastries with coffee and orange juice. Was good to put something in stomach before we ran out in morning. I don't know why people complain cause they didn't have to put anything out and it's Free!!Bar was small but atleast they had one. Happy hour was from 530-730 with reall decent prices drinks. Martinis for 6 dollars during happy hour can't beat that. Chairs and towels were given at request without questions asked from front desk. So when you leave for beach grab chairs towels boogie boards or what ever u need and no extra cost or signing for them. Front desk was very very nice and helpful, can't say one thing bad. Sounds great right? Now here are the cons. The ONLY reason this hotel did not get 5 stars all around was because of the location. Yes it is within one block of beach which is ideal. Yet it still in bad location? This is due to 1) The Homeless at this end of Waikiki beach and 2) The noise of the block the hotel is on....I must say I've never seen so many homeless in my life. They are sleeping within view from balcony ( check the photos tab) I posted pictures. Not something u want to see when u step out on the balcony in paradise. Clean up the street I don't understand it. I would think the street is hotel property and they are set up all over. As you walk up Waikiki beach towards the Hilton hawaiin village the homeless decrease on the street. Down toward the zoo they increase drastically. Though only a few bothered us by asking for money. You still do not want to see!! I mean literally every ten feet someone sleeping on floor. Ok now onto the noise, this hotel is on a busy busy street. Tour pickups out front, traffic, loading bay directly across street with constant all day deliveries. I also posted pictures from view of balcony of the traffic. The noise ended around 10-11 pm ish and was ok overnight sleeping. I always slept fine. Some beeping of trucks backing up around 6am but we always up early so not major ordeal. But during day was unbearable. Balcony was unusable. The refrigerators of trucks running overpowered any conversation on balcony. Could not even hear anything but refrigerators at some times. When u shut all the doors in room it silenced it pretty much. We went out all day so wasn't major issue unless u stayed at hotel all day. Check out was easy and at 12 noon. Our flight was late so they have a room to shower and change after beach before u head to airport which was fantastic. Other than that it was a wonderful stay. Id deff atay at this hotel again if it was in a different spot on waikiki. This is really only because of the homeless located in that area. Not something u want to see everywhere in ""paradise"". Notes:Abc store right next door. Pricey but convenient.Hawaiin style scooter rental up block.Teddy bigger burgers up block ""best burger in town and cheap""!!!Zoo up block.Diamond head less then mile a way.Less then block to Waikiki beachRight in the tourist section of waikiki, everything in walking distance.Street parking in area ",,22,5.0

The choice of places to stay on island with pets seems to have dwindled down to just this hotel. I went in with visions of a great boutique hotel and a wonderful experience for all of us. The booking was fairly easy on the phone. When I was told of the room rate, I asked about military rates and they said they were cheaper by about $50. However upon arrival, we learned that our room rate without taxes and fees was $212. On top of taxes, we had to pay valet parking and pet fees. In total over $300 - this is for ONE night.The experience started well. Cold pineapple juice and cool rags were placed in front of us upon check in. The staff was luke warm at best though. Just seemed to be going through the motions, not a hint of pleasantries. Off to the room we go... I was so impressed that they had two dog beds, water bowls and treats for our little fur babies. The room was nicely decorated too. But then the smell hit us! Wow, it was bad and strong. Maybe a cross between BO and urine? We even went to the closest ABC store for air freshener which never even touched whatever odor that was in there...The best part is that we paid $25 for valet parking only to find my car parked in a small alley way by the street. It was right out in the open, had I known that, I would have just street parked for free!We had a horrible night's sleep. I am just amazed that someone has not figured out a better place for their pet friendly rooms! They put us on the second floor right by the elevator. So not only are we getting the horrific street noise but all the traffic noise from our floor. We were up all night trying to convince our dogs that all the noise was okay so they would not bark. For future guests, maybe consider a higher floor AWAY for the elevators. Just makes sense!The walls are paper thin too! We heard the neighboring room's AC turning off and on, chatter and even heard a woman giving out her personal credit card information over the phone. We heard every single number. She may as well have been in the same room! Bring ear plugs if you have any hopes of sleeping...With the amount of money we paid for the room, we expected a decent continental breakfast. Nope, 3 pastry types, coffee, the same pineapple juice as upon checkin. That's it. We found something to eat out.Pros:Pineapple juice and cool towels upon check inBeautiful lobby and entry wayGreat location, a block from the beachCons:Luke warm reception and never any greetings as we came and went from the hotelSmelly roomOld style dirty feel hallways, looks unkeptPaper thin walls$25 valet parking that really was almost street parkingNoisy roomCrappy excuse for breakfastBottom line: While at first the hotel seemed nice and I appreciate them accepting pets - this was the worst hotel stay I have had anywhere. I guess I went in with high expectations given the online reviews and the price. I would say if you have a choice, unlike we did, you are better off staying somewhere else. We will not be back and I would never recommend it to anyone. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because I was able to muster a few pros.","Oahu, Hawaii",5,2.0

I traveled here with my wife in July 2011 for a conference I was attending at another location. The hotel has 9 floors, but only 150 or so guest rooms so it is quite small by Waikiki standards. The rooms are modern with amenities from the last few years. Some of the rooms have glimpses of the water while others are of the city (we stayed in both). As well, I prefer the location of this hotel as it is at the eastern end of Waikiki (quieter) and away from some of the bustle. This is not to say that it is out of the way as it is still a half an hour walk to the farthest end of Waikiki. It is only a 3-4 min. walk to beach (half a block) and next to some of the better evening upstairs pubs (Tikis at the Aston next door). We did not have a car so I cannot comment on parking, but transportation was easy without a car. (we rented a convertible for one day so i could show my wife the rest of the island - pick up and drop off at the hotel a block away). For 150$ a night this was about 50-75$ less than the other 4 stars in Waikiki and well worth it. The lobby lounge is also a cool spot to pull up for a drink after a hard day in paradise! Tip- There is no pool at this hotel, but if you go to theMarriot next door and order a drink at their rooftop pool you can swim for free!","Victoria, BC",112,5.0

Our travel agent put us in the Renew because she said it would be a perfect spot to rejuvenate after the long flights and two weeks of walking about in Australia. When we walked into the lobby, I immediately felt welcome and relaxed. The staff was amazing. They present you with a galss of fresh pineapple juice and a cool, moist lemon scented towel for your face. Check-in was seamless as was the checkout. The owner of Renew, Dan was a class act and I had the pleasure of chatting with him at their Wednesday afternoon guest mixer happy hour in the cute hotel bar. The beautiful and outgoing bartender Jackie made me feel welcome as well and she made me some great drinks. You must try her pineapple mojito! Dan and Jackie also gave me a great tip on a restaurant for that evening. The rooms were not too small as some have written. They were big enough for us. The decor of the hotel is very fen shui and just makes you feel relaxed. I loved the free use of beach towels and beach chairs too. All the trolleys, buses and most tour groups have a stop less than 200 feet from the hotel. Noise was not an issue for us. The beach is only 50 steps or so from the front door.

There was plenty of closet space with a safe in the room to proctect valabules. The staff couldn't have been nicer. We received a cold moist towel and a glass of juice while we checked in. We arrived early so they tagged our luggage and put it in storage untill our room was ready. The next day when I inquired about transportation to Pearl Harbor they called for a shuttle to pick us up. It was only $32.00 round trip for the 2 of us. They offered a complimentary continental breadfast of rolls, coffee, tea, & juice. They allowed me to print my boarding passes off their computer and stored our bags again when we checked out, as our flight didn't leave until late that night. The best part of their service was the use of a room set aside for use to clean up before we had to leave for the airport. This was really nice as we spent our day touring up and down the Waikiki beach area and were in need of a wash and clean clothes before we traveled home.

Very friendly and helpful staff, very nice reasonable complimentary continental breakfast. One big pro for me was a mini-fridge for our use - no mini bar. It's not recommended for perishables, because its not really cold, but they note that fact too. That came in handy for buying water, soda and beer - which is available in the 3 'ABC' convenience stores within a block of the hotel. It's in a decent location depending on where you want to be. It's within a 10 min bus ride to Diamond head or a 45 min bus ride to Pearl Harbor. Any of these buses can be reached 1/2 block away. Tour buses and courtesy vans pick-up and drop-off yards away from the hotel entrance. It's 1/2 block away from the Waikiki beach, but personally speaking not the best part of the beach. It is a nice spot to see a great sunset. The room had free wi-fi and cat5 outlets, but I had to have the front desk confirm that because the internet provider listed they could demand fees aside from the hotel in their login terms, but the staff assured me it was totally free. Free toll-free and local phone service, which was nice to confirm dinner/tour reservations. The room had plenty of outlets, which was handy for us. There was a nice size room safe, wide enough for a laptop. Clean room and comfortable bed. There was light dust on top of picture frames and bathroom upper shelves, but that personally doesn't bother me, because unless you're looking for it you would say it's a very clean room (I guess I watch too much Travel Channel's Hotel Impossible). Now... while I would stay here in a flash because of the above mentioned great things and the value, there were things I personally wasn't wild about. The room was kinda dark. So much indirect lighting with dark furniture and dark stained wall accessories. The only chair in the room to watch TV was not comfortable at all. The bathroom had what I guess is called jalousies window, which is a glass shutter type of window. It let in A LOT of alley noise. We had to close the bathroom door to dampen the noise. The room's A/C I think was linked to our physical presence in the room. The room seemed warm when we get in, but seemed to cool down shortly thereafter. I was also surprised there wasn't a bottle opener since you could store drinks in the room...maybe it was somewhere, but I couldn't find one. All in all we liked this hotel very much and would stay there again. When planning your trip budget, be sure to note that there's a 4.712% sales tax and 9.25% accommodation tax too.","East Syracuse, NY",12,4.0

The rooms were modern and clean. The continental breakfast was typical, but clean. Frankly, I could go on.... The only drawback would be, though we were near the top of the hotel, you could hear the street noise until around midnight or so when things quieted down. With the exception of window replacement, there really isn't much that can be done on this account, and it wasn't so horrible. I managed to rest well. This isn't a resort on the beach, so don't expect that kind of a setting. But it is a lovely little boutique hotel that works hard to meet and exceed all your expectations.

We were welcomed with a glass of fresh-squeezed juice and cool washcloths at check-in, and the staff was wonderful. Extremely helpful and attentive. Lots of beach amenities - chairs, towels, body boards, etc - and a block from the beach make this one a good choice if you want to be right in the middle of everything. The room was a bit on the small side and the lighting wasn't particularly good, even in the bathroom. Actually, the whole property was pretty dark which was a bit strange. But the bed was incredibly comfortable and the bedding was nice and soft. We didn't spend much time in the room anyway so those things didn't matter much in the grand scheme. Breakfast didn't start until 7am which meant we sometimes missed it (we headed out early most days), and it was limited to tea/coffee and pastries so if you want a more substantial breakfast you'll have to go elsewhere. I appreciated the fact that they had hot water and ice water 24/7.We were able to get a fantastic price on this room - look online for promo codes before you book - but even without it would have been a good value given the location and in comparison to other nearby hotels.

The large plasma was great and the beds were comfy with the fluffiest quilts I have ever used, heaven! Air Con was a bit noisy but didn't have any problems sleeping with it on.The bathrooms have been remodelled and made a bit more modern. Good towels/robes/iron/ironing board provided.

The pineapple juice and cool towels on arrival was a nice touch. All workers were friendly and reception were so helpful photocopying things for us for no charge and providing towels, beach chairs and a bottle opener for the wine we took up to our room. The iced lemon water/hot water was a bonus in the lobby too.

Other nights they had happy hour $6 cocktails and cheap beer. One night even after the bar was closed a girl named Kasi stayed behind and made us cocktails/served drinks and bar snacks until well after closing time! She was so friendly and gave us a good overview of the island and interesting facts. She is an asset to the hotel and made us feel very welcome!The free breakfast consisted of coffee, tea, juice and sweet pastries and muffins. It would be 10000x better if they provided a bit of fruit/cereal or yoghurt instead because the pastries etc. were way too sweet and doughy! Can’t complain for a complimentary service though.

The location was really great for our purposes. The room was nicely decorated, comfortable and definitely large enough considering that we were there to be outside enjoying the sunshine. I will agree with other reviewers who mentioned that the room is a little dark as there were times I was digging through clothes looking for a pair of black socks, etc. and found it a little difficult. Definitely wasn't a huge deal, though. I definitely appreciated the complimentary wireless internet, cold lemon infused water, breakfast (the hotel's website clearly states that includes coffee, tea and choice of pastries so I did not have expectations beyond that as some reviewers had) and beach gear.

CONS:- our room was smallest on floor (only one with balcony) and was tiny, and entry way and closet was super dark. Accent lighting was inadequate. - the refrigerator kept our water cold some days, but some days the fridge was hot. - our room was facing the busy street and the big hotel's loading docks were noisy first thing in the morning. This was just our room and didn't bother us too much since the AC provided white noise to block it and we were up early to avoid the crowds at all the tourist sites anyway. All in all, a great hotel! We would recommend it to all, especially if you are looking to stay on mainland time and rise early!","San Jose, California",1,4.0

Our room was pleasing to the eye, but small enough that creativity was required for two of us to be able to open our bags at the same time. The bed was very good, and the staff unfailingly helpful. When we wanted a car for a couple of day’s tourism, the desk set us up with Enterprise, a short walk away, for $51/day. The hotel wants $25 per night for valet parking, but the front desk pointed us to nearby streets where parking is free 24/7.A couple of downsides: Our room came with a balcony affording a bit of ocean view. But the street below is so noisy that we never wanted to use it. For the same reason, we never left our windows open. The furnishings had a modern look, but we wondered if the interior designers had ever actually occupied the room for a night. The bedside shelf was high enough that I cracked my elbow into it more than once. The bathroom sink was not quite deep enough to prevent water from the high faucet from splashing out. There wasn’t an in-room coffee maker, and free morning coffee was not available till 7AM (an issue if you are a couple of hours jet-lagged). The breakfast bread and pastries were bad (the wife says “awful”). We bought granola parfaits at the ABC store next door. (ABC stores are everywhere!) The staff was nice enough to refrigerate them for us so we could pick them up at the front desk first thing in the morning. On the whole, it was a decent place to stay. I might research other options though before a return engagement.",Albuquerque,57,4.0

The rooms are lovely and serviced daily which was nice. The beds are amazing - the pillows not so much.

We loved our location, right across the road from the beach. Everything was in walking distance. We had a rental car to go to the North Shore and the Polynesian center. The valet parking was nice. I didn't have to worry about the car. In our room rate we were given beach mats and beach chairs. The room was set up well. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. This was a great little boutique hotel, if you are looking for big name this is not for you. I loved it! I look for boutique hotels first, now every time I travel thanks to Hotel Renew. I love the little things, like the lobby bathroom was so modern and unique. We had 2 rooms and they accommodated us and gave us rooms across the hall from each other. The only problem we had was air conditioning in one room not working properly at first called the desk and maintenance was sent to the room in under 5 minutes. There was a little wear on the carpets. The humidity is wreaking havoc, but this was true in another hotel we stayed at as well. Because it is a small hotel there is not a view. The big chain hotels block the view.

If you want to get The Bus to Honolulu or Diamond Head there are plenty of lines just a short walk up the road but beware they can be very busy.We booked an ocean view room which was exactly what we got. We could watch the glorious sunset from our room if we were not still on the beach. The room itself was small by US standards but perfectly adequate for two people who were out most of the day. The TV was huge, great to watch the surfing channel on. The bathroom was modern and clean if again a little small. There was a little fridge we could put some drinks in to keep them cool. We slept well.While there is a complimentary breakfast it was all pastries which won't suit some but there are plenty of options within a short walking distance.

Prior to our arrival, it was suggested that we consider switching hotels to be a bit closer to the center of Waikiki. I am so glad we didn't heed that advice! The Renew was perfect in every way: price, size, location and service. The room was spacious and the bed was comfy. Service was friendly and attentive. As for some of the negative comments:-Noise: the street noise was indeed loud. I definitely heard the garbage trucks in the early morning but because of the jetlag coming from NYC, I was already up and didn't mind it. Perhaps, if you are sensitive to noise, you may want to bring ear plugs or consider a different hotel.- Location: I'm not quite sure what people mean by the ""seedy"" area of Waikiki Beach. The hotel may be closer to the Burger King than Bvlgari but it is by no means in a less than desirable location. I for one like being a little more removed from the crowds.- Breakfast: In the US, I never expect breakfast to be included with the daily rate. It was a pleasant surprise that the hotel provided coffee, juice and assorted pastries each morning. Were the pastries delicious? No, but they served a purpose. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Renew. I will take excellent service over a free breakfast any day! ","Brooklyn, New York",54,4.0

Due to the issues listed below the hotel were willing to offer a refund as none of this was as described on the website. I liked the thought of a boutique theme, but in this case boutique hotel translate to quirks which are not in your favour and are generally annoying. As we couldn’t get a refund (we could by the hotel but since it went through hotels.com we couldn’t), we ended up paying for another hotel to simply get some sleep. This was a bit of an expense we had in the contingency fund, but when you add up the total spent, we could have stayed at the Royal Hawaiian and had a great time. Booking this hotel was a mistake. Lets get it out in the open, the hotel is around the medium to lower end of the places in Honolulu and thats quite frankly what we were aiming for, something nice and clean, relatively new just to chill out in and generally spend our time at the beach, have dinner and come back for a sleep. I chose this place over others around this price range because it has been renovated and it plays on the ‘Boutique’ thing. I’d not tried it before so I thought it would give it a shot. I know the area around there pretty well so I wasn’t concerned it would be a dodgy area. Having said that I do wish I had booked something else. The air con unit. Now some people like a hot room. I grew up in a cold climate so if there is a chance for ice hanging off the windows, I am all up for that. Now the air con unit did work (when we got our room switched) but these units were from the 80’s. Despite doing up the hotel, they kept all the original air con units which means they are noisy, a bit like a leaf blower right beside the bed. Now I am a heavy sleeper, but I could sleep through these, even with ear plugs. So for the sake of the compromise, I slept in a hot room. This isn’t the hotels fault, but the 4 surrounding hotels all have a loading bay and all the trash bins right next to the hotel. The Aston Waikiki, the Marriot which are near the beach and the one at the back. Now, this means reversing horns on all the lorries from about 5am. The trash does however get picked up at around 2-3am. This was made even more fun by a bathroom window above the trash area which didn’t close. It was one of those shutter windows. On top of that it didn’t have a blind so the street lamp outside shone in the room all night. And when the sun rose, it made the room nice and sunny. Perfect for wanting to get up at 5am which is exactly what you want to happen on holidays. Now for the fun part. I did go down to reception at 3am on the first night as I had literally just got off a very long flight and wanted a sleep and tried to get moved to another room. The ‘lovely’ lady in reception said ok we can do that but its going to cost you $70 for an upgrade. Now, at this point, I would have sold my granny to get to sleep but out of principal I said no and would come down in the morning, when I could have some breakfast and mull over whether it would be worth trying to get a refund from hotels.com and moving to another place. Which brings me to breakfast. As it said breakfast was included, I got excited. Throw me at a buffet breakfast or a continental and I am happy. I don’t ask for much, just some cereal, a piece of toast and some fruit, and maybe a cheeky Danish. However, when we got to breakfast there was 1 basket, a few cups and some orange juice. So, continental breakfast was......a Danish. And it wasn’t even a Danish. It was a white bun with some apple sauce in the middle. No cereal, no fruit, no bread for toast no nothing. This hotel doesn’t have a pool, which I knew about and that didn’t bother me since I knew we were so close to the beach. So all in all, the hotel did offer me a refund after the first night, it was however not possible to get one through hotels.com, so we made the most of our stay, with earplugs and Mai tais and eventually another hotel. We basically paid close to $1000 to not sleep for 3 days and it didn’t involve any crazy clubs, excessive consumption of any beverages or a wild time. A hotel in a very unfortunate location was to blame. The hotel has been done up very well but a few oversights in the planning mean it is noisier than some of the hostel in the area.

While overall it was fine, it wasn’t a great enough experience that would have me returning. So here are the pros and cons/things to know:Pros – As other have mentioned the pros are the location (close to the beach) and the service - everyone friendly and helpful. Overall room was fine, not big but not small.Cons/Things to know:1.Room – I didn’t find it that modern. Like many hotels in Waikiki this hotel is a renovation of an older building and it still has an old feeling. Yes they have spruced it up but they did not renovate (i.e. gut the old rooms), they spruced it up. Also it was very dark.2.Cleanliness/Bathroom– average. There was dirt on the bathroom walls, the shower had mold. Nothing special. Also as a boutique hotel I would expect more toiletries (it was sparse at best) – like separate shampoo and conditioner (combined shampoo and conditioner is the worse – I know its nitpicky but I don’t pack this stuff as I expect to be able to use the hotel’s stuff).3.Sound – you can hear everything which is a problem for a light sleeper like myself. I had a “city view” and one night people at the apartment behind us were outside partying until 5:00am. When they finally stopped it was time for the garbage trucks to come and start banging around (of note the garbage truck/delivery truck noise is not an issue specific to this hotel…it is endemic in Waikiki. That means unless you have paid for one of the higher priced better view rooms you will get this noise anywhere. Trust me I have stayed enough times to know this). The only thing that drowned anything out was the even noisier air conditioning.4.Breakfast – can’t rate it because every time we came down to grab something before we headed out the small area was chock full of people. Impossible to get at anything so we gave it a pass.5.Smell – musty smell in the room but that is on par for most hotels in Hawaii in the mid-range (I guess it’s called humidity).6.Amenities: No pool and we had no balcony – not necessary but even if my balcony looked onto nothing (which I have experienced in other hotels) it’s nice to just have a small outdoor space when you return to the hotel. But this is a personal preference.Overall it was fine. It’s hard to find a good place in Waikiki without spending a lot of money (see my other review on the Modern Honolulu).",Ottawa,40,3.0

The hotel itself is much more modern then the other hotels in the area. There were some problems though. The shower head in my room was very loose and dropped water all over the place. My room was a ""city view"" on the second floor, looking right into an alley. The noise from trucks emptying the trash started at 7am and went for a few hours. On checkout, the valet had brought my car up but when I walked outside with my 2 bags, he just handed me my keys and continued to text; no help with loading or even carrying them down the stairs. Overall for the price, I suppose it was better than most but little things could improve here and there. And don't book a city view room unless you are on a high floor.

We arrived around 6PM and were welcomed by Daniel and Adam (aka. Fancy Pants). We were given 2 glasses of cold and refreshing Pineapple juice, as well as a couple of cold towels... which we didn't really need as it was drizzling and chilly outside. We were given room 203 and immediately, Daniel asked if we needed to find some places to eat at. He pulled out a map and started circling where we should go based on what we said we liked. Not only that, but we were treated to a couple of drinks at the renew Lounge- which we utilized on our very last day. We had the Hawaii Gold beer... yum! Adam was waiting for us in the room, while already placing our suitcases on the luggage self. What service! Furthermore, he showed us the really great lighting features in the room, how to use the A/C unit andset up the wifi. He was so helpful and an absolute delight! We explored the room which was very clean and the large TV was such a treat. On our last day, we weren't leaving for the airport until PM. They were able to hold our luggage all day and when we were ready to go, Adam brought our heavy baggage out to the shuttle. That is certainly service at it's finest.LOCATION:Hotel Renew is literally a few steps from Waikiki beach. They provide towels, beach chairs, boogie boards, etc... for free! The beach and Kalakaua Ave. are mere steps away. You can walk to the International Marketplace, all of the shopping and restaurants as well. No car required. Furthermore, you're about a $12 cab ride to Diamond Head. In front of the neighboring hotel, you can catch the Waikiki Trolley. We only took the 'Pink' shopping line. It's $2 a ride, but it takes you right to the Nordstrom door of Ala Moana mall. BEDS:They were clean and very comfortable. The duvet covers were divine, especially if you keep the A/C on overnight. BATHROOM:Very clean and up to date. For a place near a beach, we didn't see anything wrong with it. VIEW:Unfortunately, our 2nd floor room faced the hostels and a very loud street. Our first night was really interesting. At about 6am, we could hear trucks unloading most likely for the ABC store next door. We also heard someone screaming pretty early in the am one day, but that's expected with the hostels across the way. We did get used to it and though we would have preferred a more quiet room, it didn't affect our stay. VALUE:For what we paid, this was more than worth it. The price was great and we really have nothing to complain about.STAFF:One word... WOW! We discussed that this is probably the best team we have ever encountered in all of our travels. Every one was so kind and sweet. They always made sure to smile, say ""hello"", help answer our questions and even opened the door for us every single time we were arriving or leaving. Anything we needed and asked for, they were able to deliver- no problem. Colby at the lounge was great and really took the time to get to know us. The same with Adam who we had the privilege of seeing almost every day. Thanks Fancy Pants!Nonetheless, we cannot thank all of you enough for making us comfortable and beyond content our entire stay!SUMMARY:This is a fantastic hotel in Honolulu. This was my second time, and in comparison to where I previously stayed, this wins hands down. We highly recommend that you consider Hotel Renew. It is in a perfect location, has great (high tech) rooms, very clean and above all, a first class family of staff who will take very good care of you. We are all for boutique hotels and this one certainly does not disappoint. We will definitely go back and stay here again!","Calgary, Canada",3,5.0

It was our second time in Waikiki within about an eight day period, and we wanted to stay at a smaller hotel having spent two nights on the front end of our trip at the Moana Surfrider hotel. I am so glad we did this; the boutique hotel experience was a nice contrast to larger hotel experience that we had enjoyed. The staff was amazing at every turn. From check where they had delicious fresh drinks and wet towels for us upon arrival, to the help booking a tour we received, to the delicious drinks at happy hour, I can’t say enough good things about this hotel. The rooms aren't huge, they are cozy but they are very well designed to utilize the space. The decorations were nice and the hotel lobby was great. We arrived early and the hotel let us check in and upgraded us from 2 double beds to a king size bed which was a welcome surprise. We stayed at the hotel on the last day of our trip to Hawaii and our flight home wasn't until late in the evening on our checkout day. They were willing to give us a late checkout but suggested we may benefit more from use of the hotels courtesy room. This is a regular room that guests can “reserve” for an hour the day before after they have checked out, so that they can shower and change. I was delighted when the front desk person told me about this and willing to pay for the service, then they informed me this was a courtesy and there is no charge for the room. What a great amenity, this allowed us to do a tour that morning, go to the beach and swim and not have to fly home covered in sand. Even the bell hops seemed genuinely appreciative when we tipped them for storing our bags for us, and arranging transportation to the airport. The Hotel Renew isn't the biggest hotel, it doesn't necessarily have the best views (though we had a very nice view from our room), nor from the outside will it knock your socks off, but when you stay here you will have a great stay. I know that if I am back in Waikiki I would definitely like to stay here again.",Somervi,3,5.0

Yes, there are tall hotels on each side but, you still have a great view of the activity on the beach,the surfers (surf school and board rentals about 2 blocks away), you can see the glass bottom subs out just a little ways.Our room was spacious,wonderful bed,each person had a soft, fluffy pillow and a firmer one,helps to meet everyones desire.Always had clean towels,they will change the sheets daily if you want,but didn't think that was neccessary,we don't do that at home.The staff was wonderful about getting us shuttles when we needed,and gave good information about things we ask about and sites to see.

I read the reviews on this hotel, and my husband and I decided to give it a try. This hotel was awesome the first time we stayed for our honeymoon, greeting us with freshly squeezed pineapple juice and ice cold towels, and friendly smiles. Waiting for us in our room was a bottle of champagne with chocolate covered strawberries, with a hand written personal note thanking us for our business. The rooms are very modern, comfortable, and the view in almost all the rooms is ocean. There isn't tons of people everywhere because it's a small boutique hotel, and everyone staying there seems to be open and friendly, just like the staff.You can rent for free bogie/surf boards, beach mats/chairs, towels, all for FREE! It's a miracle! Not to mention you're steps away from Waikiki Beach.The second time my husband and I stayed there, it was the same experience, just fabulous!The third time was the same experience, with appetizers sent to our room with a handwritten note, thanking us for our business again. This past time we stayed there we decided to go to happy hour. It has simple but delicious appetizers, and fabulous affordable drinks. Beers are $4 and cocktails are $6, which are fantastic prices for the area. Let me just say that the bartender, Jacqueline, made the BEST margarita I've ever had! This is coming from someone who makes handmade margaritas (I refuse to buy the mixes). It tasted super fresh and it wasn't weak, it had lots of tequila in it!Hotel Renew is a fantastic experience overall. They treat you like a celebrity, and have the ultimate customer service. You don't feel like just another tourist visiting Waikiki, but you feel valued and taken care of. I'll never stay anywhere else!

The main thing is that the rooms are well appointed, clean, and comfortable, with fine toiletries, and it's less than three minutes in your flip-flops to the beach. And really that's all you want in a place like Honolulu. The other bright spot is the staff, which is extremely capable and friendly. Bright, however, is not a word to describe the halls, which are dingy and appear to belong to the mid-20th c. Breakfast is included, but this is limited to coffee and Costco-type pastries, which you consume on stools in a space just off the lobby. For the price, though, this is a very good deal, and a pleasant place to stay.","Lexington, Massachusetts",52,4.0

Too many people on the beach! Too many people, everywhere! However, the beach was nice to see, restaurants plentiful and so many shopping options! Hotel Renew was a great get away from the busy Waikiki streets! Small, but wonderful. Curteous staff, yummy chilled pineapple juice and lemongrass scented washcloths at check in! Our room was big, clean and comfy. Bed was comfy, lighting is fun!!!! And bathroom was refreshing... Shower had a window you could open and look out a city while showering. Nothing extravagant, but still different. I would consider Hotel Renew again, although not sure if I would spend more time in Waikiki....

The lounge is cute and they pour a decent cocktail and the room they let you stay in after you have checked out while waiting for your flight is a godsend. However, despite what you will read here on Tripadvisor it isn't perfect. Noise comes into the rooms very easily, either from other rooms or from the street. Neither the television nor the AC worked entirely properly during my whole stay but as I could ""figure it out"" I never complained. There is also a bit of wear and tear to be found in the form of water damage, cracks in the wall and whatnot. Nothing to make you rethink your stay but definately enough so that you do notice it.

It's rating then was only a 2 Star Hotel, but what made it stand out then, was the excellent Customer Service provided by Head Housekeeper Leonor Wong. Sadly, Leonor left this hotel 2 years ago, but her training of the Front Desk staff is still very much in evidence. Special mention this time to Chris & Adam, who were just super friendly & helpful, but Kudos must go to Jackie, who bent over backwards to make sure we were comfortable in our room, found the best places to eat, went on the right buses to go to the Mall & just generally made any question we had, no trouble to find the answers.The rooms have certainly changed since 2007 with some nice renovations to them, also the front lobby. My husband & I were on a cruise to celebrate our 35th Wedding Anniversary & then stayed 3 nights at the hotel after the cruise. The Management acknowledged our special occasion, by sending a small plate of cheese, meat & crackers to our room.Apart from the great customer service, it's the location of this hotel to Waikiki Beach. It is less than half a block & is quite reasonably priced, I imagine. I have to admit, I liked the prices in 2007 better. And as mentioned by others, the Continental Breakfast is really just juice, danish & sweet rolls. But, a great bonus as before, we were able to have our luggage kept secure for us by the Hotel, while we spent our last day in Honolulu & then were given the use of a room to shower, change & get ready for our late night flight back to Canada.

There are some good restaurants with entertainment and a nice vibe such as Tiki's bar and grill at the Aston Waikiki and Lulu's Waikiki which is in the same block. The food at the Wolfgang puck express below the the Aston was not good and I would avoid it if you can.

Bathroom is ok, but beware your items on the shelf separating the sink and toilet may accidentally fall into the toilet when u reach for it on the sink side - design flaw but i guess it makes the bathroom look bigger. Funny do not disturb card which actually says the room is being made up for the next guest so do not disturb... we didn't know whether to use it as a 'do not disturb' card or not... Got woken up by housekeeping at 845am in the morning, not impressed... Beware the walls are actually quite thin - we could hear every word and 'activity' of our neighbours when we walked pass their room in the corridor... Free wifi was good but had to log in every time.

The room was musty smelling and felt damp. The air condition never worked properly. The rooms and halls was very worn and the carpet was gross. Valet parking was 25.00 a day. We changed hotels after 2 days through Expedia. I'm still not sure how much credit I received because we paid ahead.","Erwin, Tennessee",2,3.0

Clean, modern room, nicely equipped bathroom, comfy bed, free wifi. The front desk was super helpful from the first call I made to reservations until the day I checked out. Breakfast is free: coffee, tea, juice, fresh pastries. I was on California time so I was up a bit early and they happily got me hot water while they were setting up. I only got to the beach once, but they eagerly provided me with towels and a beach mat. They also had boogie boards. Housekeeping was super efficient and friendly, never bothering me when the Do Not Disturb sign was up, which is VERY important on a business trip when I'm trying to catch a nap before evening meetings/functions. If you're looking for a resort-type hotel, this isn't it for you...there's no room service, no restaurant or pool and it is a half a block walk to the beach. But I was glad to trade that for the lovely room, friendly service and NO moldy smell, which is prevalent in even some of the bigger resort hotels. I also love that you can open the window to let in the warm, fragrant Hawaiian breezes. My only con? Paoakalani Street is on the Trolley route, so it gets quite noisy during the day if you're on the street side. Also, there are a couple of hotels on the corner, one that has a very loud karaoke bar, but that closes at 10pm. Although if you're on the street side, you get a view of the ocean. However, that's Waikiki for you, even at the Sheraton on the beach, the noise down at the bar and on the boardwalk floated up to our room, even on the 10th floor.I'd stay here again if I had to come back to Waikiki!","Los Angeles, California",53,4.0

At the counter, I was greeted and welcomed back just like an old friend. A couple of minutes after I walked in my room, a knock on my door...a staff with a bowl of fresh mixed fruits with a personal note welcoming me back. Very nice touch!!. The friendly staff are always very helpful in either asking for directions, recommending restaurants or look up something for you online. The free breakfast is served from 7 to 9:30 and can get crowded fast but you can take your food to your room.My recommendations to first time visitors to this hotel:If you're a light sleeper, ask for a room on a higher floor preferably facing Waikiki Beach since the hostel on Lemon can get noisy sometimes at night.If you like your room real cold, this hotel may not suit you and the A/C will be running non stop.FYI: The hallways on each floor have no A/C vents and can get real warm but I have no problem with that.Don't rent a car if you just plan to stay around Waikiki. Most tour and public buses pick up passengers just a few yards in front of the hotel. If you want to rent, Hotel Renew provides valet parking but has very limited parking spaces and not cheap. If you must rent, rent a car for a day(get it early) and return it late the same day to avoid parking fee. I even know a car rental company that will pick up and drop you off.I can't wait to go back and enjoy Oahu and Hotel Renew again and again.One thing I hate to write a great reviews on Hotel Renew is that my chances of getting a room on specific days get slimmer as more people book when more favorable reviews are posted. :)","Dallas, Texas",14,5.0

They did and then some. For 8 days, my girlfriend and I enjoyed what must be the best little boutique hotel on all the islands. The staff is so accommodating (Grace and Adam are the best!) you would think you are the only guest in the hotel. I inquired into the best golf courses and sushi restaurants and within 10 minutes the wrote out the best spots in town. The rooms are clean, modern, updated, and the bed was probably the most comfortable I've ever slept on. No need to run to Starbucks or Seattle's Best Coffee. The Kona coffee they serve for free downstairs is great, and so is the pineapple juice, and pastries/muffins. What I loved most is how close is it to the beach, and how easy it is to get in and out of the room. I travel a lot for my career and am so tired of the big, huge hotel chains where no body knows you nor cares, and it takes a week getting to your room or getting your rental car.

I want so badly to say I love it and I would be back every time here and all, but truth is, I probably won't. The hotel itself has been recently renovated, but it doesn't quite give the feel of a luxury hotel...i'm not sure if that makes sense, so i guess you would have to experience it to understand. The elevators clank, the air condition rattles and rumbles - not a lushous hotel, water leaked fr the faucet, but it's not bad - just above average. Maybe the professional photos of the hotel gave me false expectations and anticipations...plus, being ranked #5 on tripadvisor too may've made my expectations really high of the hotel itself - for the hotel itself, i would give it a strong 3 stars.The customer service, however, is where this hotel is very strong at - I have never experienced such amazing customer service at a hotel - the staff were all super friendly. It was my boyfriend's birthday and everyone knew it was his birthday and was wishing him a happy birthday which I was amazed about. Valet was super fast and super friendly.

The rooms are clean and modern with a generous bathroom and super comfy bed. We took a 9th floor room to take advantage of the view straight down to the beach which is a two minute walk away.As the other reviews have said the staff are fantastic. We had a wobbly towel rail which we mentioned to reception and it was fixed by the time we were back in half an hour. They also helped out organising shuttles and making recommendations.The wifi is great, fast and free. Take advantage of the included continental breakfast each morning as it's an easy way to get yourself fed before starting the day. It can be a scramble for seats but if you pick the time right it's easier. You can also borrow beach towels, chairs and mats from reception for the beach which is so handy.A few things to have a think about when making your decision. The 9th floor sea view rooms do not have a balcony which I didn't think would be a problem but I did miss it. You can't actually see the view from the bed so basically you have to stand at the window to look out. It would have been really nice to sit out on a little balcony in the morning and evenings before heading out. This single factor would be a sticking point for us when deciding to stay here again (although value for money wise it's still excellent).Also the hotel doesn't offer tea and coffee facilities. Just the like the balcony it's made quite clear in the room amenities but again in practice I missed being able to put a cuppa on! You can pay for a dodgy coffee from a machine in reception but a kettle and some tea bags would be nice. And there is no pool, you don't need it with the beach two minutes away for swimming. But without a balcony or a pool or external bar there was nowhere outside to sit so you were either out and about or tucked away inside the hotel missing out on the atmosphere.The noise level in the hotel is great, super quiet, no inter-room noise. We did find our air conditioner in the room noisy though and it took a few nights to get used to it. And the hotel next to Hotel Renew serenades its poor guests with singing and dancing at breakfast, rain or shine which unfortunately means you also get sung awake at 7am every morning. Be warned!Overall the hotel offered excellent value for money and was well appointed, nice and modern, unlike so many of the other ones we were looking at for the same price. The staff were a stand out. However do think about the boutique nature of the hotel and make sure you're happy with what you don't get in return for the benefits.",Auckland,20,4.0

I was quite nervous before, but all my worries were just blown away. Hotel Renew was great! I have to say it was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at and I have been in a few. We have had an upper floor, city view room, the hotel is really just steps from the beach so it is not a big deal not to stay in ""beach front"", because all the beach front hotels have the busy main street in front of them anyway!!! so it was quite nice to be not in the first row but still not far away. The hotel inside is new or renovated, however it´s really nice, no big hawaiian designs but just nice stylish room, HUGE and sooo comfy bed, nice bathroom and a small hallway with a wardrobe, there is a small drink fridge so you can put some fruit there or so too. The staff was friendly and helpfull, you can have some beach chairs and towels for free - it was great as people pay for hiring these on the beach like 50 $ a day... It was really quite, we have never heard anything from other rooms or so. The breakfast buffet is quite small but was enough for us but it is happening in the hotel lobby (the hotel is quite small compare to other ones in Hawai´i so there is no restaurant) and there is not enough chairs for all the people I would say, we were lucky to have a seat every time but I saw few people waiting for a bit. But as I saw the bigger hotels they even had a queue in front of the restaurants so than I thought this wasn´t so bad, some of these hotels are promising ""take away breakfast"" on the beach - but it is just because you actually have to take all you can before somebody else will do it and you go to find yourselves spot on the beach, because there is no room for you in the restaurant.Hotel great value for the price, I would recommend it for sure, it´s for someone who likes a bit of a privacy and who likes to stay in a nice place on a holiday (for me it just makes the whole thing much better). It is not an empty luxury, you don´t pay the extra $$ for some chandelier or so, but you have all you need - I mean, you are mainly spending time outside anyway but you are gonna feel good inside too. I think for this money this is the gem, and BIG plus - it really looks just like on the internet websites pictures. We just had a great time, we loved Hawai´i, we traveled all around the Ohau Island but we liked just to stay on the Waikiki beach as well, it may be crowded for some people, but I think it´s not worse then when you live in Europe and go to Croatia for a holiday - I thought it is gonna be much worse, like more people, so I really liked it the way it was, the place - beach, main road - is alive but not annoying. I would definitely stayed again, thank you all from the staff for helping us to have the best holiday time, Aloha from Barbora & Josef!!","Kaikoura, New Zealand",1,5.0

If this is very important to you, you may be disappointed (although it is still only a block to walk to the beach).Other than that issue, I was very impressed with the customer service, and the design of the hotel. It feels like a small, more expensive stylish boutique. Our room had some scuffs and dings and not totally clean mirrors, but it was fairly minor.

Staff is very friendly and professional. We booked a double bed with partial ocean view but that was our first mistake.The guy who checked us in said (almost apologizing) that we have a double bed but the great thing about our room is the balcony. When we get to the room (301), we are happy, on the small side but clean/stylish. Downer #1: We are a small/average size couple and the double bed was way too small. It took some getting used to for sure.Then our balcony with partial ocean view - if you have to pay extra for it, not worth it. You have to lean over the railing to see the view and the high rise hotel next door has a great view of you. No intimate evenings out there. Great for families with small children since the balcony is concrete and kids can be out there safely without danger of falling through railings. Can imagine it would be great for a smoker too.Cool lighting system, effective shades (that you will never open because you are surrounded by lanais) and Face Stockholm products.Biggest complaint - moldy smell in the room. We told reception about it. They did a ""deep clean"" but really didn't help. We stayed 3 nights and since we only had one more night, we tolerated it. Maybe coming from the carpet or a/c. Def a negative.Overall, not bad. Renew was so close the beach w/ free beach towels, boogie board & breakfast so if you are not staying too long, it's great.

Overall an acceptably good place to stay in Waikiki. We paid $1067 with taxes included. Our room was on the 8th floor.The good:The location is less than one block from the beach, so the access is very easy and convenient. The hotel offers beach towels, beach chairs, beach mats and boogie boards for the asking.The room provided all the basic needs – the bed was clean and comfortable, the AC worked fine.Breakfast is a continental breakfast (cereal, pastries, juice, coffee) from 7am to 9:30am. Sometimes we were gone before 7am; so you’ll have to find breakfast somewhere else (McDonald’s, Leonard’s bakery, etc.) if you leave early. There was always adequate seating when we were there at 7am, but there is seating for only about 10-12 people.Thursday night is happy hour with a complimentary drink for the evening – the Blue Hawaiian served by the bartender was very good.There are lots of restaurants nearby - Teddy's Burgers, Subway, McDonald's, Cheeseburger in Paradise are good choices. The not so good:The room can be noisy, even with the AC running. I suggest keeping the bathroom door closed (much of the noise enters through the bathroom window) and set the AC fan for “on” so that it runs continuously.There are no TV listings so that you have to sort through all the channels to find which ones you want.There is a $25 per day fee for parking. It’s valet parking and they always did a nice job getting the car when requested. You won’t find any free or discount parking in Waikiki, so this is really your only option if you have a rental car, which I highly recommended.The room lighting is dismal, bring a flashlight. I wasn’t able to see the safe in the closet without a flashlight. The room lighting options are dim and dimmer.The shower has such a low flow that it was difficult to clean up after a day at the beach.Our room didn't have a good view, but the view from the beach was excellent.Summary: A good value for the location; it’s clean, comfortable and provides good access to the beach.

This is a small hotel, about a block from Waikiki Beach. We were assigned a room on the top floor (9th floor) and our room didn't have a view, but to us, that didn't matter. Each floor appeared to have fewer than 10 rooms, which meant that, for us, it was a very quiet hotel. I am a light sleeper, and I found that I heard no noise at all during the night, even from other guests/rooms on our floor, which is rare. The front desk staff during our stay were all helpful and friendly, with advice regarding where to eat dinner, which shuttle service to use, etc. The front desk also provides free beach towels, mats, chairs and boogie boards for your use. The location of this hotel was great for us - not on the noisiest, busy street, but close enough to walk to many of the restaurants/sights on Waikiki Beach. At least from our room on the 9th floor, we didn't hear any street noise. It was also a good location for picking up a tour bus (Roberts Hawaii) which stopped just a few steps from the front door of Hotel Renew, which took us to an evening dinner cruise on the Ali'i Kai catamaran (see separate review - great cruise!). The free breakfast buffet each morning was more than adequate for us - juices, coffee, croissants, assorted danish and pastries, toast/toaster, cereals, fresh fruit, etc.Our first afternoon, we met the maid for our floor, who introduced herself, and indicated she would be the maid on our floor for our stay, which I thought was nice. The hotel also has a cocktail hour in their small bar, also in the lobby, each evening. The evenings we were there, the cocktails were not complimentary, but that didn't bother us. It was nice to be able to get a drink without leaving the hotel. Things to note: This hotel does not have a pool. We were more interested in the Pacific Ocean, just a block away, than in a pool. Also, there is no concierge desk, as there is with many Waikiki hotels. But, the front desk did assist when we asked them for help with recommendations or arrangements. Also, they do charge for parking the car in the hotel garage overnight. My recommendation is not to rent a car at the airport, but first to take the shuttle to the hotel when you get to Honolulu, and walk around the city or take a bus for the first couple/few days. Then, when you want to get out of the city, rent a car at one of the car rental agencies near the hotel, so you don't have to pay for parking overnight on the days you are just in town, at the beach. Also, around the corner from the front door of the hotel is a place you can rent bikes or mopeds - we didn't realize this until the day we were leaving. It might have been fun to rent one or the other if we had been here another day. Also, literally right next door is the ABC store - which are in abundance in Hawaii - they have everything from beach towels to liquor here. Almost anything you could need you should be able to pick up there. Finally, I would say this hotel is better suited to couples or singles, or to business travelers, rather than to families with very young children. Its decor is very stylish and modern, and there was a couple with a toddler staying here when we were, and it didn't seem to be a good fit for their needs, to me. It's probably fine for pre-teens or teens, though. We were here with our college-age son, and it worked fine for us. I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travelers to Waikiki, who don't want the gigantic hotel experience. We were very happy with our stay.",FL,89,4.0

Loved the contemporary style and boutique-sized hotel, and the entire staff were always friendly, smiling, and helpful. Valet parking ($25/day) was quick and simple, well worth the convenience, especially in Waikiki. The inclusive continental breakfast was excellent with ample selection of cereals, pastries, fruits, juices, coffee, etc. Cool towels and juice provided at check-in was a pleasant personal welcome after the long flight. The bed was so comfortable and our room was quiet and spotlessly clean. If you want the big, noisy, lost-in-the-crowd, resort-style accommodations of Waikiki, then stay elsewhere. If you want the pleasant, quiet, convenient, smaller, modern, personalized experience with no worries, then stay at Hotel Renew. I'll definitely return! =)",North Carolina,116,5.0

The outside of the hotel looks like an inexpensive apartment building, but as they always say ""don't judge a book by it's cover."" A doorman took our bags out of our cab and brought them inside before I even realized (which confused me for a minute :) ), we walked inside and it was instantly a very different vibe.The lobby was small but modern and sleek with high ceilings. The staff was very friendly and we were greeting at the counter with fresh glasses of pineapple juice and cool damp towels. The asked if we were on our honeymoon and we excitedly agreed. We went on up to our room and it was very modern and sleek to match the lobby. One thing I didn't like was the room was pretty dim even with the lights on the bright setting (but that's my only complaint really). The bed came with the most comfortable down comforter I've ever used, it was like a cloud! The a/c was effective and a little noisy but the white noise is good to tune out some of that city noise (the most noise we heard was our first night out of four there was a garbage truck early in the morning but it was quick and we easily went back to sleep). The room had a button system for the lights which was really handy and cool, there was a set of buttons on each side of the bed and at the door. Each controlled the lights by ""bright"" ""night and ""just right"" and there was a more detailed one by the side of the bed to turn on and off specific lights. Everything was very clean and up to date and very modern. The staff was very friendly throughout our entire stay, and they even sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne about 20 minutes after we arrived with a hand written card congratulating us. We did use the valet parking (the only parking available) for $25/night. Street parking is available but is ran by meters, so it wasn't worth the hassle. Overall a great, friendly boutique hotel. Would definitely recommend for couples.No pool, no restaurant (small bar in the lobby).The hotel is one very short block from the end of waikiki beach (about two blocks from the zoo). The street it's one is a less used street which made for a very quiet area in comparison to the other hotels.","Salem, Oregon",17,5.0

Many had me second guessing my choice but I am glad we didn't . It is in a great location. One block from the beach and on the quiet side of Waikiki. It was close to some good restaurants- Uncle Bo's , Rainbow drive in and Bogarts bistro. We also found a fun old school steakhouse in the Ohana East and the worlds smallest karaoke bar called Wang Chungs. We really enjoyed all the free loan beach equipment and even took some of it with us when we explored the North Shore. You need to checkout the beaches on this part of Oahu. We let them know it was our anniversary and they sent us up a bottle of wine and they found out it was also my birthday one day and sent up another treat that day. Breakfast was ok. Yes it was a small area but most mornings we just took it up to our room. Housekeeping did a great job and the front desk was very helpful with booking outings if you needed that kind of service. It is probably a little over priced for the amenities offerd but you know with such a good experience I am willing to pay little more.

The service and staff are really top quality here. Not only did we feel welcomed and a bit pampered, but in talking to the super friendly staff we learned some excellent off the beaten path stops for our Hawaii vacation. They accommodated us with an early check in and the room was very clean, functional, and had a stunning view of the nearby beach (2 blocks away). This hotel is probably best for couples or independent travelers who don't need a lot of amenities. The ones they do have - free wi-fi, continental breakfast (get there early and it's no problem finding somewhere to sit) pretty good happy hour drink specials in the lobby, beach chairs and towels, and good relationships with other Hawaiian companies (enterprise, a surf school) - are really top notch.

The rooms are modern and visually pleasing, and the beds are extremely comfortable. What they offer as complementary services are reliable wifi internet in each room, as well as beach towels, beach chairs and mats on request. Every morning, breakfast is free with refreshing and tasty pineapple juice.The details: What impressed me the most was their service. For me, the experience began even before I arrived on Oahu. I went to Oahu with my fiancee and actually proposed there. I wanted to arrange some rose petals as part of the proposal, so I called ahead of time and spoke with the manager, Daniel, for some info. All I asked was where I could get them, and he offered to personally buy them for me ahead of time and have it ready when we arrived. He went out of his way to get them and told his staff about it so that they wouldn't spill the beans to my fiancee. The rose petals were ready for me when I needed them, and they even helped with putting them in the car so that my fiancee wouldn't see them. When we returned to the hotel afterwards, Daniel greeted and congratulated us, and we were pleasantly surprised with a bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room. When an ocean-view room on the top floor opened up, Daniel switched us over to that room and never rushed us to give up the previous room that we had.What made Renew special was that they don't treat you like you're just 1 of these numerous people who stop by for a few then leave.

Hotel staff are friendly and welcoming - a welcome drink awaits you on arrival whilst your bags are promptly taken to your room and help is at hand to set up the free wi-fi. The room itself was very clean - the shower amazing and the twin double beds extremely comfortable. The in room fridge is great for storing water etc. The welcome book provides a good place to start for information as where to go/what to do and the hotel has leaflets at the front desk if you need more information.Breakfast is served until 9.30am - I recommend you get downstairs early as in peak season there is limited space to sit. The breakfast itself is good - cereal, fruit, tea, coffee, juice, toast and muffins - all very adequate. The hotel offers beach towels, mats, chairs and boogie boards which I'd recommend using as there isn't really anywhere in your room to hang wet towels - i.e. no balcony - its the same for swim suits/bikinis - they do dry - we hung ours on the air con system but it will take a while to dry. The air con in the rooms is good but requires some fiddling to get the temperature right. The hotel has a 'happy hour' from 5.30 - 7.30pm and whilst it is more a 'quiet drink' than a raving social event, it's a good way to start your evening with cheap cocktails at $6. All staff are very friendly and do their best to answer your questions etc. They were very helpful when it came to going home, providing storage for cases and getting taxes for you - around $40 to the airport. Cleaning staff are also very good - daily room cleaning with change of towels etc. The map provided in your room is a good start for getting around - although for buses come out of the hotel entrance, turn right, walk up the street, walking past lemon street up to Kuhio Avenue - first major street running parallel - and you can pick up all major buses from any stop along that street. For buses its $2.50 - keep the ticket because you can use it on another journey within the time frame given at the top. Most buses go to the Ala Moana centre - big massive shopping centre and then transfer there to get another bus out to places such as North Shore, Moana Falls and other beaches on the island. Bus travel is possible around the island but be prepared to spend a few hours travelling and waiting for buses - buses to North shore and Lanikai and Kailua beach run 1 every hour - worth the visit - one of the top ten beaches in the world, sandy banks, blue waters - no rocks. If you can car hire is the best option but you an enjoy the view on the bus too. I had a birthday whilst staying at hotel Renew and was given a bottle of very tasty sparkling wine in my room along with a card which I thought was a really nice touch. All in all hotel Renew is a lovely hotel with excellent location suitable for couples, families and friends/families travelling in twos.

The fact that this is a smaller, boutique hotel is such a huge plus. The entire staff was amazing, especially all of the wonderful valets (especially Adam!). We got so many suggestions on places to eat and trails to hike that we would have completely missed without these guys. Also, the fact that it's a smaller hotel means that your car is ready in seconds (unlike the larger resorts)!Also, the free beach equipment (chairs, towels, body boards, etc) was awesome! Made the beach experience (which is only a 1/2 block away) that much better! And who needs a pool when you have Waikiki 30 seconds down the road?People complain about the continental breakfast, but we honestly had no issues with it whatsoever. Cereal, yogurt, granola, fresh fruit, pastry, kona coffee, and pineapple juice....what else could you ask for in a FREE breakfast? We had a late night flight out, but the hotel offered us an hour of time in a room to shower after a day at the beach! Let us use the travel day to the fullest, and not waste it!After staying here, we went to Kauai and stayed in the St. Regis Princeville for a week and honestly missed our hotel experience at Renew even though it was 1/3 of the price!

I arrived close to 10 p.m. and was greeted with a cool towel and chilled pineapple juice, both of which hit the spot! I chose a room with a view and I could see Waikiki Beach and the ocean from my room. Beautiful! The bed was super comfortable and the hotel was quiet. I slept well every night. The room had everything I needed. Breakfast was offered starting at 7:00 a.m. -- fresh fruits, juices, muffins, toast, cereal, yogurt, coffee, etc. My first priority was the beach and the Hotel Renew supplied a beach towels and beach chair at no charge. I went to the beach my first and second days. Upon my return the second day, the staff greeted me by name! I was a bit surprised! I was there several days before going to Kauai for several days. After Kauai, I returned to the Hotel Renew to claim my same room with a view with which I had fallen in love. I was greeted again by name. Nice! If I were to change one thing about the hotel it would be to have breakfast (or at least coffee) offered earlier. Many of us are on mainland time so we're up early! This would space out the diners so everyone didn't arrive at the same time and take up all the seats -- yes, the breakfast area was a bit crowded at times. Because I was up and ""attem"" by six every day, I was also out exploring. I found several breakfast places for more hearty breakfasts -- one that had an authentic Japanese breakfast (which I love) just around the corner. Since the Hotel Renew did not have a restaurant, I enjoyed exploring other meal options. Right next door was a hotel with an excellent bar overlooking Waikiki Beach (EXCELLENT BLOODY MARYS) and an delicious calamari appetizer. Not far in any direction were wonderful restaurants and shopping. The trolley stop was just steps away from the main entrance of the hotel so I could (and did) go anywhere I wanted on a free or cheap trolley. As far as I'm concerned, this was the perfect hotel for me in terms of price, amenities, and location. I hope to go back to Oahu again and when I do, I will stay at the Hotel Renew.

I really wanted to give a better review than this - it was a great location, the staff were very nice and helpful and we enjoyed our stay for the most part. There were a couple of negatives - firstly the sound of the garbage truck in the side street which lasted for 1 hour (no joke) at 7am Sunday morning. It's a city, so there's going to be noise, but 1 hour of constant screeching on a Sunday morning was a bit much. If I was going to stay here again I'd fork out a bit extra for an ocean view room which I assume also has less traffic noise, however the whole point was that we wouldn't be spending much time in the hotel to justify having a view - we'd only be there at night!The other negative was the noisy air conditioning in the room. It was so noisy we turned it off just before going to sleep, which is fine except when waking up in a hot stuffy room and no windows to open. There was also other noises throughout the night, water running form people having showers at 2am etc. Apart from these things our stay was good, would probably stay elsewhere next time though, high up!","Melbourne, Australia",5,3.0

They did have a nice selection of tea and both regular and decaf coffees. If you want cocktails before heading out, do try the bar downstairs. I had a couple of cocktails at the bar during happy hour and they were really good, especially the pineapple mojito. The front desk will provide you with beach mats and/or chairs along with towels so don't worry about bringing any unless you plan to go on outside excursions after you check out. I gave Hotel Renew five stars because they are upfront about what they are and do (a boutique hotel with good rooms, not a resort) and they do it well.

I also prefer the smaller boutique type hotels. My partner and I got an ocean view room on the 9th floor. It overlooked the Outrigger pool next door. I wasn't expecting ocean front views from a hotel that's a block off the beach so we thought the ability to see the water was very nice.Waikiki in general is very noisy so unless you have a room with double paned windows, expect to be awakened by pedestrians, blaring radios, garbage trucks, etc. That's why I rated ""sleep quality"" as average but I think most hotels in Waikiki suffer equally in this regard. The hotel itself was pretty quiet internally when we were there. We didn't notice noise through the walls or excess noise in the hallways.The hotel room was in good shape with a nice modern decor. There was some wear and tear in the room but generally I felt like it was in good shape. The bed was very large and very comfortable. The breakfast, served in the lobby, was also very decent..mostly bread and pastries, cereals, fruit, juices and yogurt.We used the valet parking and the price was what I would expect to pay in Waikiki. The staff are all very friendly and service-oriented. We even left a jacket behind that we were able to retrieve a week later before we flew out.I like the location of the hotel, it's at the eastern end of Waikiki so it's easy to walk to Kapiolani Park/Queen's Surf Beach and also easy to get on and off the H-1 via Kapahulu. Also very easy to walk to many great places and restaurants.Generally I don't like Waikiki but if you do need to spend a night or two there, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.","San Diego, California",152,5.0

Location, price and reviews were foremost in my mind at the time. Having since returned home I am still happy with that choice. It is on the left hand side of Paoakalani Ave immediately behind the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel which fronts both Kalakaua and Paoakalani Aves. Both hotels face the beach. On the other side of Paoakalani is the Waikiki Beach Marriott which also fronts Kalakaua Ave and the beach. The Hotel Renew may be a new hotel or simply a renovated one as the name implies but is nonetheless of a boutique style of a good standard and has very friendly and helpful staff. Our room 706 was modest in size but very modern with a sweeping view down Paoakalani Ave to the Ocean and was one of the few with a balcony giving restricted views of Diamond Head. It does overlook the pool of the Aston Waikiki Beach from which live band music floats up at night and the roar of motor bikes were often heard from the street late at night. The tarfiff was US$196 per night which included a light breakfast in a small breakfast annex. Such comprised juice, fruit, cerial, pastries, cakes, toast, tea or coffee. Having just come of a 18 night cruise up from Sydney on the Radiance of the Seas it was a relief for us to be restricted to a light wholesome light meal that was more than sufficient for us to start our day. Otherwise there is no restaurant and no pool in the hotel. However it does offer a happy hour for cocktails late afternoon in the same area as the small breakast annex. My only problem with the room was the airconditioning and the bedding. Each room has an air conditioner immediately below the window and adjacent to the king bed. We found it to be a little noisy and our sleep was repeatedly broken as it went through its dormant and cooling cycles finding ourselves constantly thowing back and then retrieving the covers. It was too warm to simply turn it off and open the window to the small amount permitted. Such would have also allowed more noise to enter. The mattress and the pillows are feather and I found the latter gave little support to my neck which again caused aches and broken sleep. I was therefore often tired by early evening. A request for a firmer pillow only yielded more of the same type. No amount or combination improved the support. Would I stay there again. Yes! Not being lazy and taking time to better set the airconditioner would have helped. However I guess I would simply have to put up with their pillows.","Mollymook, Australia",33,4.0

On arriving in the room, we observed the view and while you can technically see the ocean (sort of), the hotel is set back from the water a little bit and the neighbouring hotels block the view quite a bit, so don’t expect much frontage. Also the hotel doesn’t have balconies so you may want to consider this if that’s your thing.The bed was king size, very soft and comfortable! One of the best we’ve ever experienced. Room was suitably dark for a sound sleep with the slide shutter blinds closed. As much as we tried to get up and start the day many sleep-ins were had, but that’s what holidays are all about. Only issue was the noise from the street as it is close to the main road and the trolley cars come down the street and insist on ringing their bells loudly several times. Some of the neighbouring hotels also had bands and on some busy nights the clientele felt amorous and wanted to tell this to the world. Fortunately the more than adequate air conditioning, when kept on all night, drowned out much of the noise.Room was a good size and had a huge flat screen television with plenty of channels to watch. Decor was very modern looking inside with recent furniture and custom controlled lighting. Bathroom was up-to-date and kept clean with plenty of toiletries and towels. Shower water pressure could be better though, but adequate.As we were aware that this is a boutique hotel we knew there is no pool or gym. Continental breakfast was served daily up until 9:30am, but it could get busy with many people staying. The bar was cosy and happy hour good to take advantage of after a hard day sightseeing or shopping. There were great cocktails to pick, but not too much variety with beer choices (eg no lager, but plenty of pale ale!).Staff members were friendly and pleasant making our stay relaxed and enjoyable. Grace, on the front desk, in particular helped us book some tours to explore the island and provided us with printed information about each one to help us choose. Jason, the fellow Aussie, behind the bar helped us with advice on what to see and where to eat.If you want to go for a swim at the beaches, just make sure you ask the locals, or at least experiment with different spots as some are better than others!Overall enjoyable stay at a very comfortable, friendly hotel that we recommend you consider staying at.","London, United Kingdom",46,4.0

We were on the 5th floor. On arrival we were checked in very early which was really appreciated after the flight from Australia. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our entire stay, booking a hire car for us and providing maps of places to go. The room was very clean and the housekeeping throughout our stay was fantastic. The location is also really good being 2 mins from the beach, and a short walk into the heart of Waikiki. We also ate at the Tiki bar next door which was great. The bed as previously mentioned is very comfortable. Now for the bad - the street noise is so loud, I had to sleep with earplugs in. My husband struggled to get sleep. There are constant dings from trolleys, loud trucks, and late at night people carrying on out in the street. You also get lots of noise from Tikis next door with loud music late into the night. The airconditioning was also incredibly loud and we couldn't have this on at night, which made it quite hot and I wouldn't want to be there in summer. The walls are also very thin and you can hear everything in the hallways and rooms next door and get woken early. The shower room was really dark and needed additional lighting. Also the water pressure was terrible.Breakfast was also disappointing - we never got to sit down and enjoy it as there was never anywhere to sit. So we just grabbed a coffee/juice on the way out each day. There was a small selection of cereal and pastries. There is also no pool, which we didn't think we would care about, but the beach was having maintenance work while we were there and a pool would've been very welcome on the hot days. For the price we paid I think the location is great, but I think if we were looking for a budget option next time we would try one of the hotels a street back from the beach, like Hilton Waikiki Beach which we had friends stay at and was great. Unfortunately I don't think the noise is something they can address here so if you are a deep sleeper or get a well located room than you may be okay.","Brisbane, Australia",251,3.0

The staff were amazing nothing was to much trouble for them from tours to helping with directions. Our room was facing the ocean and our little balcony was facing diamond head as it was a the end of the corridor so we had the best of both worlds. The bed was amazing and bathroom was a good size however with 4 suitcases we were a little pressed for room. The fridge was great as we were able to put drinks into it for use during the day. The air conditioning was a little loud at night when we were trying to go to sleep but other than that it was a great room. The breakfast in the morning had a good selection for food but we stayed 4 nights and had a bit of trouble each morning trying to get a seat. There is only seating for about 10 people in the lobby area and this was a little annoying having to hover around waiting for someone to leave. We ended up going else where most mornings. This hotel is located down the end of Waikiki near diamond head away from the bustle and a short 2min walk to the beach which was great. Everything you needed was close by and it i right next store to a main hotel so all the tours picked up from outside the door. Would stay here again on my next trip to Hawaii,United Kingdom,64,4.0

All of the staff greeted you with a smile and were helpful to assist any way that they could. I needed to print out an itinerary and they let me use the front desk computer and printer. They even offered to store and keep watch of my friends bicycle. The hotel offers clean beach towels and boogie boards free. The breakfast was good and adequate to get the day started. The only issue was finding a place ot sit as it gets crowded for breakfast. My recommendation is to get there early to ensure you get a seat. The room was a premium ocean view room with a king size bed on the 6th floor. It was very modern and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and I liked the fact that there are rolling shutters on the windows. These rooms look out into the pool area of the Aston Waikiki and then to the ocean beyond. The bathrooms could use more lighting, especially in the shower. It was a bit dark, even with both sets of lights turned on. The A/C is a bit loud in the room but I didn't mind it so much because it drowned out the noise coming from the outdoor bar at the Aston at night. There is no swimming pool at this hotel. Personally, I prefer the beach anyway and so that was not an issue for me. Finally, the hotel is very close and within walking distance to the beach, park, aquarium, zoo, and many nice restaurants. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a smaller hotel experience with excellent service and great rooms.","Palm Springs, California",16,4.0

We were greeted during check-in with a glass of refreshing pineapple juice and a cool lemongrass-scented towel for freshening up, and given a map detailing many attractions in the area with explicit instructions on which bus routes went there and where to catch those buses. Since we like to use public transportation, we found this invaluable. The lobby area is very comfortable and attractive, with flowers and local art to add to the fine fittings and decor. The staff was always top-notch, very helpful and attentive.Our room was very well appointed, clean and crisp with attention to detail. The bed was very comfortable, and there was plenty of space at the desk and easy chair with lots of space to move around. We paid a small premium for an ocean-view room and did not regret it: the room was quiet and the view could not be beat. We were on the 8th floor and recommend a high floor room if one is available.Unlike many big chain hotels these days, Hotel Renew offers free wifi done right (with a wired connection available on the desk if you prefer). Each room has its own wireless router and all you do is connect to your room's signal; it was strong and free and did not require passwords or daily signing in. You don't pay for electricity or water at a hotel, nor do you have to validate yourself to use these utilities; we believe wifi service should be treated the same way, and we commend Hotel Renew for this practice. We appreciated the small fridge in the room (NOT a minibar!) good for storing water or leftovers. Breakfast is ample and fresh, served in the seating area which becomes the bar in the evenings, surrounded by fun art and attractive fixtures. There were only a few minor drawbacks to our experience. The room lighting controls were a little tricky to operate, and even with all the lights on it was occasionally a bit dim. The room could have used a bit more light. It took us a long time to find the second light in the bathroom (""Touch here""); we'd wondered how to get light in the shower and would recommend that the bellman demonstrate that while he's going through the room controls. Also, there were no coffee making facilities in the room, although there was coffee and lemon iced water available in the lobby for most of the day (and the convenient Starbucks around the corner opens at 5 a.m.)Our review would not be complete without a big shout-out to Jacqueline the weeknight bartender. She was personable and fun, and made absolutely killer mai tais which were heavy on the fresh lime juice, unique, tasty, and satisfying.We had a marvelous stay at Hotel Renew and have already been recommending it to friends and family. With 3-night stay offers, it is completely unbeatable; we'll definitely be back.","Henderson, Nevada",70,5.0

I loved the look and comfort of the room. Staff is very friendly and helpful. I had many questions (typical tourist) and they graciously answered them all. My room had air conditioning and thick screens to block out the sun during the day. These are must haves for a Seattle native who is used to 40 degree pouring rain and thick cloud cover. We melt in anything over 75 degrees. Hotel is very well maintained. The two drawbacks which were only a minor inconvenience are no business center and no room service. My flight was delayed by two hours, so I didn't get into Honolulu until 10:30pm. I was too tired to go searching for food. It would have been nice to order room service. I learned the next day there are plenty of restaurants and snack bars within walking distance. I asked for the business center so I could print out vouchers I needed for two (tremendous waste of time) attractions I had booked during my trip. The receptionist informed me they didn't have one, but I could email what I needed printed, and they would do it for me. That was very nice of them. I'm unsure what the regular room rate is for this hotel. I booked my trip through Priceline and got round trip airfare plus 5 nights at Hotel Renew for $1500 and some change. I'm pretty sure their regular rates must be reasonable because of the bargain I go. If I ever visit Waikiki again, I'd likely stay at Hotel Renew.

I couldn't agree more!The moment you check in, you are blown away by the exceptional service you receive from the staff. I was treated to a cold drink upon check-in, and a wet cloth to freshen up, and the bellhop immediately took my bags up to my room, all the while I was still checking in. Not even some of the other top resorts I've stayed in (that are far more expensive) had such a service. When arriving in my room, the aforementioned bellhop announced his name, left his card, and told me I could contact him any time if I needed anything. Such great service.The room was gorgeous. Everything was very modern and looked very luxurious and fancy. All lights in the room were controlled by a small panel where you had different options - all the way off, dim, etc. Fancy. Everything looked brand new with no visible wear or tear. The bathroom was outstanding. In addition, the room had all the amenities you could ask for, including a fridge for your personal use, free wi-fi, flatscreen with lots of channels, and much more. I had a deluxe room with an ocean view. Now, while I could certainly see the ocean, The Renew is not an ocean front hotel. It's important to keep in mind that the hotel is physically located a bit away from the beach and the ocean, and thus can't boast ocean views as impressive as the hotels closer to the beach or Kalakaua Ave. The view was also complicated by the fact that they are doing massive construction on Waikiki Beach at the moment, and the hotel is unfortunately facing the portion of the beach that is closed off due to construction.So, you can see the ocean, but not really 'feel' it so to speak. The photo I've attached shows the view after a considerable zoom on my camera.The hotel is just a short walk from the beach, though, and all the shops and restaurants in the area. You actually land in the 'beginning' of where all the action begins. The zoo is also just a 5 minute walk from the front desk. Aside from the so-so ocean view, the hotel is outstanding - especially considering the relatively low price. The location is also convenient for any activities you may have in Waikiki Beach.I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are on a budget!","Copenhagen, Denmark",219,4.0

I don't know the history of the hotel, but the bathroom window and sliding glass door to the balcony in my room (501) looked like they were left over from before the hotel was renovated. That's where the noise problem was worst. There should be some more soundproofing, but my rate was great and the city does quiet down fairly early (unlike NYC), so it wasn't something that made me crazy. Free breakfast was great. Yogurt, fruit, toast, pastries, cereal, pineapple juice and teas. Great Kona coffee too. Breakfast room is small, but I never had a problem getting a table. People are respectful and try to hustle along if they see there are people looking for a seat. I was able to read the complimentary newspaper and have a leisurely breakfast every day. The staff members working the breakfast worked very hard to keep the food replenished and make sure the seating area was clean.All staff members are extremely courteous, helpful and knowledgeable. The hotel offers free use of beach chairs, boogie boards, beach towels and mats. This was so great. It was nice to have a chair to sit on at the beach.If you have a late flight home, the hotel offers a room to shower and change so you can go to the beach all day and shower before your flight. You can reserve it the night before your departure and they will give you an hour time slot to use the room. I asked about it because I had read about this service on Tripadvisor. They did not offer it (but perhaps would have when I checked out). It was nice to have privacy to get ready. I stayed at the Marriott Waikiki a few years ago and the shower room was a suite where many people were hanging out and people took turns in the bathroom. Gross.Hotel focuses on minimizing power use, which I appreciate - but the lighting in the rooms is on the dim side. Would be nice if one bright bulb was available at bedside for reading, but I was at the beach most of the time and exhausted at night, so it wasn't a real bother. Waikiki is a strange place. Some great hotels and some really scary places, so do your homework before you go. A great rate may mean a stale old hotel nowhere near the places you want to go. My trip was great and I'd definitely check in with the Hotel Renew the next time I'm in Honolulu.I used Roberts Hawaii for my transfers to and from the airport. Reserved in advance online for $20 roundtrip for a shared van. I recommend them to get to/from Hotel Renew.","New York City, New York",25,4.0

We checked in with ease and greeted with cold pineapple juice and towels! The staff are lovely and it really has that artsy boutique feel to the hotel.Room is a great size enough for the two of us and we were lucky to get a room with a balcony. Bathroom is a decent size and has everything you need, bed is super comfy and air con works a treat! There is cable tv and a small desk area and a lounge chair. The hotel does offer free breakfast but we slept in as you do on holidays and didnt make it down in time. The location is great as its just behind the Aston Waikiki and across the road from the Marriott. It's a 1min walk to the beach and right out often front of the hotel all the trolley buses stop to go around Waikiki! Compared to the big resorts on the beach I don't think we missed out on much, we still went to the Westin and Sheraton and enjoyed cocktails by sunset!

Unfortunately that part of the beach is currently closed and being restored - they are recycling the sand and will be laying the beach again. Never mind 200 meters to the left is another section of the beach opposite to the Honolulu Zoo, which is open. The hotel is OK, but nothing impressive. The rooms are quite small. The breakfast area very squeezed, the breakfast is only continental, which means toast, butter, jam, 2 types of cereals, youghurt (only super sweet with strawberry jam inside) some danish pastry and muffins (not very fresh) and the highlight is fresh fruit - cleaned pineapple, watermelon and acai. The hotel is surrounded by highrises, so the view is just a view of the other fellow travellers in the next hotel. Our room was on the 4th floor opposite to the Mariott garage and it was very noisy - I suspect that the airconditioning of the large Mariott hotel was just opposite to our windows next to the multi story garage.

We got an Expedia rate and I wonder if discounters get the worst views... ours on the 2nd floor had to be the worst.

And when our free wifi wouldn't initially connect, a technician was dispatched quickly to fix the router problem.

On one hand there truly is amazing service - the front desk staff were professional and helpful. I loved the drink and the towel upon checking in. When our room wasn't ready (we were very early), they took our baggage easily and our room was ready fairly quickly. The problem is that it's not truly a boutique hotel - it's close, but they are missing the final touches that make it ""boutique"" and therefore worth the extra cost. Our sheets had codes written on them in black felt marker (really?), the air conditioner was quite loud, the room was extremely dark (the decor is so dark!) and they forgot to replace our towels (although they were super nice about it). I really liked the beds - super comfy. The thing that made me sad about this hotel was that I was in HAWAII and my room felt like it belonged in Chelsea, NYC. The lobby is SO DARK and cramped, and the rooms are dark and cramped as well. It's on a TROPICAL ISLAND! You would have no clue from the interior. Parts of the hotel do feel slick, but somehow it just feels a bit off. Our room was truly awful - I really regret not getting a nice room with an ocean view. If it were up to me, I think I would stay elsewhere that felt more like Hawaii - after all, isn't that what we tourists want?

We opted for their ""city view"" room to get a slightly lower rate and we were looking at other apartment buil,dings with a sliver of mountains.

It's a cozy and small boutique hotel a block down from Waikiki Beach, behind the Aston. We were welcomed immediately by Adam, who wound up assisting us with everything from connecting our room's WiFi, getting our rental Jeep in the garage, to trying to fix the soft-top on aforementioned Jeep. It is quiet inside the hotel and in the hallways. We had room 802 which was facing the back of the hotel looking out to other hotels, which was fine for us. Again, it was super quiet in the room as well, which was great when we were just relaxing and getting some shut eye. We are from NYC, so all this quiet I am mentioned was welcomed with open arms.I'd recommend the hotel to couples and business travelers. You can definitely get your rest and even some work done if you needed to. As the name suggests, you do get that ""renewed"" feeling upon waking and heading out for some fun in Oahu.Some things that might be a concern to others: no fitness center, no business center, dining area is just a few tables next to the lobby (where you can have a light free breakfast each morning: toast, muffins, fruit, cereal, coffee, juice), and valet parking is $25/day.I would stay here again when we are in the Waikiki/Honolulu area.

It is a small hotel, well decorated, and the welcome/reception staff are all very friendly. There are no line-ups that you will need to worry about (unlike almost all of the big hotels along the strip). This hotel has no pool area, but this suited us well as we walked to the beach (30 seconds' walk) and went swimming. Why would you fly to Honolulu for a hotel pool? Rent a car, drive to the North Shore, and go to an amazing remote beach that you can only find in Hawaii (as we did). I do not think there is any room service, either, but it is not like you are located in a remote area. Generally, I think this hotel is best for independent-minded tourists who want excellent value and want to get the most out of Hawaii. The hotel is on the far end of the Honolulu strip, but if you any of the restaurants/hotels/shops along the strip, everything is within walking distance in any event. Also it is beside one of the numerous ""ABC Stores"" which seem to sell everything that you will need if you forget anything / need a late night snack. I would also note that breakfast is included (which we appreciate), especially if you want to ""get up and go"". There seemed to be limited seating in the breakfast area (which is really an extension of the lobby), however we never had any problem with seating (unlike some others who have noted this) - and we were there at various times throughout our 7 days. So my general advice as someone who stays in a wide variety of hotels is that this hotel is probably the best value in Honolulu; I don't think there is any reason to stay at any of the other big hotels in Honolulu over this hotel. If you want a Hawaii-style resort, go to one of the more remote areas where you can experience this (or to another island - see my other hotel reviews!).","London, United Kingdom",53,5.0

The downside for the room are it is very (i mean very) close to the lift and it is the corner of 2 garbage dump areas - Garbage area for Marriott Waikiki and Garbage collection on the Lemon road. The garbage collection start at the non-peak hours of Waikiki, which is few hours before midnight and an hour before dawn (6AM). If you are light sleeper, you may prefer the beachfront, where Aston have the live music on till midnight but nothing before dawn to wake you up. Staffs are very attentive and nice.

We decided to break up the long flight by staying in Honolulu for 2 nights either side of the journey.On the way over we stayed 2 nights at the Hotel Renew. We arrived around 8:00am and were expecting to have to wait till check in (3.00pm) but luckily for us our room was ready so went up for some much needed showers and a sleep. We had a huge King size bed which accommodated my wife and i as well as our two children. It was very comfortable and cannot fault the room. It was a 'city view' room and was very clean and modern. If you want more of a view I believe there is an option for an ocean view however the building itself is quite small. I found the room very comfortable and suited our needs perfectly. The hotel staff were always helpful and provided service with a smile. It didn't have that factory feel of a 'Sheraton' type hotel and is definitely a nice little boutique hotel.The location is great, being a short stroll to the main beach and strip where all the action is. I would gladly stay here again if I was passing through but for a longer stay with children I might have to go to one of the larger ones. If I was going to recommend something to the hotel management and it would be to add some tea and coffee in the rooms...!","Sydney, Australia",26,3.0

We were certainly not disappointed, and were most impressed with the excellent attitude and service provided by all staff. The room decor was fresh and modern, the continental breakfast included was modest but sufficient, and the valet parking ($25.00/day) was about the quickest response we have experienced. Free loan of beach chairs, towels and boogie boards is a nice touch, and the local knowledge and directions were impressive and a great help. Happy hour in the small lobby bar is good value, and free wi-fi in the rooms is a better deal than most hotels offer. Not being very pool-y or fitness centre-y people, we didn't find the lack of these facilities any disadvantage at all.Given the location (a small building squeezed in between much larger hotels) there is not really much of a broad ocean view to be had, even in the 'Premium Ocean View' rooms, but a 150 metre walk will give you the real thing anyway. Opening windows in the room were welcome, and although locked to allow only a small opening, staff offered to shift the lock position if required. This may be necessary for some, as we found the air conditioner to be unreasonably loud - the only thing we could possibly criticise in an otherwise very relaxing stay in this clean and friendly hotel.A 15 minute walk to the Rainbow Drive-In offers a taste of the old Hawaii in a 1950's-style diner, offering very basic and very cheap menu items, some of which you would probably not find elsewhere - even in Hawaii. (anyone for spaghetti with a hot dog on top?). There's an ABC store just outside the front door of the hotel, and a 10 minute walk along Kalakaua or Kuhio will find any type of dining you need. Acces to the freeway is quick and easy, and return to the airport is less than a 20-minute drive.No hesitation in recommending Hotel Renew as a pleasant departure from the larger chain hotels. It's a bit more expensive than the typical Outrigger or Ohana (which we also enjoy) but you do get what you pay for.","Melbourne, Australia",17,5.0

First the good stuff. The staff is incredible, the level of service we are receiving is on par with four and five star resorts. The wi-fi is free, fast, and has a strong signal in the room and the lobby. Beach towels, mats, chairs, and boogie boards are available for use free of charge. The location is fantastic, less than a block to Waikiki beach (although at the end of the ""strip""). The valet is super friendly and fast and knew us and our car the second day we were here. The breakfast spread is nice and the coffee is very good.Now the caveats. Our room is pretty noisy, we have a room in the corner by the hostels/scooter shop and the laundry for the Aston. It's not a problem for us at all, we live in an urban area and are used to noise. If you are sensitive to noise think about getting a sea view room (I'm assuming these are quieter since they are on the other side of the hotel) or consider other accommodations. There is also a faint mildew smell coming from the air conditioner. A little off-putting, but not bad enough to complain about for us. Seems to be a recurring theme, just something to be aware of if you are sensitive to smells. I would definitely stay here again!","San Francisco, California",31,5.0

The staff were absolutely fantastic and so friendly! They were very accomodating and eager to assist with directions and recommendations for activities etc. They arranged for us to go to a Hawaiian Luau that night at our request and they also arranged for us to have a room to get changed in and freshen up the next day before our flight out as we werent flying out until the following evening. The hotel rooms were beautiful with very modern and chic looking decor. The bed was very comfortable also.

Trip Advisor has always been my go-to site for choosing hotels and the positive reviews on Hotel Renew are spot on! I just got back from a week stay at this hotel on Monday. It is one short block away from the picturesque Waikiki beach and the vacation was out of this world. Waikiki is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to and the staff at Hotel Renew made it an unforgettable trip for my Grandma and I. From the moment that you arrive at the doorstep of the hotel there was a concierge waiting to bring in our luggage; inside we were greeted by Grace with ice cold pineapple juice and a warm towel to freshen up. It was a wonderful welcome! Throughout the week Adam, Daniel and Mike in particular were fantastic and very responsive in providing advice on things to do during our visit. We were always warmly welcomed back upon our returns from our excursions so it had a very friendly atmosphere in an industry where you don't see that everyday. The staff would proactively take care of things that we would need like porter service for our luggage upon departure and getting transfer service organized for us to the airport. Further there was a room that you could book for an hour if you had a later flight so that you could freshen up before your departure. It was a nice added touch given that checkout time was at noon.When coming back to O'ahu I would stay here again with no hesitation. Very clean, nice decor and out of this world service. The only 2 suggestions that I would have would be about: the continental breakfast and the bedding. A bit more variety in the breakfast menu would be warmly appreciated by your guests especially when staying for more than a couple days. The duvets on the beds were a bit too warm for the climate as well, so the AC needed to be on to have a comfortable sleep. Quite minor things but Hotel Renew requested candid feedback. Many happy returns and appreciation for a wonderful holiday; we'll be back! :)","Calgary, Canada",1,5.0

The location, on the quieter side of Waikiki near Kapiolani Park, was ideal and within walking distance to everything I wanted or needed. The room, 602, was boutique-picture-perfect, with little niceties that went a long way, like free WiFi and a complimentary safe for valuables.

No issues with booking, a nice considerate email just prior to the ""no refund"" detail was appreciated. After a long day and longer flight we were warmly greeted at HR reception. I cringed with the thought of Gaugain-style images in the room, but the hotel stayed to a clean boutique-meets-Asia flair. We liked the proximity to the beach, convenience store, morning cuppa Joe around the corner (at 0530hrs) and ease with picking up a tour to Pearl Harbor. Breakfast was terrific (though go early due to limited seating and early risers...with appetites). Bed was comfy and I liked (oddly) the bathroom mirror lighting.I agree the hotel is not entirely sound proof. One very young and really unhappy traveller on our floor howled between 0200hrs and 0240hrs one night and 1040-G*d knows when the next night. If children at a boutique hotel is not your thing (we found it odd frankly, as we found a boutique hotel is not a usual family haunt), perhaps ask during check-in if you are on an adult floor.For me, the air conditioner in #802 was very loud and competed with our young guest in the loudness category. We decided to turn the AC on early in the evening while we were out so it would not run during the night.Lastly, (no fault of the hotel), our tour left from another hotel at 0600hrs, but breakfast starts at 0700hrs.

I booked a flight/car/hotel through Orbitz. For reasons unbeknownst to me, Orbitz decided to book my hotel the week before, while booking the flight and car the proper dates. Unfortunately, I didn't catch this in time - the hotel reservation had already started. So I called up the hotel, where the manager told me that there was nothing she could do, but to contact Orbitz. I called up Orbitz, who then called them, and told me that when they spoke to them, the hotel wasn't going to budge - they were going to charge me for the full room rate. No offers to discount my stay for the upcoming week - just a straightforward ""you're fresh out of luck."" Of course, when I called, they had the audacity to ask me if I wanted to book the room for this upcoming weekend. Really? Granted, the problem is somewhere else (me, possibly - Orbitz, sure). But in an age where exceptional customer service is becoming the norm, why wouldn't the hotel make an effort to understand that a visitor is coming to the islands - somehow the reservation got screwed up - and that they should do something *hospitable* within their power to alleviate my problem?The staff there need to learn better phone manners to make this a better experience when things inevitably go wrong - at least pretend to care, please.","Los Angeles, California",25,1.0

When we arrived at the front counter, they welcomed us and provided us with amazing pineapple juice and cold face towels. The room was excellent! It was very modern and gave a Zen type of feeling. There was a dresser to put your clothes in which are not common at other hotels. They also provided a safe for your valuables. Their complimentary breakfast was great! They offered croissants, muffins, toast, cereal, soymilk, regular milk, and pineapple juice with extra condiments. I'm used to staying at a 4 - 5 star hotel and was a bit skeptical staying at Hotel Renew since they were a 3 star hotel. I'm glad that I decided to stay at Hotel Renew as they have exceeded all of my expectations. I’ve previously stayed at Sheraton Waikiki in 2009 and never received the same type of service. This hotel is a block away from the beach, which was perfect. I didn't want to be right on the beach. The location was great. The valet parking is an additional $25 per night but it was worth it since there is no parking available and didn't want to wait to look for one. The night before we left, Adam suggested that if we needed to freshen up before our flight, there was a courtesy room that we can use for an hour at no additional cost after check out. Guests were welcomed to take a shower and freshen up. That was a great bonus! Daniel was also accommodating during our stay and gave us the available time for the courtesy room. Altogether, the staff was amazing! They really wanted to make sure that we had a wonderful experience staying at Hotel Renew. We couldn’t have been happier.

We went up the ramp that said parking for hotel renew and we parked our car ourselves...where's the valet? We found out that we were supposed to drive right in front of the door where a booth was situated (which we didn't see)...our bad. Anyway, the hotel only has valet (no self-park) because the parking lot is so small. Valet is $25 per day. We were greeted with pineapple juice and face towel dipped in a very refreshing scent to freshen up ourselves. Check-in was quick and we were given an upgrade to oceanview without being asked...that was cool. The room was cozy and comfy. When we returned from dinner, I asked the staff who opened the door for us for extra bath amenities (shampoo and conditioner) and was told that someone will bring them up to our room. As we got in the elevator, another staff got into the same elevator and got off on our floor. As we were opening our room, that same staff handed the bottles of shampoo and conditioner to us...that was quick! Then my son who joined us late at night had to valet his car (he didn't want to find parking outside) so we were charged another $25 for the second car. That was the only disadvantage we had.

We received great service from the front desk (the male staff smiled much more than the female employees -- but everyone was very professional).PROS:+ Rooms well appointed, with contempory decor+ A few steps to the beach+ Continental breakfast included, which is excellent for those early sightseeing morning+ Complimentary beach chairs (which however are very low to the ground and consequently difficult for seniors to use -- but still handy and cheaper that paying $50/day to rent two chairs and an umbrella on the beach!)+ Attentive staff that made efforts to make your sightseeing easier (whether by printing maps or providing candid assessments of the various tours -- they saved us money by giving us tips on how to maximize our trip to Pearl Harbour without paying for the expensive group tours)CONS- No balconies. Yes, the hotel is a few steps away from the beach, but being able to sit on your balcony in the morning and watch the city wake up would be nice. Something to consider if you have people in your group who are early risers- Air conditioning in our room was difficult to control; consequently, we either were warm under the fantastic duvet or cold since the air was going full blast. It was challenging to find the happy medium. - Valet parking is expensive ($25) compared to the self-parking lot ($10) that is a block away. However, the hotel employees never once made an issue of the fact we were using the parkage instead of their valet service and would still help us unload the car after a day of sightseeing.The ""Cons"" however are pretty much negated by the ""Pros"". We enjoyed the hotel. But more importantly, we enjoyed just how helpful the staff members at the hotel were. This was an ideal choice for a young couple (my partners and myself) who appreciates a more contemporary hotel and for our parents (i.e. senior citizens) who value personal attentive service.","Vancouver, Canada",3,4.0

I booked this hotel as it said it was boutique and looking at the pictures seemed to resemble a four star hotel which is what we wanted. I think however in Honolulu boutique just means small. Its location was good, not on the main street but not a big walk at all to the beach. Why you would stay 7 nights is beyond me in any Honolulu hotel... there are much nicer parts of Hawaii. It was ok for a night or two but the rooms are rather small. We had two double beds, one for our son and there was not much room for anything else. The tv is large if you like to watch tv in bed. The bathroom was pretty average really for boutique, tub was so small and shallow. The air con was right near the bed and the room smelt musty. We just had a view of another building and a palm tree as we were level two. Also there was no fridge in the room, it looked like one but apparently it was just to store drinks in without chilling them. Breakfast was interesting. We called to ask where it was as there was no rooms for it? It was basically in the foyer, there was a very small area with a few tables to accomodate nine levels of guests so of course not everyone could get a table which was very awkward. There was just cereal, toast, yoghurt - a continental breakfast i guess. It was ok if there had of been anywhere to sit. I think its quite poor value for what it is, there are other hotels half the price with larger rooms.","London, UK",72,3.0

For $195 you get a double bed in a tiny room. The decor is nice but they don't go 100%. The bathroom has old jalousies and the balcony is pretty sorry. The old air conditioner is right next to the bed (right next to your legs actually) and is a little inconvenient. The bed is very plush and takes nearly half of the room. For $150 I would say it is a pretty good value but for $195 I would say it's slightly below average. I would recommend redoing the exterior of the hotel because it looks like an old apartment complex.The service is good and the lobby is nice. Valet is $25 but they charge that everywhere so I could not gripe about that. Overall the hotel is ok but I think I had too much expectations since it was tripadvisor's #4 hotel at the time. Just wish the rooms were a little bigger to stretch out.,Ewa Beach,5,3.0

We'd visited Honolulu with our youngest child a few years before (although we stayed at another hotel) so were aware how beautiful the island is. The hotel has less than 100 rooms so you have the advantage of the receiption staff getting to know you. The ground floor receiption is welcoming, as were the doormen and receiption staff throughout our stay. Booking in was hassle free, and whilst the various forms etc were completed, we were offered complimentary soft drinks and towels to refresh hands and face. Most welcomed after the flight and taxi ride (which took about 30 minutes and wasn't overly expensive - although I can't remember how much it cost - sorry). We had booked a Premier Ocean View room (which turned out to a a corner room, so we overlooked the sea and from the room balcony, also had views of the rear of the hotel and a neighbouring hotel car park). The room was of a reasonable size and comfortable for two people. Everything worked - lights, hairdryer, small fridge, wifi, tv. The bed was very large - almost California size at a guess, and fairly soft. Being used to sleeping on a memory foam bed, I was concerned about how well I'd sleep, but had no problems at all. The room air conditioning wasn't particularly quiet, but didn't interefere with sleeping. Plenty of fresh towels were provided daily and the room was kept clean and tidy by the maid. Blinds at the patio door and across the room windows were excellent at cutting out the light - almost to blackout standard. One complaint - small, but as everything else was so good, it became a bit of a bugbear to me - there was no blind across the bathroom window. There is no danger of anyone 'peeping' as the glass is frosted, but as the rest of the room was so dark because of the blinds, when the sun came up in the morning the room became illuminated from the light shining through the bathroom window. A blind would have solved this and allowed for a few more minutes sleep each morning. Other reviewers have commented on the breakfast arrangements, and there isn't a great deal more about that to be said. It was plentiful with a good selection of fruits and cereals. Unfortunately some of the guests could have done with some courtesy lessons. There are a limited number of tables and chairs available at breakfast time and some guests, once finished breakfast, sat at the tables and read the complimentary newspapers, even though others were standing around waiting to be seated. Be warned, it can be a frustrating start to the day!! Located only a couple of hundred yards away from the beach and sea and a few minutes stroll to the main area of Waikiki the Renew is a good hotel. Whilst unlikely to visit Oahu again, if I did, then I'd have no hesitation in returning. For the money (and the hotel's website does appear to offer the best deals) it would be very hard to beat.","Cambridgeshire, England",8,4.0

The bed itself is also superb, up there with some of the best 5 * hotels I've stayed at.

There is a very limited selection of food and the area is small and often full. Still, for the money, just getting breakfast is great! The other thing is, like others have mentioned, the noisy AC in the rooms which mar the otherwise excellent room.

We were really unsure of what to expect, so we headed to tripadvisor to get a recommendation.We chose Hotel Renew based on the reviews, the value, and the proximity to Waikiki Beach. All things considered, this is an amazing hotel. The beach is one block down, and if you have been to Waikiki before, you know that everything is accessible by walking. Unfortunately, with all of our wedding plans (Hotel Renew had nothing to do with our wedding arrangements - we were married at Haiku Gardens in Kaneohe), we chose to rent a car.Valet Parking costs $20 per day and you may come and go as many times as you want within that day, but if you park, you pay. This is not uncommon in Waikiki. You will undoubtedly always be paying per night to park if you have a car, so please keep this in mind. Valet is the only option at Hotel Renew, but with general parking at other hotels costing around the same price, this is actually not a bad option if you must have a vehicle for your trip.Check in:We were somewhat disappointed that they were not able to give us any kind of upgrade as we were there for our wedding. However, they were definitely not under the obligation of doing so. We got the room we paid for, and it was a very nice room. I only mention this, because people often think that upgrades happen for special occasions, but it didn't happen for us. HOWEVER, they did send us up a bottle of champagne on our wedding day, along with a card and also one for my mom who celebrated her birthday in the same week. Very thoughtful!**One thing I will also say, because I was caught a bit off guard by this, is the deposit upon check in. I have never experienced this before, and perhaps that is naive, but this happened to us at both hotels we stayed at in Hawaii. Hotel Renew placed a $200 hold on our card at check in and the other hotel held $500. Please be aware of this when budgeting! The charge is reversed at check out, but can take a couple of days to return the funds to your account.The staff at this hotel is wonderful. Every person I encountered was friendly and helpful. I am so glad we chose this hotel. It may not be a resort, but this place has a quiet kind of luxury that you cannot experience in a big resort hotel. We will be back!","Leon Valley, Texas",19,5.0

We had a city view room with a king bed. Everything felt new and clean, and the small fridge was a nice touch. One morning we peeked into a room across the hall, and from the 6th floor the ocean view looked amazing and unobstructed. Our favorite two things about this hotel are the location and the service. You can stay about a block from the beach without paying an arm and a leg. It's about a 10-15 minute walk from our favorite beach we visited - Sans Souci - and not far from all of the action of nice restaurants and shopping. The free breakfast is nothing special, but the fruit is fresh and the coffee is great. It saved us a chunk of money. But the service - awesome. Everyone had a smile and offered great advice about things to do and places to eat and visit. The front desk can arrange a car rental for you or hook you up with a discounted day pass to the gym nearby. They even gave us access to a hospitality room where we could shower after the beach a few hours after we checked out on our last day. The lounge has great happy hour drinks, and the bartender can make you something not on the menu if you like. Same price - $6 - and strong. We loved it here. ","State College, Pennsylvania",5,5.0

We chose to stay at Hotel Renew because of the affordable price,the great location ( half a block from Waikiki Beach),and the smaller size of the hotel(only 70 or so rooms). We have stayed at many hotels in many large cities but we really hit the jackpot with this one.The personal service we received was outstanding. A special thank you to staffers Daniel and Kris and to all of the others who made our stay magical. We arrived a bit early and our room was not ready so they took our bags for us so we could do a little site seeing while waiting. When we came back to our room there was a bottle of champagne,two glasses and a card in our room wishing us a happy anniversary. The room itself was not very large but just a good size for the two of us. The king bed was very comfortable and bathroom was fine with tub/shower combo. The free morning breakfast was perfect with croissants,muffins,eggs and fresh fruit. The pineapple was always fresh and delicious . One of our favorite items each morning was the fresh pineapple juice. We now drink pineapple juice at home because of this.Everyday as we left for the beach we would stop at the front desk for complimentary beach towels and chairs to take with us for the day. There is no pool with this hotel but who needs one with the beach a half block away. Although we did 'creep' on the second floor pool of the hotel next door to ours!

My stay was for a week and somehow I got the very best room in the hotel with a clear view of the beach and ocean. The room was nicely decorated in blacks and reds giving a very modern feel. The bed was great with nice sheets and a feather bed. The only down side was the view in the morning, not the one of the nice rainbow, but of the neighboring hotel with their massive poolside breakfast buffet. The Hotel Renew breakfast was quite limited with mostly carbs and drink. The location of Hotel Renew is just a block from the best swimming area in Waikiki. It is very close to the Zoo and the crator. But shopping is a shot walk and the marina is at the other end of the beach. But, hey, it is the beach and what better than a nice stroll?

The staff at the Renew are what make it such a nice place to stay, all are really genuinely friendly and try to help. The really tall doorman was a standout for service and friendliness. Anyway so the room was really nice, dark modern furniture, nice bathroom, very comfy bed and lots of mood lighting. The breakfast they serve in the lobby is really nice also. Great coffee, fruit, cereals,juice, bagels, toast muffins, croissant and danish - so much more than your stock standard continental breakfast offered at most hotels. Room service was always really well done and they drop fresh beach towels into your room each day. The ONLY issue we had was the airconditioning unit made an awful sound all night, it would stop and start constantly and it was too hot to turn it off. We reported it the following morning and a nice man came to fix it and sucked about 10 litres of water out of the bottom of it. It improved but was still noisy. A few nights later it did the same thing, only worse, making it impossible to sleep - which sucked as we were exhausted from a few nights of getting NO sleep. We told front desk and were compensated for that night. The Hotel Renew really is an outstanding hotel in every aspect other than this. It is a shame the air con units are old or aren't serviced properly as it really does spoil what would otherwise be a perfect property. I have noticed a few other people have commented on the air con so hopefully they fix them as we are returning to Hawaii again this year and would love to stay at Renew if this is done.

Beautiful redesigned hotel/boutique style. Contemporary furnishings from the lobby to your room. Each room is designed well. Most comfortable bed we've ever slept on. Way better than the heavenly beds at Sheraton, Hilton, Hyatt, Omni etc!! Comfort 5 stars, atmosphere 5 stars, decor 5 stars! Price is affordable not steep, but for the cleanliness, comfort and style, I would recommend this hotel beats price, than staying at the Edition (high end style hotel in Waikiki, which was our first choice, but Hotel Renew beat them by price). Though the only draw back for this hotel is that there is no on site pool to lay sexy. I must say, the front conceirge was excellent! They take care of your luggage and transportation so you won't have to worry. They offer many amenitites like free beach mat, towels, tour info, and not to mention upon your arrival lemon fresh face/hand towels and a fabulous drink upon your check-in.

It is well located, and the “Waikiki Trolley” bus stop is only a stone’s throw away – literally 100m from the hotel’s front door step! The beach is parallel to the main road, and again, this is less than 200m from The Hotel Renew. The International Market Place is about a 10 minute walk from this hotel – however, an easy walk, with plenty of things to see along the way.There are a number of convenient stores within walking distance and lucky enough, there is one next door to the Hotel Renew.We did choose this hotel based on the Trip Advisor reviews and I must admit these are quite genuine reviews. I doubt you will be disappointed, as long as you’re after the key elements… definitely a nice find!HOTEL The Hotel Renew is a small boutique hotel. By the end of our 5-night stay, the front desk staff knew our name on a first person basis. There was one person I must commend and her name was Jackie; very friendly, very hospitable, and definitely a nice touch when you feel your stay is just “that little more personal” from them knowing who you are, rather than just another passing guest.The hotel is modern and unique – bearing in mind, it is small in comparison to the larger branded hotels. Our room rate included breakfast, and this was a light breakfast with the basics; bread, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, muffins etc. The breakfast area is within the main area of the foyer when you arrive, and there is probably seating for maximum 15 guests at any one time. My only tip would be to arrive early for breakfast, because this does get busy by 7.30-8AM and sometimes there is not enough seating. There are elevators within the property and easy access to your rooms.ACCOMMODATIONI believe we were staying in a King, City View Room.Somewhat small, however perfect for what we were after. The room is very modern, and air-conditioning is centralised. The room does have a large flat screen TV, and the bathroom was spacious.The hotel does offer wi-fi however this is very weak within the hotel. We did have an iPad and the connection kept dropping out when we were trying to search. We did mention this to the front desk, and they assisted by providing us print outs for where we were intending to go. If you do choose this property purposely for the wi-fi, unfortunately for our experience it did not work well for us – but this was not crucial for our stay.OVERALL THOUGHTSFrom our experience, we were more than satisfied with our stay. I had a work colleague whom had stayed here, which is where the original recommendation came from, followed by reading the reviews from Trip Advisor. The reviews for Hotel Renew are all quite similar, and you will know why when you stay… If you’re after a great place to stay and intend to spend most of your time outside of your room during the day, this is a nice, relaxing place, well located, at a very affordable price!",Sydney,24,5.0

We decided on this hotel because of the great rate, proximity to the beach, and the uniqueness of the ""boutique hotel"" atmosphere.

Every time we needed help, advice, or just wanted to see a friendly smile, we could depend on Adam. We recieved cooling, citrus scented towels and juice at the front desk to welcome us to the hotel. Our room was perfect. Very clean, comfortable, and the bed slept great! The sliding window shutters blocked out all sunlight!! What a way to snooze! :)We were very satisfied with this hotel and if we come back to Oahu in the future, we will definitely stay here. I encourage anyone visiting Hawaii to stay at Hotel Renew.

The staff is friendly, courteous, very helpful and reliable. Response to requests are almost instantaneous (eg.

It makes it feel that you are going home and seeing familiar faces ! You will never find this kind of atmosphere in the bigger hotels. You can pay bigger bucks and get lesser bang I am sure. We have stayed at numerous bigger hotels every year for the past four years and we must say Hotel Renew is our favourite.

I have done hours and weeks of research then decided to have all friends and family stay in Hotel Renew. It has great location (1 hotel away from the beach), modern look, friendly staff and clean rooms. Room: we had ocean view room on the 7th floor which was excellent! Great view, sheets are clean, bathroom are modern. The room might be a bit small but enough closet space to store all the clothing. But my friends who stay on the 2nd floor had bit weird smell in their room for some reason. Staff: The staff there is very friendly and accommodating. Adam who helped us with the luggages is the MOST friendly staff I have seen! He was very nice and patient, he was even able to pull all the luggages from our small Jeep Wrangler. Our stay at Hotel Renew was even more pleasant with his service.Location: It is next to Honolulu zoo which is end of Wakiki, but it's 1 min walk from the beach and still very close to all the busy section in Wakiki. Parking: they have valet parking for $25/day, hotel staff also told us about the self parking structure which is a block away for $10/day with unlimited in/out previlege which is great!Value: The rate of the hotel is consider really good with the factors that most hotels in Wakiki are old. It also has free wifi, compliemetry breakfast without any additional resort charge. Most of my friends are ok with the rate despite some still stayed at cheaper ones.

This hotel is a no-frills, comfortable, option for those who want to be in the center of Waikiki but need a bit of downtime. The room: Neutral tones, browns, beiges, whites throughout. Had a sliding door leading to lanai with chairs and table. Bathroom had clean modern design. Japanese sliding doors cover windows and it really blocks out that morning light. There's a desk, fridge, safe for valuables, bath products, phone, small closet, and a lounge chair.The hotel: They provide free boogie boards, and beach mats to guests. Upon check in they give you juice, and a hot towel. Continental breakfast is served from 7 to 9. Bar opens at 5:30pm. The interior has a sort of modern lodge design. Dark wood panels, black leather chairs. Location: Closer to the east end of Waikiki but still close to everything. I prefer if it were tucked away further away from the beach and away from the crowds. Since the hotel is pretty much surrounded by high rise hotels and the ocean view is quite limited, it doesn't matter if it's 2 blocks away from the beach. Overall: Check in was easy (they allowed me to check in early), the service was pleasant, the continental breakfast was sufficient, and the room was comfortable. The only negative I would mention is that the room wasn't as clean as I would expect upon arrival - specifically the bedding, and some hairs in the bathroom.If I ever end up in Waikiki again, I would consider Hotel Renew's calm oasis.","San Francisco, California",39,4.0

The price was OK for Waikiki, but it wasn't the chic little boutique hotel that I think it would like to be. There are no balconies, which can make an ocean view somewhat anti-climactic.

We booked a premier ocean view room and were located on the 8th floor (room 806). The hotels web site is one of the best I’ve seen but it would be even better if they didn’t use flash - that way I could access the sites useful info on my ipad as well. Booking was easy and email communication was excellent. What you see advertised on the web site is exactly what you get. It was one of the few hotels we found where it was better to book on the hotels web site rather than expedia, etc.I have included some photos but the hotel web sites photos are very accurate.After booking we emailed Renew saying we wanted to spend a day driving around the island. We gave them our preferences and they organised the rental for us through ‘Enterprise’. They even organised the free pick up for us from the hotel to the car rental premises and followed up with reminder notes on arrival and under the door the night before.We had cruised from Sydney and were spending the first night onboard the cruise ship. We had a morning tour planned and wanted to beat the crowds disembarking the next day so we rang the hotel and asked if we could drop our bags in that night. This was no problem for them and they were more than happy to store our luggage overnight. This gave us the opportunity of spending the first evening walking around Waikiki but more importantly, allowed us to beat the crowds and simply walk off the boat the next morning.On arrival we were treated to a lovely pineapple juice and a lemongrass scented, cool wet towel. We checked in at about 10am and our room was already available. We were due to be picked up for a tour but had to have a quick look at the room. Apart from the fact that our bags had already been delivered, the first thing we noticed was the beautiful ocean views. Blue skies, blue seas and palm trees, framed perfectly in the window – gorgeous! Our room had a side balcony which had partial views of Diamond Head to the left and the beach out front. The room was spacious; the bed was huge and very comfy. Overall, one of the nicest rooms we’ve stayed in.There was a lovely welcome letter along with two bottles of water and two platters. The first platter had a half pineapple that was scooped out and filled with fruit salad and the second platter had about half a pack of crackers plus two types of cheese. All of which were scrummy and it took us a couple of days to finish it all off.Lets see, there was a table and two chairs on the balcony, the room had a small fridge, iron, ironing board, large safe, complimentary robes, beach towels, toiletries, a laundry service, writing desk, speedy wireless internet plus ethernet outlets (network cables could be borrowed from reception, but I had my own), a large flat screen TV with free cable, mood lighting, A/C, hair drier, etc. Plenty of electrical outlets, I think I counted six. The bathroom was lovely as well. The shower was over the bath.We took advantage of the complimentary breakfast every day apart from when we had an early start for a Pearl Harbor tour. We had no problems with seating, but noticed some people had a wait of a couple of minutes some mornings. The free continental breakfast was basic but more than adequate. Cereals, toast, jams, pastries, fruits, yoghurt, etc. A nice touch was the fact that there were also take-away cups available. So if you wanted a quick start you could grab a few pastries and have your Kona coffee or tea “to go”.Location was perfect. Although at the Diamond Head end of the strip it is an easy walk to all of Waikiki and close to all transport. We walked up to Dukes one night, down to the Hau Tree another night and even to Ala Moana one afternoon.The hotel is beside the Aston which is a major pick up point for trolleys and tours. So on every tour we did, pick up and drop off was about 20metres from the Renew front door and TheBus stop was maybe 150m away. The beach is to the front of the Aston so, at a guess, I’d say it is about 100m away from the front door. As well as the location being very handy to the beach the hotel also provide complimentary beach towels, boogie boards, beach chairs and mats for guest use. And believe it or not, the hotel is right near an ABC Store – what are the chances?!Service could not be faulted. As soon as they see you coming they would rush to open the door for you and greet you by name. One day there was nobody stationed at the door and the concierge was standing inside near the counter, as soon as he saw us he literally ran for the door, I ran as well and when I beat him to it he was lost for words and looked completely dejected. The concierge and staff were most helpful with bus timetables, tour info, etc. Housekeeping was efficient and unobtrusive. The room was always spotless (before we fell into it each night that is). One evening I needed to transfer some files from a CD to a thumb drive but had left my laptops DVD drive at home. I went down to reception and the attendant lent me his own laptop so I could transfer the files.The breakfast area serves as a bar at night. Most evenings we were out but did manage drinks a couple of times. The first time we missed happy hour by about 60 minutes but because the barman hadn’t seen us there before he gave us drinks at happy hour pricing. The cocktails were lovely and they were very generous on the spirits. There was a good selection of local and imported beers. From memory happy hour cocktails were $6.50 and beers were $4 and maybe a dollar or so dearer outside of happy hour.On our last night we found a hand written thankyou note along with three chocolates on the bed. Service wise, they did not miss a beat. All staff were always helpful and happy.Shortcomings. The overall experience was brilliant so these are being a bit picky – plus some might be considered good things. No tea/coffee facilities in room and no mini bar. The mood lighting was lovely but I could have done with a bright reading lamp by the bed. The aircon fan was a little loud when it cycled in and out but on the one night it bothered us we simply turned it off. I also noticed a lack of drawer space for those people who like to unpack their bags completely. If bright lights, lobby shops, crowds and hotel swimming pools are your thing I’d suggest you stay elsewhere but after having been completely spoiled for a week I wouldn’t consider staying anywhere else in Waikiki than the Renew Hotel.","Sydney, Australia",143,5.0

Renew is located at the far end of the Waikiki strip, about a block from the water.

Their warm staff, amazing attention to details (chilled juice & lemongrass infused hand towels to refresh you upon check-in, lovely complimentary continental breakfast every morning), plus the relaxing atmosphere and beautiful spa-like rooms are, alone, enough to make a guest rave about this hotel!However, one thing stands out above all the other amazing things at this establishment: Hotel Renew has absolutely impeccable customer service standards.My first night at the hotel there was a problem in my room (double-occupancy, City-View, 2nd floor) with a very loud a/c unit. Being Hawaii, it was too warm to leave off for long, so, I tried to live with it thinking I'd get used to the noise. However, by morning I was exhausted after a restless night. A quick call to the front desk brought the day manager to my room, where she politely listened to the clanging a/c and my request to possibly have it fixed while I was out for the day. She extended apologies on behalf of the hotel and left to find out what could be done, returning the following solution in minutes:Hotel Renew relocated me to a new room and, in gracious apology for the inconvenient noisy/sleepless night and moving all my work gear, they upgraded me to a tranquil 7th floor Full-Ocean View room at no additional charge!Needless to say I was surprised and delighted with the resolution, not to mention thrilled that everything was handled quickly, pleasantly and with friendly smiles by all.

We asked about nearby and cost-effective self-parking, and the staff graciously provided information and did not give us a hard time about not valet-parking.

The rooms are a bit small, but we found our room to be large enough for a couple for a few days (a family may want to consider opting for more than one room). The furnishings are updated and the decor is tasteful. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet.The breakfast was the best breakfast we had on our trip. It sometimes can be hard to find healthy options at a continental breakfast -- Hotel Renew did not disappoint. Breakfast included fresh fruit, yogurt, healthy cereal, toast, muffins, juice and (good) coffee.

The hotel is small but boy does it make up for it in so many ways. I have to start by praising the amazing staff!!!! I read one review about rude staff on here and was a little concerned. That is not the case at all. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect!!!! Every time you walk in the door they will have it open with a smile. The lobby is very modern and cool. On our first night in they had a cocktail hour where we enjoyed tropical complimentary drinks. Really gets the vacation started off right. In our room they had put a wonderful bottle of champagne with a card from the hotel. The rooms are set up to relax you! The light feature is so cool. You can control all lights in the room right from your bed. The beds are amazing!!! There is an in room safe which I did not think much about until I went next door to our friends at the Aston and realized 1 they had to pay for their safe and 2 it was much smaller. There is a fridge in the room for drinks and food. I recommend getting an Ocean view if possible. If you can't swing that try to go up a few floors. It can be a little loud in the mornings in the lower room. Of course with a time change you may be up at 3 am anyways! :) The breakfast is not huge but great to get you going in the morning. Always great fresh fruit, cereal, and some pastries. They have everything you need for the beach as well. Check out all the toys when you get there. It's about 100 yards to the beach so you can grab your stuff and head right out the door. If you rent a car the valet prices may catch you off guard a bit at $25 a day. But when it takes all of 30 seconds to get your car it really makes it worth it. Nothing like Vegas and 30 minute wait times. I don't think I can say enough about the amazing staff and fun hotel. It really is great! If you need to be on the water and are used to having a huge lobby you may not like it but I have never felt more at home on vacation on my life.

We had also read about it in a travel book, which had some inaccuracies that disappointed us (no DVD player in the room, no leis upon check out, and valet parking had gone up to $25 a night, making the good price of the room moot). We had an ocean view room, which was beautiful. A lot of times when hotels say ""ocean view"" that means if you lean over your balcony, you can see the ocean. Here it means, you have a window-wide view of ocean AND beach from your room. The bed was comfortable. The hotel was very European feeling to us. We enjoyed being close to the action in Waikiki and close to the beach. The breakfast each morning was a nice touch. It is crowded for the duration (we tried different times), but never such that you can't find a seat as everyone is in and out rather quickly. We also enjoyed happy hour at the bar most evenings. They make a delicious mai tai. I can't quite put my finger on why this isn't a five star review. Like the title of my review says, I would ""probably"" stay again rather than definitely is because I never felt like the hotel was really interested in my business. Even when we asked questions about various things (locations of restaurants, directions), it seemed like the staff either didn't know, or didn't really want to tell us anything, while everyone else we encountered in Hawaii was anxious to talk with us about what we were doing, eating, etc. You'd think the people in the tourism business would feel the same way. At any rate, if I couldn't find a better deal elsewhere, I would stay here again. But I'll definitely look into other options first. I'd put an asterisk by my ""Yes, I'd recommend this hotel to a friend.""","Atlanta, GA",23,4.0

It is not one of the big hotels that you would typically find in Waikiki, but rather a small, renovated hotel with a Zen theme, lots of great personal touches, and attentive, friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is located at the east end of Waikiki near the Honolulu Zoo and about a block from the beach. You will love this location if you're looking to be close to the action but not in the middle of it, yet still a couple minute walk from the beach. We had a city view King room, which was on the side of the hotel that faced the north and was next to an alley that was home to several hostels and and ABC store. The room itself was very clean and comfy, w nice Zen touches and energy saving lights. We had a flat screen TV, free WiFi, safe, and refrigerator. Even though the room was a little small, it was well laid out and had plenty of room for suitcases, clothes, etc. There was an AC unit underneath the window, which we kept on most of the time since the weather was pretty warm even into the evening in February. A continental breakfast is offered every morning - a combination of pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal/granola, fruit, juice and coffee. Nothing fancy, but it was the perfect way to start the day and was tasty. There aren't too many places to sit in that area, but luckily we always managed to find a table when we went. At night, this area turns into a cool bar. We did get one drink while we were there....it was a yummy, strong Mai Tai made by a bartender who was really cool and friendly to talk to (sorry I can't remember her name!). The rest of the staff that we came in contact w during our stay were all fabulous! Everyone was always so helpful and greeted you w a smile. They helped us w restaurant recommendations, directions, reserving a rental car through Enterprise, and with the complimentary beach chairs/mats and towels we requested each day we went to the beach, which was a great amenity! All this for a really good price that was alot cheaper than the other hotels in the area. And since we were so close to the beach, we really didn't miss having a pool there at the hotel...why use a pool when you have all that beautiful beach a minute away!My only ""complaint"" was the noise that we would hear from the alley in the early morning hours. Garbage trucks would come empty the bins there in the alley, not every day, but most days. Luckily this would only last a few minutes, and if we had the AC on, we would hear this faintly, so it really wasn't an issue for us. One night one of the hostels was having a party, so that was a bit of a bother, but luckily it didn't last too long, and again having the AC on really helped.Overall, we would definitely stay at the Hotel Renew again!","Los Angeles, California",13,4.0

I got a great deal on Priceline otherwise I might have been priced out of this place. They provided great service and the little extras that make a hotel worth coming back to. Free beach towels, beach mats and beach chair rentals. A filling continental breakfast. A daily happy hour was a good deal and on Thursdays they have appetizers. The bartender gave me and my girlfriend each a free blue Hawaiian. Their fridges were big enough to stock up on booze and snacks from the store. We had an incredibly comfortable king size bed which made up for the view of the parking lot. They also have a hospitality room you can reserve to use and freshen up before your flight home. They are only a half block from the beach and that was food for us because it kept our room quiet. The only negative was the 25 dollar a night parking charge. Though it was probably comparable with other places I simply parked on the street and feed the meter in the morning since we were gone all day with the vehicle it made more sense to do it that way. I rented from VIP car rental around the corner for 3 days at 39 bucks a day made getting around the island a breeze. We were treated very well the entire time and I got great local food tips which helped us save money. (valet guy thanks for the heads up on the rainbow drive in).

But, I have to say that our (my wife, 3 year old son and I) stay at the Renew for 5 nights in late November was just fantastic. In my opinion, the best part of the place lies with the hotel staff. The concierge and other front desk employees were very friendly and incredibly helpful. The hotel is roughly a block, if that, from Waikiki Beach and the price is so much better than many of the other hotels in the area. The room was very nicely decorated with a modern and functional look to it, had a flat screen TV and a small fridge. Wifi worked great throughout the hotel, so that was a plus. And the breakfast, though basic (muffins, cereal, yogurts, etc), was a great way to start each day.There is an ABC convenience store right next door. But then again, there seems to be an ABC store at every corner if not half block in Waikiki. So you can fill up on basics there for snacks and what not. Bonus treat.

Service here is exceptional - from the front desk to the valet parking guys... top notch. They went above and beyond to adjust my reservation to prevent me from having to change rooms midway although I had two separate bookings. The lobby is small and dark, much like the rest of the hotel. Mood lighting accents guest rooms, hallways, etc. My 7th floor room was small but comfortable, outfitted with ultramodern dark brown/white decor, lighting, fixtures and furniture, creating a simple mix of light and dark which is both cerebral and relaxing. View was just okay, but I hadn't intended to pay for an ocean or Diamond Head view, so I was looking out at some nearby apartments. Who comes to Waikiki to look out their window anyway? Get out and experience it, don't just try to absorb it through the view from your room! Location is very good... steps from Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Wolfgang Pucks, with tons of restaurants and bars within a short walking distance. Also within 100m is Kapiolani Park with its great running paths, and the decent sandy beach, where you can watch beach volleyball or laze around in the sun. If you're a fitness fanatic, check out 24hr fitness a few blocks down. Tell them you are moving to Hawaii and that you want to try out their gym on a free 7-day trial basis. Oh, make sure to get online and register for the 7-day trial. Free gym for 7 days, who can say no to that? I gave the location 4/5 because you're kind of on the east end of Waikiki, so you've got quite a walk to most areas. I gave the rooms 4/5 because the bathtub was sub-par compared to the rest of the thoughtful design. The sink and mirror are very cool, like someone put some thought into it... but the tub is just a standard old sliding glass kind from the 1970s, back when the average tourist weighed 150lbs... far too small to be comfortable for most today. Bed is very comfortable... my wife is a big comfy bed freak and she was happy here. I ended up paying about $160/night plus taxes and another $25 for valet parking (free in/out) so it ended up being a very good deal for Hawaii/Waikiki. Continental breakfast consists of yogurt, granola, fresh fruit, toast, muffins, croissants... they have soy milk and coffee too. Enough to get the day going, but there's a reason why it's free. Ah yes, complimentary wi-fi, where other hotels charge $25-$40/day! Big plus. Oh yes, garbage pickup WILL start at 5am... you may hear the trucks. Sorry, but this is Waikiki, thousands of tourists generate tons of trash. Would you rather that they just left the trash in place or that they pick it up in the middle of the day as you are walking to the beach? Just deal with it, like you would in any large city.

The most magical place to go snorkeling (we have the Great Barrier Reef) Hawaii has Hanuama Bay. Take a picnic lunch and absorb natures beauty at its best. (And sunscreen)We also went to the North Shore which is a beautiful drive with some quaint little shops in Haleiwa (pronounced Haleiva). But the winner for me was horseriding on the beach and seeing the turtles popping their heads out of the water. Truly magnificent.My husband and I often talk about our holiday and when we will go back to Hawaii and where will we stay next time.

It is adult oriented meaning a better place for a couple than a family with lots of children. It is quiet and comfortable, well decorated and immaculate. The hotel staff is extremely helpful and friendly. We had a leak in the air conditioning system the first day we were there and it was repaired within an hour. The location is at the end of Waikiki and a block off the main road, so you are removed from a lot of foot traffic and noise. You can get a beach chair and towels from the staff and walk down to one of the more uncrowded areas of the beach in just a few minutes. There is no swimming pool but did you come to Hawaii to sit by a pool? The morning continental breakfast and the evening ""happy hour"" are very nice touches and add to the boutique atmosphere of the hotel. We had a rental car and the valet service was extraordinary. We would call down and by the time we got downstairs in the elevator the car was usually there. That brings me to the one downside, if there is one - all parking is valet and the drop off is a small area and occasionally you get tour buses or in our case the crew of Hawaii Five-0 taking up the space in front of the hotel. No worries - here is what you can do - pull into the drive way to the parking lot and just give your keys to the valet and if he is not there just go inside and give the keys to the desk clerk they will take care of everything!! As for restaurants there are plenty in easy walking distance and when you get up at the crack of dawn (you will if you arrive from the states because of the time difference) there is a Starbucks down the street and around the corner that opens at 4:30 AM. We loved our experience there and after staying at some of the larger hotels - notably the Hyatt and the Hilton - we would prefer the Hotel Renew for its' peaceful ambiance and cozy nature.","Keller, Texas",28,5.0

Hotel Renew is at the south end of Waikiki, near the zoo, about half a block off the beach, so removed from the hustle and bustle, but still close enough for easy access to everything. The hotel staff were terrific, very accommodating, informative and always friendly. The breakfast every morning was perfect for us (not being big eaters) and everything was well supplied. The room was nicely furnished, the bed and pillow some of the best I've slept on. Since our room had no view and looked out on an alley on the side of the hotel, it was a bit claustrophobic for spending much time in during the day. That wasn't a problem for us though as we were out and about all the time. We walked everywhere except for taking the city bus one day to Pearl Harbor. The variety of restaurants in the area was plentiful and we never had to succumb to touristy places, other that our need for Starbucks. The only drawback to this hotel was some street noise. We aren't big lovers of air conditioning so we had it turned off in our room the entire stay and had the window open. Every night about 3AM there seemed to be a lot of activity out in the alley. We could never figure out if it was tourists making their way back to their hotels after the bars closed or if it was some shift change in the hotel staffs. It wasn't awful but it did wake us every night. I think if we had had our air on, it would have provided enough white noise to drown it out.Wouldn't recommend this hotel to families, as the rooms are smaller and there is no pool or much to keep the kids entertained. But for singles or couples of any age, this place is perfect.","Seattle, Washington",47,5.0

We couldn't shut it off as it was encased in a wooden structure. There were sleek modern finishes like the pictures showed, but it didn't all come together - like they used up their budget renovating too quickly. I suppose our view of a parking garage would change with a higher price, but I don't think the room would.

There was some slight hallway noise in the morning. The bed was a king and was very comfortable as were the pillows. There were no problems with the elevators at all. Where this hotel shines is in its styling and its staff service. Both are exceptional. The hotel lobby is small where it hosts its breakfast and evening happy hour.

Hotel Renew is the antithesis of what you might expect in Honolulu. It's a Japanese inspired Zen retreat rather than a resort with the big amenitiesDAY 1: I was greeted with a lemon grass infused cool cloth to wip off my travel grime and a glass of fresh pineapple juice. Large rocks with water somehow skimming over the top hold tropical flowers but add the Zen like quality. The backdrop of the reception desk is covered in small river rocks in shades of gray. The whole color scheme is earth tones (grey, black, brown, white, pops of red/orange.) Shapes are sleek and long. My room again continues the color scheme and structure. The feather bed is on a platform and is COM FY. If you don't like feathers you can remove it and use the other mattress underneath. The desk chair is while leather , rocking back and forth as I keep my mind interested in what my task is at hand. The carpet is unique. It's like black waves. The windows look out over a couple of hostels that get a bit loud at night, but settle down after a while. You can shut them out for the most part by closing the shoji screens. The closet holds 2 kimono robes, a tower to stack towels or shoes and a safe that you can set. The bathroom has a door with dimmed glass allowing additional light to enter. The bathroom is beautiful but not as functional for me as it might be for my husband. The sink is square but there is only about 4 inches on either side to put my things. There is a multi leveled shelf to put bags and irons, but I like to lay mine out and this does not have the room. Is it that big of a deal? NO. I don't mind really since I'm alone. The shower is great and kind of cool too. It's the touches I like. The rock on the towel, the water in bowl in the drawer. (I'm not sure why?) Maybe it collects water from the air. But it smells good. I LOVE the big seat bench with drawers I could lay my suitcase there as well as hang things without making the room see too cluttered. They have a shoe basket to catch flip flips and anything that you might want to keep the floor clean. I kept my purse and laptop in the free safe too. One final touch...2 big beach towels ready to head to the beach. DAY 2 The day started with breakfast consisting of yogurts, unusual pastries, cereals, fresh fruit, and coffees. Our desk guy recommended a snorkeling group and it was fabulous. They let me take a mat, bath towels, and beach chair borrowed. There's happy hour with 5$ drinks and are made well. Apples, newspapers, and games are ready for the takers. I need recommendations for dinner and the gentlemen suggested Ono's Hawaiian Food. It's close, you could walk, and it's authentic local food. It's a mom and pop place. It's different food and don't expect it to be fancy. It's kind of a kitchy in a good way. People stand outside for up to an hour waiting for one of the 8 tables. If you go there, look at as an adventure in food and culture rather than a star rating. If you get poi, ask for the fresh. Otherwise you won't like it. I mixed it with my pork and it was fine. I was pleasantly surprised by our hotel's guest concierge and their willingness to go above and beyond in this little thing. They printed a map, circled it and found a rating to go with it. They also found comparisons for two luaus we were considering. They know the bus routes to go, etc. They know their stuff.CONS : Thin walls (heard more that I wanted to with a couple having some fun!), I took care of this with my sound machine. No outside noise now., no pool/spa area or fitness center (although is it necessary really?). I don't have a view except Diamond Head, if I stand in my tub. I could get the good view if I paid for it, Hostels behind it. It didn't get very loud and they went in early. I wish they vacuumed down along the floorboards all over the room and down the hall. There's a lot of sand and I see it.. This isn't a big con but I think some freshening of nicks in the paint should be taken care of. I still feel like the room is clean.PROS: Price, location, small boutique style. serene rooms, friendly beyond what I see in other hotels, nice amenities, end of the crazy strip, lots of bus stops stop here, ABC across the street, free WI FI, free safe, small bar with cheap drinks, comfy bed, chick bathroom, kimonos, lots of storage, no bugs (I checked all over the place), wide screen tv mounted on wall.","Fort Wayne, Indiana",77,4.0

There is no way this hotel is worth the price it charges - not even a third of it.It is located at one end of Waikiki beach (ie not central) and is not at the beach front. We paid for an ""ocean-view"" room and were extremely disappointed when the ocean view was only very limited as it is viewed through the gap between two taller buildings (check the location of the hotel - which we didn't - and you will see there is no way you will get a full ocean view). If the hotel were honest, it should have stated a ""partial ocean view"" on its website like many other reputable hotels in the area did.Our room was supposed to come with a balcony and the so-called ""balcony"" was only fit for drying clothes and does not even face the ocean. So the ""view"" can only be seen through small windows which offer no privacy since it is in full view of the rooms from the other two taller adjacent hotels.The room is very small and the design is only ordinary at best. The toilet is small too and does not come with the usual amenities. For the price you pay, they even have the audacity to charge $4 for the bottled water in the room and $22 for valet parking.The walls are also extremely thin and you would be woken up by the loud voices of the housekeeping staff early in the morning. Breakfast was again very disappointing with very little to offer (and in a very cramped space too). As mentioned by earlier reviews, there is also no swimming pool.All in all, this is a TOTAL rip off and in no way deserves its ranking on Trip Advisor. Just check around the higher-grade hotels in better locations on Waikiki beach and you will know what I mean. We stayed only for one night and moved to an international-chain hotel which offers a much better location, high-floor full ocean view , a much bigger/nicer room, free parking, free water, free calls etc - all at a price 30% lower than Hotel Renew.",Singapore,14,1.0

We chose Hotel Renew because we had so many things planned for the last four days in Hawaii (Lost Tour, trip to Pearl Harbor, shopping, Luau, etc.) and figured we wouldn't be spending much time in the hotel itself. We knew the rooms would be small, and we knew that there was no pool but we figured since it was so close to the beach we wouldn't miss having a pool.Well, unfortunately, my fiance and I came down with pretty bad colds towards the end of our trip and while we were able to still do all the planned activities, when nighttime rolled around, all we wanted to do was relax in our hotel room. Unfortunately, the rooms there are far too small to just ""hang out"" in. We had an ocean view room, so the view was quite lovely, but far too cramped to do much else other than sit in bed and watch tv. A few nights we ordered dinner in (you have to find restaurants in the area that will deliver since this place has no room service) and one of us had to eat in bed while the other ate sitting at the desk in front of the bed. Not very romantic. I thought we wouldn't miss having a pool, but we did. I thought that we wouldn't miss having a lanai off of our room, but we did. I thought we wouldn't miss having room service, but we did. Hotel Renew is supposed to be known for their service, but honestly, there was nothing special about it and was a lot slower than any other place I have been to. We had to wait two hours for towels once to take a shower. We requested for a food delivery menu to be brought to us, and after a good twenty minutes of waiting, my husband just went down to get one himself. Would I recommend this hotel to someone? Yes, but only if they don't plan on spending much time here. It is a good value if you are looking for a bed and bathroom only, because in all other aspects, it is lacking. It is beautifully decorated and very clean, but I'm not sure that makes up for the small size of the rooms and the lack of amenities.

Although requests are not guaranteed, Hotel Renew gave us the BEST room in the hotel; in fact, it was said that this was the same room that the owner stays in during his visits. So you can imagine its beauty. Ocean view King with a balcony, just one block away from the beach. Simply gorgeous!  The only thing that surpassed the beauty and modernistic style of Hotel Renew was the friendly and attentive service that we received from the entire staff. From the front desk all the way down to housekeeping, everyone was pleasant and exudes an attitude that they enjoy their job. By the end of our 7 day stay, we practically knew everyone by first name. And Jackie, wow! She was nothing short of amazing! She gave us suggestions for dinner, called to make us reservations at Roy's, and even mentioned to them that we were celebrating our engagement. The food was delicious and the waitress surprised us with a complimentary dessert at the end of our meal congratulating us. If that wasn't enough, Jackie even told my fiancé where to take me to see the most beautiful Hawaiian sunrise. Talk about romantic!

That started the trip off on a sour note and Grace was unhelpful and unapologetic about the bountiful charges which included $22/day for valet parking (you have no other option but that's the case in most of Waikiki). So much for the aloha spirit...The rooms are tiny and cramped and we all bumped our knees multiple times on the shaved-off corners of the beds. The mattresses are cheap and flimsy and we found stains on our sheets several nights even after requesting fresh linens.The free Wi-Fi internet is SO SLOW. It literally took 15 freaking minutes to load gmail and we gave up trying to research places to eat on yelp online due to the terrible, weak, slow connection.The hotel location is convenient, at the far end of Waikiki, and it's a block away from the beach.

One small caveat, our oceanview room faced Tiki's restaurant at the Aston hotel next door- they play loud music in the morning and night which is sometimes annoying, but really not Renew's fault. The entire Waikiki strip is loud so it's almost to be expected. The hotel is just a short walk from the beach and the front desk staff kindly provide all beach gear and fresh towels, which is convenient.

The location was excellent, only a half block to the beach and “the strip”. We also enjoyed the convenience and “beyond-fast-food” options via the Wolfgang Puck’s Express for dining which was just out the door at the Aston on the way to the beach. The Hotel Renew staff was truly exceptional, one of the best we’ve ever encountered in our travels. Beach gear (mats, beach chairs, fluffy towels, etc) were free for checkout every day.Breakfast was free and ready every day from 7A – 9:30A. It consisted of a mix of terrific Kona coffee, cold cereals, yogurts, toast (the only “hot” item), fresh fruit, and mediocre pastries. The selection was the same every day, so after one week it grew old, but since we are not big breakfast eaters and it was included we won’t complain too much, other than the fact that if they ran out of pastries at 8:45A they did not replenish them and you were out of luck. There were only five 2-person tables available so you may eat standing up or take the items back to your room if you are not the first in line. They had hot water in a thermos available throughout the day in that area, but it was not available prior to 7AM when we were up early for bus tours and had our own instant Starbuck’s coffee available. A microwave to warm the pastries would be a plus, as well as one in the room for hot water and “whatever”. The fridges in the room kept your drinks cool at 45 or so, but not cold. Making an ice bucket out of one of the trash cans worked well for a few beers and/or wines.The house keeping staff was superb and the rooms were very well kept. The overall design of the rooms and facilities was ultra modern. Some areas were showing wear such as the scars at the elevator entries, as well as the baseboard edge dust in the rooms the vacuums could never reach.Parking is valet-only and pricey, but typical of the “big city”. In fact, the valet parking cost more than the car rental! The valet staff was exceptional, and your car would be typically ready in less than a minute after your request so we didn’t mind the cost in the end, enjoying the service.Free wi-fi was available in every room. The first day I clocked it at 4 mbps and it ran well. Other days were spotty and service was up and down and sideways. Overall, I guess it worked OK on average. I plugged my laptop power into an outlet under the desk, leaving the laptop running, but every morning it was low on power or dead. That’s when I figured out that the outlet was turned off via bedside controls at night, and you had to specifically turn that outlet back on after turning out the lights!We got some great rates via our 7-day stay and “old folks” discount online, making the Hotel Renew one of the more affordable places on or near the beach to stay.

Though this place has some nice amenities, I would probably choose a different place to stay next time. The good:Hotel Renew has an excellent location about a block away from Waikiki beach. It's nothing to look at from the outside (and in fact is easy to miss if you're driving by and not looking carefully), but it's very nicely decorated inside with modern furnishings. The staff at the front desk was first rate, remembering my name, helping me with a few little troubling details, making suggestions that turned out to be right on target. I felt like an honored and valued guest, something that is often elusive. The complimentary breakfast was adequate to get me going, its presentation a notch above that of many chain hotels.  The not-so-good:In their desire for trendy decor, the designers in my opinion went too far, sacrificing practicality. To wit, if I had not had a flashlight I would not have been able to adequately see the face of the closet safe nor the controls for A/C and lighting. The room is well lighted in places, but darkness prevails much too much. The desk area had what appeared to be a lamp, but I could not figure out how to turn it on, and so the area was too dark. Then there's the chair in front of the desk. It looks cool, but in fact it was so low that I needed three pillows to be even modestly comfortable using my laptop at the desk. Finally the deal-breaker that would prevent me from recommending this place or going back: A moldy or musty odor in the bathroom. All surfaces appeared to be clean, and there is creative lighting there. But this odor was an unmistakable sign of neglect. This is really too bad, because the hotel has gone to considerable trouble to create an attractive place.",Seattle,89,3.0

Staff and the hotel were pleasant, however a few gripes--there was no Internet on my floor for the entire two days I was there--and since I was there on a business trip, this was a HUGE drawback. I had to sit in the small lobby for several hours at a time to work. Even after numerous complaints to the front desk and even talking for the tech company that does this for the hotel, it took them two days to fix the problem, which happened as I was about to check out. While staff was pleasant, they appeared helpless, and didn't offer to take off anything of the room charges. The room itself is well furnished, and well decorated. However, the space it tight, and if you are looking to as much as do a morning stretch, you're a bit out of luck (I stayed in a room with two double beds).

Our first trip was spent on a resort, so while planning this year we decided to try something simple. We got exactly what we wanted from Hotel Renew. This is a great location for a couple on vacation who just want some peace and quiet (and a short walk to the beach). The room was a perfect fit for the two of us. Our view wasn't great, but we opted for the city view and got exactly what we paid for. We looked out to the hostel next door, although it wasn't the greatest view we didn't mind because the room had screens that slide over and block the window completely (also great for afternoon naps if you like it dark). Who needs a view anyway when you are so close to the beach? We loved the quick walk to swimming, sand and sun! Just a bit farther of a walk and you are by all the stores and restaurants. It's a great location.I would also like to mention that the staff at Hotel Renew were more than helpful through our stay. A quick thanks to Jackie, for such a great suggestion for a salon and hairstylist.

Stylish and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and well laid out. The beds too are comfortable. It's a nice touch having down pillows, as well as a down comforter. But the best of it is the down mattress top. Very nice touch! All in all, the ambience of the room made relaxation quite easy. A hotel, however, does not stop at the rooms.The hotel lobby has had a large amount of thought put into it, and it shows. The front desk, though small is perfectly adequate for the needs of the facility. It being a boutique hotel, the Hotel Renew does not require a large and mostly wasted space there. The big find is in the breakfast nook. It also doubles as the hotel lounge at night. Though at times a bit crowded, the hotel has done a marvelous job with this space. The continental breakfasts there are quite good. The coffee is stellar, as is the fresh fruit each day. Additionally, the lemon water found there during the day is quite refreshing. At night, when it becomes the lounge, the setting is intimate and inviting. Additionally, the hotel's being one block from the beach is actually to its benefit. You don't see the panhandlers and pushy salesmen that you find on Kalakaua.All of the above do not make for a great hotel, but merely a good one. What Hotel Renew does that makes it great is in its personnel. Let's start with the housekeeping crew. Our housekeeper was amazing. She was friendly and cheerful, and seemed ready to assist us with anything we asked. She thanked us for choosing the hotel and offered her wishes that we return. Each time we saw her, she always had a smile on her face, and greeted us warmly. It was like having another grandmother, only nicer!The bartender too was a sweet as she could be. My wife and I enjoyed talking with her. She was friendly and upbeat at all times, and made the most amazing Mai Tai's. We really enjoyed chatting with her. It was like meeting a long lost friend. She's a true gem.The parking valet's as well were great. Quick with getting our car for us, they often asked if we would need the car later in the day. They were all friendly and cheerful as well. Top that with efficiency, and you have a well oiled machine.The best I've saved for last. The front desk supervisor, Jackie, is the best hotel person we have ever seen. Jackie was courteous and efficient, and always had a ready smile. Her ability to effectively multi-task is a rare trait, but to do it as well as she can is amazing. Hotel Renew's real challenge will be to keep others from hiring her away from them. My wife would be the first to try, should she ever decide to move to Dallas.My wife and I have both traveled extensively, both nationally and internationally, and have never before stayed in a better hotel. We may have stayed in ""nicer"", but not by far. When you combine the amenities that Hotel Renew offers, along with its amazing employees, you get a great hotel. After days and evenings filled with shopping, exploring, and ocean therapy, this is the kind of hotel everyone should get to come back to. Congratulations to Hotel Renew and its outstanding team.","Dallas, Tx",31,5.0

While the room was small (or cozy as my travel companion would say :)), the hotel made up for it with their helpful staff.Of utmost importance to me is cleanliness. I was very impressed. Each day not only did our room attendant thoroughly prepare our room, but he/she adapted to our needs. For instance, we didn't want the comforter on the bed so after noticing this, she/he no longer put the comforter on the bed; or we wanted our shoes in a certain spot; or the computer set up in a certain way. While initially they were moved because it was probably easier to clean, again, the person adapted to our likes and dislikes. The room is modern and the bathroom has all the amenities you would need; however, if there is a negative, the a/c unit is way too close to the bed. There were many a nights I was too cold and had to turn it off only to be too warm again. I tried adjusting the a/c, but couldn't quite find the right comfort level for both of us. If the unit wasn't right next to the bed, I am sure this would have made a difference. However, we made it :).You're a stone's throw away from the beach and within walking distance of shops and smaller scale eateries. Also, I would HIGHLY recommend the scooter company right around the corner on Lemon Road. Their company is Hawaiian Style Rental and Tours. We rented scooters for three days of our stay and absolutely loved it. It was a great, economical way to get around the island and this company is great. They provide a scooter, a brief training session (we didn't need one as we have ridden scooters in the past), helmets and great rates. Since we were repeat customers, we were even given a discount. Also, one of our scooters seemed to be burning a lot of gas and when we brought it back, they refilled it at no cost to us. They're friendly, helpful and when and if I go back to Waikiki, even if I stayed further away from this company, I would still use them.While I would probably stay at another hotel if I were to travel back to Waikiki, I would highly recommend Hotel Renew. The only reason I may (and that's a big maybe as it's a great hotel) not stay there is because I would want some of the amenities that the larger hotels offer (gym...business center...etc.). That's it. If these don't interest you, please stay at the Hotel Renew. You will enjoy it.","Washington, DC",4,4.0

Fortunately, I found another hotel in Waikiki. One that was a block from the beach and had an ocean view! Due to my work, I am not without limits budget wise, so I was greatly surprised that the price of my room was well within my budget with an ocean view! When I pulled up to Hotel Renew, not being a frequent HI visitor, I had trouble finding parking and inevitably parked illegally. I got my luggage and walked into the cool interior of the lobby area. When I say cool, it fits that description in all ways with the exception of how friendly and helpful the staff were. I was greeted and helped immediately. My car was retrieved from its illegally parked place by the valet. I had incorrectly booked my room and the desk attendant found a room that would be available for my entire trip without me having to sacrifice the ocean view. This was all done while I sipped a pineapple beverage that I was given. Very soon, I was checked in and off to my room. My room was gorgeous. I had a large and very comfortable bed, a large LCD TV, a deck, a great ocean view, a small fridge and wifi access. I loved it and I called a few people to brag about the place as well as sending pictures, too. The hotel bar was open each evening, so I went down for happy hour. The hotel bar is intimate in size and detail. I was greeted by a lovely bartender, Jacqueline, who greeted me and introduced herself. She poured a great drink and answered all of my questions. I have to say that her recommendations were all fantastic. She also introduced me to the General Manager, Daniel Howry. I must say, that he made great conversation and gave unique and interesting ideas of things to see on the island, if I had the time. I looked forward to their input after my workdays there. I was blown away by the personal touches of Hotel Renew. I have, and will continue to sing the praises of Hotel Renew, its management, and its staff.

The centrally controlled lighting was also surprisingly convenient--being able to control the whole room from the side of your bed is very nice.

The location is GREAT.. 1 minute walk away from the beach, walking distance to restaurants, shops and sights. Some other reviewers have complained about the noise outside - which I think is the only downside to their location. There is a scooter/motorcycle rental company behind the hotel, which means if you have a 'cityview' room and are on a lower level, you will get a bit of noise. We knew this ahead of time, so we phoned and requested a room on a higher floor, further away from the sound. So because of that, we didn't have problems with noise. (I do live downtown in a big city, so perhaps I am just used to the noise as well.)The staff was friendly and helpful. The only problem we had was there was a musty smell in our room the first day. As soon as we brought that up to the front desk, they immediately had housekeeping in our room to fix the problem. Apparently it was the air conditioner, so they had it cleaned and wiped down and after that the musty smell was gone. I was impressed by their promptness in addressing our issue. I thought the breakfast every morning was great! It was exactly what we needed every morning - some cereal, fruit and toast. The pineapple is delicious, I think I had a bowl of that every morning!

If you get there around that time there are a fair few options, however, it appears the buffet is only stocked once so if you arrive a little later, there will only be cereal and juice available. The real issue from my point of view was the airconditioning in the room. There is no central air conditioning, rather each room has one of the old fashioned individual units. When I turned mine on it sounded like there was a 747 landing in the room. I asked to have it checked but was told there was nothing the hotel could do. There is no way you could sleep with it on, and the traffic noise meant you couldn't sleep with the window open, so the only choice was to sleep with the airconditioning off and the window shut which made for a very very hot and stuffy room.

I have no idea how this hotel got to be no.2 in the list as I have stayed in 'boutique hotels' around the world and this is far away from being considered 'boutique'. A boutique hotel should be personal, sumptuous and leave you feeling like you've been looked after. I found Renew cold, dark and noisy.1. The view from my room window was of.... an electricity pylon (it was advertised as a city view)2. The bed was not a double as advertised, but a large single (luckily I was travelling alone!)3. The windows had no sound insulation whatsoever so I heard every single passing thing as if the windows were open.4. The aircon system was old, loud and had terrible temperature control5. The lighting in the room was so dark in the evening that I couldn't actually see what clothes were hanging in my wardrobe. There was a small, feeble light in the cupboard, but it was as much use as a pocket torch.6. The bedding was made up to a terrible standard and in my first night, I actually had to ask for a new duvet cover as it had not been changed.7. I asked reception for a change of room, but they said they were booked up bar another room, but demand extra payment if I wanted to swap. They then offered no other compensation to make up for my unhappiness.8. The cleaning staff in the morning were much nicer than everyone else in the hotel!9. The excuse of a breakfast is pretty dire for some place that wants to call itself a ""boutique"". Rubbish coffee, cheap juice and a few pastries does not make a boutique breakfast experience.Awful.

I liked the bathroom very much and bed was so comfortable. Also you can borrow beach towels, mats, chairs etc at the reception. Room size was OK. The lighting system was very nice and decorative. Would have appreciated light set in the main mirror though.The room was too dark in the evening. Asked the ""city biew with double"" and it comes with balcony with city/street and terrific ocean view (I was on the last floor).For those complaining about street noise : Waikiki is noisy , no matter where you stay. Just close the window/door, set the air conditioning and enjoy the silence...I would suggest they fix their internet connection. It was too slow (I have friends who stayed at other Honolulu hotels, and experienced the same problem), impossible to watch youtube videos.I would recommend this hotel for the solo traveler, couples, but not for families. I met solo travelers sometimes in the elevator/lobby and felt the hotel lacks somehow the ""gathering"", ""warm"" feeling that you expect when you go to Hawaii (and specially if you go alone, or with only a few friends). I know they have cocktails and happy hours but at checkin I was tired and didn't pay attention to what was said about that.

This was our first time visiting Oahu, and we were extremely impressed. The staff at Hotel Renew is friendly and helpful. Everyone from the valet to the cleaning staff went out of their way to say ""hello"" and ensure that we were having a pleasant stay. They set us up with a rental car (at a way cheaper price than anywhere else we found), printed out directions for us, and gave us recommendations on places to visit. When we had an extra charge on our bill for a night of valet parking, they cleared it up immediately. We were sad to say goodbye at the end!The rooms are fabulous. I've read reviews that they are on the smaller side, and I do not agree. The rooms are comparable to any hotel I've visited, and I had no trouble walking around. There is a big tile area at the beginning of each room with a bench and set of drawers that was very helpful when we came in from the beach all sandy and wet. The beds are comfortable and clean. My husband particularly enjoyed their air conditioning system-- it's easy to use and was very convenient during the muggy nights. We never had any problem with noises from Lemon Street even though our room was facing that direction. However, we generally used the airconditioning system instead of leaving the window open. The only issue I really had with the room was the lighting in the bathroom. There are two lights, but they are more like ambience lighting than functional light. We also enjoyed Hotel Renew's amenities. I loved the continental breakfast-- it was fresh and delicious and better than a basic continental. There is no hot food or meat available, but the bar area isn't designed for that kind of use. There are also plenty of breakfast restaurants on the block that you can enjoy if you need something heartier. The pineapple juice and cool towels they offered us was a sweet touch. The lemon ice water they had available in the lobby was delicious and refreshing. The lobby itself was so quiet and tranquil, for a few days my husband and I wondered if anyone else was staying in the hotel! It's definitely a relief after a long day at Waikiki.

The rooms represented on their website are just as they are in person and are very nice. The location is very close to Waikiki Beach and only separated from the waterfront by the Aston Waikiki Hotel. The hotel is within easy walking distance to any number of restaurants, hotels, ABC (convenience/gift stores), shopping/souvenirs, and designer stores and transportation. It was great to have the complimentary internet and in-room safe to store valuables. Just a hint for check-in, if you have a car, park at the front entrance door and the valet will take your car to their lot behind the hotel. Even though there is a ramp on the end of the hotel that says ""valet parking"" there is no one there or at the top of the ramp to assist you. The continental breakfast consisted of coffee, tea, fruits, toast, pineapple juice, pastries and cereals. While this is a nice added value, we didn't enjoy it much since it's not served until beginning at 7 a.m. Being early risers, we ended up walking to a restaurant each morning. Most other hotels we have stayed at start their breakfast by at least 6 a.m. There was some exterior noise, but since the hotels are in very close proximity to each other all throughout this area, I think you will get that to some degree wherever you stay. Take advantage of their Thursday eve reception and enjoy a ""Blue Hawaiian"" or two. This was a fun time and we got to meet some of the people who worked at, and guests at the hotel. If you are renting a car in Oahu, be prepared for TRAFFIC! No matter what day or time of day you drive, you will most likely encounter gridlock on the freeways and surface streets for at least a portion of your drive. Also be prepared for LOTS of people in this area. It reminded me of Times Square on the beach! My only advice for improvement to the hotel would be promptness. Have breakfast ready to serve at 7 a.m. sharp (earlier would be better), and have someone at the bar promptly and ready to serve on Thursday evening for the reception rather than waiting for the first guest to arrive.",Phoenix,18,4.0

The hotel decor is simple but modern; the bed is nice and plush; and best of all, we were able to upgrade to an oceanview room for just $20! The hotel is located at the end of the main drag in Waikiki, so it's pretty quiet. A little difficult to check-in, though. While we were able to find the hotel itself pretty easily, it was difficult to figure out where to park the car so we could check in. There is a small valet ramp right in front of the hotel, but there was no valet attendant when we arrived. With the one-way streets in Waikiki being what they are, it took a good 15 minutes for us to find our way back to the hotel to figure out where to leave the car. There's a manager's cocktail reception every afternoon, where guests are supposed to be able to enjoy cocktails and cheese and crackers while meeting some of the hotel's management staff. Great concept, but lacking in execution. When the bf and I went to the reception (which is in the tiny bar area of the hotel), we almost thought we had shown up at the wrong time. The two ""managers"" that were present did not greet us upon arrival, and just continued chatting with their friends about their plans for the weekend. It wasn't until we sat down at one of the tables for a good five minutes that one of them came to greet us. Even then, the other ""manager"" (who I think was just the hotel bartender) began complaining that she was only going to make Blue Hawaiians that day, and that she wouldn't make any modifications/substitutions whatsoever. She said that if anyone wanted anything else, they could just shove it. Not a great first impression, if you ask me. All in all, we had a wonderful stay at this hotel and would gladly return.

All of the rooms are very small including lobby and hotel room (we all had bruises from hitting our shins on the bed corners). The bathroom had been updated fixture wise but the tub was moldy and cracked where it met the wall on one side and there was no bathroom fan, meaning it was hot and humid in the bathroom after showers and there was mold on the ceiling and the paint was chipping off. We also couldn't figure out if the controls for the air weren't working or if the panel on the wall was broken. The walls were paper thin, we could hear everything.

I can safely say I wasn’t disappointed! Upon arrival my wife and I were greeted to a glass of fresh pineapple juice and cool scented towels each for refreshing while being checked in. The hotel lobby was nicely presented with a rock water fountain in the centre of the lobby.We had booked an Ocean View room which was quite expensive but the view was worth it. However, only a select few of the hotel rooms come with a balcony and those with ocean views so not which is slightly disappointing but not the end of the world. I had requested rose petals if possible to be sprinkled on the bed sheets as this was a honeymoon stay but what we got was even better. We received a bottle of champagne and a lovely handwritten note from the hotel congratulating us on our marriage and a thank you for choosing the hotel for our Honeymoon stay. A really nice touch which sums up the exquisite customer service offered by the hotel.The room itself apart from the lack of a balcony was nicely presented with a comfortable bed, superb view, air conditioning, large LCD TV and a lovely clean bathroom. There were also funky lighting control switches for various lighting moods in the room.Breakfast was an adequate selection of cereal, bread, fruit and yogurt etc., although depending on the time it may be difficult to get a seat but you can take it to your room if required. Once a week is a meet and greet at the bar where you will receive a complimentary cocktail. There is also a happy hour each night.The hotel also offers Free Wi-Fi although there is no terminal to check into flights etc. (you can do this in the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel next door for free).The hotel also offers complimentary beach equipment which I think is an excellent touch. You can have beach towels, chairs and a boogy board if required and when the beach is only across the road they will be well used!One word of warning however, is that the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel can have very loud music playing late at night and early in the morning at their pool.In summary the Hotel Renew offers a superior customer service than that of any hotel I’ve ever stayed at. The hotel is not the largest compared to others in Waikiki and this is why you get the personal attention. The hotel next door (Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel) is a much larger hotel and I believe having an Ocean View room with balcony and breakfast will be a cheaper alternative however, you will not get the personal service offered by Hotel Renew.","Belfast, United Kingdom",83,5.0

The staff were always happy to go out of there way to make us feel comfortable and with a minimum of fuss, the best service we've received at a hotel so far.Since Hotel Renew is rather new (at least it seems that way) all amenities and furniture are new and with modern styling (which I like). Rooms have large LCD TVs, comfy chairs and beds. The only criticisms I could make are that the toilet appears to be an afterthought in the bathrooms, as there is not much room around it; and that the air conditioning was rather smelly (but you get used to it after awhile). The hotel is described as a boutique hotel - it isn't as large as many of its competitors and consequently doesn't have things like a pool or gym on-site, however it does have a lot of other services on offer you'd expect from a quality hotel (e.g. a laundry service). They also provide complimentary Continental Breakfasts in the morning in their lounge (not to mention cocktails in the evening). A big plus for me (as I'm a geek) is that they have complimentary wi-fi (you'll find a lot of stuff in this hotel is complimentary - which is great when you don't want to worry about extra expenses). They can also arrange hire car for you at a discounted rate.The hotel is situated in Eastern Waikiki so it's about 15-20 minutes walk to Waikiki centre but it's only a minute's walk from the beach and nearby the Honolulu Zoo and Waikiki Aquarium. You also can catch the tourist trolleys at the nearby hotel, not to mention coach tours as well.What I liked best about this hotel is the special effort they put into accommodating honeymooners (which includes a 20% discount to the room rate) - I suppose the only thing I could fault is that the hotel maybe expensive if you don't get a special rate but there are so many packages to choose from (which often come with free stuff), you probably won't mind after experiencing the excellent service!",Australia,34,5.0

The price reflects that fact, the staff were very friendly. the rooms/bathroom and decor were very stylish, and there was free wi-fi, which is something much more expensive places don't offer. Parking is off-site (nearby Banyan hotel) which is slightly inconvenient but for only $10 a day I'm not complaining. I actually stayed at the Royal Hawaiian all week on business and wanted somewhere a bit less expensive to stay for the weekend while I did a bit of sightseeing. Renew was almost perfect for that. My one complaint was the street noise. We were on the 2nd floor, facing the apt building across the street. I would definitely request a room on a higher floor if you are a light sleeper.

The hotel is cozy and dimly lit throughout...no Hawaiian decor that may be typical of many hotels within the area. The staff is extremely friendly and very accommodating. Since it is a small hotel, guests are given a more personalized service.The hotel is only half a block from the east end of Waikiki where the beach is less crowded. If you're joining a tour, buses pick-up passengers in front of the Aston Waikiki Beach Resort, just a few steps away from Hotel Renew. Across from the hotel is a hostel (or maybe two, I think). There was, however, an incident as we were heading back to the hotel one night where two men got into a fist fight right in front of the entrance. We were afraid that guns might be drawn (hey, I'm from NY afterall!) that we had to duck into the ABC store. I was told that this sort of thing happens quite a bit!Our room was on the third floor and had a view of the hostel across the way. We didn't mind the lack of view at all since we were only in our room to sleep in at night. As some guests have reviewed, you do hear the trash being collected early in the morning. So if you're an extremely light sleeper, this may not bode well for you. Maybe the higher floors are quieter.We had 2-double beds which were super comfortable to sleep in. The room was big enough to move around in, but then again, there were only 2 of us. The safe and a mini-refrigerator were great to have. The wireless connection was trouble-free. The ice machine is located only on the 5th floor, but they seem to have iced lemon water in the lobby available throughout the day/night. There is no swimming pool but the beach is right there. There's no need to pack beach towels or beach mats as the hotel provides these also. There is parking available for $22 a day, although I parked at the Aston Banyan hotel on Kuhio Ave. (just up the block from Renew) for $10 a day with in/out priveleges.Continental breakfast is served in the lounge area starting at 7AM. You have a selection of pastries, toast, cereal, yogurt and fresh fruit as well as coffee and pineapple juice. Even though the lounge only sits 8-12 people, we had no problems finding a seat as people were usually coming and going. It's great to have this complimentary breakfast so you can pretty much get going and not have to worry about where to eat in the morning.One of the best things with Hotel Renew is the availability of a courtesy room. If you have a late flight and want to spend more time at the beach, make sure you book this room the day before you check-out. The hotel will let you check-out and store your luggage. And when you're ready to finally leave, you can make use of this courtesy room to freshen-up.","New York City, New York",1,4.0

The hotel is situated in a side road just off the main coast road running up from the town with all shops, restaurants etc within reasonable walking distance. The bus to the Ala Moana mall stops outside the hotel next door so very convenient for those all important shopping trips.The hotel aims to provide contrast, relaxation and an extremely comfortable atmoshpere and it ticks the boxes on all counts. From the minute you walk in (cool, dark decor in contrast the brightness of ouside) and are offered a fresh pineapple juice even before you check in, you know this is going to be a special place. Our room was not perhaps the largest we have had but comfortable for three people, however the ambience created by the lighting, decor and projector screen (rather than an ugly tv set) made the space seem larger than it was. Everything was clean, fresh towels every day, bathroom well laid out, powerful shower, dressing gowns provided. Room service excellent - on one day, when my son was ill and could not go out, the lady looking after our room (and I am sorry I can not remember her name) came back at the end of her shift to clean for us. Breakfast was included with the room price and this was excellent. Served in the bar area off the foyer, there was choice of cereals, juice, fruit, toast, danish pastries and croissants. And of course plenty of coffee. We thought this very good value. The bar was open in the evening with half price cocktails during the happy hour - again very good value compared to elsewhere in the Waikiki area. All beach equipment - towels, bodyboards, beach mats, chairs were available to borrow - amazing value when you consider what it might cost to hire. There are really few negatives to mention in this review as we enjoyed staying here but I would comment on the noise of the air conditioning unit in the room. It was not possible to turn it off, as the room became too hot, and opening a window was not an option either due to the noise of the traffic and the next door hotel outside. Ear plugs are a must. Also we upgraded to a beach view room on arrival, but as the hotel is set a little way down a side street this did not provide the view I was hoping for. Leaving the above aside, the staff were excellent - helpful cheerful and pleasant - and the ambiance created was just what we needed and we would certainly return here for a stay if we were visiting Oahu again.

Everyone was very friendly and professional, helping with reservations, printed out personal confirmations when asked, advice on activities, very genuine customer service.- free wifi- good signal throughout- free breakfast- lots of fresh, tasty choices, local and WSJ newspaperCons: (VERY few and VERY minor)- our Ocean view window had a huge bird poop smack in the middle. Something housekeeping should be able to reach out and clean.- Whole property is already showing wear and tear. Scattered nicks and rub marks on the hallway walls and in the room. The walls in the bathroom show too many water stains (wrong paint base?). Calking job is somewhat shabby in the bathroom.- some frayed carpet and lint in the corners. Despite being very clean, these things are annoying and easily avoidable.Summary: Very recommended, great location, great staff, clean, great value. Property should schedule the resources to keep the wear and tear to a minimum.

Parking was also expensive because you can only valet, ($22 /night, plus tip) although you never waited longer than 3 minutes for them to bring your car up.

Leave my wedding dress at the hotel for a week while I go visit the other islands? No problem. Want advise on the best place to buy a ukelele? They can tell you, and how about some free ukelele lessons while you're at it? Where's the best (and cheapest) place to buy some Thai food? They'll show you the way.

I have heard some complain about the small amount of seating for breakfast, but we usually showed up at about 8:30am and had no problems getting a seat every time. The only bad thing is that you can hear the music from the Aston Waikiki starting at 7:30am.

It is literally a block away from Waikiki. It was a pleasant stay as long as you are not expecting to spend any time at the hotel. We were greeted with a wet towelette and some cold and refreshing juice. We got in at 3:15 and they were still cleaning the room though but only had to wait a few minutes. A bell hop will take your luggage to your room for you. There is not really a beach view unless you are at level 5 and above, because there is a huge hotel in front of it. For light sleepers you do want to get a higher level. It was pretty noisy at level 3 where we were staying, but we slept fine with ear plugs. The air conditioner is right next to the bed also. But the bed itself was very comfortable. The room itself is quite small. We got a king size bed. We did look in two double room which were much bigger so for the claustrophobic a 2 double is recommended. But the king was just fine for the 2 of us. The room was also very clean, but you do need to talk to the front desk if you would like the bed sheets changed every day which was not a big deal to us. They have a free continental breakfast from 6:30 to 9:00. Get there before 8 if you want a place to sit. They served 3 assortment of fruit, coffee, tea, orange juice, muffin, and croissants. They also have free internet.They have free loans on beach towels and beach mats. they also have lawn chairs and boogie boards but they are very limited and go very fast. They do not have a dinning are, but a small little bar that can seat at max 8 people. They only have valet parking and it will cost 22 dollars a night. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We took the bus a few times to get around and the people were helpful. but we walked most of the time since all of the shops and food is so close. We did end up renting a car for the day and the staff was helpful to point us to where we could get one.

The front desk and bell staff are wonderful and very personable and friendly. The location is good and within a short walk of Waikiki Beach. Our room overlooked the building next door but also had a water view. The setup in the rooms is a little odd but functional. I do wish they would put a shade over the glass blocks into the bathroom so the light didn't wake up the other person in the room in the middle of the night and the bathroom is a little dim for applying makeup with the eco-lighting in place everywhere. My only real issue with the room was that it apparently hadn't been occupied in a while - there was dust everywhere when we checked in, a little mold around the tub, and an odd, musty odor coming from the AC all night. Nothing horrible but could have been a little cleaner.The bed was the absolute best I've ever slept on - I actually looked at the mattress and wrote down what kind it was!!! I have neck/back issues along with fibromyalgia and am usually in pain first thin in the morning.

We found the hotel to be quite nice, at a decent price. We weren't looking for a place with a full service restaurant, so the complimentary continental breakfast was a nice way to start the day. The seating area for breakfast seemed adequate. A few comments for anyone thinking of staying at this property:- Try to book a higher floor room. Our friends were on the 3rd floor, and were staring at the side of the parking garage next door. - If you book a room with two doubles, it most likely will have a projection TV (the same kind of projection system you might use at work in a conference room). The picture quality is poor, and the setup is not the most user friendly. The hotel should junk these, and replace them with LCD flat screens (as they have done in the rooms with king size beds).Tip for parkingIf you happen to have a rental car, don't do valet parking at the hotel. Drive a block and selfpark at the Waikiki Banyan. The rate is only $10/day, which is probably one of the cheapest rates anywhere in Waikiki.","tucson, az",11,5.0

The hotel had a nice continental breakfast consisting of breads and fruit. There isn't a restaurant at the hotel, so if you plan on having room service, you won't be able to do that. There really isn't any parking available, so if you have a car, you will probably need to valet, and that was $22 a day. I would recommend that you get a room with an ocean view.

The staff were exceptionally helpful and pleasant.

We ended up picking up coffee and muffins and returning to our room as it was more comfortable with a baby. The hotel is located close to plenty of ABC stores, take away food shops and restaurants so you really don't miss an in-house restaurant. We did the 'resort' thing when we were on the big island so we didn't miss not having a pool and were quite happy to visit the beach a few times instead. The beach gear was in great condition and it was easy to borrow it. Waikiki is noisy. On our first night we stayed on a lower floor and we did notice the noise. We returned to the hotel for 5 nights after staying on the Big Island and we requested a room on a higher floor (for an additional $10 per night I think). It was worth the money for a better sleep. Neither of our rooms had a pleasant outlook but again, we'd experienced gorgeous views on the Big Island and we didn't spend much time in our room so we didn't feel this compromised out stay at all.Overall a very impressive stay for the price we paid.","Mount Pleasant, Australia",66,4.0

The lobby is very well designed and feature complimentary drinks and on certain days, breakfast. The beach is a block away and the hotel will provide all the beach gear you need free of charge. The room was a good size with a nice big flat-screen.

I am originally from Hawaii and was mainly there to visit family so I didn't want to spend a fortune on a hotel. Hotel Renew's ratings were high on several websites and the price was right. Upon arrival we recieved a refreshing glass of pineapple juice and a warm towel to freshen up. Jackie, the receptionist was extremely friendly and welcoming. The decor of the lobby and our room was very modern and chic but warm and inviting. The room was very well thought out with lots of space for all our belongings. Other room ammenities include Face brand toiletries which are definitely high-end, free wi-fi, a refrigerator and safe. The lighting was definitely well done and added a dramatic decor element with full control panels conveniently located by the door and both sides of the bed. The bed was very comfortable with quality linens and pillows. All spaces were very clean and well kept. The hotel seemed to be brand new, so they are still doing some minor construction work here and there, but none of it was disturbing or inconvenient to us. There is no pool but the beach is at the end of the block and that's why you're in Hawaii, isn't it? There is no self-parking so if you rent a car, you have to pay $22/day for valet parking. The valet attendants were always extremely fast and pleasant.There is a complimentary continental breakfast from 7:30 to 10. They were always well stocked with a selection of fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, toast and pasteries. The coffee was actually decent (I'm a bit of a coffee snob). The bar area where breakfast is served is small but very elegant and relaxing. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Jackie and the rest of the staff were extremely gracious. Our flight was cancelled due to the recent snow storm on the East coast and we had to stay an extra night. Our room had been previously booked but they rearranged things for us so we would not have to change rooms. There is a complimentary hospitality room for guests to keep their luggage and freshen up, when late check-out isn't available.I was extremely impressed by this hotel.

We were greeted with lemongrass scented cool towels and pineapple juice upon check in. Nice after a very long trip from FL. The room was spotlessly clean with a fluffy, white, very comfortable bed. The room was modern, but not ""hard"" with current amenities like a nice flat screen tv and safe big enough for your laptop. We sprung the minor extra $10-$15/day for an oceanfront room and had a lovely view of Waikiki Beach and the sunset. Room 909, which was on the top floor, so very quiet too. It was more then made up for by the free wifi, free plentiful breakfast (fruit, yogurt, granola cereal, pastries, toast, juice, coffee and tea), free beach towels and mats and the availability of cheaper parking. Use the covered parking garage around the corner at $10/day with unlimited in/out. The valet/baggage guy willingly told us where it was. I read reviews that said it was a block to the beach, but it's the smallest block I've ever seen. You walk maybe an extra 100 feet and an abundance of restaurants and nice shops are right there. Being able to get towels and beach mats from reception was great as we just threw them in the car with us so we could hit whatever beach we happened to find that day. We were so comfortable and content at Hotel Renew that we extended another day before we left for Maui. We had a 4 star booked in Maui and found we were disappointed and spoiled by Hotel Renew. The staff, from check in people to porters were very nice and any of them would step up and assist you if someone else was busy. The only very slight negative was the very small number of tables for breakfast. You never knew if you'd get one, but they don't mind if you sit anywhere in the lobby or take breakfast back to your room. Usually even if tables were all full, by the time we fixed our breakfast and got our coffee, one opened up and the money it saves you on eating an extra meal out every day is more then worth it. For the price of this hotel (we paid around $150/night for our ocean view) it far exceeded most other hotels in this range.

The hotel doesn't have a lot of amenities (restaurant, pool, etc.), but who needs them when Waikiki is just a few steps away? Definitely not the spot for a young family or elderly couple, but the Marriott is just down the block.

Got a smoking deal for this boutique hotel located a block and a half away from the beach and far enough away from the majority of the crowds (if that's at all possible). We were welcomed with a nice cool glass of pineapple juice and cool aromatic hand towel upon arrival. Once we got into our room there was a bottle of champagne, a coupon for a specialty drink (both honeymoon gifts) and bottled water. Offered daily complementary continental breakfasts, towels, beach mats, beach chairs and boogie boards (that's right boogie boards). Ain't gonna get that in any corporate hotel. But the best part of our stay turned out to be the incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff. The standout for us turned out to be the night front desk manager, Jerome, who gave us some incredible suggestions on restaurants and places to go throughout the island.

I am so happy we made the choice! The rooms are large, welcoming and clean and feel very modern and new. The staff were unbelievable. So friendly, willing to chat, always at the ready to help. Hotel staff have never really impressed me until our stay at Renew. The breakfast was a perfect continental breakfast that was a nice healthy balance to the heavy dinners we were consuming! Location was absolutely perfect also, right outside a trolley stop, close to the beach and at the quieter end of Waikiki. My only little dislike about the hotel was the shower head - having showers was not enjoyable!The only bad thing that happened during our stay is we had organised a shuttle through the front desk to take us to the airport. The guy arrived a 30 mins late, then proceeded to drive all around Waikiki rather than getting us to the airport on time. When I questioned him about what he was doing as he promised we would be at the airport by a certain time, he stopped the car in the middle of the road and started to yell and scream at me saying that everyone will laugh at you for being worried about missing your flight and that if we said one more word he would kick us out of his shuttle! The guy was an absolute ****. As soon as we did arrive at the airport (only 40 mins before departure but thankfully the airline still let us board) I contacted the hotel staff immediately to let them know about the pig of a man running the shuttle service. They were disgusted and apologised but I let them know only so they wouldn't use him again. It was by no means Hotel Renew's fault and again I would like to emphasise how impressive the staff were. I did ask the shuttle providers name but I have since forgotten (I wanted to warn you all)!All in all a wonderful stay and if I return to Waikiki for the third time, I'll DEFINITELY be staying at Hotel Renew.",Australia,32,5.0

After arriving late on Saturday, it was a pleasure to be greeted with pineapple juice and a cool moistened towel. The location is superb as it's on the eastern edge of Waikiki near the zoo, which permits easy access to Kapalau Avenue and the University of Hawaii (UH) where many of the business meetings took place. Before the crack of dawn, it was peaceful (and safe) to jog along the beach heading east (toward Diamond Head) and then walk to the Honolulu Coffee Company (for a cup of Kona) or Starbucks. I stayed on the 9th floor in Room 907, which overlooked the ocean (and the gorgeous sunsets). If your budget permits, you should request a room on an upper floor facing the water. The small rooms might be a problem if you prefer ""lots of space"" or travelling with young children, but I really liked the minimalist, Japanese design of the shoji screens on the windows and clever use of space, which offered a peaceful, Zen-like respite. While the breakfast space is limited (you should get there early or wait for the first-wave rush to end), it provided enough nourishment to get the day started. But what really exceeded my expectations was the use of a ""hospitality suite"" on Wednesday before my 10:15pm red-eye flight back to the mainland. The Hotel Renew provides a private room (at no additional charge) to change your clothes, take a brief shower, and jettison any unwanted paper or trash before hopping on a taxi to the airport. You just have to request it a day in advance and reserve a 30 minute block of time. I would definitely stay here again for a business trip. Pros: (1) superb location near Kapalau Ave., (2) free Wi-Fi and a strong, consistent signal, (3) use of beach chairs and towels for guests (great for Hanauma Bay), (4) personal service that is friendly, (5) hospitality suite for red-eye flights back to mainland, and (6) outstanding sunset views from the upper floor rooms facing the ocean.Cons: (1) limited breakfast space, (2) no fitness room - but jogging along the beach toward Diamond Head at sunrise was great exercise.

We arrived at the hotel at 9:30 a.m., and they checked us in immediately in a room on the third floor. Rooms 301-305 all look down on hostels and motorcycle rental shops on Lemon Street. We were prepared to trade the street noise for the convenience of checking in at 9:30 am and receiving a complimentary buffet breakfast on the day of our arrival. There was daytime street noise, but none loud enough to disturb an afternoon's recovery from jetlag. The Lemon Street dumpster noises occurred at about 9 a.m. the next day. The room doors seemed to be of the same type as at Best Western Coconut (where we had a disappointing noisy stay), but there were no wall-shaking door slammers on our floor and no neighbor noise.The lifts were fast and convenient. We were able to access the in-room wi-fi with both Windows XP and Linux computers, and the signal was consistently strong. The large screen TV had many channels. It was over the desk so a person sitting at the desk blocked the view of a person lying on the bed.The hair dryer was not as good as most. We did not see the wall plugs that were located under the nightstand by the bed until the day we left. Like many hotels, they provided very heavy blankets that forced us to turn the air conditioning super cold to keep from waking up in a sweat.Although there were only 5 or 6 tables at the complimentary buffet breakfast, we were fortunate to get a table both mornings. The breakfast was adequate to get you going in the morning with coffee, juice, fruit, rolls, toast, and yogurt.The refrigerator was a bit of a nuisance. They must have plugged in the chiller (it was never cold) when we checked in at 9:30 a.m. because by 8 p.m., it was still at room temperature, and they put in an order for a technician to look at it the next day. After 24 hours, it reached chill temperature just as the technician arrived at 10 a.m. the next day to look at it. In the meantime, we used the ice bucket to keep our things cold. They froze our ice pack, and we picked it up at the reception desk when we left for the airport at 4 a.m.We had an excellent dinner at Sansei Japanese restaurant on the third floor of the Marriott Hotel next door to Hotel Renew. The beach across the road was much nicer and less crowded than on the western side of Waikiki, but after staying at both sides, we found that we prefer the western side for its proximity to a greater variety of shops and restaurants.

A form of protein would have been welcome; such as cheeses or a hard boiled egg. I loved the efficient way it was all set up. The reception staff were very friendly and very accomodating. The complimentary beach gear was handy. At this hotel you get what you see and read plus the amazing staff in person! The photos are accurate. Would we return? You bet we would.",calgary,3,4.0

We booked this hotel solely based on the reviews that we read, and they are right on the mark.I've witnessed pleasant staff at other hotels I've stayed at, but never to the point of being the first thing we describe when someone asks 'how was our hotel'? They are truly to be commended on their attitudes and service level. From the first person who grabbed our bags at checkin, to the valet attendant, to check-out, everyone was terrific.The room is very stylish, and attractive. In terms of size, it is cute - not overly spacious, but plenty of room for the two of us. Comfortable bed, well cleaned each day, well appointed - everything we needed.We stayed in 607 - which had a great view out towards the beach.The only thing that was an annoyance was the noise level that comes from the door/hallway. We had a few loud party-goers on our floor that came in loud and clear. It was disappointing, but did not sour our trip. Location is great! As others had mentioned, it's a pitching wedge from the beach. There is a convenient ABC store right beside the front door. Having stayed in Waikiki several times, it is at the quieter end of Waikiki.If your looking for a neat little spot, with good location and great service, you can't go wrong.Some have noted not having a pool as a negative - Am I missing something?

And we have to say that our experience was above and beyond all our expectations. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by the very friendly staff who treated us like family. After receiving face towels as a soother from a lengthy journey starting in Toronto, and sipping the best tasting pineapple juice we`d ever tasted, we were escorted to our honeymoon suite, which was beautiful, modern and very eco-friendly.Some great services that they offer are: 1) Daily bed linen changes, 2) a complimentary continental breakfast (featuring an all-organic menu, including their `best-ever`pineapple juice) and 3) FREE beach towel and mat service, which helped a lot since they are so close to the beach.The staff at the hotel, as we mentioned treated us like family and friends. Two of the staff were especially helpful when we needed their services, but were also great conversationalists and were always caught up in friendly banter with them. One of them even advised me (the husband) on what to look for in a ukulele, since I was buying one for gigging. Also, they were a big help for us finding our way around Waikiki and Oahu, and as a result, we were able to travel around like locals (on the bus system).Also, its great location is a huge plus. You are a 1 minute walk away from Waikiki Beach, and the surrounding beaches. Also accessible in this area are a number of local stores and authentic Hawaiian restaurants. Its proximity to tour bus stops as well, makes it an excellent choice when planning sightseeing, shopping or food tours.In conclusion, Hotel Renew was a great experience, and we definitely want to come back to the same hotel on our next Waikiki vacation.

This decision was rather easy as my co-worker stayed there in January, and had nothing but good things to say about it. So, I took her word for it, booked Hotel Renew and expected just as fine a trip, if not better. Upon arriving at Hotel Renew, my wife and I were greeted with friendly staff. The concierge carried our bags straight from the trunk of the taxi and up to our room. At reception, we were welcomed with a warm scented towel and an ice cold glass of pineapple juice instead of the typical line-up you’d expect at every hotel check-in. This was very refreshing especially after travelling 15 hours. This level of service continued through-out our entire stay, and actually excelled as the trip went on. The overall style of the lobby and bar/event area is modern. There is a most interesting fountain in the elevator lobby.We had a premier ocean view room. Our first impression of it was clean and contemporary. Although the style was very modern, the room felt comfortable and cozy. There’s a high-tech. lighting system which controls all the lights without the need of getting out of bed, plus touch sensitive lights in the bathroom. The air-conditioner is not as new as the lighting system, but it kept the room nice and cold during our stay (forgot to add the maintenance staff changed the filter for us as soon as we got there, ensuring the A/C unit was properly functioning from the beginning of our stay there). Hotel Renew is nicely situated off the end of the busy Honolulu strip, on a quiet street. Within immediate walking distance are many tourist amenities such as a trip advisor, rental services, shopping, a variety of restaurants, – the list goes on. One thing I’d like to point out is there is a convenience store located literally right beside the hotel. It has everything you need from baby wipes to booze. Most importantly, the beach is only about a minute walk from the hotel doors.There’s so much that we loved about this hotel. As mentioned earlier in this review the staff are great and the level of service excelled as the trip went on. We had the privilege of becoming friends with one of the staff, this really cool guy named Will. From the beginning of our trip he expressed interest in making it an awesome one, at the hotel and away from it. He had great suggestions on where to go for good food and sight-seeing, among many other things. His advice was a great help especially when we wanted to experience local-type attractions like nightlife and restaurants. Being in Hawaii for our honeymoon was amazing enough, but Will’s help and advice was a huge added bonus (Thanks Will!). When we return to Oahu, we will definitely be staying at Hotel Renew!",Toronto,2,5.0

This was my 6th trip to Hawaii and my first stay at the Hotel Renew.Having previously stayed at the Ala Moana Surfrider, Sheraton Waikiki and Waikiki Parc I was drawn to this hotel by the reviews and photos posted on Tripadvisor. The hotel looked so different from the run of the mill standard decor you see at the larger hotels. I wasn't disappointed. It looks just like the photos - even better.The staff are friendly and approachable. Nothing is too much trouble for them.The rooms whilst not huge were comfortable and inviting after a busy day of shopping! The bed was one of the best I have slept in and I slept soundly every night I was there. There was plenty of room to store things and a handy sized fridge (to store drinks) and in room safe. The bathroom had a good sized shower (over the bath), lovely smelling FACE bath products from Stockholm and I had a never ending suppply of bath towels. I stayed on the 8th floor and had a great view of the beach. I would recommend you pay the little extra to stay on the higher floors. As for noise apart from the odd clang of the Waikiki trolley going by (there is a stop at the hotel next door) I heard very little. Although if you opened the window you'd certainly hear the noise of Waikiki after all it is a busy city with people coming and going at all hours. The hotel is located at the quieter end of Waikiki but well within walking distance to the beach (half a block) the Bus, the restaurants and shops of downtown Waikiki. A friendly ABC shop is next door. The continental breakfast provided was more than adequate and was a good start to the day. My one small gripe would be the rooms had no tea or coffee making facilities and as someone who likes to have a cuppa as the day winds down I found this to be the one thing I missed from my room. Although there is a Starbucks round the corner. This hotel doesn't hold itself out to be a ""mega hotel"" it simply is a small hidden gem amongst the hustle and bustle of Waikiki.

We were not disappointed.The rooms were much smaller than we expected, and the ceilings felt low. Overall, the best word to describe the size of the room is 'Cramped'.However, nobody comes to hawaii to stay in the room. The hotel was a short block and a half from the beach, and the staff was quick to give us towels, chairs, toys, and more stuff than we could carry. In general, I would describe the service levels as Excellent. There were almost no interactions that we could find that could be handled better. Even the Valets were fantastic.The bed was large and soft, and the sheets felt expensive. i slept like a baby, and my baby slept well too. That alone makes this a great hotel. This is one of the nicest hotel beds I have slept in, including the Fairmont, the W, the Ritz, etc. This is clearly one of the strong suits of this hotel. There is free breakfast downstairs, but this is a ""continental breakfast"", which apparently means stale rolls, coffee and juice. But it's free, so we loved it.We could not find any room service, but there are a million places nearby. Not many of them are any good, but they are convenient (and expensive!)Valet parking is done exceptionally here - there is little to no wait, there wer ZERO problems with the car. One time we came back to the car to find that dollar bills that fell out of our pocket were still there. It almost sounds like a fairy tale. The price is steep though. It's cheaper to pay a @#$!! valet and let them steal change from the car, but the hotel is very nice about the service, so it is hard to begrudge them the highest rates for valet parking on the island.",Bay Area,3,5.0

There is plenty of storage with several drawers, shelves and closet space. The in-room safe is huge and holds big items, which is a nice touch. The TV is gigantic. The lighting system is ingenious. With a touch of one button all lights can be turned on or off. Or individual sections of the room can be lit up. The windows can be shuttered for privacy and darkness.

I liked Hotel Renew much more, where the service was much more personable, and would definitely stay there again. The staff were always friendly, you are greeted with a glass of cold pineapple juice and a wash cloth for freshening upon arrival, the rooms were very nice and contemporary, the lighting system (where you can control all the lights in the room from bedside) was very convenient, the projection TV was totally cool (I think I might check into one of these for myself now), recycling is encouraged, the hotel offered complementary amenities (shaving cream, tooth paste) quickly when I realized I forgot those, there is complementary wifi, and the hotel is very convenient to the beach, less than a full block away. This is a bit quieter part of Waikiki Beach than some other hotels (though an easy walk to busier areas), but I saw that as a plus, and the hotel was a couple of blocks away from a park and convenient to Diamond Head (an easy run from the hotel). Like someone else noted, the room temperature can creep up during the day (to the higher 70's) regardless of the setting in the middle of the day when its really hot out, but I found that was easily prevented by just closing the shades during the middle of the day. The continental breakfast included yogurt, muffins and toast, fresh fruit, tea and coffee. Although they also offered coffee drinks from the bar, the regular coffee was on the weak side, and if you prefer Starbucks, there's one right around the corner, and next to the Starbucks, an ABC store that sells hard boiled eggs for 49 cents if you prefer a little more protein for breakfast. There's also an ABC store right next door to the hotel, as well as a Wolfgang Puck Express, ice cream place, and tour services in the local next-door hotels. The ABC store is also super convenient for everything that you left at home but need for swimming, e.g., sun block, goggles for swimming in the ocean, etc., but the hotel has beach towels for check out, so you don't need those. Don't forgot to go out to the beach for the wonderful sunset. For excursions, I highly recommend snorkeling in Hanauma Bay (seriously, don't forget the sun block on your back!!), and the full day rainforest and waterfall trip to Hana, offered by hikemaui.com, although for the latter, you have to wake up in the middle of the night to catch the early inter-island shuttle flight to Maui.

This has it's inherent pros & cons, but generally speaking we had a great experience there.Checking in was a genuine pleasure. No lines, no waiting, and they immediately present you with a cold, moistened face cloth and a glass of chilled pineapple juice. I found this to be a very nice touch.The lobby is quite attractive, and they provide chilled lemon water and coffee there.There are two elevators, and they can be painfully slow. I never figured out the navigation necessary to use the stairs from our room to the lobby. One staircase exited only to an emergency exit door.The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only hiccup that we ran into was an unexpected $10 charge that was added to our bill. We borrowed a bottle opener from the front desk which I returned about 45 minutes later. We were subsequently charged for not returning the opener. They removed the charge without any hassle after I called and explained the circumstances.Our room was on the second floor, and as such, we knew we weren't going to get a view of anything. I would be surprised if any of the rooms in this hotel had a view of the beach, but maybe the upper floors do. There are about eight floors, from what I recall. The building is about 100 yards from Waikiki Beach, and there is another hotel in between.The hotel is located in the middle of just about everything. There is an ""ABC Store"" right next door. ABC Stores sell everything from beer/wine/liquor to clothing. You will probably find this to be a great convenience. Their prices aren't all that bad, either.The room was very clean, and VERY contemporary. There is a fantastic large-screen LCD in the room, but no HD. We weren't in Hawaii to watch TV, anyway.The bed was very comfortable and there is a heavy-duty down comforter along with it. This puppy would be great to have at home in New England, but it was a little bizarre having it in Hawaii next to the beach. My wife hated it because it was so heavy. It really did feel a bit like the protective cover you are given when having x-rays done. Easy thing to fix, though. Just take it off the bed!One weird thing about the contemporary bathroom is that the walls of the bathroom are frosted glass. So that means that if you get up in the night to use it, you will light up the whole room (unless you can do it in the dark). That reminds me, I was completely perplexed by their light switches. It can't even be explained here.The room had an individually controlled air conditioner, but it just could not keep up with the outdoor temperatures, which were around 90. The AC ran constantly all day and night and it never went below 79 degrees in the room. I like it cold, and it just couldn't do it. We did not bother to complain about it.There is a feeble, tiny refrigerator which is housed inside a compartment in the desk. It had trouble getting cool. I think that the lack of air circulation probably causes this. Again, we didn't complain about it, just a minor peeve. I filled the bathroom sink with ice (ice machine is on the 5th floor) to keep our bottle of wine chilled.The complimentary continental breakfast was perfectly adequate. They have plenty of fresh choices available in order to create a viable meal. Cereals, yogurts, granola, pastries and fruits among the offerings. Keep in mind that meals can be very expensive, so factor in the cost of included meals! Some of the hotels that I had inquired about were charging an extra $25 per person for the buffet breakfast.We were boarding a cruise ship the afternoon of our checkout day, and we asked if the hotel would store our luggage for a few hours. They were quite accomodating, and they also allowed us to keep our valuables in their safe.

Unfortunately, we were disappointed and checked out of the Hotel Renew (and into the Moana Surfrider) after our first night. Our small black and white room was very ""urban"" and the opposite of what we look for on a Hawaiian vacation. Our ""view"" of the ocean (from inside the room through a small window, not from a lanai or small balcony) was beyond the roof and pool of the adjacent hotel. We ate our meager breakfast while hunched over a ""table"" that was more like a bongo drum. And there were no gentle breezes through the small, enclosed lobby. On a positive note, the hotel was clean and the staff were friendly and accommodating. We've planned a return trip in 2010, and we'll be staying at the Moana Surfrider.","Portland, OR",9,3.0

The hotel has a recycle trash can, energy saving shower, no AC hallways, and a energy saving lighting system. In addition no paper handouts or plastic usage anywear.

I booked this because of all the glowing reviews on TA. During the three nights we stayed, they had to replace the AC on two days. On the one day they didn't replace it, I still had to call them for maintenance cause it just stopped working. Granted, they did come up to our room as soon as I called but I was hoping that since they were an ""elite"" hotel, that this problem should not have come up. On our first night, we actually had to sleep in another room because the engineer was no longer working so they couldn't replace the AC. They did give me 50% off the first night (i booked a king but ended up sleeping at a double bed). The hallways to the elevator was warm.. it felt like the AC was not turned on. It also had a smell... not a bad one... but not a pleasing one either.The location of the hotel is good... less than 2 minutes from the beach. The ambiance is very serene. The hotel itself though is really tiny. It was easy to get in and out of, compared to all the major hotels where you had to walk through the huge lobby before getting to an elevator. The continental breakfast was ok. If I go back to Waikiki, I wouldn't stay here again.",California,71,3.0

I was pleased when I later found out my rate was lower than the convention rate. I thus knew in advance the hotel had things I wanted--style, small size, location on the eastern edge of Waikiki, free continental breakfast--and did not not have things I cared little about--a pool, beachfront location, restaurant. Even without a convention to attend, I am not one to loll about pool or beach-side, and as for dining, I knew the hotel was around the corner from Kapahulu Ave., where many local eateries like Rainbow Drive-In, Waiola Shave Ice, Zippy's, and Leonard's malasadas are located.It was after booking that I discovered the TA hubbub regarding the authenticity of some of the hotel's reviews in TA forums, the subsequent briefly posted TA disclaimer, and the slight slip to #2. How curious that lots of the laudatory reviews were submitted by reviewers with one contribution only, and how interesting that so many reviews singled out and complemented specific employees, as if there was some sort of internal competition or incentive. This all served to increase my eagerness to visit Hawaii and the Renew; I certainly never had any intentions of changing hotelsI stayed for 5 nights, and to cut to the chase, I think the Renew is a great stylish and intimate boutique hotel with a very friendly staff. I don't think any of the positive reviews were excessively out of line, and as for employee shout-outs, it's understandable that a guest would learn people's names, given the small size of the staff and the hotel itself (only 72 rooms). I would happily stay here again. For more details, please read on.The Renew was formerly the Ocean Tower Hotel, an annex of the adjacent ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Hotel, and was redone and rechristened the Renew about a year ago. The redo is a total design concept by San Francisco-based designer Jiun Ho, whose name I noticed on towels, pillowcases, the wool throw, robes, and the stitched chocolate leather on the ice bucket, wastebaskets, laundry basket and tissue holders. Certainly the furniture, light fixtures and everything else are his as well. The result is beautiful--clean, slightly Asian, comfortable--the hotel would fit nicely in any cosmopolitan city, almost totally avoiding Hawaiian elements that can easily seem kitschy. Although most Hawaiian hotels have lobbies open to the outdoors, the Renew actually has entry doors, so the lobby is nicely air-conditioned. You are given a cold scented towel and pineapple juice at check-in. If you take an airport shuttle, know you will be one of the last to be dropped off. It took my shuttle 90 minutes.At this end of Waikiki, there are no hotels on the ocean side of Kalakaua Ave., the main drag, so only the ResortQuest is between the Renew and the beach. The beach here is wider, less crowded, more locals. A jetty called the Kapahulu Groin separates Kuhio Beach with its sea wall, great for kids, from Queen's Beach, where folks bodyboard or surf shortboards perilously close to the jetty. The ocean view rooms are on floors 5-9, but the periphery views are blocked bay the taller ResortQuest and Marriott hotels. The city view rooms face Lemon Rd., which is really an alley with a few hostels and apartments that are a bit downtrodden. An ABC store is on the corner, with about 5 more within a 2 block radius. There are 9 floors counting the lobby, with 9 rooms per floor. There are no suites or connecting rooms, so the hotel is not ideal for large families. There are 2 elevators that guests share with the staff (i.e., there are no service elevators). There is no business center, but there is Wifi. For those without a laptop, one is referred to the internet cafe in the hostel across the alley, or to the ResortQuest. The front desk will print out boarding passes. There is no fitness center.My room was a corner room, as I had requested a balcony, which are in the 01 and 06 rooms. My room actually faced the ocean but was on a lower floor, so the view was blocked by the ResortQuest's garage/reception/pool building. The corner rooms are configured differently than other rooms, and are a bit smaller. The balcony did not have a nice view--parking garage and weary apartment building. Again, the design was great. nice dimmable lighting, unique fixtures, green elements like recycled toilet paper. The closet was small and half the hanging space taken up by shelves (there is storage space under the platform bed). I worry about the durability of some things like the otherwise lovely faucet. The cabinet that covered the A/C unit was held in place only with Velcro. Housekeeping was minimal, leaving new toiletries only once, never changing the plastic liner in the ice bucket (maybe this is being green). Photos previous reviewers posted on TA show fruit in the rooms. I had none, but there is always a bowl of green apples in the lobby, along with ice water with lemon and coffee.The continental breakfast offerings were of good quality--several platters of fresh cut or sliced fruit, yogurt, granola and cereal, a different juice each day, breads and a toaster,a large bowl of fresh danish, muffins and croissant, coffee and tea. Even soy milk. There is only one employee setting up for breakfast, which starts at 7am. Since a lot of our convention activities started at 7:30 am at the Convention Center near Ala Moana mall, I saw many colleagues either eat and run (to the shuttle bus at the Marriott), or grab and go. Guests who tried to start before 7am were rebuffed--wait until the dimmed lights are turned up or an announcement is made! The one time I had to depart super early, I spied the not yet opened box of pastries and snuck out two and an apple while the attendant was away.Again, the staff was very friendly and helpful. When checking in, the receptionist made a point of mentioning the 24-hour restaurant located in the nearby Hilton Prince Kuhio hotel. There is a weekly hosted mixer on Thursday evenings, where a got more dining tips from staff. Interestingly, no employee told me their names, although most have name tags. TA was never mentioned.After checking out I spent a few days on the North Shore, but the had no problem storing my luggage for a few hours upon my return before I caught the airport shuttle. Other reviewers mentioned the use of a hospitality room where they freshened up or showered before departure. I disappointingly was not extended this offer (I don't know if there is a dedicated hospitality room or if it's just an unused room), so I had to make do with the lobby restroom, which does have a very unique sink.All in all a very enjoyable stay, and a good value. Of the 4 Waikiki hotels I've visited, I'd rank the Renew behind the Halekulani (so elegant and peaceful, superb service, virtually no beach but nice pool and restaurants, pricey), but ahead of the Waikiki Parc (which has since been remodeled into a W-like place, but did away with its fabulous free breakfast buffet when it put in the Nobu restaurant) and the Hilton Hawaiian Village (huge, impersonal staff, timeshare hucksters everywhere, large beach though). I would gladly return.",Los Angeles CA,1201,4.0

The staff, especially at the front desk, were very friendly. The decor is simple, tasteful and the place is quiet and relaxing;quite welcome in Waikiki. The only big thing missing for me was a coffee maker in the room. I hated schlepping downstairs three times each morning for more coffee. But they did have soy milk, to my astonished delight. The other drawback is no business center. But, maybe in Hawaii, why have one? Maybe computers are antithetical to relaxation and renewal. And the staff was more than willing to print out anything that I wanted on line, even when I had to deal with Delta and it took one-half hour to get them to send me a complete boarding pass.Local calls are free, as is the hospitality room for a nap or quick shower after you check out. Although there is no pool, why use one in Hawaii? Huh? Finally, this is the first hotel I have stayed at that uses energy saving devices and has convenient recylcing for guests. Why don't other hotels do this? Just so you know, this hotel is closer to the Diamond Head end of Waikiki and lovely Kapiolani beach which has less people. Try out the nearby Rainbow Drive In, if you enjoy local fast food and families eating in the back of their pickups. It is a hoot. I found it refreshing to be with warm and generous people who live in Hawaii.","Seattle, Washington",150,4.0

Hotel Renew was great --close to the beach, close to the bus stop and right next door to ABC store (convenience store). I did not have a car, bought a four day bus pass twice during my stay.. from the next door ABC store. Breakfast was okay and just from 7 to 9. Coming from the mainland I was often already gone from hotel by the time they started breakfast. Lots of surprisingly good food available, again, from the ABC store. (For light breakfasts or picnic lunches.)Room had a beautiful view of ocean and sliding wooden Japanese style shutters that almost completely blocked out the light and probably helped with sound as well. The ocean facing rooms also faced a bar and pool area of another hotel and there was some noise, but I found that bearable, especially with earplugs. I slept great, comfortable soft bed.Shower has no railing, was a little slick getting in and out of.The master light controls right beside the bed were great, especially for getting just enough light for middle -of -the -night bathroom trips.My negative experience? the smoke alarm battery went down in the middle of the night and started emitting a high pitched intermittent beep. I called downstairs and they sent someone up before we figured out where the noise was coming from.I too, had some difficulty with setting the A.C. comfortably and it was a bit noisy.Still loved the hotel and I would definitely stay here again.General advice: the buses are cold, have a jacket or towel..Sushi place at hotel across the street was very convenient, Sansei.Honolulu Academy of Art had a surprisingly awesome and varied collection of European as well as Asian Art.

Traveling alone I was looking for good value and couldn't afford any of the ridiculously overpriced on the beach options, but I also didn't want to stay in some crappy Holiday Inn-like motel off the beaten path. This was a FIND. The hotel was still engaged in some renovations during my stay, but the rooms were immaculate and the staff couldn't have been friendlier. The hotel reminds me of a New York style boutiqe hotel. Small, quaint and friendly, but with modern design, very comfortable. The room size is great and the hotel is very close to the beach. Perfect location. Great value for your money. It really was a hidden gem. I will definitely stay there again if I go back to Waikiki (not my favorite).

Way too touristy.Hotel Renew, however, was a nice escape within Waikiki. It's small, which is to its advantage, in my opinion. I think there may be a maximum of 60 or so rooms. The location is nice. It's only a short half block to the beach, so if that's your thing, you're golden. It's a bit of a pain to get to - it's pretty much on the end of Waikiki - so if you are coming from the airport/convention center/downtown, it's a pain driving through the rest of Waikiki. If you're coming from Diamond Head, it's easy to get to, though you'll still have to deal with one block of the traffic, since the roads are almost all one way.The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Zero complaints there. They even had my car ready for me the next morning. Their wake up call seems to be a combination of either a personal call from the front desk or an automated call.The rooms were very comfortable. The A/C is moderately noisy. I had a hard time getting it set to just the right temperature, but I know that's just me. The bed is incredibly comfortable - IF you like very soft bed. If you're used to a firm bed, this will take some getting used to. The bathroom is nice, but the shower head is awful. I realize that hotels are trying to save water, but the aerated shower heads HAVE to go. I'm almost tempted to start carrying a shower head with me for just such a case. The bathroom also has a glass door and wall - but they are frosted...so nobody can see anything. The lighting in the room is nice and very convenient. There is a controller for all lights right at the bedside. Nice touch. The windows - I really like how they have the ability to very nearly black out the room - in addition to a pull down shade, you can slide covers over the whole window span.The only downside - they do not have any kind of business center.If you must stay in Waikiki, or if tons of tourists is fine for you...then by all means, try out Hotel Renew. Well worth it.","Henderson, Nevada",45,4.0

We (4 of us) were there for the ADA convention and we have nothing but praise for Hotel Renew.The location is great. You’re on the quiet side of the strip but within easy walking distance of the action. The beach is half a block away and the staff will give you beach umbrellas and chairs to use while you’re there. They have continental breakfast in the morning starting at 7 am. I didn’t get to try it because I had classes at 7:30 at the convention center but the friends I traveled with did and said it was good.

I love me some Jackie! She is the blonde lady at the front desk who will do whatever it takes to make your stay a great one. Girlfriend deserves a raise! She made restaurant reservations and recommendations and we love her for that. We saw her on the street as she was walking home after work and she recognized us and asked how our day was and what we had done, etc… We love you Jackie!Seriously, everyone on the staff was wonderful.

They were really good people. They greet you with cold hand towels and a cold glass of pineapple juice when you check in. It’s a great way to start your trip. Pros: Fabulous Staff. Fabulous Location.

Grace, Angie, etc... everyone there was awesome. Something about staying at a smaller location like this, gives the staff the opportunity to be more comforting/helpful than at a larger hotel. Normally you would expect to pay for a 5 star hotel to get this type of attention. So big thumbs up to staff.- Very walkable location around town. Most of the time, me and my wife walked around, 1/2 block from beach, etc etc.- Very modern rooms. (Depends on your styling, this place is ultra modern. If you feel like you want a more authentic Hawaiian style, this hotel may not be right for you)- Beds are very true King beds, very comfy. Did I mention the rooms are EXACTLY like the pictures on their website, (will be posting our pictures of our Room 909 shortly)Cons:- Parking could be a problem if you have a rental car and need to park. I was fortunate to find a location not too far from the hotel, just message me and I'll point you to that direction.- No Lanai to step out of the room. Kinda got jealous that the Marriott and the Aston next door, have their lanais... oh wells, small price to pay I suppose.Other Comments:- This hotel may not be for everyone. My wife and I don't use the pool (since Waikiki is 1/2 block from hotel), don't care for room service (I'll just walk down 1 block around the corner and grab it myself), and knew we were going to walk around a lot.

The room was air conditioned and always comfortable for sleeping. There is a fridge and safe in the room. The pictures of the rooms on the Hotel Renew website are the same as the room we stayed in. The staff were very friendly and helpful, we enjoyed chatting with them as we would come and go from the lobby. As it was our honeymoon, there was a complimentary bottle of champagne from the staff waiting for us in our room. Our room was quiet, (city view side), we spoke with another guest on the ocean view side and she commented on the noise from the nearby bar. Although not right on the beach it is so close you could easily walk to and from the beach many times a day if you wanted. It was about about a one minute walk to the water if you caught the walk signal. The part of the beach that is closest has a retaining wall which makes the water very calm and good for swimming and children. The location was perfect, close to all the action but not directly in it. The hotel is close to Kuhio Ave. which is the main thoroughfare for The Bus. Breakfast was delicious, it consisted of fresh fruit (pineapple, melon,oranges, grapefruit), pastries, muffins, granola, yoghurt, toast, coffee, tea, pineapple juice, milk and soy milk. It was always fresh, and the lady that worked there was very nice. We would have liked to have seen more protein such as boiled eggs included. All in all would highly recommend this hotel.",British Columbia,5,5.0

Our first stay was for 5 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon and then 2nd stay was for 3 nights and the end of our honeymoon.The rooms were very clean and a nice size. The beds were very comfortable. Other reviewers have made mention of the hallways needing some repair. Although this is true, the quality of the rooms totally make up for it. This hotel is 1 block away from Waikiki Beach. It's towards the East end of the beach, so it's not as busy as closer to the Beachwalk. The breaker wall at the beach is great, especially for those of us who aren't strong swimmers.There are a ton of restaurants located just a few minutes walk away. One of our favourites was the Japanese restaurant located in King's Village. Hula Restaurant was great too.The staff at Hotel Renew were all amazing and very very helpful. They printed out maps of the city and highlighted their favourite restaurants, arranged for a shuttle for us to Pearl Harbour, helped us with directions, reserved a rental car, etc. etc. etc. The breakfast was good. Not much selection, but we already managed to eat enough and get started on our day. I really liked that there was Soy Milk available. The pastries and fresh pineapple juice were great.Everything with this hotel is included. There will be no surprise charges on your bill upon checkout. Local calls and toll-free calls are free - even though some of the larger hotels charge for this. For long distance calls, go to the ABC Store (right across the street) and buy a $10 calling card. Wi-fi is also free, as is the in-room safe.My husband really liked the lighting system they have in the rooms. It's very handy for when you're coming into the room or going to bed at night.

My friend Sarah recommended Hotel Renew, a very affordable boutique hotel in Waikiki. A quick scan of hotel rates in the area confirmed that Hotel Renew's nightly rate was much less than most. We stayed for two weeks. If you're not on vacation, Waikiki's throngs of tourists and over-the-top vibe can be draining. In contrast Hotel Renew's low-key polish is an oasis. The staff's attentiveness is genuine and warm. Will, one of the valets, was particularly helpful and cheerful which made a difference when coming home from a long day of looking at rentals. The hotel itself is lovely. You can feel the thoughtfulness in small details, from FACE Stockholm bathroom supplies to the vessel sink to the beautiful reflecting fountain in the lobby. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and quiet. My favorite part was the giant TV that could be angled to face almost any part of the room. There's no restaurant, bar, or pool, but Hotel Renew does well with what it has.

Since it's a smaller hotel the city-view rooms have a great closeup of the sides of other buildings if you're located on the lower floors and as far as the ocean view rooms you won't get the right-on-the-water feel.

Overall, we had a great stay and can't wait to go back.A few tips for your trip:-rent a car and drive out of Waikiki for gorgeous non-over crowded beaches. e.g., North Shore, Kailua, Lanikai, etc.-if you're looking for cheaper parking, park at the Banyan. it's about 2 blocks away from the Renew and significantly cheaper. ($10 a day vs. $22).-if you plan on buying souvenirs, go to the Aloha Stadium swap meet. we snagged 8 tshirts for $20!-take a trip to the supermarket the first day you arrive. you'll save a ton of money on just water alone.",New York,27,5.0

What a great property. Our flight was delayed and we didn't get in until the wee hours of the morning. Even then, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist with chilled pineapple juice and chilled washcloths. We had three city view rooms, two with king beds and one with two doubles. The rooms all had an iron and ironing board, safe big enough for a laptop as well as other articles, a mini-fridge, a hairdryer and robes. The room with two doubles had a projection tv that projected onto the wall over the desk. The beds were very comfortable.Each morning they provided a light breakfast in the lobby. I will agree with other reviews that this area is not very big. In the evening, they had a bar with cocktails and boardgames in the same area.The hotel is located about a block from the beach and they have towels, beach chairs and boogie boards to check out at the reception desk. There is an ABC store right outside the front door that was very convenient. There were several restaurants within a short walk that we tried and really liked. Lulus is just around the block and had awesome Aloha burgers with garlic fries. We also enjoyed the Hula Grill at the Outrigger hotel.The staff at Hotel Renew was fantastic. Rooms were kept very clean, the valet service for our car was great (Will was the best!) and if we needed anything, they helped us out.I would not hesitate going there again and will be recommending it to friends and clients. There is no pool, and I think this was the reason we didn't see any kids here. Our older teens thought it was great though with the ocean so close. The only thing I didn't like was the spotty internet service. I would lose my connection to the internet in the middle of something and have to start over- so that was a frustration. However, I didn't have to pay for the connection, so that was good.There are many things to do and see within a short distance from the hotel. The Honolulu Zoo is just around the corner. The beach is just down the block. The International Market is about a 5 minute walk along with many restaurants and shops. There is also a free shuttle to Hilo Hatties right next door at the Resort Quest hotel.","Denver, Colorado",35,5.0

We decided to stay at this boutique hotel before the conference as we wanted to experience the best of Hawaii. By choosing Hotel Renew, we did choose the BEST.From the moment we booked the room via the internet and contacted Cecilia about a travel agent discount, the service was absolutely terrific!!! Upon arrival we were unsure of where to park our car as they have a small lot. The gentlemen told us ""No worries"" and he parked it for us. At check-in they gave us a hot cloth to freshen up with and some wonderful juice. Once in our room, we were surprised again by the modern touches the hotel had. It was very tech savvy. This was certainly a boutique hotel and very lovely.Breakfast each morning was a treat as the variety and staff were great. Each staff member was always pleasant and warm. They gave us the true experience of Aloha and Mahalo!When we had to check out and move to the convention hotel, we were truly saddened as we went from being treated as welcome valuable guests at this smaller, but outstanding hotel, to being treated as just a number at the big Resort Hotel.As a lifelong hotelier of 30 years and an avid traveler, I would stay at no other hotel in this area whenever I return. This hotel is the trued meaning of what customer service is all about.My only regrets are that we had to leave this hotel and that it has taken me this long to thank them for the OUTSTANDING JOB they do. It was obvious it starts with ownership as one of the owners helped us with our luggage and he set the standard. He truly cared about his guests.

After Will and Grace kindly greeted us upon our arrival, we went to our room and unpacked--there was plenty of clean and nice closet and drawer space for our things. The bed was really soft and cozy, so every night we fell asleep quick. There was nothing uncomfortable about our stay at Hotel Renew. The staff even remembered that it was my boyfriend's birthday on July 4th, and when we came back to the room from our trip to the water park, there was a small box of cookies and a card from the hotel staff and management wishing him a happy birthday! Everyone who worked there were genuinely happy, friendly, and helpful, and that made this hotel feel like home while we were there.Location was GREAT too--just across the street from the beautiful beach!

Hotel Renew was great, and we're definitely staying there again the next time we go to Oahu. But, if you're looking for the big fancy busy chain type hotel this might not be for you.Just to make it easy this is what we liked about the place:- Small/cozy hotel in Waikiki, but not in the busy area of town. Still close enough to walk to the busy part of town though.- Staff was great (everyone from the bell boys, concierge, and cleaning staff)- Some of the workers we talked to even gave us some good recommendations on where to eat out and hang out at night- Really nice rooms, comfortable beds- 1 block from the beach- Walking distance (about 2 miles) from Diamond Head- Younger crowd there. Most guests we saw were in their 20's/30's- They let us use one of the rooms (hospitality room) for a couple of hours so we could shower before we left for the airport at night- The hotel is smaller, so it's a much more personal atmosphere. Some of the staff eventually knew our names and room #- When we checked out there were a couple of things that were wrong on our bill, but they took it off immediately w/o giving us a hard time- Breakfast was included. Nothing fancy (coffee, tea, cereal, fruit, bread/pastries) but enough to get your morning started.- They have an affiliation w/Enterprise which makes it easy to rent cars- They loan out beach towels & boogie boards for freeThere were only a couple of things we didn't like too much, but were understandable:- There's no parking, only a $22 valet for every 24 hrs you park your car. But parking in Waikiki is pain in itself- Since there's usually 1 or 2 ppl working the front desk, you sometimes have to wait a little long before you can talk to someone- This doesn't apply to all rooms, but ours had a projector instead of a plasma TV like the other rooms. It made it kinda hard to watch TV when we wanted to, but we were in Hawaii, so that was the last thing on our list of things to do.Other than that we hope to be back in the next year at Hotel Renew.","Marina del Rey, California",16,5.0

So much so, that we actually wound up coming back at the end of our trip. We made a pretty impromptu trip to Hawaii after finding out at the last minute that we'd both have some time off of work at the same time. I scoured tripadvisor for hours (maybe days) trying to find the perfect hotel- good location with ocean views, at a reasonable rate. We knew we wouldn't be in the hotel much so we didn't want to waste money splurging on anything too expensive, but we did want to come back to a moderately comfortable room at the end of a long day in the beach. Hotel Renew completely exceeded our expectations and turned out to be absolutely perfect. Our room was beautiful, incredibly clean, with direct ocean views and a lanai and was a treat to come home to each night. The bed was SO comfortable, the room very zen- just wonderful! I'd highly recommend spending the money to get an ocean deluxe room, it was just great. In addition to the awesome room, the staff at Hotel Renew also rocked. When we arrived to check in, we were greeted with glasses of chilled pineapple juice and some cold towels. We really needed that after sweating it in the sun on the drive over. They showed us around our room, brought bags up within minutes, shared recommendations for restaurants (found our favorite sushi place, Sansei, that way) and were just very gracious in every way.Another plus for us was the complimentary breakfast. We enjoyed it every morning, and were glad it saved us a bit of money! The options were great- lots of fresh fruit (mainly pineapple, melon, and berries), granola, yogurt, breads, pastries, muffins, pineapple juice, coffee, tea. It was also very nice to be able to borrow towels, boogie boards, umbrellas, and beach mats for free, and then take the two minute walk to the beach. Wireless internet was also complimentary in our rooms, which was great. The only thing that was a bit on the high-end, pricewise, was parking. $22 a day. We came to terms with it because most hotels were about $10-15 a day for parking and didn't include many of the complimentary things (wi-fi, breakfast, beach stuff) that this hotel did. In the end, we are so happy we stayed here and would definitely come back. We ended up taking a few days to go up to the North Shore but came back to Hotel Renew for our last night in Hawaii because we loved it so much. We are newlyweds in our twenties and it was very romantic, but I'm sure any and everyone would be more than impressed with this place. We saw plenty of other couples of many ages, families, and groups of friends staying here. It's got the perfect location, great staff, and wonderful accommodations.

You can read my trip report in the Oahu forums for backup.We are fans of boutique hotels, contemporary designs, clean and well-priced. The Renew was all of the above. Check in was easy and quick and we were upgraded to an ocean view room on the 6th floor that was amazing- (didn't realize until the morning when we opened our shades what a lovely view we had!) nice cool towels and pineapple juice upon arrival.There is literally an ABC store a foot away (and one on every corner for that matter) but made things very conveinent for picking up water, wine, tylenol, nail polish etc.The breakfast was perfectly filling, and free- so you can't top that. We did valet park each night for $22, and found the valet guys to be really nice and relatively quick.Rooms weren't huge, but perfectly comfortable, as we didn't spend too much time in the room-it's hawaii! The beds were incredibly comfortable and the AC always seemed to be at the right temp.

From manager to cleaning staff nothing but good things to day. Only drawback was our room the first night was on a low floor and we got a lot of street noise. Spoke to a management guy (they own more than one hotel) and a window replacement project in the works. We were moved to a higher floor and everything was quiet. We booked through a hotle booking website and I can say with certainity, this is the best value in Oahu.

It was a really nice hotel, even though some of the poor designs were annoying (like the sink design, poor bathroom lighting, and tiny breakfast bar). It's a beautiful hotel, newly renovated. Very clean and nice rooms. The hotel staff was very freindly and helpful. Don't expect to find a gym, pool, or vending machines like a normal hotel though. Just a block away from the beach, so it is noisy, but the A/C covers the sound mostly. Internet was fast, and cable was okay.The only downsides to the stay was the bad maid service and the noisy rooms (due to being close to Waikiki). Half the time, the maid forgot to give us pillow covers, shampoo, conditioner, wash clothes, etc. She also touched and moved our stuff around, which is unacceptable.

We had high hopes for Hotel Renew. The best way I can describe it, is that it was exactly as I expected and hoped for based on the reviews here. I loved the design of the hotel and rooms. The beds were divine. The location was fabulous - less than a block to the beach and only a few minutes to the restaurants and shops of Waikiki. The staff was wonderful and very helpful in providing public transportation advice and driving directions around the island. The breakfast was perfect for us - although I would agree that there are too few tables. Coffee and ice water are available all day. The towels, chairs, and boogie boards were a wonderful bonus. The free internet was great, and we didn't find it to be too slow. We did not have a car overnight, so I cannot comment on the valet parking. As everyone else has said, there is no pool, but we didn't even miss having one.The few negatives were the lack of seating in the breakfast area and the lighting in the bathroom was too dim for me.

The entire hotel decor is done in a light and dark style that reminded us both of the Hudson Hotel in NYC. The bed was very comfortable, although our AC apparently ramped down at some point during the night, making the down comforter too warm. The bed, comforter and pillows are all feather and/or down, which we loved but which might cause a problem for allergy sufferers.The clean lines, beautiful decor and friendly staff really did make it feel like a place of renewal, which was great since we did not love the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. In every interaction with the staff, they were great -- gave us directions, let us use their desk printer to print out our airline confirmations, etc. No reasonable request is denied, and all customers are met with a smile (at least in every interaction we saw).Downsides for us? The $22 charge for the requisite valet parking (not a huge deal, but a slight annoyance), and the fact that this great hotel is in Waikiki, a place that annoyed us to the point that we'll probably never go back.

My first visit was during Christmas 2009 when I connected with my husband who works overseas. This time my friend and I visited for Memorial Day weekend. I was a little worried about her opinion of the place as she was very concerned about not being close enough to the beach. I am happy to report she loved the décor of the hotel and found the staff helpful with any questions. Colby, the bartender recommended a place for dinner one night. My friend also had no complaints about the proximity of the beach. One day as we were walking to the beach my friend decided she needed an umbrella and was about to pay $10. I mentioned to her the hotel offered them for free. The next day we went to get our beach items and they asked if she needed an umbrella again (the completely remembered her). As I mentioned before this was my second stay and I loved it even more. I am planning another short stop over hopefully by the end of this year. I love the location of the hotel and the uniqueness of the décor. The staff is extremely helpful and addresses any concerns you bring to their attention. This trip I even found a handwritten note from the staff thanking me for my return visit (nice touch). The happy hour is a great deal with cocktails starting at $5. Jackie makes lovely drinks and makes you feel completely welcome (she remembered me from my first visit too). Lastly, I think it’s a bonus that the hotel offers beach towels, beach mats, umbrellas, and I understand boogie and surf boards. All these items for free. The internet is also free unlike many larger chain hotels.

Not once were we disappointed.

The hotel does not have a pool so when we arrived to a closed beach for three days we chose to sitesee instead. It may have an option, but perhaps having an agreement with next door's hotel to use their pool would be a good option. Parking is expensive at $20! so we chose to rent a car daily instead. However, when the beach did open, Renew loans out towels, umbrellas, boogy boards, all for free, so just ask. It saves money on the beach!I organize high class events for my investment management company and I have to say that I have never encountered such amazing staff as at this hotel.

So, we booked the Renew based solely on the Number 1 status on Tripadvisor. As our trip got closer, I started to read some of the forum threads on here ( you know the ones ) and started to panic a bit. Now, the wife and I had just gotten off a 2 week cruise before arriving in Honolulu, so we'd been used to a tiny, cramped stateroom on there (not that we cared). By comparison the rooms at Renew are quite spacious, and we both really liked the decor and design. It was actually a room we didn't mind spending time in, which is always nice. We didn't actually think much of Honolulu, so we did spend a bit of time in the room. The bed was comfy, but the air conditioner was a bit of a hassle. It was right next to the bed, and pretty loud (it'd wake us up as it kicked in overnight). The room did get quite hot without it).The staff I can't really fault. Everyone we spoke to was very helpful and helped us out with our sightseeing etc. No complaints there. I don't think I ran into the head housekeeper lady, but we did speak to 2 other cleaning staff and they were both really nice to their credit. So, the staff we think are very good.Breakfast was included, and did the job, but it wasn't great by any means. They seriously need some more chairs down there :D It filled us up though which is what you're after in the long run.I do think the hotel is overpriced for what you get, but as I said above, I was pretty much attracted by the number 1 rating on here (before I'd read up on the history). To sum up, I think the place is fine for a 1 to 2 night stay. I wouldn't stay here any longer than that I don't think. And for us to want to stay here again, they'd have to drop the price by a good $20 or so I think.","Melbourne, Australia",8,3.0

I didn't have a terrible experience nor did I have the most exceptional experience. The hotel really for us, was a place to take a shower and sleep between our busy days. The good part about the hotel is that it is not a tourist or commercial hotel. If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the busy streets of Waikiki, I suggest staying here. The bed was very comfortable and spacious. The staff was friendly and tried to accommodate any of our needs. When we needed a rental car, they were able to find the best value for us. They also provided towels and boogie boards (note: they were more like children's kickboards). Now some bad parts of the hotel is that if you didn't turn up your AC, it would get hot and humid very fast (like it was all the time in the hallways). The worst part is the lack of water pressure in the showers, the showers at the beach have better pressure. The walls are thin, so noise control is a problem. We heard children and a dog next door as well as people slamming their room door (and don't forget the loud drunken groups of men prowling the streets late at night, but that happens everywhere). The valet staff were not as knowledgeable about the island when we asked questions about where to go and how to get there. And I didn't get the 'family' feel that a lot of the reviews gave here. I witnessed it, but didn't experience it. I just felt like a regular guest at any other hotel, so some of these reviews may skew your opinion of the staff and your expectations. The staff recognized us, but weren't jumping out of their seat to make our stay any more memorable than the next couple walking in. Like I said before, the hotel wasn't a place where we spent most of our time. So if you're taking a vacation that involves a lot of bedroom time, don't stay here (due to lack of room service any other amenities). But if you're looking for a quaint place to sleep that is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable, this hotel will suffice. Our vacation was weighted more on the activities rather than the hotel itself. Could it have been better? Yes, but it was enough and it didn't make or break our vacation.

We were pleasantly surprised at the proximity to the Waikiki beachfront, but this didn't quite take the edge off the $AUD485 a night tariff. The rooms and corridors are already starting to show signs of wear.The refurbishment has left the room a bit pokey, and it quickly becomes cluttered. Our suite had an impressive ocean outlook, but there was no balcony, and the airconditioning unit made it awkward to admire the view. There was no insect screen on the window, although we were not bothered by any bugs -- even with the window open all night. The bed was outstanding.One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of seating in the breakfast area. There are only five tables for a 70-room hotel: woefully inadequate.",Perth,12,3.0

The bed, in particular, is fabulous! The small lobby is a serene place to hang out. But perhaps the best part about the hotel is the staff -- they will assist you in finding the best local restaurants (try Pearl for Vietnamese and Uncle Bo's for Pacific Rim cuisine), organizing a day trip to the stunning north shore, and making the most out of Waikiki. The hotel does not have any outdoor space, and it would have been nice if they had designed a roof deck bar or something along those lines.

From the valet attendants, to the check in staff..this hotel was really cool. There are better hotels which are typically more expensive in the Waikiki area but this really felt like a seasoned travelers hotel. Though it has a walking proximity to the beach, small bar-with limited hours-though Colby does make pretty good drinks at the bar, no refrigerators...they call them environmentally friendly drink coolers. Well they look like old beat up fridges that have the coolant removed. Don't tease the guests..if you don't want fridges then remove the placeholders. They even tell you that if you want them to be cooler you can get the ice off the 5th floor..(environmental trade-off??)The thing that makes this hotel awesome is the staff. Even though we went Island hopping for a couple of days, when we returned they treated us like returning family. The hotel possesses a southeastern Asian calmness.

No gym, no lanai, no restaurant, a bar that is only open a few hours every night, a mediocre continental breakfast in a tight little space (also doubles as the bar at night).

I was admittedly a bit concerned after subsequently reading some TA forum comments about possible ""planted"" reviews; however, having now stayed there, I can honestly endorse all the positive comments made about Hotel Renew. My basic requirements for a hotel stay is that the place is clean, quiet, comfortable and safe. Hotel Renew checks off all those boxes, with some nice extras such as early check-in, in-room safe, bathrobes, borrowing beach chairs and towels, etc. The rooms really are lovely - my husband and I stayed in an King Ocean View room and it was well worth it. My uber-selective spouse even said he'd stay there again, which is high praise indeed (although I suspect the presence of the wide screen TV in the room may have helped)! As already noted in other reviews, the staff is indeed very friendly, efficient and expedient with requests (a big thank you to our housekeeper Mary Jane, who kept our room pristine for our week-long stay). The hotel is at the quieter end of Waikiki Beach, about a block from the Zoo. Its location helps in reducing traffic and other ""beach buzz"" noise but the main Waikiki shopping/restaurant strip and its conveniences are less than a minute's walk.

I am very, VERY picky about the hotel we stay in so the reviews and the great rate we got won me over. Usually, it is just my husband and I traveling but this was our first ""family vacation"". That means my husband and I, 7 & 5 year old boys and our toddler daughter. First impressions are amazing here! We were greeted with wonderful scented towels and the best pineapple juice served in chilled glasses. The boys really thought that was cool. The hotel is beautifully decorated! You can tell someone spent a lot of time thoughtfully planning each detail.Our room was lovely and while it was a little small, it did fit 2 double beds and a hotel provided crib (another plus!). Great touches included the fridge, the fun lighting (our kids were fascinated by it), the bedding and the free wifi. The projector TV was not as practical with a big family since someone was always in the way but it would be a neat touch if we had left them at home! The staff was SO genuinely friendly and helpful. We loved the beach towel check out and the boogie boards they had available for us to borrow. I thought the breakfast was great but my husband and the kids were not as impressed. I would not say it was the most kid friendly food ever but they all LOVED the pineapple juice. Valet was super fast and very helpful as well. Housekeeping was so accommodating - we asked for extra towels a couple of times and to have the bed linens changed 1/2 way through our stay and everything was done promptly. The front desk staff even let me print out our boarding passes on their computers.I gave it a 5 but my only complaint as far as cleanliness was the rubber bath mat. I put it down in the bath to bathe my toddler and when I pulled it up I noticed there was mold underneath the suction cups. Not a huge deal - I just rolled it up and put it aside for the rest of our stay. I'm just a little anal about that sort of thing!

Let me begin by stating that I am VERY picky about hotels, and can assure anyone staying at this hotel - you'll have nothing to worry about. Now, I wasn't looking for a ""resort-type"" hotel, and if that is what you want - you'll need a large chain. I, on the other hand, prefer the modern boutique-style hotel, and am willing to sacrifice a pool (there is a beautiful ocean outside), a gym (I exercised outside in perfect weather conditions), and a restaurant (I don't need access to restaurant food 24/7, and besides there are plenty of restaurants/bars/fast food/ABC stores next door - read on for Hotel Renew breakfast comments). Upon arrival, we were greeted with warm towels and sweet pineapple juice. Our check-in was flawless and our room on the 7th floor (not an ocean view room) was very clean. The staff was impeccable! I have never stayed in a hotel where ALL staff were equally courteous and more importantly genuine. The complimentary breakfast from 7:30am - 9:30am was more than adequate with endless fruit, granola, pastries, yogurt, coffee, tea and the like. In Waikiki, this breakfast would cost you at least $30 each morning. The hotel also provided the local paper and WSJ to read daily. Although there is limited seating, I didn't find it a problem. Noise was not an issue in the rooms, and the bed was heavenly. Our room had a King size bed, safe, and fridge. The light settings were phenomenal, and I applaud the Eco friendly atmosphere. The complimentary robes and free wi-fi were also a nice touch. Valet parking was prompt and helpful. Another perk were the clean towels provided for beach use as often as you'd like. The hotel is within walking distance to the marketplace, the shops of Kalakaua blvd, and most importantly a 30 second walk to the beach. There is an ABC store next door for your grocery needs, and a Starbucks around the corner for your espresso fix. Finally our departure flight was roughly 11pm and the hotel assisted us with a late check out, luggage storage, and allowed us to freshen up in an unoccupied room prior to our trip to the airport - (which was greatly appreciated). My only complaints (which I overlooked due to the many pros of this hotel) were the lack of fans in the bathroom, and the hallway appeared somewhat unfinished in the remodel. Overall, my husband and I are renewed!","Seattle, WA",14,5.0

To show us how to get to one place he recommended, the bartender even took out a guidebook for tourists and made a photocopy of the relevant pages so we could take them with us to find our way.

I'm no big fan of huge resort-like hotels (we mostly stayed in B&Bs or small hotel the rest of the holiday), so this place seemed the ideal choice: no swimming pool, fitness center, restaurants or other amenities, great location and reasonable pricing. After all, we came here for the ocean (not to swim in a pool), and Waikiki is packed with restaurants and all other amenities... it's a 3 minutes walk at worst.The place is very near the ocean, as there's only the ResortQuest between it and the waterfront. If you're at least a few floors up (we were at 8th) you get a great ocean view, and if you have a corner you'll also be able to see Diamond Head. Commanding, and romantic. The rooms have modern-style furnishing, and everything is almost brand new and immaculately clean and well kept. There's free high-speed WiFi Internet access.The one thing we really liked in this place was the kind and helpful staff, which really doesn't make you feel like a number as it happens in other hotels in very touristic places. Everybody, from valets (Tyler, Paul and Kris were all so nice) to barmen to folks at reception (Robert, you're very helpful and fun as well), always had a word to share. We we got there, I went inside the valet-only parking with my car by mistake (the sign isn't tat clear, actually, a big red ""Do Not Enter"" would do much better) and I found myself among cars packed like Tetris pieces and wasn't able to exit: Tyler was really kind and without a problem solved the situation, always being courteous.There is a complimentary breakfast, which is actually more than enough to kick your day off (well, we're Italian and don't eat too much at breakfast, maybe it's not enough if you're used to a cooked breakfast) - anyhow, all the parts of a continental breakfast are available here. There are not many tables, but it's a 5 minutes wait in the worst case, and you can also use the sofa at the front desk: nobody cares - we were even allowed to change some clothes there the last day after returning from the beach, staff is really great in making you feel comfortable. There's a bar in the hall (which is a relaxing and intimate place, by the way): it's never crowded, so it's perfect for an evening mai tai.The hotel has no parking unless you use the valet, which I highly recommend. It's a kind-of-steep US$ 20.00 per day (but they gave us the last day free as we had an evening flight!), but it's really handy as you can take and return your car how many times per day you want at no extra charge, and you'll avoid feeding parking machines all the time.All in all, we found this place really lovely: it's laid back and relaxing, but still right in the middle of Waikiki action - the crowds are just 50 meters away. Would definitely choose it again if going back to Hawaii (which I really hope, but it won't be that soon I fear ;-)).","Maniago, Italy",100,5.0

You do the math. It's easily filled up and people are waiting for you to finish so they can take your table. Not exactly consistent with the relaxing ambiance the hotel wants to maintain.

As my friend and I are just that, friends, we weren't about to share a small double bed. They didn't have any rooms with separate beds available until a couple days into our stay (and truth be told, I was on the verge of losing it because I did specifically ask about separate beds weeks in advance), but were nice enough to upgrade us to a room with a king bed, which was large enough for two and everything worked out fine. Our new room had a view of the loading dock, but they didn't charge us for the changed room and were very nice and apologetic about the whole thing so we opted not to switch hotels. Otherwise we loved our stay. The location is perfectly situated half a block from the beach so no complaints there either. The room was really lovely...reminded me of the W...modern, clean lines, trendy. The sheets were out of this world (it was hard to leave the bed in the morning) and I couldn't tell any difference from higher-end hotels that I stay in regularly for business. We especially loved the daily, complimentary continental breakfast (I missed my morning dose of fruit and pineapple juice when I got back!). The highlight of our stay was the staff...extremely friendly and responsive to our every request (and we had a lot of requests!). They were great about providing beach supplies like mats and chairs, directing us to the local public transportation when we wanted to be adventurous and then securing a rental car for us when we tired of taking the bus. They had great suggestions for good places for dinner and live music as well. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and I would definitely return!","San Francisco, CA",1,5.0

Reception area looks very nice and cool. A much different style than most other hotels in Waikiki, that is much older style in general. Rooms are nice and spacious, with a good cleaning standard. Bathrooms are also nice, modern and clean. Rooms have safe without charge.Breakfast is included, and is nice. Croissants, Muffins, Yoghurt, Fresh fruits etc. Only problem can be that there are only 4 small tables, but then you can just bring the breakfast to your room and eat there.The location of the hotel is nice, and on the east side of Waikiki Beach. In my opinion you have the nicest of all beaches in Waikiki just at the Renew, because the sand is the finest of all the beaches. When you want to go eat however, you will usually have to walk along the beach road to get to the area with most restaurants. Only 5-10 minutes walk though.Hotel offers free Wi Fi and the staff is extremely service minded and smiling! There is no pool in the hotel, so you have to enjoy the beach instead.Hotel is offering the service to lend out Beach chairs, Beach umbrellas and more, which is nice, as the beachguys charge 10 USD per hour for a set of 2 chairs and a sun umbrella. Can get expensive for a whole day...In general restaurant prices are very OK. Not expensive, not cheap. There is something for everyone though. I can recommend Cheesecake factory in the cheaper end, and NOBU in the more expensive end. If you want to go out in the evening and have a few drinks in a lounge atmosphere, try to go to RUM FIRE at the Sheraton Waikiki. Great cocktails and cool atmosphere just on the beach...","Copenhagen, Denmark",44,5.0

Staff were also friendly, and recommended great local eateries and destinations for us to explore.

The continental breakfast they offered was a great way to begin the day. Our room was a bit small, but considering that we spent very little time inside the room, it was never a problem. The room was very well appointed, and relaxing. There were times when we heard live music emanating from one of the hotels down the block in the evenings, which may be a problem if you want to go to bed early, but it wasn't a problem for us.

This is a small ""boutique-style"" hotel located a block and a half from the beach with a fabulous staff and extremely comfortable rooms. We were able to book a ""Fun in the Sun"" package which turned out to be a great deal (many hotel packages are not). For $199 per night we got a king room, breakfast each day, complimentary cocktails (one each) and a convertible car delivered right to the hotel. The only ""hidden cost"" we discovered was that we had to pay for valet parking but I assume that the lot does not belong to the hotel so they have to pass the cost onto their guests.The rooms are not large (very few rooms in Honolulu are) but they have made excellent use of the space they have with very modern decor and windows along one whole wall that are covered with sliding shutters (not curtains) so the room seems even larger. We did upgrade to a higher floor and I would warn guests to beware of ocean view rooms on the lower floors since they look over the pool deck of the hotel across the street that hosts frequent late-night parties. The higher floors are absolutely silent.Because the hotel is small, the staff gets to know you but they do not overdo the use of your name - the friendliness is just right. We were having a package delivered to the hotel that was delayed by the shipper but arrived just before we checked out and I felt that the desk staff was as excited as we were that it arrived in time.The hotel does not have a full restaurant - just a small area off the lobby for breakfast and evening cocktails - but it is all you need when there are so many great restaurants within a short walk. The breakfast featured fresh-squeezed juice (including the sweetest pineapple) and delicious pastries. The bartender in the evening made a wonderful Cosmo for me and the best Mojito my husband had on our whole vacation.We could not think of anything negative about this property and many of the other guests we met felt the same way. We would recommend this property to anyone (although we did not see a lot of children around) and we will definitely stay here again when we return to Honolulu.","Hilton Head, South Carolina",13,5.0

Booked a city view king room at the start, and splurged on a premier ocean view room at the end.Both times we arrived we had early morning arrivals, first time arriving around 9am and was able to check in right away which was a bonus after an overnight flight from Australia. The second time we had an overnight flight from Vegas which arrived at 6am. Knowing it would be highly unlikely we could check in right away we left our bags with reception and went and had breakfast, then by the time we came back our room was ready, and it wasn't even 9am. The staff at all times were amazing and extremely friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. We were offered juice and a refreshing cool towel upon our arrival which was most welcome. Upon our checkout the first time we actually both received a hug! I can honestly say no other hotel has had staff hugging us as as we left.Both rooms we stayed in were terrific. The city view room was just as nice as the premier ocean view, very comfortable bed, nice shower, great flat screen tv, free wireless access. What i didn't notice the first time but used a lot the second time was they had an actual computer in the room from which we could use the internet. We didn't have a laptop so this was so handy for sending emails and surfing the net. In all the hotels i've stayed in i've never encountered one that provided an actual computer! The view from the premier ocean view room was great, though it was a bit noisier than the city view room as it overlooked the hotel pool next door, which featured loud music, though it finished reasonably early (i think by 10pm).Breakfast was provided in the lobby area, nice muffins and danishes and juices which was a good start to the day. Free newspapers were also provided.Location is in the eastern part of Waikiki, near the zoo. We were feeling energetic one day and walked to Ala Moana shopping center, which took us about 40 minutes. If you are looking for a great burger then you have to go to Teddy's Burgers around the corner, one of the best burgers we've ever had.The hotel isn't for everyone though. If you're expecting a resort type hotel with a great pool then look elsewhere as you won't find it here. If that isn't important then this is one of the best hotels in Honolulu you can stay in. We stayed in the Ohana East 7 months prior to this and while that was nice, Hotel Renew leaves it for dead.Next time we return to Honolulu we would stay here again without hesitation.","Melbourne, Australia",39,5.0

We definitely agreed with what everyone has been saying about this place - just wanted to summarize the pros and cons we found...First the pros: probably the best thing about the hotel is the staff. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. We were always greeted with smiles and friendly attitudes. The rooms are very clean and modern, with plenty of storage space. Pretty standard amenities. Another great aspect of the hotel is the free beach equipment - chairs, towels, mats, etc. The hotel is conveniently located about a block away from the beach, so its easily walkable with all the gear. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but they do have a small bar/lounge area where there is free continental breakfast every morning - fresh fruit, pastries, cereal - a nice way to start off the day. Another note about the location, its basically on the very east end of Waikiki, so its not quite as crowded as some of the other hotels along the beach.Now for some of the cons: It can get loud at night since the hotel is sandwiched between a major resort and two youth hostels. You get all sorts of noise from the outdoor restaurants and the rented motor scooters driving up and down the street behind the hotel. There was also construction occuring on the street behind the hotel which woke us up pretty early in the morning. Probably the most frustrating was the wireless internet connection which is really really slow (slower than old time dial-up!) and spotty. Also, we didn't realize this, but there is no self-park for cars, so you have to pay $20/day for the valet.Overall we enjoyed our stay especially for the price compared to some of the bigger resorts in Waikiki, and we would definitely stay again our next trip to Honolulu!",Illinois,6,4.0

The convenience to the Waikiki strip is excelent located less than half a block from the beach itself. Positives: very pleasant and helpful staff at all times during my stay- obviously professional and well trained in guest relations. At one point, I even had a fall during a sightseeing activity and the staff (paricularly the front desk manager for the shift and a bellman) were able to provide a needed transfer to a handicap shower equipped room . On these particular qualities, I would rank as excellent.  Negatives: the hotel is located behind another much larger property that and overlooks that property's pool and outdoor lounge area- the problem is that loud music booms out from this area and is able to be heard at one point after midnight- also traffic noise is rather distict during the day and jackhammer/other loud construction noises were troublesome during my stay- however, I don't blame the hotel for this. Also, the hotel has a small bar area that is only minimally stocked with basic cocktail essentials- also at 5:00 PM the bar is still closed- think that it should be open at the tradtional ""happy hour"" time. Overall, a generally pleasant experience except for the noise. Kudos to the staff for their professionalism and the maintainence of the property.","Hickory, North Carolina",24,4.0

I arrived at the hotel after a long delayed flight (waiting 2 hours on the tarmac, then a 6 hour flight), completely exhausted. When the shuttle (airport shuttle- the hotel renew does not have its own) pulled up to the hotel, I almost thought I must have the wrong place! It seemed far too fancy for the price I paid; the lobby is gorgeous, almost downright intimidating for me! But the staff were absolutely welcoming, explaining themselves and the hotel's services briefly but fully as I checked in, as they clearly saw how tired I was feeling! As a bonus, they had a fresh glass of pineapple juice and washcloth waiting for me when I arrived; very refreshing, I definitely needed it, and it made me feel very welcome.My room was incredibly comfortable, so much so that my exhausted (I had been working 3 weeks solid before leaving) self stayed in there for almost all the days I was in Honolulu... a waste, perhaps, but it speaks well to the comforts of the room. The beds are great, there's a great view from the balcony, excellent tub and shower (strange sinks, but who really cares) and even free internet access, although the connection was mediocre. The hotel would have arranged tours and such for me, but I didn't have the energy at that point... instead I took advantage of their offers of free beach towels and spent my time at the beach not two blocks away! It's very close to the Diamond Head hike, as well- too much walking for me, but I'm sure all of my more outdoorsy friends would have loved the location!In Honolulu, you probably can't find something better without paying a lot more, and I give lots of credit to the staff's hard work for that!","Vancouver, Canada",18,5.0

You basically need to do their valet for $20 a day (with in and out privleges) or you will be feeding a meter all day. We were confused with the proper way to turn in our car, but once we figured it all out we were happy to see that the hotel is trendy, but intimate and very nice. The staff is friendly and they greet you with lemon grass scented wet towels and chilled pineapple juice. We went up to the room and were happy to see that it was nicely decorated with a large tv (full cable and even some HD options) and a great bathroom with lovely products and plenty of towels. It was our honeymoon so they had a bottle of (actually nice) champagne set out for us. All the rooms have fruit in them as well. The lighting is great and you can control every aspect of it. You have a choice of bright, night and just right. Just right setting is a very romatic, soft lighting. There is a mini fridge and the bed is amazing. Super comfortable with a fluffy duvet and nice feather pillows as well and standard pillows for those who like them a bit bigger and firmer. You can control the air conditioning and there are shades that provide a nice, near blackout effect. The bad thing is that you are offset in an alley and the ocean view is not front and center. You have a large hotel in your way that is super loud and has live music well into the night and (unbelievably) early in the morning. The hotel is very into recycling ( hence the name) so they provide a separate trashcan in the room and the place was made to be green. The water saving shower heads are a nice touch. The complimentary continental breakfast is a cut above. The lobby is so small, that it is awkward to maneuver around the small space they have allotted for this. Also seating leaves something to be desired. However, they have gone a step beyond the normal apples and oranges, boxed cereals and packaged muffins. They have fresh berries and pineapple for you along with various types of melon. They have granola, high fiber cereal and yogurt. The pastries are dainty and tasty and are not pre packaged. They have a nice tea chest out and decent coffee, as well as orange juice and hard boiled eggs. We did this every morning we were there. We happened to be in Honolulu with high winds, which apparantly set off the fire alarm. It was a pretty frightening, and bad way to start the morning. We all evacuated down the stairs and stood outside in the wind while they tried to turn off the loud and jarring alarm.Overall, our stay here was nice.

It makes getting ready (with 2 people) really difficult. The hallways/corridors were a little bit sketchy with electrical wires hanging down from the ceiling exposed.

Having stayed in Waikiki for a third winter holiday in a row now, we have seen most of what the hotels and Honolulu can offer. Suffice it to say, that after our time there, it was difficult to leave and come back to our Vancouver storm warnings. This hotel rocks for three reasons: Comfort (beds, overall cleanliness), attentive and excellent Staff (Tina who kept our room so clean and tidy - as does William Mawk who is a brilliant ray of sunshine in an already sunny place) and design. If you've heard of the Halekulani, Westin Moana Surfrider, etc - they just don't hold a candle. They are more than twice the price, the rooms and common areas are not as nice (although those two mentioned do have incredible grounds - and great restaurants that you have to experience - like the Room Without a Key) - but they just don't compare to the Hotel Renew. It is a small hotel, but is truly a Wow experience. They have set the bar for the other 'high end' hotels and will do well competing for clients in this down-market economy. One note: this is a small boutique hotel with NO amenities - so don't come prepared to visit the pool or use the gym! Those amenities are nearby - and you can pay to use them - but really - the ocean is warm and useable, and there is a gym down the street - so I can't imagine staying anywhere else in the near future!Thanks to all the staff who made our stay simply fantastic!",Vancouver,2,5.0

We chose this hotel primarily from the good reviews given in Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. Having arrived very early we were offered an upgrade sea view room which we duly accepted. Our room was modern, clean and bright with a comfortable bed and a compact workable bathroom. Our stay was unfortunately affected by storms which caused local flooding in and around the island. The Renew also suffered for a brief period with all available staff 'manning the pumps' in removing storm water from the stairs and lobby area. During our stay we were invited to attend a drinks/buffet reception as an opportunity to meet other guests as well as staff, which was very much appreciated. The Renew is relatively small by comparison to the high rise hotel blocks that front Waikiki Beach, which was our principle reason for staying here, preferring boutique style accommodation where possible.We would specially like to thank Will Micheals ( Bell/Valet) for his kindness, help and good humour in directing us each day to nice restaurants and other attractions close to the hotel. Although the hotel has limited facilities such as a pool, restaurant, lounge etc. this is more that compensated for the warmth and friendliness of the staff.

But we didn’t spend a lot of time in the room in the first place. It was a quiet hotel which is important to me since I’m a light sleeper. And yes, the air conditioning units do make noise but we didn’t mind that at all since it drowned out any street noise.

Our overall experience was excellent, and I would highly recommend this hotel property, with one caution that I will address later in this review.The hotel is small --- 83 rooms --- and does not have a restaurant. However, there is a lovely lounge just off the chic lobby where a hearty Continental style breakfast is served every morning (included in room rate). The breakfast includes fresh island fruits, juices, coffee/tea, pastries, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs. Just enough to start the day!The decor of the hotel's public spaces and rooms is modern and sleek, featuring dark woods, light-colored walls, tile and marble bathrooms, and adjustable mood lighting. Room window are large and can be opened for fresh air, and 25% of the rooms have private balconies featuring a small table and two chairs. The hotel is spotlessly clean.The hotel's location could not be more perfect if you don't need to stay directly on the beach. It is one short block from Kuhio Beach to the West and a short block from Kapiolani Park and the Honolulu Zoo to the South. Because all beaches in Hawaii are public, it is no problem to use the Kuhio Beach or the Queen's Beach (just two blocks from the hotel to the South). Both beaches offer restroom facilities.The hotel staff is among the best to be found in Hawaii. Everyone we encountered during our four day stay was attentive, friendly, welcoming, and extremely professional. From the front desk staff to the bellmen to the housekeepers --- we felt like we were among Ohana (Hawaiian for ""family"").The only drawback about the hotel is that the rooms located on the South side of the buidling facing Diamond Head are subject to some pretty terrible noise. The South side of the hotel faces the delivery entrance of the Resort Quest Hotel next door, and during most daylight hours there are trucks making deliveries. Of course, if you plan to be at the beach or out touring all day, then the noise is not a problem. However, if you plan to take an afternoon nap, bring ear plugs.That said, Hotel Renew is a lovely addition to Waikiki Beach.

My wife and I also met a corporate representative from the hotel, who was very cordial, and if I can find his card I'll contact him about this as well.

Face it, Waikiki is noisy. tour busses, night clubs and rowdy people are common, so at night I expect it to be loud. But at 6:00 am, people servicing the hotel industry there don't put fourth the effort to consider the hotel visitors, as they unload dairy products, or pick up trash.

I stayed here for four nights on a vacation. The place was clean and the staff was always very friendly and accommodating. Excellent breakfast and valet parking. Comfy bed and room layout, with good room service. The location is excellent though one hotel back from the beach. My room was on a high floor and I had both a sunset view and a Diamond Head view. Cool! Unfortunately I also had a view of the bar/pool area of the hotel next door (ResortQuest), which had loud music from about 5pm to 8pm every night, and until 11 pm on the holiday I was there for. It was not horribly loud or horribly late, but I would have enjoyed the stay more without the disturbance from next door. All too typical of Waikiki, unfortunately.If I stayed here again I would request a room without a view, so I would be on the side opposite the loud hotel.

I had done a lot of research to select a suitable hotel in Honolulu, as we had been travelling around with another couple for 2 weeks previous, and wanted to stay somewhere special, being alone at last!! Unfortunately, Hotel Renew, much like Honolulu itself, does NOT deliver - for me anyway. The hotel itself is quite nice in terms of it's renovation. However, if you look closely - it has been done roughly, thus appears cheap, in parts. I am fussy though, as I work in the building industry. We stayed in an ocean view room, which had a good view of the water/sunset over Waikiki. However, as the hotel is relatively small, it is dwarfed by surrounding hotels, and our aspect particularly was towered by the Marriott next door. Thus we had a great view of hundreds of balconies, which really spoils the beach view in the distance. Couple this with the feel, of hundreds of people, possibly being able to see in to your room, and not all is good at Hotel Renew. Our room was a corner room, which included a balcony, with a glimpse of Diamond Head, but again this came with 'ugly' and 'old' apartment buildings in the foreground, and the backpackers to the side, which previous reviewers warn of! By the way, oddly enough, this premises, the most costly of our trip, was the only one that didn't have our room ready when we arrived around 11am. However, the glass of refreshing juice was a nice surprise at check in. The beds are divine, as are the pillows! The rooms though are tiny - and I'm not someone who cares much for a large room, for a couple, but these rooms are really small, so be warned ! A little extra space to move would have been appreciated for the price. It is worth noting though, that due to our honeymoon, we were given a great deal - so can't complain too much !!Worth noting is the fact that our friends chose to stay at Aqua Bamboo. Their room was also renovated - quite nicely - and about doule the size of ours!! This place really appears to be a hidden bargain, beautiful big rooms, much cheaper than Renew...highly recommended if you're going as a family. I mean the ocean view is nice, but comes at a price, and I mean more tha your wallet!! Very important - if you plan to visit the island's water park please call to confirm they are open first. We drove all the way out there one day, only to be very disappointed that it is closed Monday and Tuesday. The Treehouse cafe in the world marketplace is a nice place for food brunch, etc. great service and nice coffee - which we really needed after 3 weeks of terrible coffee !! TIKI's Lounge at Marriott, next to Renew was great for live music, and we went there twice, we also went around the corner to another surf type lounge - opposite the beach, whic was great. Really enjoyed the North Shore, turtles at turtle beach etc, and had a laugh at Sandy Bay watching bodyboarders and bodysurfers 'going hard'!! Waimea Bay was nice to swim in - beware, it gets really deep suddenly! I'd love to come back to Hawaii, but maybe stay on the north shore or somewhere out of Honolulu.","Melbourne, Australia",4,4.0

No, it doesn't have alot of amenities, but they have the friendliest, most helpful staff I have ever encountered. They accommodated every request with a smile. The personal touch is a refreshing change from the massive, impersonal chain hotels that have overrun Hawaii. They also provide free beach towels, umbrellas, chairs, boogie boards, etc., and the staff was always there to take the gear off our hands before we even stepped through the door. The complimentary breakfast is a great value, and provides fresh fruit, pastries, yogurt, cereal, tea and coffee. There's no pool, but I can't imagine why you would need one with the ocean across the street. And there's no restaurants onsite, but the hotel next door has several places to eat, and the restaurants along the main street are just steps away. The rooms are bright, clean, and very comfortable...great to come back to at the end of the day. There was a cozy, spa feel to the setup, including the robes...very calming and relaxing. The beds are wonderful and the cleaning staff does a great job. We sort of missed having a balcony (especially for drying swimwear), but that's certainly not the hotel's fault. The ocean view was great, and the huge window provided lots of light. We had the massive projection TV, which was great except that you can't see it very well during the day unless you close the curtains, and the projector tends to overheat and shut down fairly regularly (however, every time it did, a staff member was there instantly to fix it).

Given its No 1 status on this site, we expected a near-perfect experience. We were not disappointed.We had a lovely corner room (906) with lanai to the side and an ocean-front view. Pluses: cool welcome face cloth and pineapple drink. Bedroom contained contemporary, beautifully hued decor with modern and high-end fixtures and decoration. Beautiful view of the ocean and the surfers. Good use of small space in bedroom and bathroom. We brought lots of stuff, and with some creative rearranging, there was ample room for everything (eg, iron board and iron we had removed during our stay, suitcases fit neatly under the bed, and a/c unit served as a large shelf for books and gear). A small bathroom had lots of drawer and shelf space. Bathroom had good lighting, and a window with a view of Diamond Head. The lighting system was the best we have experienced - eg, allowed for dimmer bedside lighting when I wanted to read and my husband wanted to sleep. Bar none, the most deliciously comfortable pillow-top bed and pillows I have encountered in a hotel room (and I include the ""heavenly"" beds of the Westin and Sheraton in this comparison). Small fridge ample enough in size to hold 3 beer, bottle of wine, cartons of milk and juice, small containers and water bottles, and keep them sufficiently cold. Excellent continental breakfast with fresh fruit and yogurt (some different choices every day), fresh pastries, good tea selection, and good coffee, cereal and juice (not fresh). Daily fresh apples - nice touch. Thursday evening wine tasting evening with other guests (we didn't go, but appreciated the invitation). Beach chairs, towells, umbrellas, and straw mats for the asking. (we had a hard time keeping the umbrella from blowing over on the beach, however). Helpful, friendly, can-do staff who were genuinely pleasant to guests.Minuses: small rooms, not great shower spray, a/c that was fairly noisy at night as it responded to thermostat setting, noisy with windows open, and no pool. 9th floor hallway looked a bit tired and worn in spots (but not the foyer and breakfast area, or first floor bathrooms - these were gleaming and perfectly maintained). Bit of a lack of a feeling of privacy with adjacent (large) resort towering over the hotel. I believe there may be small differences in rooms - eg, perhaps new shower heads in other rooms?? Also we did not have a high tech (or any) computer in our room - not a problem as we brought a laptop. It worked fine. As you can see, the positives significantly outweighed the negatives. Moreover, 10 steps behind the hotel was a scooter rental place where we rented scooters for a couple days and had a blast touring the island on our own schedule, parking free and with ease. We also rode the city busses - busstop half a block away, both directions - bus fare was $2; exact change needed, or you can buy a 4 day pass at an ABC store - and these were ubiquitous. Starbucks a block away. Beach and restaurants a 2 minute walk. A Wolfgang Puck take out (or casual eat-in) just beside the hotel. I should mention that the beach a block away also rented umbrellas that were firmly ""rooted' in the fine sand. If you have water shoes, they are ideal for the beaches. Leave your fins at home. As to Honolulu, it was my first visit there and I loved it. I especially suggest a trip to amazing, moving Pearl Harbour, and Hanauma Bay for excellent snorkling (even large sea turtles were seen) in a beautiful park-like setting. Also, Ala Moana park and beach, at the other end of Waikiki, is gorgeous, as is the stunning road to and beach at Kailua. As a Canadian, I have always felt that monuments and parks are things Americans structure, organize and maintain very well, and these were no exception.In summary, I would stay again at this fine small hotel with its genuinely friendly and courteous staff in a heartbeat, and recommend it to anyone for whom a pool is not absolutely necessary.","Vancouver, Canada",427,4.0

There is a feeling of warmth and charm as you enter the doors of The Hotel Renew.You are greeted and made to feel as if you are the only guest at this hotel. The staff is extremely warm and caring providing for your needs while visiting Waikiki. The hotel location is one block from the beach but if you have the ocean view room, you feel as if you are on the beach. The Tour bus stop is a short walk from the hotel. This area of Waikiki Beach has several dinning choices available and the beach area is less crowded. We loved The Hotel Renew so much we are returning in April. The rooms are comfortable with great bedding; I never slept so well in my life. The décor of the rooms continue the feeling of Aloha. The Hotel Renew provides for quit peaceful place for a great night rest with easy access to all of Waikiki.

We decided to valet our car since the meter costs 25 cents per 10 minutes! It turned out that the valet guys were really nice and super fast! And if you valet, there's the advantage of in and out any time. If you are new to Hawaii and Oahu, definitely ask the front desk for suggestions. They know where the locals go to eat and hang out, and they provide you directions on a map, which is really helpful since the streets names are really hard to remember.Also, since we arrived early and left late to and from the island, they were really nice to let us check in early and have a late check out because they had rooms available.

Very good experience overall. Greeted with a complimentary glass of fruit juice and hot washcloth while checking in. Very nice touch after a long flight from the East coast. Staff friendly to the person, without exception. Not overly friendly either. Low-key, but polite and responsive. Perfect for me, as I'm not into really high-key friendly. In any event, the staff is exceptional.Rooms are great - big by Waikiki standards and very well-appointed. Especially liked the lighting control system - with locations at each side of the bed, in the bathroom, and at the front door upon entry, you can control the closest light, turn on all the lights (with a button entitled ""Bright""), turn off all the lights (""Night""), or a custom setting (""Just Right""). Very cool. No need to run around the room, or as more often the case, get out of bed.The entire hotel is modeled after a modern East Asian style, all very new and chic. I suppose the trend will eventually become outdated, but it's very tastefully done, even if it isn't your first style preference. The beds, comforters, and pillows are all high-quality - exceptionally comfortable. There's also an LCD TV in the room and a safe that can fit a laptop (though no fridge, sadly). Bathrooms are nice, especially the sink style and lighting (I've never looked better than I did in their bathroom mirror - wish I could carry the whole lighting/mirror setup home with me). Also has a hair dryer, ironing board and iron, and other amenities.Continental breakfast each morning is nice. Fresh fruit, granola, yogurt, muffins & pastries, coffee, and fruit juice. Very fresh and tasty; just a bit tricky to find seating at peak times because of the small lobby/bar area. Still very nice.Service is impeccable, including the valet parking (a must - $20/day for the space, with in/out privileges, but be prepared to tip a couple bucks each time you leave). They even provide complimentary beach towels for you - just check them out at the front desk, take them to the beach, which is about 100 meters away, and turn them in when you return).In short, I loved everything about Hotel Renew except one thing - the wireless Internet service. It's free and carries a strong signal (my MacBook signal was full strength), but it was dreadfully, painfully slow. So slow that even checking email was laborious at times. Because I was here at a conference and had to do some work at various points, I was disappointed at not being able to use the Internet more reliably and quickly (I frequently use gotomypc.com to access my work computer). Honolulu's not exactly bursting at the seams with free wireless hotspots either, so this was a pretty serious inconvenience for me. Just a word of warning if you need to use the Internet for anything other than email and/or casual surfing.Short of that snag, Hotel Renew was superb. Highly, highly recommended. Will definitely stay again when returning to the Islands.","Washington, DC",65,4.0

They also provide all the beach acoutrements one could want (towels, mats, chairs). Brunch was nice, with fresh juice, pastries, granola, etc. (although for die-hards like us, there is a Starbucks just around the corner). One of the best things about our stay was the bed--more comfortable than any hotel bed I've ever slept in; woke up feeling refreshed every morning.

It was very easy to find. It was so easy to find, I was able to use the Honolulu bus system to find it. It had everything I needed or wanted in one place. The hotel was the best thing I experienced during my time in Hawaii. The experience starts with the door being opened into this modern deco style lobby. You are then greeted by two very kind and helpful attendants. I was given a glass pineapple juice and checked-in with almost no effort or delay. As I made my way through the hotel, you could get a feel of how small of a hotel it was, but you never felt crowded. When I entered my room, I was greeted with some amazing and delightful deco and a nice plump king size bed. The TV and entertainment computer were great ways to kill time, but the room really did not need that. It was peaceful enough to just meditate or be calm and still. The entertainment computer provided multiple options that I made it so I could not use all of them during my stay. The check-out was quick and effortless. You are just given your recipe unless you obtain outside of the normal room cost. The cost of the room for what I got was incredible. I found it hard to believe the location of the hotel along with the cost of the room. The location also provides you with a convenience store just down the street. Also, you are two or three blocks from shopping and an exciting night life. In addition, the Marriott is across the street and has some shops in it. There were three negative events in the whole experience. First, the shower nozzle appeared to be a little dirty. It was not a pressing issue, but I just happen to notice it when I took a shower. Second, the remote for my TV did not work initially, but a simple call got fix immediately. Third, the WiFi provided to the room had spotty performance in the morning. I guess that is its high use period, but that is just another thing to note. The other thing missing was my wife. It was really too bad this was a busy trip. I will definitely come back with wife, so she can explain this hotel.","Everett, Washington",6,5.0

I found that the free internet service that was accessible via the 32” LCD HDTV was very helpful in looking up various restaurants, activities and other helpful information; not to mention check my email everyday. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and the room and bathroom were cleaned daily. The hotel was a block away from the beach and was close to the bus stop. I didn’t have problems parking…you just have to know where to park. The free continental breakfast helped out a lot especially for a couple of students who were trying to budget their way in Oahu. We would like to thank, in particular, Leonor Wong for going out of her way to make us feel welcomed and to ensure that we had a great stay. She is friendly, kind, thoughtful, and considerate and it is because of her great customer service that I rated the hotel a 5 out of 5. The hotel would simply not be the same without her. Thank you Leonor and to all the staff at Hotel Renew. We look forward to staying at Hotel Renew in the future.",Toronto,3,5.0

It's in a nice location, just steps from a beautiful portion of Waikiki beach with great swimming and an easy walk up the waterfront avenue to other hotels, restaurants, and shops. It had the feel of a small, hip boutique hotel. Everything was very sleek and modern, including the flat-screen TV in our room and the bedside light controls that allowed us to set up any lighting scheme we could have desired. While the room was the slightest bit cramped with a king side bed and a chair and ottoman, it was perfectly good for us for the one night. The staff were extremely courteous and professional. Other nice touches included chilled pineapple juice and cold scented towels at check-in and a nice continental breakfast provided in the small lobby bar. My single complaint about the place was the lack of a mirror outside the bathroom, but that's as much as I could find to gripe about. Some might take issue about the essentially mandatory valet parking for $20, but the quickness with which they brought the car around and the headache of parking that was avoided by using valet made it worth it for us.","River Vale, New Jersey",9,4.0

When we checked in we were given a room on the 3rd floor where you could hear all of the noise from the very busy street below. As I wanted to get good sleep and relax on my honeymoon trip, I didn't want any noise. We called the front desk asking for room on a higher floor. The man told my husband there was nothing immediately (it didn't seem like he actually checked the computer system)... Since that was unacceptable to me and I would rather find a new hotel than not get good sleep in one, I called him back. He then spent a minute looking and found a room on the 9th floor (top floor). This was MUCH better. The only real problem with this room was that it faced other high-rise apt. buildings whereby all the inhabitants there can see right into your room. So, there is quite a lack of privacy. If you don't want people looking at you all the time, you have close the shades and not be able to enjoy the natural sunlight. Also, the side we faced had an alley down below where lots of youth hostels are located. So, needless to say, quite a few ""strange"" druggie-types were always hanging out down there and making quite a racket late into the night. After our first night, I hadn't slept more than 4 hours b/c of the horribly loud noise from the students and bums hanging out on the street below playing guitar and talking/laughing LOUDLY! We asked the front desk to move us to the opposite side of the hall where it would be quiter (since now street down below), but they said they would charge us $25.00 more per night since it would be an ocean front room. Well, we didn't want to pay any more money to stay there, so we declined the offer and got earplugs. So, for the rest of my stay I had to wear earplugs... Not good. As others said, the free breakfast is just mini-pastries (quite fatty and unhealthy), a little bit of fruit (grapes or oranges), yogurt, and coffee/pineapple juice. There was no variety day to day and after a few days I was going to die if I had to eat the SAME thing again! Some definite variety is needed - cereal, toast, butter, honey, boiled eggs, etc.The room was comfortable (city-view King) and had a fairly nice bed. The bathroom was quite small and the tub was old-ish - so, I never got to take a relaxing bath (which I usually like to do in nicer hotels). Flat screen TV where you could search the internet, too, was cool. So, no real need to bring your own laptop. Elevators are a bit old, as are the hallways in the hotel. The breakfast area needs to be larger. Also, one staff member (a lady with red highlights in her longish black hair) seemed to only want to talk/flirt with the male guests at the hotel. She never one said ""hi"" to me. But, she was always fritting around the lobby trying to look stylish and important and talking only to guys who came and went. So, that was not very professional. Otherwise, the valet guys were super nice. The $20.00/night fee is a total ripoff. This should be no more than $12.00, since there is a lot just down the street where you can park for about $8-10.00. Lastly, as it was my honeymoon (and I had noted that several times when making my reservation), I expected they would do something special (as they had promised). Well, that never happened. Half-way through the week, I called the front desk and asked why I never got anything and they said ""oops!"" So, they sent us a bottle of cheap champagne and a box of cheap Hawaiian chocoloates. I wasn't impressed. We ended up giving the champagne to the housekeeper...I, too, never saw or met the manager nor did I meet/see the infamous Leonore. So, what was all of that hype about?!?!...I think I would return if I couldn't find one of the higher-end hotels available for a good price. But, I can't say I was in love with the hotel. We made the best out of it though.","Austin, Texas",14,3.0

Our room appeared just as in the pictures. Modern, minimalist, comfortable (1st Hawaii project by designer Jiun Ho). We had a LARGE projection TV which the boys loved (to watch Olympics).  The hotel is less than a block from the beach. The staff provided beach chairs, beach towels, boogie boards whenever we requested them, and then took them off our weary hands upon our return to the hotel. Personal service is their specialty. By the 2nd day, they would recognize us coming and going (unlike a mega-resort where you are a face in the crowd). Kudos go out to Angie, Grace, Will, Kyle and the rest of the staff (sorry that I don't have everyone's names, but they were all gracious and helpful). Accolades to the hotel manager PEARL -- it's obvious she sets the tone for her staff. Some of the review here were written BEFORE the renovations were complete. These should be disregarded if you are considering this hotel. The renovations are done with some minor work or rework still being done (saw evidence of that in our hallway).

We selected this hotel based on the reviews we read from Trip Advisor. I have to say we were disappointed after hearing so many wonderful things. Our room was quite small. The bed took up most of the space. We had our golf clubs with us which we kept in the room. We kept tripping over things trying to move through the room, because the space was so small. When we checked in and were shown to our room, we mentioned to the staff member that there wasn’t any room for our clubs. He replied, “These corner rooms are pretty small.” If you are at all claustrophobic, you won’t want to stay here. We often left the hotel at 6:30 to get to other locations on the island or make an early tee time. When we asked if we could get coffee at 6:30, we were told that it wouldn’t be ready until 7:00. One of the most annoying parts of our stay was the loud music from the pool area in the hotel next to Hotel Renew, which played until the wee hours of the morning. The staff was very pleasant when we went to ask for something on the 2nd floor. Otherwise we didn’t see them. We stayed at this hotel for 5 days and never saw the famous Lenore Wong that we kept hearing about. We told them when we made our reservation as well as when we checked in that we were celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary. A note or some small acknowledgement would have been nice, but our special occasion went unrecognized. When we checked into our hotel on Maui, they had a bottle of champagne waiting for us to help celebrate our 35 years. Hotel Renew is in a good location, a short walk to the beach. There is convenient parking nearby. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are clean. Otherwise, we were disappointed in our stay here.",Chicago,8,2.0

It's a no-frills property - the rooms are nice and have a contemporary flair. We ended up staying in two different rooms during the week because we left to visit Maui and then came back prior going home.The rooms are pretty much as the website shows and describes. There isn't much sound-proofing between the bedroom and the bathroom. Nor is there much sound-proofing between the room and the hallway.The continental breakfast is not what was expected - just some coffee and pineapple juice, some muffins and sliced oranges. The space set up for the breakfast is small - maybe 4 small tables total plus a bar with stools for maybe a total of 12 people - so get there early (or go somewhere else).A much larger resort is next to Hotel Renew (a ResortQuest property), so some of the noise from that property tends to float over to Hotel Renew. But we spent most of our time outside and spent only time in the room to sleep, so it wasn't such a big deal.The first room we stayed in had poor Internet wi-fi. They responded immediately by putting in a new router, but it didn't help. Our second room at the end of the week had much better Internet.

I just finished staying at the Hotel Renew with my family (wife and young son-age 7). I have been a frequent visitor to Hawaii and Waikiki Beach in general, and I must admit that this is ONE OF THE BEST HOTELS in Waikiki. A true treasure. The staff are extremely cordial and helpful. I initially stayed there for 2 nights before leaving to visit the other islands. My experience with the hotel staff was so pleasant (Lenore and Angie were GREAT!!!), that upon my return from the Big Island, I cancelled my Starwood points subsidized stay at the Sheraton Waikiki and stayed at the Hotel Renew instead.Upon check in, we were warmly greeted with lemongrass scented towels and refreshments. As we checked in, the front desk staff made sure that we were pleased with our room. Free continental breakfast was provided and Lenore was great (and provided the hard boiled eggs!). Beach equipment (umbrellas, mats, towels, chairs, boogie boards) was available for free. Valet parking was $20 per day, but parking in the prime Waikiki area is expensive in general. Upon our return to the mainland, we had a late departure, and we were allowed to keep our luggage at the hotel and to use a room to shower and prepare for our long flight home.The location of this hotel is also great -across from Waikiki beach and close to Kapiolani park (the Honolulu Zoo and the Aquarium), You also don't get that ""claustrophobic experience"" of being swamped with tourists when you stay at places like the Sheraton Waikiki and Outrigger. Being on a side street, you are close to everything in Waikiki Beach, without the hectic crowding.The hotel definitely has a boutique design and feel. I had my 7 year old son in tow , but the atmosphere in this hotel is more for couples and people who just want to ""relax"" on vacation (not be surrounded by screaming kids). I really wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are traveling with small kids , who are primarily interested in a ""pool""/resort scene. Nevertheless, never did we feel unwelcome by having a young child, and my son quickly became friendly with the hotel staff.Also with a ""boutique"" design, the rooms are smaller than most ""chain"" hotels (ie., Hilton, Sheraton, Hyatt, etc); however, the size was more than adequate for us. The rooms are well designed to maximize the use of this smaller space (rooms are more like European and Japanese hotels in size ).Again, there are many more expensive places in Waikiki that will take your money but not provide you with the service that the Hotel Renew will. If you want to waste money, go stay at those other places. If you want SERVICE at a great price, then consider the Hotel Renew. I have a meeting in Waikiki next year, and I have already made plans to stay here instead of other ""highly recommended"" (i.e., expensive) hotels.",NYC,12,5.0

I'll try and keep it shortish, but there's so much to praise that it'll be hard. Like most people I've read all the glowing reviews of the staff (which are absolutely spot on) so I'll focus on other stuff. That said, I've never seen such happy, helpful hotel staff that don't seem to be forcing a smile but actually love their jobs.First impression of the hotel is great. After taking the shuttle from the airport and stopping at all the massive chain hotels, I was thanking the heavens that I hadn't booked into one of them. The mass disneyland atmospheres would've killed me! The hotel lobby is serene and gorgeous - more spa than hotel. The room itself is perfection. I had a king regular room, and the furnishings are new, tasteful (no floral chintz in sight) and modern. I travel frequently for work and play so have seen my share of Westin, W, Sheraton and such, and I think the furnishings here are better than them all. Amenities in the room are flawless - wireless internet and all the cable channels you would want, free internet tv and movies, a mini-fridge, lutron dimmable lighting controlled from a console near the bed, a new bathroom with good shelf space...A special note on the bed - WOW. Very comfortable with beautiful bedding. I found there to be no noise from the street at all, which is great. Amazing for sleeping.Hotel Renew is really the perfect place to stay for location (1/2 block from a great part of the beach and everything is within 1/2 mile walk). It's not a family-oriented hotel...and that's a huge positive. If you're a single traveller or a couple and don't want the hoardes of kids running around, this is the place for you. That said, it's not a bad place for a family, but it'd be a family with class that stays here.I just can't recommend the hotel enough. I'm coming back to stay again in 10 days at the end of my trip, and I'm looking forward to the relaxation that is prevalent throughout the hotel as an end to my trip.

When I got there after a 12 hour flight, The General Manager Terry Dowsett came out and greeted me personally and had refreshments and drinks waiting for me in my room. He was very professional and treated his guests with class. My room was comfortable, clean, and nice. Along with the excellent staff, the staff member who stands out the most is the Executive House Keeper/Director Leonor Wong. I read ALOT of good reviews about her in the Trip Advisor Review. And after I met her, I could see why so many guests were so impressed with her. She is a very gifted individual who knows how to make people feel special and valued. On many occasions, I noticed the way she would stop, and just enjoy chatting with her guests in the lobby and really listen...and take a sincere interest in each person. Not only does she have a radiant and likeable personality, but I was impressed by the way she seemed to LOVE to go out of her way and make it her personal responsibility to make each guest feel like a VIP. On several occasions during my stay she went out of her way to greet me and make sure I was happy. An example of this was when I was waiting for my shuttle bus to leave for the airport, she came in on her DAY OFF, and brought me chocolates, bottled water, snacks for the trip home, a beautiful homemade lei she made herself, and just sat and visited, and made us laugh for about 20 minutes. This energetic lady who seems more like a professional motivational speaker. It is was so refreshing to be do business with Leonor and Terry who obviously love Hotel Renew and put their whole hearts into making people feel like VIP.  As I looking towards another trip back to Waikiki and checking out reservations, I was so surprised to hear Leonor is leaving Hotel Renew on Aug. 1, 2008. The excellent way she and her staff treated me was the reason why I wanted to book another reservation there next time. I understand that Leonor Wong is going to Aqua Bamboo (and other Aqua hotels) to take a promotional opportunity as the Director of Guest Relations.

After reading excellent reviews and browsing the property's website, we decided to book a deluxe oceanview room at the Hotel Renew in Waikiki. I hate to say it, but the experience was somewhat disappointing.The lobby is small, but very beautifully decorated and reminds you of a day spa. The hallways upstairs are very dark, somewhat dirty, and there are a lot of holes in the walls with wires hanging out. Thankfully, the room was beautifully decorated, very clean, and had a beautiful view from the main window (picture attached). Unfortunately, it was A LOT smaller than the pictures on the website indicate. There was a flat-screen LCD television, but it wasn't programed correctly and was very fuzzy. The internet also didn't work when we first arrived, but they had fixed the problem by the time we got back from swimming.There are a number of items provided by the hotel for a fee including a beautiful kukui nut necklace for $7 that was placed in the hotel room. I thought this was a nice touch. (Unfortunately, we found out that Australian customs doesn't allow kukui nut items to be brought back into the country, so it was taken away when I returned home. Oh well.) You can also buy other items including flip-flop sandals, but be prepared to be charged quite a bit of money for these items. ($10 for cheap, flimsy flip-flops!)We had a wonderful night's sleep in the VERY comfortable king-sized bed. Unfortunately, the continental breakfast the next morning was the worst part of the stay. Literally all that was available was coffee, tea, pineapple juice, bad looking oranges, cinnamon rolls from the can, and overcooked mini muffins filled with sugar. If you wanted to have a healthy breakfast, you only had one option. Needless to say, my husband and I had to go out and get something else to eat later.While we did enjoy having a large, comfortable bed to sleep in for the night, the rest of the experience was lacking. For the amount of money one spends for a night at this hotel, you don't get much at all. I highly doubt we'll stay there again unless they either lower the tariff or include more in the price.

Brian, Paul, and Will always made sure my car was available to me whenever I needed it. I never had to wait more than just a couple minutes for them to retrieve it. Yes, $20 a day is steep for valet parking, but it was a convenience that was well worth it.The property itself is very peaceful and ideally located at the East end of Waikiki so you get the benefit of easily walking into the shopping and restaurant zone, without feeling like you’re right in the middle of the chaos of the city. Diamond Head is conveniently nearby which is nice for running or hiking. The beach was less than 50 yards away and the hotel had free use of whatever beach toys, towels, and chairs you might need. The fact that this is a smaller, boutique size hotel without throngs of tourists going in and out of it on an hourly basis was definitely a plus and made for a much more relaxing, quiet environment.The rooms are nicely appointed and the beds are heavenly. Even though my room was classified as a city-view, I actually had a nice partial ocean view which was an extra plus. If you get a beach facing room, I would suggest keeping your window shut at night if you don’t want to hear the band playing from the Tiki Bar next door at the ResortQuest Hotel. I’m sensitive to noise, but with the window shut, I never had a problem with it. The rooms are a bit on the darker side, even with the multi-level switch setting, however, the hotel indicated they’d be happy to provide more lights for the room if desired. Counter space in the bathroom is a little tight, but I found an easy enough way to work around it. The property does not have a pool, however, I never found this to be an issue seeing as the beach was so close-by. Lastly, the hotel was great about little extra touches like a complementary continental breakfast and daily fresh fruit in your room and chocolates & orchids on your pillows in the evening. They also hold a weekly complementary manager’s cocktail reception which was very nice and a great way to meet some of the hotel staff as well as other guests staying at the hotel. The sevice at this hotel is outstanding and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the Waikiki area. I look forward to staying there again whenever my travels take me back to Oahu.",Redondo Beach,1,5.0

It could be described as a “designer’s hotel” with lots of surprising and unusual design ideas included in both the hotel and guest room.Perhaps the most unusual and striking feature is a projector PC and TV system. Rather than a tabletop TV, the room features a built in PC projector that turns the wall into the projection screen for both the in room PC and cable television. We did not use the in room PC, but cable TV looked great projected on the wall. The room was kept immaculately clean by the housekeeping staff, with daily maid and turndown service. Two Hersey’s kisses are placed on the bed at turndown service for the chocolate minded. The bathroom was totally adequate, although better for a shower than a bath. The bathroom accessories are coconut shell type design that perfectly fits the culture and feeling of Hawaii. We had a city view room on the 4th floor. The room size is adequate. There is no balconey/lanai so the room can feel a bit closed in at times. Blockout window doors keep light out of the room for those who wish to sleep late. There is also a dimmer switch to adjust the lighting in the room to any desired level. The desk is oversized and nice to put plenty of stuff on. There is also a luggage stand located near the entrance door which keeps bags out of the way.Wifi is provided free, unlike many hotels that charge extra for internet. The connection to my Macbook was immediate. I measured the speed at about 150-250 kbps, which is not really broadband, but adequate for most purposes. My slingplayer worked ok at low video bit rate. Hotel Renew provides a light continental breakfast each morning in the lobby, including pastry, fruit slices, coffee and juice. Coffee makers are not located in the room. The hotel information book states coffee makers are available upon request. We did not request nor feel a coffee maker was necessary in the room.Parking is valet only and costs and extra $20/day. This was completely disclosed in the welcome email. The valet staff were excellent and always promptly retrieved our car upon request. The staff in general were great. Very friendly and helpful and a great asset of the hotel. Upon arrival, the check in staff provide cold oshibori towels and a welcome drink (pineapple juice) which is very nice. The hotel is completely non smoking, which is appreciated. Many smoker guests congregate outside the main entrance and can be observed when entering or exiting the hotel.Couple of nitpicks: the continental breakfast is too sparse - by around 9 am most of the breakfast pastries are gone and only sweet muffins are leftover. Also, orange slices seem to run out on occasion. One suggestion to the hotel would be to provide a larger variety of bread in the morning, like croissants or rolls. Also, the breakfast area is too cramped and not really enjoyable. Best to take the light meal back to the room. Also, the hotel entrance (not the guest rooms) faces the back loading dock of the massive Marriot Hotel which is not the most picturesque view. One convenience to note is that a branch of the ubiquitous ABC Store chain is located next to the hotel. This makes the purchase of drinks, snacks, food items very quick and easy.As other reviewers have noted, Hotel Renew is not a integrated resort. There is no pool, restaurant or other service facilities. Overall the Hotel Renew is a great choice for those who are looking for a good value boutique hotel and for those who do not desire or need a resort hotel experience. Highly recommended.","Tokyo, Japan",466,5.0

Leonor in particular was simply wonderful and we both felt lucky to have her oversee our stay.The location was fantastic...just a few minutes from the beach and far enough away that you felt like you could get a break from the hub bub of the main strip of Waikiki if needed.The rooms were immaculate. A very comfortable and sample sized chair, a very luxurious bed with plenty of pillows and blankets, and plenty of closet/cabinet space. The bathroom was so modern and so much nicer than what we have at home, my wife took pictures so that when we remodel ours, we can make it look like those at Hotel Renew.

I arrived into a nice reception area, clean and modern looking and checked in promptly ( to my premier ocean view room) with helping staff. Thats where it started to go downhill starting as soon as i stepped in the lift. The lift itself had a strange musk about it that didn't go away for the duration of the holiday. This didn't overly concern me until i stepped into the hall where i notice most of my level was still under refurbishment ( which i had the impression was finished some months ago. There were large spaces with no wall paneling that were stuffed with rubbish, likely from the workers. This hit me as quite shocking but none the less i continued on.I arrived in my room which was quite nice, had a little bit of a smell but was still quite nice. Large flat panel TV with good selection of channels. Bed was reasonably comfortable. The a/c was a Nightmare! First of all, it never once successfully got the room below 78, which was very uncomfortable at night time, coupled by the fact that it was ridiculously loud, louder than a washing machine and ever hour and a half it would make loud cracking noises that would nearly always wake you or at least take you out of REM! For the whole week i didn't not get a good nights rest and i considered changing to the hilton.This place seems like a bargin but i am sorry to say i would not stay there again.

The dimmable lighting was wonderful for me since I don't like bright light. We had a bit of trouble hooking up to the the Internet on the in-house TV/system and the manager himself came up to help us with it. The manager also gave us incredibly useful information for what to do with our evening, when we met him at the weekly ""Manager's Reception"" on Thursday night.

This is not a #1 hotel. While the decor is interesting, the room was not practical for a couple staying for 5 days. The bathroom is so dark I never saw my face during the entire stay. There is inadequate storage space in the bathroom - just a few narrow shelves, open on either side, so your toiletries can easily fall into the commode. There is a small closet, mostly occupied by a set of shelves, and a safe which is not secured to anything. There is loose wiring under the sink. While it is a nice idea to have a computer in every room, the internet connection is so slow as to be nonfunctional. There is a nice workspace area, and the bed is fabulous. The breakfast area is small, and you will sit cheek to jowl with other diners. While the hotel advertises beverage service and snacks throughout the day, we saw no evidence of that.

The staff is oriented to providing excellent guest services; no request was too great. The continental breakfast was carb-heavy and could have had some fruit (they did have pineapple juice, however), but I appreciate their gesture of providing a complimentary breakfast for guests at all. On Thursday nights, the manager hosted an intimate open bar with pupus.

My Big Island hotels were very nice, but always dinging me for things like internet access and phone calls and parking spaces. We headed to Oahu and arrived at the Renew. Now, it's not a very large hotel in terms of number of rooms. But the rooms themselves were amazing. Intelligent lighting controls, internet access in the form of free wifi and also an in-room PC hooked up to the room's LCD TV. Stylish and modern room decor, great washroom and shower head, super-comfy bedding, all of this was lovely and as advertised on their site. What doesn't come across on their site is just how above and beyond the staff will go to make your trip a good one. The hotel is a one-minute walk from Waikiki Beach (literally at the end of the block), and if the staff sees you heading out with your swim trunks, they'll make sure you have towels, chairs, umbrellas if it rains, anything. Always friendly, always helpful, always there when you need them.  We also had the occasion to meet Leonor Wong during our stay and she was absolutely fantastic. From making sure we weren't stranded our last evening in town (we booked a flight that was late evening and she made sure we were able to secure a late checkout), to booking a shuttle, to making sure we weren't waiting for it by ourselves.

If you don't read this entire review - at least know this. You will not go wrong booking this hotel. The staff at this hotel is fabulous. I cannot compliment them enough. The location is great and the hotel clean and comfortable.The Staff:The staff was ALWAYS friendly and helpful. All of the staff remembered our names. The assistant manager even went to the local store to get milk and cereal for us once she discovered we liked cereal for breakfast. She also picks up fresh pastries every morning for the continental breakfast. So fresh, they are still warm when they arrive.The Hotel:Clean, Modern and pretty. There are less than 100 rooms in the hotel so it never seems crowded. A notable exception along Waikiki Beach. One room on each floor has a very large balcony with an ocean view. We were assigned one of these rooms as were my inlaws. I think they might be a bit smaller than the other rooms but it was well worth it!!!Make sure to check out the continental breakfast. The pastries are great!!!The rooms are on the small side, with a closet (with a safe), desk, bed and chair. The bed is against the wall so you cannot enter from both sides. However, this is one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in (and my husband and I travel an average of 2 weeks out of every month for business so I have slept in A LOT of hotel beds). The bathrooms are nicely sized, modern and clean. Location:This hotel is located a block or 2 off Waikiki Beach. Plenty of places to eat and shop in walking distance. You are down at the end of the beach where their are not hotels built directly on the water so there is plenty of beach access.

We had a room on the 7th floor with a fabulous ocean view, the only downside is that you also overlook the Outrigger Waikiki. From checking in to checking out the staff at the hotel went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Chilled juice and wet towel on check in, champagne in the room (we were celebrating our honeymoon). We were upgraded to a Premier room which we were delighted about. One unexpected bonus was the free newspapers in the morning and complimentary continental breakfast, coffee/tea/juice and pastries/muffins were more than enough for us. Leonor Wong, the executive housekeeper, was on hand in the morning to ensure everything was running smoothly and help advise on any queries. We had an early check out on the day we were leaving and the hotel provided us with fruit and some chocolates on our departure since we would miss breakfast. The hotel itself is an oasis of calm after the hustle and bustle that is Waikiki. The lobby is styled in a very modern way and was getting new front doors whilst we were there. The rooms are all very comfortable with modern lighting, flat screen tv etc and are wonderful having just been refurbished. There is no restaurant but you have the pick of the Waikiki hotels all within easy walking distance. Of the ones we ate in the Moana Surfrider was our favourite. The location of the hotel is at the south end of Waikiki, one block back from the beach. There is an ABC store next to the hotel entrance, bus stop around the corner.We used the bus to visit Pearl Harbour and the USS Amazon memorial, this is easy to do and is only a single bus ride but be prepared for a long journey.

We knew after our first stay that we would come back & stay here. Upon arrival we were greeted with fresh cold pineapple juice & cold towels to cool down as we checked in. That was very thoughtful. I immediately noticed how beautiful the rennovations turned out. It is very modern. Our room was absolutely beautiful. Flat Panel TV, beautiful decor, and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. It was very clean too. Everything looked brand new. Gorgeous. The next morning, we had the pleasure of meeting Leonor. We were on our way out to the beach. She took the time to introduce herself to us & ask what we were up to. She then gave us some fresh blueberry muffins for the road, awesome! Every night when we would come back to the Hotel we felt as if it were home. The whole staff was excellent, they always greeted us with a smile & took great care of us. I kept telling my boyfriend that there was no other place I'd rather stay. I liked the feel of the hotel. Not a overly huge hotel where you get lost in the crowd, you actually get to know people here. The location is perfect for my taste, close to everything but not in a spot where it's too noisy and busy to relax. The beach is so close too. A minute walk if that. As soon as you walk out you see the beach about a super short block away. When we would hang out in Waikiki there was no need for a car, we would just walk. The International Market Place was just a few blocks away. That area was pretty much the heart of Waikiki. Plus, its so nice to experience the nightlife in Waikiki as you take a short stroll. Leonor went out of her way to make our stay a special experience. Some days we would come back to fresh fruit, flowers, and one night we came back to a bottle of champagne. When we would run into her in the morning on our way out she would always make sure we took a snack. Upon leaving she gave us chocolates & fresh bananas. She made us feel so special & appreciated. She is such a great person and very genuine. By the last day I was calling her auntie Leonor. The whole staff was so nice, they all exceeded our expectations, the bell stand, the front desk, Tina, Terry, and Leonor, basically the whole staff. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone. The combination of a beautiful hotel, comfort, location, price and superior customer service makes this is a #1 pick for me.

It was a feel like being in theater.Wireless connection to the internet was fast (54mbps) and without interruption.  Usually we have an issue sleeping in hotels but this time it was exception.The bed had down mattress and pillows were also very comfortable.This time we celebrated our 36th anniversary, and we were touched when we saw in our room bottle of Champaign, candy and flower arrangement.We had a great time jogging every morning in the near located park area.We could not find any negative just only a suggestion for continental breakfast arrangement. It would be nice to have plain yogurt and plain bagels. We are looking forward to spend more time in Waikiki next year and definitely will stay at the Hotel Renew!Alex & Olga,6/04/08, San Jose, CA",San Jose,3,5.0

The service is great. Very attentive staff, always smiling, and eager to help. The new design is very attractive. The lobby is modern and cozy. There are some minor work to be done through out the place, but it won't hinder your stay whatsoever.Location is close to pretty much everything. A few steps from the beach and starbucks. ABC just down stairs and everything else within easy walking distance. The rooms are quite nice also. Comfortable bed and decent view (we stayed in an ocean view room). The patio is off to the side facing the back streets and other hotels, but can still get a glimpse of the beach and ocean. The free Wifi is great. However, the TV reception is soso and the netflix movies or the internet features from the in-room entertainment system didn't work at all. The Internet works from my laptop but not through their computer system. Probably still working out the bugs. Overall, I would highly recommend this place to everyone and will not hesitate to return when we get a chance to visit Oahu again!","Bolingbrook, IL",3,4.0

Leonor (the Executive Houskeeper at Hotel Renew) is amazing - every morning she asked us if there was anything we needed and if there was anything she could do for us. For example, we were traveling with our 10 month old daughter. We mentioned that we could use some fruit / vegetables to make some baby food so she lent us a blender (and offered a microwave), and daily brought fresh fruit and avacadoes (from her own garden) to our room each day! Our flight home was in the evening so we were given a late check-out (without even having to ask!) along with a bag of snacks and a lei for each of us.Grace at the front desk was also very helpful, she gave us a beach bag, clean towels, beach umbrella, a boogie board, snorkeling gear and beach toys before we went down to the beach each day - which is conveniently located only half a block from the hotel.The rooms are slick and modern, very clean and new in appearance (since the hotel was recently renovated). The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. The room was quiet at night, this may have been because we had a city view on the top (9th) floor. Our housekeeper even folded our clothes if we left them out!We appreciated the location of the hotel, as it was close to many attractions such as the Honolulu Zoo, the Waikiki Aquarium, Diamond Head and the beach.The only negative I can think of was the in room computer, which we had some trouble with (audio was not working, internet connection issues) but these were resolved immediately.The next time we visit Waikiki, we will definitely stay at the Hotel Renew!",Vancouver,3,5.0

Our bathroom was really big (I heard one of the biggest in the hotel), and the view of the beach was spectacular. I have stayed at hotels that promise an ocean view, and arrive to find that I can see the ocean out of the corner of the window if I squint, but this is not the case with Hotel Renew. While there isn't a balcony, the view is amazing just the same. The staff are also really friendly and helpful. It is within walking distance of lots of great spots on Waikiki.

Waikiki is not my favorite place to stay on Oahu, but when we were in town for a quick two-day stay, it made sense to stay conveniently located to favorite restaurants. The hotel has recently been renovated and although there were some renovations happening on the floor we were staying on, it didn't bother us too much as we are renovating at home ourselves. Others may be more sensitive too this. On the plus side, however, the room we were in was essentially new. I like that the hotel seems eco-friendly and had great amenities, including the option to watch netflix movies for free if you were already a member as well as free wifi! The staff was extremely friendly and I like the location at the far end of the Waikiki strip, a bit away from the busiest sections and very close to beautiful Kapiolani park. The hotel does offer a breakfast, but it was minimal and not anything too special. However, other amenities including providing guests with beach umbrellas and mats and free wi fi made up for the breakfast, which we weren't even expecting in the first place. Overall, if you can't afford the more expensive historic hotels on Waikiki like Moana Surfrider and Halekulani but still want a high-level of service with extra amenities, I highly recommend this hotel.","New York, NY",11,4.0

The hotel is located half a block from Waikiki beach and a hop skip and a jump from the zoo and Kapiolani Park. The hotel is located in a quieter end of Waikiki but within walking distance to everything. The local bus stop is a block away and there's an ABC store next door. We loved all the fresh flowers throughout the lobby. I booked the hotel directly through Pearl (now Hotel Manager) and managed to get a fantastic rate of $140 per night + tax for our entire stay. Pearl was a great help when we wanted to prepay some of our nights before we arrived and when we emailed her several times in the months prior to our arrival to ask questions on the hotel or things to do and places to eat she was more than willing to help out. If she wasn't available her staff would reply to my emails on her behalf. We arrived to the hotel around 11am after walking with our suitcases from the Aqua Aloha Surf and Spa. Grace checked us in and we were both given bottles of water when we arrived. As our room wasn't ready they were happy to store our bags for us. Leonor saw us in the reception and immediately took us to a spare room where we could change our clothes, get what we needed for the day and we were told that we could use the showers or the beds and to come down when we were ready. We came back later that evening to check in. We had the ""Renew Experience"" room which consisted of two double beds, and a desk, two chairs. The room was spacious and there was enough space for both of us. The beds both had space underneath to store our suitcases, there was a large bench seat with 4 large draws underneath to keep our clothes that was located near the door, the wardrobe housed the safe and also some shelves which we used for our shoes, there were also robes in the wardrobe for guest's use. The bathroom was clean and updated. We loved the large shower head in the shower. The bathroom had two draws to store our toiletry bags and there was some shelving to keep additional items. The towels were large and fluffy and there were plenty of them. The hotel also provided shampoo, conditioner, bath soap and body lotion. We liked the lighting system that we could turn lights on and off while sitting in bed. The windows had both a blind and wooden shutters which kept the light out early in the morning. All quests also had free local and toll free calls which was great when booking shuttles or tours. We had trouble trying to work out the internet/TV system on our first night but Terry the hotel manager came the next day and set everything up for us. We liked that we could look up tours, places to go, where to eat, bus schedules etc and check our emails for no additional charges. The beds were really comfortable. Our room was located on the 5th floor overlooking Lemon Road. We heard no noise from other guests, garbage trucks or the hotel next door. Freash fruit was left in our rooms and most days chocolates and/or orchids were left on our pillows.The breakfast was complimentary and consisted of pastries, fruit, juice and tea and coffee. Most days Leonor would come by during breakfast with a basket containing extra items for the guests such as boiled eggs, yoghurts, breakfast bars etc. The breakfast was delicious and we often found that it was filling enough that we didn't need to have lunch. There were apples and oranges available to the guests to take at their leisure. On our second day at the hotel there was a box of macadamia nut chocolates left in our room by Leonor, on another day a fruit basket was left for us, a vase of roses, a bottle of champagne and more chocolates and two of the biggest avocados we have seen. Pearl the hotel manager left us a box of chocolates and a personal note after we met her to thank her for all the help in booking our trip and answering our emails prior to our arrival.We enjoyed the cocktail night which was held for all the guests, local appertisers were also provided. Ikaika made us delicious cocktails (volcanos). The hotel provided the guests beach towels, beach mats, boogies boards, beach chairs and snorkels to use. One day we were waiting for our pick up to go kayaking and my friend had her tennis shoes in a plastic bag. Leonor noticed this and immediately went to get her a Aqua Resorts backpack to use. Leonor also offered us a spare suitcase if we needed it to pack all our shopping in to take home with us.On our last evening we wanted to say goodbye to Leonor but she had already left for the day. Pearl called her to ask what time she would be in the next day. We said that we were getting picked up at 6am and that it would be too early. To our amazement when we came downstairs the next morning to checkout Leonor was there with a bag containing boiled eggs, chocolate, tea and had made us both toast. We were also both given handmade leis made by Leonor the night before. While we were there we ordered some goods online and they didn't arrive before we left. The hotel offered to send them to us in Australia and even though the postage was around US$90 they only charged us for half the shipping cost.The front desk staff: Grace, Shaika, Robert etc were all friendly and helpful with any questions or queries that we had.We are really looking forward to returning to the hotel again in the near future and are recommending it to all our friends",Sydney,4,5.0

It is situated only a half block from the beach with restaurants and coffee shops in close proximity. The Honolulu Zoo is one block from the hotel and Diamond iHead is 5 minutes away. When we arrived there was fresh pineapple juice and cold towels waiting for us. The staff was friendly and helpful. The decor in the rooms were very modern and cozy. We had a beautiful ocean view room (#508), which had a nice breeze from the tradewinds. One major plus was the rooms were well insulated and pretty quiet. The lighting is very cool, once you figure out how to work the switches. I must attest to the comfortableness of the beds. When we arrived, I took a shower and laid on the bed at 3p.m. I didn't wake up until 5:30 a.m. the next morning (14 1/2 hours). It was the best sleep I had in a long time. Your body will melt into the mattress. On the last day we pulled up the sheets to get the name of the mattress pad. Just when you thought the bed was great, then their was the 80"" projection TV and computer. It was Awesome! It was like having your own private movie screening in your hotel room. You'll want to go home and throw out your 32"". Having internet access was great for restaurant reviews and driving directions. Each morning their was pastries in the lobby with coffee and fresh juice. The lobby was absolutely gorgeous and adorned with fresh flowers. It looked like a page out of a magazine. We read so much about Leonor on other reviews we couldn't wait to see if she was ""Real"". She was just as the they described but better. She spoiled us! Leonor definitely takes pride in her job and genuinely enjoys making people smile. She made us handmade leis which were a great momento to bring home. Each day we were like kids on Christmas Day , waiting to see what special treats would be waiting for us in our room. Each day their were fresh flowers and candies on our bed. We received water and juices in our fridge, a bottle of champagne and a fruit basket with chocolates. The hotel provided chairs, towels and mats for the beach. They have thought about all aspects of comfort that any guess would want. The extra space under the platform beds provides more space for luggage storage. Only improvements, would be our hallway on our floor appeared to still be under remodel and the lobby was very chilly in the evenings. Lastly the refrigerator is very tricky to use. You have to turn the key in order for the refrigeration unit to begin cooling. Unfortunately we didn't turn the key on a few occassions and our items were warm. All in all, these were minimal improvements. We had a great stay! P.S. Hotel Renew better hold on to Leonor she is a wonderful asset.","Concord, CA",3,5.0

While we wandered around Waikiki, the hotel staff were amazingly quick and we were called on our cell and in our room before lunchtime. This was really appreciated after a long international flight. We were at the hotel for 7 nights and it was some of the extra touches that were the icing on the cake.

Leonore Wong and staff makes this hotel what it is. The rooms are nice and newly renovated, quite modern with an asian theme but are not the reason we would come to this hotel again. What made our stay so special was the extras you wouldn't expect. Champagne in our room one day, chocolates and flowers on other days. Every morning Leonore was working she would meet you at the complimetary continental breakfast and make sure you're happy and every small detail taken care of. On our second last day she asked us when we would be leaving and we said our flight leaves late the following night. We hadn't even asked for a late checkout, although we were planning on it, and the next morning she told us everything was taken care of....we could have our room until 7pm when we left.

Having said this, we expected nothing but the absolute best... and we were not disappointed at all! The room was wonderful - king-sized bed, down mattress cover, down pillows, a well-functioning A/C, flat-screen TV... and the creme de la creme being the FREE internet viewed via the TV screen as a monitor. Call me silly, but one of my favourite touches in the room were the light controls next to both sides of the bed that controlled every light in the room - including the washroom. By the way, the washrooms were spotless and the room super clean. In fact, if you go on their website, that's exactly how the room looks. The lobby was beautifully 'zen' and spotless. The complimentary breakfast was a great touch too - fresh pastries, kona coffee, pinapple/orange juice, fruit and if you're lucky wonderful hotel manager, Leonor Wong, will walk around with a basket of hard boiled eggs, granola bars, or other breakfast-y items and orchids. Saving the best for last, I'd like to thank thank thank Leonor and her staff including Robert, Angie, Sheika, Jay, and everyone. They were all SUPER friendly, with smiles every time we saw them. When we inquired where to rent boogie boards for the beach, they went and got us a pair - no charge. When we wanted to watch movies in our room (but couldn't register for netflix, being Canadian), Robert came to our room and signed into his personal account for us, when we said that our plane leaves at 10pm, Leonor said that we could stay in our room until then, foregoing the usual 11am check-out. I could go on and on but I think those examples shows the dedication of the staff at Hotel Renew to their guests. For that, thank you!The only only thing missing may have been a pool and a gym, but it honestly didn't bother me that much. Our days were packed as it was.

Another great perk was that we were able to keep our bags in our room on our last day until we left at 6:00 p.m. Our checkout was supposed to be at 12:00, but we were offered to stay until later so that we could come and rest for a little bit before our flight.

My wife and I both decided that this was our best trip to Honolulu so far simply because of the great experience we had at Hotel Renew. You can definitely plan on us coming again and staying at this wonderful Hotel.",Utah,3,5.0

The name is quite appropriate as the entire hotel has recently been beautifully renovated. In fact, the lobby had just been completed prior to our stay. The lobby's design sets the tone for what you will expect as a guest--calm, relaxation and renewal.Our room was clean, modern and very comfortable. With just the right touches. We happened to have a small deck and a view of the ocean from our room. The bed was comfortable and fluffy. The staff made us feel like part of the family - in fact, we were lucky enough to be invited to join the staff and owners during the traditional Hawaiian blessing of the hotel. Leonor, Richard and the rest of the staff made us feel welcome and were so helpful and accommodating.We took advantage of the continental breakfast each morning as a refreshing start to our day. While the hotel does not have room service or a spa in the facility, we really didn't miss it. Their sister hotels a few blocks away have spa facilities, and frankly we wanted to explore as it was our first trip to Hawaii. The location is perfect--close to Waikiki Beach (1/2 block), yet far enough from the noise and traffic. Plenty of convenience stores, shopping and restaurants within walking distance.Our honeymoon was picture-perfect thanks to the lovely people at the Hotel Renew. We're looking forward to celebrating our anniversary there next year.","Seattle, Washington",3,5.0

We could not have been more pleased. We have nothing but great things to say about the hotel—and in particular the hotel staff.First, the location: It’s about a block from the beach and is next door to one of the many ABC stores, which sell souvenirs, beverages, and small groceries. It’s also only a couple of blocks from the bus stop. This was great for getting to the various things to see in Honolulu and Waikiki. (The four-day pass more than paid for itself.) The airport is a 30-minute ride via shuttle, not counting any stops. Hotel Renew is accessible to everything yet somehow very quiet and calming once you enter.The design is very attractive and well-executed. The lobby was recently remodeled with a very tasteful Asian motif, with dark wood, lots of flowers, walls faced with river stones, and a trickling fountain. Very peaceful.The rooms are of average American size—definitely large enough, but if you are looking for the maximum acreage possible, there are probably larger, though for much more money. The room was very comfortable and quiet. Some rooms have a stunning, sweeping ocean view, but they also face a nearby hotel that has an outdoor tiki bar. Other rooms (like ours, room 903) face other hotels and apartment buildings, with a bit of mountain visible in the distance. These rooms cost less and are quieter. The windows had roll-down sun shades as well as solid door-like coverings you slide to cover up the windows. They kept the light out much better than blinds or curtains. We slept like babies.But the best thing about Hotel Renew was its staff. Everyone, from the bellmen to the front-desk clerks to the housekeeper, was sincerely eager to be of help and did their jobs perfectly.And most notable of all was the wonderful lady who heads guest services, Leonor Wong. Leonor was always surprising us with niceties, offering us snacks or drinks when she saw us in the lobby. (Which was often--she must work 12 hours per day.) On our final day, she even let us hang out in another room long after we checked out of ours at around noon. This allowed us to relax, watch TV, and not have to go anywhere before our shuttle picked us up in the early evening. A very thoughtful gesture that has never been offered by any other hotel anywhere we have stayed. Leonor was the essence of Hawai’ian hospitality—genuinely warm and repeatedly generous. Her attention to the guests is the hotel’s greatest asset. There might be a few hotels in Oahu that could come close to Hotel Renew's luxury, but I have no doubt that none can match the sincere aloha spirit with which Leonor anticipated our needs and showered us with unexpected graciousness.One neat thing about the room was that we had a projector instead of a conventional TV screen. Thus the image for the TV was about 80 inches. It also included free Internet; a hidden computer CPU handled both the TV tuner and Internet access. It also had a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse. We had a problem with the projector at one point, but it was quickly fixed by hotel maintenance. The other unique feature was the lighting; one could, from either the bed or the doorway, turn all the lights on or off at once or press a “just right” button that set them all to a slightly dim level. (Not all the rooms have this, however.) There was a small refrigerator instead of a mini-bar—a blessing, given that I always worry I’ll somehow incur a mistaken charge. And the ABC store next door has everything you could want.The room was spotlessly clean. The beds were very soft. The marble bathroom included towels of Turkish cotton. The elevators were quick and never crowded. The housekeeper left chocolates and fruit each day. The in-room safe worked as it should. The only improvement I can think of would be the addition of an active blower-vent in the bathroom—a feature that many hotels seem to be dispensing with. Still, this was a very minor omission, more than compensated for by the other amenities and the exceptional service.There is no pool, but you’re a block from the Pacific Ocean. If you come to Hawaii to swim in chlorinated water, you don’t need a hotel; you need a mental institution. Surfing and even a free evening Hula demonstration are a short walk away.Parking is available at the hotel for $8/day—which would be a bargain even in cities in the mainland US—or you can park overnight for free at the nearby Kapiolani Park a few blocks away, just up Kalakaua Avenue.If you are looking for a wild party scene, that can be had nearby. But if you want an intimate, relaxing, and luxurious hotel that feels more like a bed and breakfast, you can do no better than Hotel Renew.","Washington, DC",108,5.0

We stayed for 2 nights in mid-April ... the hotel is in a good location, rooms are very nicely decorated (boutique style), very comfortable bed, flat screen TV with internet, and a nice bathroom, all new except for the tub which I don't think was replaced, although I might be wrong on that? The room was fairly compact, but with a king size bed, chair, ottoman, desk and closet, there was enough room and comfort for the two of us. They've done a nice job on the reno!Our room was on the 3rd floor, so no view, but there was a lanai. We would stay here again, but would upgrade to a higher floor, with a view. We didn't get to meet Lenor, but Terry was very helpful, as were all of the staff that we talked to.We missed breakfast (7:30-9:30) because we were out early each day ... still adjusting to the time change and wanting to get an early start at Pearl Harbor on the first day and Diamond Head on the second day. Enjoyed the apples in the room each day though and chocolates on the bed. It's very convenient to Waikiki beach (1 block) and a parking garage in the opposite direction (a few minutes walk) where parking is $8./day. We stayed in Waikiki because we felt it was something we had to do once, but were so impressed by it (beautiful beach...along with walkways, gardens, ponds, benches, etc. that stretch the whole length of the beach) that we would stay again on a return visit to Hawaii. It's busy, but fun and interesting. Most of this trip was spent in Kauai, but we would like to explore more on Oahu and look forward to a return visit to both Waikiki and Hotel Renew.","ON, Canada",160,4.0

Althought the lobby was not finished, it did not cause us any problems. Our rooms were not ready, as it was only 9am, but Leonor showed us to a room where we stored our bags, and we could change and have a shower if we wanted. When we arrived back at the hotel later, our rooms were ready and our bags already in the rooms. My sister and I had a room with 2 double beds, and our parents had a room with a king bed. We found the rooms beautifuly decorated, and VERY clean! We found the rooms big, we had a lot of bags so this was great. We had oceanfront rooms, and the views were beautiful! Beds were very soft and comfortable, and were new ( I pulled some of the sheets up to find new, very clean matresses!). The bathrooms were a goog size as well. The shelves next to the sink were very handy to store all our makeup hair products, hairdryers, and straightners. The shower also had a sliding glass door, so much better than those plastic shower curtains that other hotels use. A good size closet which also had a safe in it, which was free to use. On our first night we were treated to a fresh fruit basket and a box of chocolates and a note from Leonor welcomeing us in each of our rooms. House keeping did a great job and always left a fresh flower and a chocolate on each of our beds every day. Another night we arrived back to our rooms to find that Leonor had left a bottle of champagne in each room. On our last night we found a bag full of freah muffins and juices in each of our rooms, as we were being picked up to go to the airport at 5am. Another nice touch from Leonor as she didn't think that she would be in that morning. But as we were packing our bags into the car Leonor pulled up to say goodbye to us and give us a lei each, which she had pearsonly made! Leonor is fantastic and did so much to make our stay more comfortable! They need to pay her more! The free breakfast was a nice touch, and although is mostly muffins, bread ( theres a toaster), fruit, juice, tea and coffee, it was always good, and its free so you cant complain! They also give you everything you could need for the beach, like beach towels, beach mats, etc! We hired a mini cooper convertable from the Little Hawaii Car Rental which was great. They drop the car off to you and pich it up, which was so handy. Although there isnt a car park at the hotel there is a carpark around the corner which was only $8 for 24hrs. My sister and dad did a shark dive with Hawaii Shark Encounters which they loved and said that the company was very good and they felt very safe in the cage! To get to and from the airport we used a company called Airport island shuttles which we booked from home. Once we had claimed our bags we called the company and the told us where to wait, and the driver who was already waiting at the airport, met us there two minutes later. We were the only people in the van and it only cost $40 US for all 4 of us. There were some great restaurants near the hotel, cheeseburger in paradise was great! Theres an ABC store on every corner, which has everything you could need. We loved our stay at hotel renew, and cant wait to come back and stay again!","australia, NSW",33,5.0

The beach is just a block away and you are within walking distance of everything.(food,shopping,night life) We were greeted with chocolates in the room, a great big hug from the manager Lenor and to our surprise a bottle of champagne, chilled and ready to go on our 4th night there. Customer Service is top notch.You will have to book your tours directly but allow them to schedule your ride back to the airport. It's much cheaper than the going rates of taxi. The hotel is also located right off the the city bus line which is a great option for sight seeing. We took the bus from the beach and to a few other local places and it was only $2 per person to ride it. Upon leaving, they were just finishing the lobby renovation and it looked fantastic!

The best part of my stay was the staff, overseen by Terry and Leonor, who were incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable about everything Oahu has to offer.A daily continental breakfast was offered during my stay, which I had not expected. This was much appreciated.There were a few minor drawbacks: the hotel has no amenities (such as a restaurant or fitness centre), the lobby was under renovation, and there is no on-site parking. However, there are lots of restaurants close by and who needs a gym when you can swim in the ocean? There is also a reasonably-priced parking lot close by.Overall, this was one of my best hotel experiences ever and I hope to have the opportunity to stay at the Hotel Renew again.","Vancouver, BC",3,5.0

Originally planning on staying at the Prince Kuhio; a hotel we’d stayed at in ’05 and ’06, we were unable to locate it due to an ownership change. What a stroke of major Luck that turned out to be!While browsing hotel names we came upon Hotel Renew. Expedia advised that it was undergoing a major renovation, but it also had a 3 ½ star rating. The price seemed nice, and we are always up for a bit of adventure, so we booked the hotel.When we arrived we discovered that the lobby was being renovated; but that didn’t dampen the enthusiastic welcome we received from the staff, including Joe K., the bellman, and Erick at the front desk located temporarily on the second floor.When we got to our room we were blown away by the décor’s understated elegance. In a Deco-moderne style ( according to my wife ), the room was very comfortably appointed. The flat-screen HDTV mounted on the wall, the included high-speed internet, the sophisticated lighting system, king-sized bed and a crib for our 2 ½ -year old, all contributed to a sense of sublime comfort and relaxation.Our maid, Tina, fastidiously restored our room each day despite our son’s efforts at remodeling, and the flowers and chocolates on the pillow were just the cat’s meow.Leonor W., the executive housekeeper, was always right on time with whatever we needed, and she was intuitively adept at relating to our son, who fell in love with her and Joe, who played Spiderman with him.It was great to have the opportunity to speak with the general manager, Terry, on a regular basis; who seemed to be involved in every aspect of the hotel operations from management functions to physically working on the lobby renovation.The complementary continental breakfast featured fresh tropical juices, Hawaiian coffees, tea, fresh fruits, toast and sweet rolls. The intimate table settings allowed interaction with other guests at the start of the day, contributing to the familial atmosphere that persisted despite the elegance of the hotel décor.The lobby’s grand opening was planned for the day after our departure, and I wanted to cancel our return flight just to see the realization of the work.Throughout my travels over the years I have never enjoyed the combination of luxurious appointments and wonderfully personal and professional attention provided by the entire staff.I would not hesitate for a moment to recommend the Hotel Renew to anyone travelling to Honolulu.","Oak Park, Il",10,5.0

This cozy-modern hotel located 1 big hotel away from Waikiki Beach is a little hard to find at first due to it's smaller number of floors and one-way streets in the city. Located directly across from the mega-sized Marriott, Hotel Renew is close to finishing the interior lobby renovations. Oahu is a busy city so don't be surprised by some bustling activity outside but our room was quiet and we weren't affected by any of the renovations or outside action. The staff were very pleasant and helpful with Leonor Wong a very outgoing and friendly Hawaiian ambassador ! The room had a very comfortable king bed and a ton of comfy pillows all very clean and the room was neat and tidy. The decor was asian elegance inspired with a crisp white with black accents with a very convenient lighting scheme and ambient controls. Chocolates and flowers were on our pillows every day and we were pleasantly surprised by champagne, fruit basket and chocolates as we celebrated our 6 month anniversary ! We usually were able to get a parking spot right behind the hotel but only 2 blocks away was an alt parking garage for $8/day (most large hotels in the area were charging $15-$20/day). After sightseeing and dealing with heavy traffic throughout Oahu, the room was an oasis for us which included a complementary computer system wired through the 36"" HD TV mounted on the wall above the desk. A safe was included in the room which should have been mounted to the cabinetry and the A/C was noisy at times. Hotel Renew is a more private and cozy hotel than compared to the monster brands available and is located so very close to the beach and convenient ABC/Wolfgang Puck/Tiki Bar restaurants.

This hotel was a total disappointment. We were aware that when we booked this hotel that there was going to be renovations late 2007 early 2008 but were assured that they would be complete when we arrived in mid March. We did contact the hotel 2 weeks before hand and were told that most of the rooms were complete and that the lobby may not be open by the time of our arrival but that the renovations would have little impact on our stay….sorry to say on our “brief” stay, it did.We arrived at 3am in the morning having delayed flights from Auckland via Fiji, we were just ready for Bed. The taxi driver could barely find the hotel as it was not lit very well. There was no real entrance to this hotel but only a sign telling us to take the lift to the 2nd floor and go to room 202 I think, the reception was a room !!! in the hotel, not looking good at this stage !! but the staff were pleasant and checked us in without any fuss, well after all it was 3am !!!. We got to our room and our first impression was it was small but décor was nice but bags were just left and straight to bed.Next morning we were awoken by the light in the room, one of the windows did not have curtains to block out the light, we did hope for even a small lie in.The room !!, We had booked a Premier Room on a higher floor with Ocean view. The room was nice but on the small side, the colours and décor were indeed pleasing on the eye and the Ocean view was nice. In my opinion the lay out of the room was not good which resulted in the room feeling quite small, there was little room for luggage and very little storage space for cloths. There is a fancy lighting system in the room which as an electrician was a nice touch. The TV/Entertainment system is what they call state of the art !! but for some reason, is on the side wall to the bed which I feel is in the wrong place, we did not have time to use this so not fair to comment on it.The Bathroom !!. this was again on the small site, yet again, décor was nice but storage space for toiletries etc was limited and was on an open shelf to the right of the sink ?? again, strange location.Breakfast !! The breakfast room was yet again a converted bedroom consisting of I think 3 small round tables with a few chairs, when we were there, there was no one else, not that it could hold many people. There were two toasters, bread, cereals some pastries and a bowl of fruit, it was not an ideal setting for a holiday in Honolulu.The Staff !!, the staff indeed were very friendly and when we went to them after our breakfast to tell them of how disappointed we were in how we found the hotel, they offered immediately to improve things for us, I suggested the only way that could happen was finding us another hotel, they got on the phone straight away (9am) and by 10am we were settled in a lovely Premier room with Ocean view in the Hilton Waikiki Prince Kuhio, which I will review over the coming days. We were charged the same rate for this room and also were not charged for our brief stay in the Hotel Renew.It may be unfair to review this hotel while the renovations were not complete and the fact that we only spent 6 hours in the hotel, but in my opinion, even if the Lobby etc is complete, I don’t think there is any comparison with this hotel and say the Hilton Waikiki Prince Kuhio which has everything a holiday maker could want. On our short stay in Hotel Renew, the hotel had, no reception, no lobby, no restaurant, no bar, no swimming pool. I know this is Waikiki Beach, but when out on the beech for the day or back from a tour, it is always nice to relax in the lobby or restaurant or bar but afraid Hotel Renew fell very short in all aspects.","Dublin, Ireland",37,2.0

Our only complaint was the air-conditioning was old and whatever setting one used it was either ""Very cold"" or ""not working"".The location was excellent and within 200m of Waikiki beach and the restaurants along it.",London,4,4.0

Having been my fourth visit to Honolulu since December (I am sure you can all figure out why), I have had my share of experiences in and around the Waikiki area (from absolutely harrowing one night at the Hawaiiana; to the relaxing and comfortable at the Waikiki Parc). This stay has been one of the most pleasing!High Notes: +The room decor of course! This is one of the first hotels I have experienced where the photographs on their Website were on par with the actual experience.+The Staff! Leonor was an absolute pleasure to speak with and is as accommodating and lovely as other reviews have noted. Tina from housekeeping was great! She kept my room in tip top shape, provided us with fresh fruits and chocolates daily and was just a wonderfully sweet woman. I spoke with Grace on a daily basis (sorry for the trouble, Grace!). She was so wonderful as well and addressed my every concern and question. The three gentlemen working the 'lobby' made us feel welcome every time we entered, greeting with genuine smiles and pleasantries. There is not enough I can say here.+Location. Very close to the beach is a definite plus!If I can nit-pick on anything, it would NOT be on the lobby construction since it is sure to be finished soon and I can bet it will follow suit in terms of attractiveness and taste.-Windows do not open enough for me. I am not much of an A/C man, so I usually open windows. I guess there is a safety reason for this.-Be aware of a transient that likes to hang out near the Starbucks (he will ask for just a few cents every time). He can get a bit aggressive and hostile. But that is not the hotel's fault, just a reality of Waikiki.There is no reason I can recommend you stay elsewhere for the value you get at Hotel Renew. I seriously stand by that statement.Tips:-You are in jogging distance of Diamond head Crater. If you start early, you can probably make a run to the top before sunset (not for the faint hearted of course). I did a few days running around the crater as well as up.-There is plenty of free parking if you are willing to walk a little bit (as we all should to help enjoy the wonderful Hawaii weather!) The parking meters stop after 6:00pm and a quarter will buy you about 60 minutes at Kapioloni park. Monsarrat has plenty of non-metered parking as well (can be hit/miss on very nice days).Last, but not least:-Enjoy yourself and relax. I see far too many stressed out people ""vacationing"" in Hawaii. If things bother you, stop, breathe and look around at the paradise you are truly privileged to enjoy.Matthew White, Colorado (for now)","Denver, CO",2,5.0

I knew that renovations were going on, but the overall experience was not great. We couldn't believe the drab grey hallways! It looked like a run-down prison. We had no alarm clock, or coffee maker in the room! When I asked for a clock I was told to simply call the front desk if I needed a wake-up call. I really just like to see what time it is if I wake up during the night. The continental breakfast was not worth going to....in a little tiny room with bad juice and muffins. And the tiny bathroom drove me crazy for 2 days with no counter space whatsoever.We only stayed for 2 nights, but I wouldn't stay here again if we go back to Honolulu. I'd rather pay more and stay at the Marriott next door. Note: After your stay they send you an email with a link to TripAdvisor asking if you would write a review - this must be the law of averages that if they get so many reviews and most are good they get the #1 spot.

Since we don't usually enjoy staying in areas which cater primarily to tourists, we've avoided Oahu for years and have focused on visiting remoter parts of the other islands instead. Our primary purpose for this trip was to visit the Arizona Memorial, climb Diamond Head and experience Waikiki--an iconic tourist mecca. We were pleasantly surprised by the ""kitchiness"" of Waikiki and how low key (relaxing) it was--especially during the day. Staying at the Hotel Renew--in spite of its rennovation-in-progress--proved to be a good choice for various reasons and only added to the positive experience of our visit.* Easy to reach the Hotel Renew via the $9 shuttle from the airport. We elected to use public transportation or taxi throughout our stay since we had heard / read that the traffic was horrendous, and we just didn't want to deal with it. How nice to sit back and read the newspaper while we let someone else do the driving (Bus: $2 each way per person; Taxi: considerably more, but sometimes worth it for the convenience).* Small, intimate hotel that could be considerd ""boutique"" just one block from Waikiki on the quieter end (Room 306--no view of the ocean, but this was fine for us--especially for the price)* Friendly, helpful greeting at the door* By the time we checked in (staff was friendly, quick and efficient--but not rushed) our bags were already in our room!* Clean; attention to detail apparent (see photos)* Mood lighting* Comfortable beds* Requests made were promptly fulfilled* Recommendations for local eats (try ""Ono Hawaiian Foods"") and a special night out with an on-the-beach sunset view (try ""Hau Tree Lanai"") were on target.All-in-all, we would return to Waikiki and stay at the completely rennovated Hotel Renew. We're sure that with the attentive personnel (we met the General Manager, who greeted us outside the front door one afternoon when we returned from Pearl Harbor) and their desire to offer an attractive product, the Hotel Renew will continue their #1 position on Tripadvisor.","Orange, California",112,5.0

Not the Waikiki I remembered so long ago. I didn’t want to stay in a hotel with more than 10 floors and certainly not with more than 400 rooms, which most hotels were in those ranges. I also didn’t want to stay in a hotel that is several blocks away from the beach.That being said, I booked two double beds at Hotel Renew located on the 6th floor. Hotel Renew was the second hotel across from the beach. The one and only downside is that the lobby is still being renovated, though the workers were very nice and moved out of our way to let us pass. Other than that, our stay at Hotel Renew was surprisingly pleasant and took away my uncertainty. Our room was nice and roomy, though without the balcony, which we were okay with. We had ample drawers to put our clothes in. There was a safe deposit, which I tried to tip over and carried but couldn’t (too heavy). I had to test it before I can store my belongings to make sure that it wasn’t easily picked up. The bathroom was great – enough for two people. No leaks and shower pressure was perfect. We even used their shampoos, conditioners and soaps, which were great because we hadn’t brought ours. What is most important is the staff, especially Leonor, who made us feel right at home. When we first got to our room, there were two boxes of chocolates. and two guava drinks. Every day that our room was cleaned, there were little knickknacks left, such as flowers and candies. I believe that our stay would have still been pleasant even if we had not seen Leonor. The staff was helpful and made you feel welcome. One of the staff recommended Like Like Drive Inn for authentic Hawaiian food – spam and fried rice, which was great, and the other was Uncle Bo’s, though we got lost and couldn’t find the place. I bet it would have been great. Another day, we asked one of the staff for directions to a rental car. She printed the directions and also requested a taxi. To our surprise, the taxi happened to be a limousine so we asked for the same driver (David) as well on our return to the airport. Since I didn’t see a computer to use, I asked the staff to print out the boarding pass for us, which she gladly did. With all the extra efforts that the staff made for us, it sure made up for the hotel still being renovated. Plus I believe Leonor added value to our stay. She made us feel welcome, remembering our names as if we've known each other for awhile, and willing to help as much as she could. On Easter Sunday, Leonor placed a fruit basket, box of chocolates, and champagne in our room. She even gave us papaya for our breakfast. The continental breakfast was just that “continental” with fruits and pastries. The staff was pleasant and made sure that coffee, tea, and pineapple juice (this is Hawaii, after all) were always filled. We rented a car for two days and parked the car at Waikiki Banyan for $8.00 a day. No other parking places cost so little. The other hotels charged more than $15.00 per day. Everyone walked while in Waikiki so two blocks was not a problem for us. Our experience at Hotel Renew was enjoyable and truly felt the Hawaiian presence: friendly and helpful. Though I am sure the rates will increase once the renovation is completed, we would be happy to visit Hotel Renew again.",Los Angeles,5,5.0

She made me feel very welcome and went out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay. The hotel is close to the beach.

I followed the dusty footprints to the room which was being used to check in guests. Our room was assigned to us and two rooms down from us were the builders, who worked from 8.30-5.30 Mon-Fri. It wasn't too much of a problem as we were out most of the day.The corridor was dark, hot and quite seedy looking and considering it's been refurbished, it's quite tacky and the carpet didn't go right up to the edges.The rooms are small, black and white with an Asian theme and have sliding Japanese style shutters on the windows. We also had a balcony with sliding blinds which did not take out all of the light and if you had the light on in your room and walked past these blinds the people in the hotel opposite could see your outline, (I know as we tried it), which was a bit off putting when you've just come out of the shower. The bathroom was tiny, no room for toiletries and the sliding glass shower door would leak at the side and across the floor, we actually thought it was the toilet leaking at first. There was a window in the bathroom with slatted glass which you could open, my husband said it reminded him of Alcatraz, but it was so badly finished, it looked like it had just been cemented in around the edges. The a/c unit was in a wooden box with open slats so you didn't get the full effect of the unit and at night when it kicked in it was really loud, especially as the bed was so close to the a/c unit.You cannot have a window open at night because there's a singer from the hotel next door who starts early in the morning around 7am and goes on all day til after 11pm. He drove me mad, the singing was awful, we wondered if it was a karaoke bar?! Even without the singing, there's all sorts of shouting going on during the night so don't come here if you want peace and quiet. There appeared to be a group of working girls hanging around the hostel at the back of the hotel and one was leaving the room opposite us early the next morning.The hotel literature said coffee makers were available by request so we rang down for one, which was sent up when we went out. When we got back we had the coffee maker but nothing else so rang down again to be told that we had to provide our own coffee and that they might be able to find us some mugs??!!! I have never stayed at a hotel where you have to provide your own coffee!! The following day we had two sachets of coffee but didn't get them again.We only saw the 'famous' Leonor once in our 5 days and that was over the continental breakfast when she informed us that we could have beach towels etc and that they got them from what guests had left behind, so therefore not supplied by the hotel?!The toiletries are not replenished very often, we had to ask the maid for some and she said they were short. The elevator number was stuck on floor 5 our entire time so we were always a bit cautious about using it incase it broke down, the inclusive continental breakfast consists of pineapple juice (no other juice and I hate pineapple), a few pastries, white bread for toast and some muffins. You can also have a spam pastry... if you so desire.There is also absolutely no storage for toiletries and you have to put your underwear on open shelves in the wardrobe, they do not have any cupboards or drawers. There is a safe, but it's screwed on to the top of the open shelving unit which was not screwed down so you could slide the whole thing out, so therefore not very secure and I did think it might be a bit dangerous if a little kid grabbed hold of it as the whole thing would topple over.The bed had a feather topper, which was a nice reminder of home, only it wasn't secured to the bed so tended to wander during the night, the mattress also was just placed onto a board and tended to go flying if you leant against the bed.The internet did not work for the first 3 days of our stay.Having said all that, the room was clean and they may be little things that I'm picking at but when added up, they all detract from your stay. The hotel sign was also made bigger on the last day of our stay so it should be easier to find now.Personally I would say, if you want to stay in the busy noisy part of Honolulu then come here when the hotel is finished and don't stay for too long or those little things might bug you too.",UK,17,2.0

Check-in: Upon arrival we discovered that there was nowhere to park on-site and that the parking facility for the hotel was 2 blocks away, with no valet service available. While my husband went to park the car the bellman stood there and watched me struggle with my bags, with no offer to assist me. Granted, I didn't ask for help but I shouldn't have had to ask! While I knew the hotel had been undergoing extensive renovations, my assumption was that renovations would have been completed by now, but they have not. The lobby is still under construction and the temporary location of the check-in desk/concierge on the second floor is very awkward and not inviting; ditto the room across the hallway used for continental breakfast. When exiting the elevator to check-in, the door hit me hard enough to leave a large bruise on my arm. The door didn't stop automatically the way most elevator doors do if someone is still entering or exiting. I am not sure if it was broken or that is how it normally functions, but I made sure to get in and out of the elevator in a hurry after that! If this had happened to a child or elderly person it could have caused them serious physical harm. This happened right as we were checking in, and the only reaction from the hotel's concierge was a muttered ""sorry."" An ""are you okay?"" would have been a better response. In fairness, he seemed to have limited English skills so perhaps he didn't understand what I was saying. The room:The room had a strange - although not entirely unpleasant - odor to it and was much smaller that I had anticipated after looking at the photos on the hotel's website. The renovations seemed to have been done in a pretty slapdash manner, but the room was spotless and the bed was extremely comfortable. We had a great view of the beach, but also a view of Tiki's (bar) in the hotel next door. The noise from the pool/bar area begins about 7:00 am (including loud music beginning around 8am) and continues into the late night. This is, of course, completely out of the control of Hotel Renew but is kind of annoying nonetheless.Bottom line: For $300 a night, I won't be going back with such a huge collection of other hotels with a similar price point to choose from in Honolulu.",West Coast,9,3.0

The room was freshened daily and was a joy to return to after our busy days of sight-seeing. The personal touches like the chocolates and flowers left on our bed were very much appreciated, along with the Valentine's Day treat of chocolates and champagne - it made our stay memorable.Our room was located next door to 2 rooms being remodeled and we were never disturbed by any noise. The reconstruction effort did not interfere with our visit at all.My only concern was a lack of privacy with the use of the make-shift office on the second floor. I would have appreciated a place to sit in the hallway while I waited to speak with someone in the office. With that being said, I think it is important to note that the level of service never failed and we were cared for right up until the end of our stay. Leonor made sure we had the use of a room on the day of our departure, after check-out, since our flight was scheduled for later in the evening. We have traveled the world and very rarely find this level of proactive-service from a member of staff.

I'm glad I was traveling solo because two people in the room would have been totally unmanageable. While I appreciated the outdoor space the balcony provided, and the views of both the ocean (fab sunsets!) and the mountains, the noise from the street was unnerving. The sounds of trucks, buses, brakes and horns were constant from 8am until 10pm. After getting accustomed to hearing the surf of the North Shore the previous week, the city noises were horrific. I was very impressed with the decor and furniture choices in the room and bathroom -- I like the modern approach with the asian flavor. And the flat screen TV was cool. But I was promised computer access and I didn't get it -- my room was not yet wired for a keyboard. That was disppointing.The on-going renovations were not a problem but it also meant that there were no amenities.

The service is excellent and very personalized. All of the great reviews written about Lenor are true, and the other employees we met are also very nice too. Lenor would greet us by name whenever she saw us and would always ask if there was anything she could do. She spoiled us with a lot of high-quality goodies during our stay... cakes, chocolates, juices, and cookies. I've stayed at a few 5-star hotels in the past and the service here seems to exceed those places due to the highly-personalized feel.The hotel is relatively dark compared to what you would normally expect in Hawaii. Yes, the room does have a lot of fancy lighting options, but it's the design (dark furniture, dark walls) that gives it a dark, elegant feel that you would expect to see at a trendy Manhattan boutique hotel. It's a nice design but it might not appeal to everyone. Our room had two double beds, an 80-inch projection TV (yes, it's huge), dell computer w/ dvd player, wireless keyboard / mouse, Klipsch speakers, high-speed internet, NetFlix on demand movies (never tried it) , remote control lighting, mini-fridge, and a large safe. All of the electronic gadgets are very cool but most people probably won't be spending a lot of time in the room anyway. I think we watched 30 minutes of TV during the whole week. The beds are very comfortable and luxurious but the down comforters were too warm for the tropical climate. The rooms are a bit on the small size and have lower than average ceiling height. The walls are too thin (especially in the bathroom) and you can hear everything next door. I could hear our neighbor blowing his nose in the morning. Our city-view room had a medium-sized window with a view of another building. In Hawaii, a lot of people expect floor-to-ceiling windows with a lot of light coming in -- not here. The room does have a warm, welcoming feel and there is a lot of storage space. Overall, this a good choice for those curious about the technology or trendy decor. Those who aren't used to great service will love the personalized service from Lenor and her staff, but others may miss the valet parking and room service that is traditionally found in high-end hotels. For $150-$175 this is a good value, but the $300+ rack rate seems excessive.","Oxnard, California",20,4.0

We were staying on the 6th floor, and my parents on the 9th floor, on the ocean side, and we both had a great view. The renovated rooms are gorgeous, with modern colours, and with many specially placed drawers and shelves so that they are able to fit in a lot of storage space in a relatively small area while still keeping the design sleek. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. One of my favourite touches was the lighting - when you enter the room you have the option of lighting the entire room with a dim ambient setting, or brightly, or turning off all the lights (yet you still have individual controls of each light at your bedside). It really helps so that you are not stumbling around trying to find light switches, and I wish more hotels would do something as smart as this. As others have mentioned, the staff went above and beyond to make sure that we had a comfortable stay. The breakfast is simple but tasty and convenient, and Lenoor dropped by every day to say hello to everyone. All of the staff were very friendly, they genuinely seem happy to get to know you, and they gave us a boogie board to use, beach mats, and those little beach chairs, all free of charge. The rooms were always very well cleaned and neatly arranged for when we arrived back each afternoon, and the staff left fruit, flowers, and chocolates in our room, which was so sweet.

We were skeptical at first because of the ongoing renovations that were previously mentioned. However, during our stay we experienced nothing but bliss. The Ocean Deluxe room was amazing. It was beautiful, clean, functional, and roomy. All the amenities that were mentioned on the hotel's site were in our room. Also, I noticed some reviewers complain about lighting in the bathroom. Dan the bellman pointed out that there's a silver, sensor touch button between the sink and toilet. If you touch it, it adds extra illumination. As for the complaints about the loud music next door, it wasn't as loud as people describe. It was actually soothing to hear the live music from our balcony. The band doesn't play all throughout the night and if you sleep with the windows closed you should be okay. The location was one block from Kuhio Beach. Almost everything you need is walkable distance. Waikiki Beach is about 3 to 4 blocks from the hotel. It's not that bad of a walk because you'll be distracted by all the stores, restaurants, and entertainment along the way. As for parking. the nearest parking garage from the hotel is called the Waikiki Banyan located a block away. It's $8/day to park there, which is a deal in comparison to other parking garages. The service was impeccable. Our check-in with Keenan went very quickly and smoothly. We finally met the famous Lenore. She does truly does live up to what everybody says. She sincerely cares about the guests. She welcomed us with open arms (literally). Our room attendant cleaned our room everyday. We would always find our bed neatly made with little chocolates on top. One day we found a basket of fruit, champagne, and a box of chocolates in our room! How awesome is that? What I also loved about the service is that you can borrow beach towels and mats at the front desk so no need to pack extra. The complimentary breakfast was yummy with various pastries, coffee, and pineapple juice.

In addition, she brought us some gifts of leis and chocolates to make our stay more memorable.Since we were moving to Hawaii, we had brought our Yorkie Anna. The Hotel Renew was only one of a handful of facilities on the island that accept pets. Hotel Renew went out of their way to make our pet comfortable as well by providing dog treats, pet bowls, dog toys and a nice doggie bed for our four-legged princess. The facility was still under renovation but the construction crews and staff ensured that we were not bothered. The newly-renovated rooms were wonderful with a true Zen-like feeling that is not kitschy. There is also plenty of storage in the rooms but they still maintain a clean look.The property half a block away from the beach so you can easily walk to the beach, shops and restaurant from the property. This means you don't have to worry about moving your vehicle constantly.

Can't say enough about how accommodating they were. My GF and I were there for 8 days in February The place is still under construction, but it did not effect us once we got to our room - not such a big inconvenience at all. Upon arriving, the wireless internet was going in and out - we called downstairs and then they actually brought a router up to our room to plug our computer directly into. The next day they brought another one for my GF once I told them that she also had a laptop and had the same issue. Our room had a nice 32"" LCD TV... we called downstairs and they brought us a DVD player and installed it for us. Every time they brought something, they said ""anything you want, just let us know"" - and they did take care of everything. The manager actually told us that he had a few higher speed routers after I told him that I watch streamed television on my laptop - then they switched out a router with a more high speed router - was great.the lights are great. you can control all the lights in the whole room/bathroom from the little remote control on the side of the bed - very cool - and you can dim, etc... again, very cool.every morning we were greeted at breakfast by Leonor, everything they say about her is correct - total sweetheart - looking to help out the hotel guests - she made us feel like family. the breakfast was a very good continental breakfast. after breakfast we went to the check-in area and they had beach chairs, towels, etc. for us - no need to bring your own or rent them at the beach.we had a late night flight coming home... we brought this to leonor's attention to request a very late checkout or at least a few hours... she let us stay in our room until 9pm on the night we left! No hotels ever do that - it is almost like having another day. they could have just given us a place to store our bags - or a random room which was unused, instead we actually got to keep our room. so nice....the negatives: construction - will be done soon; wireless didn't work well - but they more than made up for it; no parking - it would have been nice but i understand the issues.the positives: can't say enough about the service, great location, great modern rooms, nice amenities, nice bathrooms, great lighting / light controls. felt like home!great deal - i am sure it will be much more expensive once all the renovations are complete - and it will still be worth it. we will be back. thank you Leonor.","Los Angeles, California",19,5.0

You can't beat a nicely, stylish, remodeled hotel at a great rate combined with the location being 1 block from the beach. The renovated rooms should have the large flat screen LCD/HD TV, we noticed that wasn't in the room and a call to the front desk got things remedied quickly.

I expected much, much more from ""Honolulu's first true luxury boutique hotel."" That is not to say that the hotel will not become that in the future. I can see where they want to go with their vision, and I have no doubt that they will achieve it. But they are far from ready to call themselves that now. I had very high hopes for the Hotel Renew. But within moments of arriving, I knew right away there going to be problems. Our first interaction with a hotel employee was a disinterested bell-hop. More concerned with text messaging on his cell phone, we were left to haul our own luggage out of the towncar. I knew going into it that the lobby is still under construction. I made sure to take a peak behind the plywood barrier to see how far they had come. I was shocked. They are quite a way off from anything resembling a lobby of any sort. I am guessing sometime late this summer is a good guess at completion. Up to the second floor to check in, and I will mention even the elevators need work. Creaky, cramped and smelling of the 60's. The check-in staff was nice enough. Our Deluxe Ocean View room was not ready. We were a couple hours early, so we anticipated some delay. The check-in girl called housekeeping and asked to put a rush on our room and make it a priority since we had just checked in. Very good move on her part. So she was to call us as soon as the room was ready. This was about 12:30 in the afternoon. At about 2:30 and no phone call, we called the hotel and were told the room would be ready in 20 minutes. Regular check-in time is 3:00pm. Where was the rush we were promised? The room itself was nice. Very nice. They did a wonderful job with the space they had to work with. A bottle of champagne sent up from the ever popular Leonor had put the Hotel Renew back on track. Until later that evening, the brand new toilet backed up and flooded a bit. It took 45 minutes and 3 phone calls to the front desk to get the requested plunger sent to the room. Although I was told the general manager would be up to take care of it himself, I am not altogether certain it was him. The bed was perfect, the pillows perfect, the rest was perfect. But I am conflicted as to how I feel about the hotel on the whole. You cannot slap on a few coats of paint, buy some nice bed linens, set up a flat screen TV and call yourself a luxury hotel. Yes, we paid a fantastically cheap rate for a top notch location, so is this a case of ""you get what you pay for?"" The Hotel Renew will one day be all they claim to be. They just quite simply, are not that right now. I will certainly be back and be happy to stay with them again. But I am going to wait a good year or so to make sure they are up and running at full speed. I can only in good conscience give them a ""neutral"" rating. They will be great one day, I am certain.

Leonor was kind enough to leave chocolates each day and on the Friday 1st of February - I was booked for a Lu-Au. I bumped into Leonor in the lift and she said she had some goodies for me when I told her. I took a quick shower and she came with a big basket of fruit and a nut type looking lei. Leonor was FANTASTIC, I was able to extend my stay 2 extra nights with no hassle.I highly recommend this hotel for the warm staff, the close proximity to the beach and all nearby attractions. If you have hired a car you can park just around the corner for $8USD a day and you can come and go as many times as you like at the car park for the flat $8USD a day rate. Its a short 5min walk from the hotel and is very convenient - located near the corner of Kuhio Ave and Paoakalani St.Stay at the Hotel Renew - its a great hotel!

It was such a great stay - the lobby was stil being renovated but they have set it up so that it is really no inconvenience. The hotel is VERY close to the beach, the rooms are great. The design and decor is cool and trendy - much more hip that the usual Honolulu hotels - not glitzy or tacky, which i really loved. The beds are VERY comfortable and I loved the rear projection TV with internet access and free movies - when you are a tourist and not carrying around a laptop it is so great to just have free internet access in your room without having to use a business centre - so many places in this price range charge outrageous internet access fees. The only (minor) compliant would be that the complimentary breakfast was pretty basic - I imagine this will change after renovations are complete, but it would be nice to have some more options - maybe some granola & breakfast ceeral as well as toast & fruit. really friendly, helpful staff.","Sydney, Australia",8,5.0

Although the hotel was still under renovations, it definately met my expectations and more! ServiceThis was by the best service I have ever had, from the front desk to the Manager (Ms Leonor Wong). Everytime we needed help they were there for us. They helped us with transportation, shopping and finding fantastic restaurants during our stay, they even went out of their way to book a few of our reservations for us. Ms Wong went out of her way to assist us with everything, and would always ask us to make sure we were enjoying our stay and help us if required.LocationThe hotel is located just off of Waikiki Beach. The location is pretty good. You are near all bus and trolly stops and can get to all the major attractions very easily. Shopping is all around here along with great restaurants.RoomsThe rooms were great, we had one facing the back of the hotel so I can't say for sure how the views were but we were happy enough with the room we were staying in. The rooms had full internet and large a flat screen TV. Very modern trendy rooms with a nice comfortable king sized bed.There is a continental breakfast in the morning, which is a big plus. nothing fancy but a good selection of pastries, fruit and coffee/tea.The renovations to the hotel will be done around March, I would love to check the hotel out again when they are fully completed - for the price, location and service, this was definately well worth the stay. Thanks to everyone at Hotel Renew, we had a great time during our stay, we would stay there again in a heart beat!!!",Calgary,114,5.0

We were impressed (the lobby was still in the process of reconstruction). Very European--reminscent of our stays in London and Paris. The rooms were modern and sleek; beds very comfortable; shower/towels/linens/signature toiletry amenities very satisfactory. The continental breakfast was excellent with free newspaper, cold pineapple juice, Illy brand coffee and fresh pastries. The famous Leonor Wong amazingly not only matched but transcended our high expectations in personal service and aloha spirit. She made us feel welcome with smiles and hugs, and extra touches of hospitality. She is the epitome of what hotel staff should be in terms of customer service. Leonor Wong made us feel that we were staying at her personal Bed & Breakfast inn rather than a model hotel chain. We loved the flat screen TV with large screen viewing of the Internet and email.Some glitches: Internet service was spotty (but that happens at home, too), the lighting in the bathroom was too dark for makeup and hair (as stated by the guests before us), and the DVD player had audio problems (however, the general manager, Terry, came to the room personally to successfully fix it).

Our room was beautiful and spacious (king bed) and the flat screen TV was a bonus, as they had just arrived.We would definitely recommend the hotel. We had friends staying at other locations in the Waikiki area, paying two and three times more than what we paid, and their rooms paled in comparison.

The cheap parking at the Waikiki Banyan nearby was a big plus, too.The rooms are just as nice as they look in the pictures. They have lots of shelves and drawers, which is great for feeling more settled rather than digging through your suitcase every time you need something. The bathrooms are also nice, and I loved the supplied products (especially the body scrub). The maid(s) did an excellent job with our room, even folding our clothes and straightening our shoes. We didn't have a view, but you don't stay in a hotel a block from the beach if that's important to you. It was nice to have the simple breakfast in the morning. We're not big breakfast people so coffee, juice, and pastries are all we need. The breakfast room was cramped but I assume that will be remedied with the construction is done.The only complaints I can think of about the rooms are fairly minor. The internet through our TV never worked, and we were told a work order would have to be submitted to have it fixed. It wasn't a big deal to us so we told them not to bother, but why is it up to us to require that something be fixed? I would think a complaint from a guest about something not working would be good enough for the hotel to take action. My only other quibble is that without an overhead light in the bathroom it was sort of dark in the shower.We only heard construction noise one morning, although sometimes we'd have to wait for an elevator because the workers were using them to the upper floors (no freight elevator?). Signs in the elevator indicated the lobby would be done by the end of January, but it looked pretty far from completion. I think there are other amenities that aren't ready yet, too. Instead of an iPod docking station we had a beat-up clock radio in our room.All the mentions of staff introducing themselves and free goodies in these reviews had me wondering if my husband's birthday would be acknowledged, but other than a ""happy birthday"" from the clerk who checked us in it was not. And nobody introduced themselves to us, but we didn't really see anyone other than to ask for beach towels.","Seattle, Washington",126,4.0

The bath is a little small but everything else is good. We would stay there again.The hotel is located next to the Marriot and the beach is at the end of the street. This part of Waikiki beach also has a huge sea pool so you can swim without the waves if you wish.We never made breakfast but it is included. Pizza just next door at Wolfgang Express is cheap and quite good. Lulu's bar just around the corner is good too and for something more special go to Roy's for dinner (approx $100 for 2 people, 3 courses not including drinks) - very good food but remember to book a table as its busy.

It's the only hotel I know of where you get a hug from the manager if you want! The only downsides are: 1. that their lobby renovations are waaay behind schedule but this is compensated for in the price & the service. 2. personally, I found the new bedding over-heavy for the Hawaii climate (a matter of taste though).

There was no lobby, check is in a tiny little room on the second floor, and the continental breakfast is in the tiny room across the hall. The most entertaining part of this breakfast was watching the appalled look on the faces of the fellow guests. The selection of pastry was minimal and you had to wait for about 30 minutes for the ""pastry and fruit"" man to come refil. Many folks walked in, looked stunned and walked out. I have read the other reviews about flat screen TVs; ours was a tiny box. If you want wireless internet be prepared to work on it. I gave up after two trips to the office where I was told that the technical staff had already gone for the day. When I wanted to print our boarding passes I was told that I could come to the office and give them my info and they would print it off for me on the ""office"" printer. There is no computer room in the facility. I felt sorry for the poor guy I met in the hallway who had spent 4 hours that day trying to check his email via internet.

I stayed for 3 nights, and had what I consider a mostly renovated room on the 7th floor (707), facing the beach. The view from the room was great! The bed was extremely comfortable--this is the most important detail for me. The decor was tastefully modern. I loved the window screens that you can slide shut at night to keep out light and noise from another hotel pool area just in front.Upon each time entering the room, though, there was a very mild musty odor that would catch my attention--it definitely wasn't a newly renovated ""clean"" smell. It really wasn't very offensive, but still was noticeable. After a couple minutes in the room, I acclimated to the odor and it didn't bother me. This room didn't have a flat screen TV yet. Most of the light dimmers (the ones on the walls) in the room didn't work yet. The only one that did was the master dimmer on the nightstand. Bathroom lighting was limited to a light that frames the mirror--very cool, but perhaps not enough lighting for some. No iPod dock, yet, in the room either.The renovations-in-progress of the rest of the hotel also affected the overall ambiance of the stay. Check-in is in a make-shift ""lobby"" room on the second floor, and a modest continental breakfast is offered in the room across the hall. The staff overall was very pleasant, but I was never once offered any of the ""perks""--complimentary bottled water, welcome snack/fruit, etc.--that I read so much about from previous reviewers. It wasn't until my last morning that I happened to meet Lenore--I can see why so many guests are fond of her...she has a very welcoming personality and seems truly concerned about your stay. I suspect, though, that with all the renovations going on at Hotel Renew that her attentions towards guests get distracted to equally important renovation issues. Renovations of the lobby are now projected for completion in March per their posting.If you rent a car, parking arrangements have been made with a parking garage 1 block away for $8/day--a great deal. The only inconvenient aspect of this was that you had to go over to the garage and renew your parking fee every 24 hours. But for only $8/day, I feel a bit guilty for even mentioning this, as I really am not an overly fussy traveler.I can tell this is going to be a great hotel once the renovations are complete. I would definitely recommend it to others. It has the potential to become one of the top destination boutique hotels in Oahu--if I get the chance to return, I will not hesitate trying Hotel Renew again. I strongly suspect my experiences represent a rather awkward phase for management as they transition into their new digs.","E. Lansing, Michigan",1,4.0

Then we were pleasantly surprised when we found out they had upgraded us to an ocean view room and left champagne and chocolates on the desk in celebration of our anniversary.As everyone has said before, the room is beautifully designed with a dark minimalist decor. The custom dimmable lighting system was one of our favorite features, especially the bedside remote so that you didn't have to get out of bed to turn the lights(the entry, bathroom, bedside lamps, or the whole room) on or off! There is plenty of storage available, as well as an in-room safe.The location was ideal, just seconds from the beach and also the bus line. Although the lobby was under construction, we never heard a thing while we were there. The only hint of any construction were the contractors we saw occasionally in the elevator.We walked down the stairs to eat breakfast. It's a simple continental breakfast, but the staff is so eager to serve you that if you express a desire for on more croissant, they'll bring out five. Every staff member we encountered said hello, or wished us a good evening as we walked out.I was glad that I did not book a room at one of the super-huge hotels that dot Waikiki, as it wouldn't have been nearly as personal an experience as staying at Hotel Renew was.

The hotel was formally the Ocean Tower Resort. In fact, the hotel was under going renovation while we were there. The lobby was unavailable, and business was conducted in a make-shift office. Nonetheless, the hotel was very nice. Our room was decorated in an Asian-influenced minimalistic style. I understand that in the future, fresh flowers will be in each room and with fancier TVs. (Note: the TV that we had was just fine). There is advanced lighting options so that one could choose which lights were on (and to what degree) from bedside buttons. That was nice. The people were extremely friendly and helpful. They were really nice - just perfect.The beach is just around 100 yards away from the front door. Very convenient. The hotel is also very close to the zoo and the aquarium. There are also bus stops located very close to the hotel. A nice location.The only drawback was that the wi-fi access to the internet was slow. However, that should be fixed soon or you might want to ask them if you choose this hotel.","chicago, ill",14,4.0

The check in and checkout were easy and painless. The hotel offers continental breakfast and it was very nice. we had a choice of hand squeezed pineapple juice and homemade cookies. They had a variety of pastries and Illy's coffee. This was a very nice continental breakfast.

The first hotel we stayed at (five nights) could not accommodate us for our final three nights. Our first hotel was exceptional; we had direct access to the beach, ocean views and a balcony on which to enjoy those views. Accommodation was very tight over the New Year period and we came across the Hotel Renew on 'trip advisor' and booked the room according to the good reviews.We arrived feeing quite despondent about staying in a hotel with no pool, a room with no ocean view or balcony. The entrance to the hotel was uninspiring due to the renovations (which we had been advised of) and it was going to take a lot to lift our spirits.Our spirits were lifted as soon as we settled into our room. As a designer I was most impressed with what they have done with what they had to work with. The room was clean, comfortable and well appointed and the decor was most appealing. The bath towels were luxurious especially compared to the face cloth sized towels at the previous hotel. The beds had us submerged in down, which made things quite warm but very comfortable. Complimentary Internet access is a bonus and no charge for extra tea and coffee sachets was appreiated. The staff at the hotel were wonderful. Lenore could not do enough for us and breakfast (included) was a social event. The complimentary champagne and chocolates on New Years Eve was such an unexpected and special treat. The lady who attended our room did so with an enormous smile and just topped off a lovely crew of people.Renew is only one hotel back from the beach so there is no real issue with not having a pool, there are ocean view rooms available if you book early enough. I'm not sure that you can escape the noise of delivery trucks reversing all around Waikiki in the very early morning. I love fresh air and loathe air conditioning. At one stage we tried to shut the outside noise out by closing the window, but the air conditioning was noisy, seems there was no escape, fresh air and beeping trucks won.I would have no hesitation to stay at the Hotel Renew again, and am happy to give them a good wrap and thank them for complimenting our stay in Waikiki.Nadine (and Brad) Sydney",Sydney,16,4.0

My husband and I and our two children felt like valued and honored guests at all times. Leonor welcomes each guest as if she were hosting them at her home. We returned to our room several times at the end of the day to find thoughtful gifts of fruit, chocolate, and even sparking cider for a family-friendly New Year's celebration. When we asked to borrow towels for the beach (an easy block's walk), we were also handed straw mats, bottles of water, and a boogie board. Hotel Renew is probably not for those who are seeking a resort with every amenity available on the property, but it is truly a gem for those who value customer service. It is conveniently located at the edge of Waikiki's strip of shops and restaurants, and although I believe the hotel was full when we were there, it was very quiet and restful.","Charlottesville, Virginia",76,5.0

We wished we had booked our entire stay here. After the continental breakfast the next morning she invited us back for the following morning breakfast even though we were booked in at another hotel.

I must admit, I was a bit hesitant about booking a room at a hotel which was being renovated. Not to mention the reviews on Trip Advisor were so good, I wondered if they were real. I knew only, I had kicked myself in the past for going against Trip Advisor Advice. Here was the #1 rated hotel in Honolulu being offered at an excellent rate. Check my past reviews, I have several in the past couple years. All the reviews you read about this property, and its excellent personal service are indeed true! If it was possible to top what I'd read about Lenore, she managed to top it. I've stayed in hotels for 30+ years, she is possibly the best hotel employee I have encountered. But, don't worry this is not a one-woman show. There were plenty of other stars. Keenan was the desk agent who checked us in, he too was professional, friendly and very knowledgeable in the restaurants and sites on the island. The size of the hotel, being fewer than 100 rooms is a huge advantage over the mammoths nearby. By the end of our stay, I felt like all the employees knew and greeted us by name and genuinely cared about us enjoying our time in Hawaii.Our stay was at the start of November 2007. The room we had was indeed one of the newly renovated rooms by designer Jiun Ho. While the rooms are indeed modern, pictures don't do them justice. The colors while dark, are easy on the eye and with the huge windows looking toward the bright city, they seem to compliment one another. There are a couple great features, the huge flat screen tv has many high definition choices, as well as over 100 channels to choose from for free. The free wi-fi thru the room was nice. My favorite feature is the lighting throughout the room and bathroom can be dimmed to a perfect level depending on the outside light in the room. Even better, all the lights in the room can be controlled from a sleek modern control box at your bedside. While we had people staying in the rooms next to us and across the hall, we rarely if ever heard any noise - the building seems to be solid. From reading other reviews of Waikiki hotels, street noise seems to be an issue at most properties. Not here, we heard none from the city side. Now, to the renovation… There is no lobby to speak of as of November 2007. The renovation to the lobby had just begun. I believe completion is slated for January 2008. Instead, a security desk and employee direct you to the 2nd floor, where a renovated guest room doubles for a front desk/office. It's open 24 hours, and they are quick to jump to any request. Another 2nd floor guest room doubles as the breakfast room. This is where you are likely to encounter aforementioned Lenore. She will greet you by name after your first meeting. She wears many hats at the property, and does them all well. Working in the office, breakfast area, even making delivery to our room after her shift when we requested extra glasses to entertain with... I even received a Thanksgiving E-Card from her, 3 weeks after our stay, wishing us well! Location of the property is another plus. You are but a block from an excellent, safe part of Waikiki's famous White Beaches. The hotel has no full service restaurant or bar for that matter. But, you are 1-2 blocks away from the many bars & restaurants of the Marriott, Hilton Prince Kuhio and Resort Quest Hotels. While there is no hotel owned parking as of our stay, there were many lots within 2 blocks. We rented a car for one night to visit the North Shore and found free overnight street parking less than 2 blocks, near the zoo.If you want a huge resort with big pools, restaurants, bars - look elsewhere. If a lobby under renovation (Nov 07) won't dim your vision of what will be an excellent boutique hotel soon (Jan 08), I highly recommend you take advantage of the location, service, price and style you will get at Hotel Renew/Aqua Ocean Tower.","Los Angeles, California",54,5.0

Leonor Wong went out of her way to make sure we felt at home, had everything we needed and even provided a late check out for my wife and me. The late check out turned out to even more meaningful because our midnight flight was late and we didn't get to leave HNL until 0130. Having a place to relax and shower before heading to the airport was super. Location of the hotel is great if you don't want to be in the midst of lots of people; at the same time it is easy to get to most of the places of shopping interest on Waikiki Beach, and best of all, it's only a short block to the beach. Remodel is still going on and parking is a little bit of an issue, but the suggested parking place is only 2 short blocks from the hotel and cost only $8/day.When we go back to HNL we'll most certainly try hard to stay at the now named Hotel Renew.Dave & Shari, Burnsville, MN",MN,71,5.0

Also, you get free internet access, local calls and toll-free calling, which you do not find at other hotels.Amenities:This hotel doesn't have the frills of other hotels in the common areas but it more than makes up for it with the friendliness of the staff and large/modern rooms.

The hotel is currently undergoing renovations to modernize it from average hotel to ultra Maude. At the time the first 3 floors were completed with the renovations. We stayed on the 9th floor overlooking the ocean. Even though it was an older room it was extremely clean. It was also a perfect view of the ocean. The rooms are clean with all the amenities one could expect from a hotel.  The staff is friendly right from the front desk experience to the cleaning staff. They will do whatever they can to accommodate and make you feel like an actual 'guest' The hotel manager, Leonor Wong deserves a line all her own…. Even an entire page to describe how truly wonderful and caring she is as a manager. Leonor makes herself known to her guests and makes a point of knowing her guests. She is a unique manager that actually cares about her guests and their accommodations and their overall trip to Hawaii. She makes herself available and will often be found conversing with her guests at all hours, even past her regularly scheduled work hours.The hotel is located one block from the beach and positioned between two hotels – the Waikiki Marriot and Resort Quest Waikiki Beach Hotel. It really is an understatement to say one block from the beach, as it is merely just steps away from it and the Ala Moana strip.  The hotel does provide a continental breakfast in the morning, with pastries, toast, juice, coffee and tea. It does not have an onsite restaurant, but this is Waikiki with many options of food just steps away from the hotel. Situated next door is a Wolfgang puck express and of course one of many ABC stores.  The hotel provides beach towels, boogie boards and beach mats at the front dest – all you have to do is ask.  Parking is available at the hotel, but the staff is more then willing to provide you with a map to another hotel parking complex one block away for less expensive and more available parking lot with in and out privileges. The value for the rooms is a great bargain all around for couples or families looking to enjoy the beauty that Waikiki and Oahu have to offer. On our trip we stayed at the Ocean Tower twice, and will gladly return to this destination rather than some overpriced resort with low client service…. We hope you feel the same.Enjoy your stay in Hawaii and the Aqua Ocean Tower!",Ontario,10,5.0

The room itself was small and dingy and we seemed to be the only people on our floor as a number of other rooms' ""peep holes"" were missing so you could actually peer into bare rooms. There was also damp on the walls near the lift which made the whole feel of the floor really grotty.The advertised ""Ocean View"" is actually around a 50m stretch of visible ocean wedged between two tall buildings either side, as the hotel is actually not located on the ocean front but set back around 50-75m from the main ocean road. Be warned !The reception area is well overdue a renovation in its own right and the lifts were really dirty, obviously from the workmen who were going up and down them during the day.We booked this hotel on the basis of some earlier positive reviews, but were ourselves very disappointed with this hotel.

I chose it for the location and the size - I did not want a big mega-resort property with all its attendant problems and crowding. When I arrived at night and the taxi pulled up to the property, I thought to myself ""this must be a mistake."" The building looks like any other mid-sized apartment building in Honolulu. The lobby was closed off for renovation and the security agent directed me upstairs to the second floor for check-in. They are clearly in the midst of a major overhaul! Reception is currently in one hotel room while breakfast is across the hall in another. My room was one of the new ""preview"" rooms - I have to say, the design is quite lovely and they gave me an ocean view room that was both quiet and cozy. I found the smells of the paint and new carpet too much to bear - it made my eyes water and I had to open the windows to get some fresh air in. The cool Waikiki nights made that a pleasant option anyway.The staff are really very nice and helpful. I was concerned that on the two days I was there I only saw a bellman/security downstairs at the entry once - anyone could enter the hotel and go to any floor. Given all that, I might recommend waiting until the remodel is complete before giving them a second shot - all in all it's a lovely small property with a lot to offer. My gut feeling is they should have closed for the renovations - it's noisy and quite inconvenient at the moment.","Los Angeles, California",159,3.0

The Aqua Ocean Tower was an anomaly. The staff was a ten, but I'd give the facility a 4. It was under renovation at the time, so perhaps things are better, but I never did see a remodeled room so I don't know what the new ones are supposed to be like.Our first room had a very strong smell of urine coming from the bathroom, so we asked for another room. The second room smelled very badly of mold, the air conditioner was leaking and created a large pool of water by the window. Not good.After some work, they found a third room for us. This room was ok. The elevators were very small, and the rooms were small. The biggest problem we found was that the ocean view rooms have no balcony (Lanai in hawaii speak). This would be ok except that the windows are too high to see out of while you sit down. As a result, the ocean view room is pretty pointless unless you plan to stand at the window all day or night.Another problem was that there was no power anywhere in the room. Charging a cellphone, digital camera and video camera was nearly impossible in this hotel. Perhaps this will be changed in the remodel, but the power was a very real problem. We made it work, but it wasn't simple.The hotel is located about a block from the ocean, next to a resort quest facility and across the street from the Marriott. At the end of the street is a nice section of Waikiki that has a protected area for swimming. This is great if you have kids, not so great if you like to swim in the surf (as I do). There is no pool, and you should not stay at this hotel if you expect anything other than a place to sleep.The staff was the saving grace of this hotel. Terry and Leonore were simply outstanding at making us feel welcome, at home, and comfortable. I really can't emphasize enough how much of a difference they made. I would give the Ocean Tower another chance, knowing that they were renovating the rooms. I wouldn't pay for an ocean view though.Overall this is a difficult rating to make. The facility wasn't great, but the staff was. This was ultimately a bargain hotel for us, and that was good. We were able to enjoy Waikiki for about a third of what we paid to stay at the Moana Surfrider the last time we were in Hawaii.

Consequently our room looked out onto two parkades...not exactly romantic considering this was an anniversary trip. The hotel has a great location near the park and Diamond Head and the room itself was great...very high tech but also very comfortable. But we still might have moved elsewhere if not for the genuine warmth and graciousness of the staff...all of the staff. Lenore Wong of course was an extra bright spot and the one that took great pains to look after us...wine, chocolates, and then a move midweek to a 5th floor renovated room with an ocean view...just finished...I believe we were the first occupants. We were more than satisfied and I highly recommend their higher level rooms if you like a bit of view. Other hotels also have views and comfort.

The Aqua Ocean is an older hotel located behind the ResortQuest hotel right across the street from the beach. I arrived on Thursday evening to find (surprise!) that major renovation work was being done on the lobby and many of the guest suites. We had not been contacted ahead of time by the resort regarding the renovation project and this wasn't a big deal for me but I do know some travelers who would have been put off by this. We headed up to the temporary front desk quarters located on the 2nd floor and were warmly greeted by Lenore Wong and her staff. We were really treated like family by the staff who were very accommodating and really wanted us to feel at home. About the hotel. The Aqua is an older 9 story hotel located in a great downtown Waikiki area, just a few steps to the beach and surrounded by great shopping, dining and convenience stores. The Aqua does not have a pool or restaurant but close proximity to the beach and a great restaurant next door is satisfactory for most guests. Our room was one of the older rooms which are slated to be refurbished. It had twin beds, a noisy AC unit which kept us from achieving REM sleep, a mini-frig and a good sized bathroom with a tub and shower. Ocean views and a TV with cable. Continental breakfast with great pastries, fresh fruit, and coffee, tea, juice. The best part about the room was the price, 99.00/night with a free night stay if you book for 5 nights.  The newly refurbished rooms are very nice with a big LCD tv and pc with internet access, nice king bed and nice furniture. I don't' know what the price on the newly refurbished rooms will be but they may be around 150.00 or so a night; this may be ok but not a smokin' deal due to the lack of onsight amenities. But then you wouldn't be getting the superior service from Lenore and her staff so that is something to factor in also.Would we stay there again? Surely, especially if they manage to keep the rooms at the great prices we were attracted to in the first place and if they continue to offer internet specials. The Bad...The renovation project is ongoing and while the place was in desperate need of a facelift, it is an inconvenience for travelers to have to share the place with contractors/workers who are trying to get the job done. We came back to our room one morning and the door was cracked open and the housestaff was vacuuming the hallway with an extension cord plugged into our bathroom. Not a great thought when we had our pcs and digital SLRs lying about the place (our fault but we were on vacation).The Good...Staff, Location and Lenore. What else can we say!

We got so much value and more for our money - it deserves all the praise and recognition for its amazing hospitality.We reserved 2 moderate rooms ($99/each) for 3 nights before heading off for our 7 day Pride of Hawaii cruise. We automatically got upgraded to the brand new rooms on the 5th floor. The decor was modern, beautiful, and the beds very comfortable. The hotel is conveniently located across waikiki beach, honolulu zoo, shopping (including the International Marketplace), restaurants, trolley and tour bus pick-ups, internet cafe and ABC stores. We (my husband and I, our 19 month old daughter and my in-laws) saw Leonor every day and she did not hesitate to offer us drinks, snacks, beach toys and towels etc. to make our days more enjoyable. She gave our daughter a fun orange/black lei for halloween and offered us a hospitality room to store our luggage after our cruise (which docked at 7am) since we had the whole day free before our flight home, which was at 10pm. We took her up on that offer and was given an oceanview room on the 9th floor to use for our last day in Hawaii.

The staff and service were incredible, better than I have ever experienced at a hotel. I made several requests (late check-out, early check-in, re-modeled room, etc.). They made every effort to oblige and were incredibly gracious and friendly while doing it. It is the little things that make the difference to me like leaving little packages of M&M's on our pillows or adjusting packages of plants left on the widow sill to sun so that they wouldn't fall, that make all the difference to me and the staff at the Aqua excels in this area. The service is five star quality but without the five star price. My husband was in Hawaii working; I flew in at the end of his trip to celebrate a belated honey moon/anniversary and like others, there was a bottle of champagne waiting in our room when we got there. I also was one of the lucky few who got to meet the ""infamous"" Lenore Wong. She was as amazing as everyone else has mentioned. I met her the morning that my husband and I went for a hike...we were lucky enough to walk out that morning with a loaf of her excellent mango bread and two bottles of water. She really is as devoted to both the hotel and guests as others have mentioned. The Aqua is lucky to have her.The hotel room was beautiful and elegant. The decor provides a sense of peace that I have not experienced at other hotels, which are decorated in traditional, dry, boring hotel style. The location is excellent, less than a half a block away from the beach and half a block away from CHEAP ($8.00 daily) parking (hard to find in Waikiki).

Needless to say, I stay in several different hotels around the country a month. I booked this hotel for my vacation based soley on the reviews here at TripAdvisor, and I was not disappointed AT ALL.1) I did stay in an older room because it was cheaper and frankly, we were on a budget. Yes, the stuff in the room is old. I don't know if I would call it shabby-just older. And spotless. Last night, I stayed in a Doubletree in San Francisco and it had tears in the carpet and cracks in the bathroom too-almost every hotel I stay in does. If you go expecting a perfect room for $90 a night on Waikiki beach, you're kidding yourself. In any case, the new rooms are beautiful and will be luxurious to stay in the next time I go back. Besides, a room in Waikiki is really just a place to crash, isn't it?2) The location was VERY acceptable-again, especially for the price I paid. It's about a block from the beach-and it's at the end of Waikiki beach rather than smack in the middle of it, which I preferred because it was much less crowded. I counted 3 ABC stores within a block of the hotel. There was also a Starbucks, a Subway, a Cold Stone, a Wolfgang Puck express, and a bar and grill type place all on the same block-not to mention all the stuff in the block next to us. Everything was in walking distance, and the bus stop was also about a block away-this bus stop has bus runs that take you to most of the major attractions-we used it to go to Hanauma Bay and Pearl Harbor pretty easily.3) The service was outstanding. Not only do I work in the travel industry, I work in the development of leadership for our customer service team-so I basically train people all day long on how to give excellent customer service. This team seems to have this down pat. Lenore is like the rock star of the group-everyone knows her and she makes it a point to know everyone else. One day, we came back and found chocolates in our room. On the day we were checking out, Lenore came to find us after we had checked out and put our stuff in one of the remodeled rooms that wasn't being used. We were able to relax and clean up before our red-eye flight home-and she insisted we stay in there as long as we needed to. Lenore had also made a special lei for my daughter for her birthday, and also gave her a plumeria necklace as a birthday gift. Terry, the hotel manager, made it a a point to come out and say goodbye as we were leaving. Everyone else was extremely helpful and polite. The continental breakfast was simple-coffee, pineapple juice, pastries, toast, and fruit-but neither of us is big morning eaters, so it was perfect. Besides, that's all a continental breakfast is supposed to be-bread, fruit, juice, and coffee.It's true that they ask guests to leave their reviews on TripAdvisor-which in my opinion, is just smart business.

There are also stores very close by and the tiki bar and grill at the next door Resortquest hotel which we visited for cocktails, food and live music some nights. There is also a Wolfgang Puck express we used for lunch some days at the same resort next door. Across the road is a Marriott where we hired a Hertz rental car to tour the island - so everything we needed for activities and entertainment was right thereWe stayed initially on the top floor with an amazing view of the beach. This is one of the rooms yet to be refurbished but was fine for us - it was immaculately clean and had great a/c, comfortable bed, good size room and unlike the Hilton, had breakfast, wireless internet and in-room safe included in the cost. Excellent value! Linda and I met Leonor on our first morning and she was everything we had read about in the other reviews - very warm and full of good advice and help. (Actually we found all staff , from manager, to the front desk ,to the cleaning staff ,to be friendly and helpful - with maps, beach towels and general tourist advice)The list of special treats/upgrade items we received during our stay was amazing - we had champagne with chocolates one night - complimentary. We were also shown the new rooms - what an amazing transformation - the old ones were absolutely fine, but the new ""Hotel Renew"" version were luxurious - we gave up our deluxe ocean front view on the top floor and happily moved into the new room on the 4th floor. It was great with new amazing technology (plazma tv's with pc's connected to them with full internet access and more with wireless keyboards and mice - they have the most advanced tech I've seem in a hotel room) and the most calm decor and luxurious fittings throughout from the lighting to the beds to the new bathrooms all very comfortable and luxurious. This upgrade was also complimentary - we were also given full access to a room for our later check out at 5.45pm - once again complimentary - unprecedented service by a distance for our experience!!!Note:- there is construction on-going but it is internal refitting of rooms etc and not early or late - we barely noticed more that a dull drone noise when briefly visiting the room during the day to change or pick-up books etc. But when out for the day we wouldn't have known it was on-goingThe value and service of this hotel is legendary, we had an amazingly positive experience, and for the first time, had to just complete a review - these guys are as good as the reviews say. We found this hotel from it's top rating on this site and couldn't believe the value, but it's true. We would always visit this hotel if returning to Waikiki.

I'm constantly on tripadvisor before any vacation to see if there are any new posts or rankings. It wasn't until I received the amazing service from Leonor Wong and staff at the aqua ocean tower hotel that I have broken my tripadvisor silence.My wife and I were in hawaii for her sister's wedding which also coincided with our 1 year anniversary. Over 75% of the guests of the wedding booked with the Hawaii Prince, but I chose this hotel because of the Tripadvisor ratings. I don't regret my decision at all.My first night here, i was placed on the ninth floor in a relatively dated but clean room with a view. The room had a really nice balcony and it definitely suited our needs. Tina did an excellent job in keeping our room neat and clean, also leaving us little treats every day. On our second day we met Leonor Wong, and we finally understood why everyone rated this hotel number 1. She caught wind that it was our 1 year anniversary and left us champagne and chocolates in our room. She also hand delivered coffee to our room one morning (my wife loves her coffee) and her famous mango bread. On another day it was fruit, because she saw us eating bananas from chinatown. Everyday she found some way to make our stay here more enjoyable. The staff were always friendly and courteous - providing us with beach chairs, towels, and beach mats - directions to various places and tips for our stay here. We also got a chance to stay in a newly remodeled rooms - and they are gorgeous. The designs are simple, sleek and modern. The room had a LCD TV, one that I wanted to take home for myself. Our stay here was amazing! I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend and am looking forward to going back.

I booked based on Trip Advisor reviews and found most of the good reviews to be spot on but did have a few glitches. We stayed in one of the newly remodeled rooms on the second floor, Rm 205 I believe. Our room had a ""city"" view ( the side street facing a hostel). Not a concern at all as our time in the room was very limited. A couple items in our room didn't quite fit or match the other rooms described. For one the TV was a standard set which was bulky and stuck out into the walkway between the bed and desk. Not the LCD as I did see in another room as I walked by. It was obviously out of place. Again not a big deal just odd. Another more bothersome item was in the very nicely remodeled bathroom there was no fan, just the old screw type glass panel window that didn't close all the way. What made it bad was that because the window didn't close tight, you couldn't leave the bathroom door open to the room because the AC couldn't keep up. So we ended up with our own unwanted sauna adjacent to our room as you can imagine not very comfortable after showering or any other times. As others have pointed out the ice in the basement is a bit strange but not being in the room much... if you remember I suppose you could grab it as you arrive at the hotel before you go up to the room. The last item really exposed the great service that has been written about so many times here on TA. The ""new"" bed frames basically are flat wood with square corners that protrude a few inches past the corner of the mattress. You can only imagine the shin busting that happened...more than once. On our second morning we displayed our bruises and gouges to the front desk staff as we left for the day not knowing what if anything they could do about it. Upon our return later that evening we were shocked to find that the bed frame corners had been cut off and refinished eliminating the problem. We truly were wowed. Terry Dowsett, GM, really did a great job. Anytime we had contact with the staff they were always friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome. The treats and beverages almost each day were really a nice touch. Although I never had the pleasure of meeting Leonor Wong we certainly congratulate her and her staff for a job well done. We would stay again and not hesitate to recommend. The location is great with the beach 1/2 block away and cheap parking a 1/2 block the other way ($50 week).","Jerusalem, Israel",43,4.0

I normally stay at budget hotels in Waikiki, but have stayed at many hotels on the mainland, usually in 3 star, sometimes in 4 star and a 5 star on one special occasion.The service I experienced by all of the staff, from the front desk to housekeeping, was phenomenal. In my opinion, this isn't a case of service that is above expectation based on the price of the room, but a case of a group of people with genuine care for you as a guest. I would say they value your patronage. This is something that many service industry workers have forgotten, especially workers that know they will only be seeing you for that 1 week in their lifetime.I stayed in an older room with a view. I was offered a remodeled room without a view, but chose the older room due to all the 'new' smells. I didn't think my sinuses would handle it. Yes, the furnishings were a bit dated, but it was always exceptionally clean, thanks to Tina. Will I stay here again? Most likely. I say this because by the time I make my next trip to Oahu, the hotel will be done with it's remodel, and I'm sure the prices will be a bit higher.

The hotel is simply a smart choice.My husband and I stayed there from Aug 24 to 28. We paid $99/night on Expedia. The room where we stayed had a king bed, a T.V., drawer/chest, closet, safe, vanity, decent bathroom and lanai.The location is great. Half a block from the beach. Within walking distance to International Market Place; Honolulu Zoo; Duke's Statue (where you can make your friends jealous by standing in front of the webcam); many bars and restaurants, cheap parking and a bus stop around the corner.Located next to two not so budget-conscious hotels (ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Hotel and I believe the Marriot is across the street), you feel smarter than the people you see hanging out on their lanais, having the same views as you do, but paying much more for it.The views from our room were good, not excellent. I posted some pictures and you can decide. I honestly prefer to take a couple of steps to the beach and have more to see.The rooms are very clean. The furniture is dated. But if you're one of those people who actually go to a place to learn about the culture, see new places, try new food and spend as little time in a hotel just coming back to sleep, not caring what the duvet color is, this hotel is for you. Take a look at the pictures I posted, I think that will help you to decide. The curtains keep the light out effectively for those who may suffer from jetlag. :)The breakfast consists of muffins, bread, danish, donuts, coffee, pineapple juice and tea. The service was amazing. Being a relatively small hotel, The Ocean Tower can offer exceptional PERSONALIZED service. Everybody is friendly and the front desk staff is very helpful. Here's an example: We were heading to the beach and we knew that the hotel had beach chairs for the guests (thanks to TripAdvisor reviews), so we asked for a chair and a beach mat. Grace (front desk) came back with a beach chair, a beach mat and 2 bottles of water! Try doing that at the Marriott! ""Oh, water? There's the vending machine!"" Leonor (Executive Housekeeper) always goes beyond your expectations. One day I went next door to buy some bananas and when I came back, Leonor said: ""Oh, you like bananas in the morning? I have bananas here."" Next day she shows up with not one, not two, but a BAG of bananas! On the day after: apples. Tell me which other hotel has someone paying attention to such detail and actually caring about it.OK, now... the renovation. The hotel is going under renovation and is becoming a totally different place (see pictures). It will be called ""Hotel Renew"". The only downside is that I guess it won't be a bargain anymore, BUT if the service remains the same, it will certainly be worth it.Yes, we were upgraded to one of the new rooms on our last night. And Leonor, again, was the one who arranged the move. (Oh, did I mentioned she gave us a bottle of champagne and chocolates?)

It was done in muted blacks and grays and whites, with indirect lighting, asian styling, modern electonics, flat-screen TV, and tropical flower bouquet. It was lovely.

I can say for the price, service and location, this hotel can’t be beat.We arrived very late one evening after a dreadfully long flight to Honolulu. We took the shuttle bus to the hotel. The front desk lady mentioned us BY NAME when we approached the front desk and made us feel very welcome. Check in took just minutes. I mentioned that we had an early morning flight to Maui and she offered to schedule a cab for us (since the shuttle would run too late), and would give us a wake up call in time. The elevators require a room key to access which made us feel good about safety. Our room was in good repair and very clean. It’s not the Ritz, but you don’t get the Ritz for about $100 per night either. We promptly got our wake up call but being very tired we dozed back off to sleep. 15 minutes later we got a second automated wake up call. We arose and began to prepare to leave. About 5 minutes before leaving the room, we got yet another call. This time it was the front desk – same lady who checked us in the night before. She said she just wanted to make sure we had made it up so we wouldn’t miss our flight. When we let her know we would be down in 5 minutes, we said she would call a cab. 5 minutes later we checked out and she had the cab waiting for us. What great service!If you’re looking for a place near Waikiki beach and don’t want to break the bank and get personalized service all at the same time, I would highly recommend the Aqua Ocean Tower. I cannot imagine a scenario where they could have done better for us.","Milwaukee, WI",42,5.0

The location is perfect: right near the beach and convenient to a plethora of shops and food options.Though our room was newly refurbished in a nice modern Pacific style, I realize that there is much work going on right now to upgrade the rooms, so make sure you request a refurbished room. I noticed someone complain in a previous review about the continental breakfast being meager. This is true, but I rarely encounter a continental breakfast that is much to brag about, so I don't dock any points for that. (By the way, as my wife and I were hurrying to meet our cab at 7:30am, Leanor ran into the supply room to find us some extra muffins to shove in our bag. Oh yeah, and we were also given a complimentary apple pie and cold drinks when we arrived because the staff could tell we were famished. Now that's some service!)My mother chose this hotel based on the positive reviews she'd seen online, and we were not disappointed.

Our choice was based almost entirely on the reviews we read here on Trip Advisor. The rave reviews we read here seemed almost too good to be true and you know what they say about something that sounds too good to be true. This hotel most certainly did NOT deserve all the 5.0 ratings it got here. Yes, the location is excellent, just a half block from the beach and shopping area and right next door to an ABC store. If I were rating this hotel based solely on location I would give it a 5. However, there is more to a hotel than location. The rooms were old and badly in need of refurbishment. For example, the wallpaper in our bathroom was peeling from the walls. Our ocean view room was small and dated, but the view was fantastic. Don't even factor the so-called continental breakfast into your decision on whether to stay here or not because you will almost certainly end up at the Starbucks about a block away. The ""breakfast"" consisted of coffee (no decaf), hot tea, juice, mass produced danishes and toast. I did not experience any of the legendary outstanding service spoken about so often in the Trip Advisor reviews. Yes, the staff was nice, but nothing outstanding.

It's a small, 9-story unassuming building 1/2 block from Waikiki beach. When I first arrived, I wasn't overly thrilled with the rooms as they were basic and in need of an update. However, they were very clean and kept in great condition by the friendly housekeeping staff (Tina is the best!). I figured it didn't really matter because nobody goes to Hawaii to sit in a hotel room all day. Plus the location was fantastic for how much we paid ($108/night). Surprisingly, what turned out to be an OK first impression ended up becoming a pretty great experience at the hotel. First, the staff makes up for any bells and whistles the rooms may be lacking. When you stay here you feel like you're staying with family (without all the smothering and nagging). Leonor Wong is especially helpful in making sure you have everything you need. When we told her it was our anniversary she left us a bottle of champagne in our room. The small staff at this hotel works hard to make sure you have anything you need for going to the beach (towels, boogie boards, rafts) to giving you advice on tourist sites (and how to get there). Second, the location is brilliant. 1/2 block away from waikiki beach and all the stores along the boardwalk. You wake up, have a lite bite to eat at the free continental breakfast then head to the beach. Also, the free shuttles that take tourists to the huge malls stop right next door to the hotel.One thing to note is that the hotel is undergoing a huge renovation. I saw some of the new rooms and they're GORGEOUS. They feel very W Hotel in design. Right now the construction is confined to the 3rd and 4th floors but check to make sure you can get a room a few floors up and the noise shouldn't be a problem. It was actually surprisingly quiet for how much work they were doing. Some of the re-designed rooms are available on the 2nd floor but you will have to tolerate some construction noise.

The rooms were very spacious and well maintained.. the views were breathtaking each and every day.. the authentic Hawaiian Live music from the nearby Tiki Grill and Bar gently serenaded us awake every morning and (secret advice here) if you open the balcony door & the beach facing window at the same time (we were on the 8th floor, room 806), lay on the bed and you will get a pure, soothing and stimulating breeze that you will not soon forget.On top of that, they are renovating this already perfect hotel experience..and the rooms will provide the ultimate in luxury and technical excellence.

The hallways and its paint also give off an impression that the hotel has not really been cared for. The lack of preparation in the painting can only make one wonder what else the owners took shortcuts on.Although there are a few comforts that I had to do without, the many services that the hotel offers make up for its lackings tremendously.

Another great thing about the hotel is the free local calls and the cable television. My room's view was not really what I had imagined it to be but the large windows made the days wonderful by the way that it allowed light to shine inside on those nice Hawaiian mornings. The free newspapers and the conspicuousness of the hotel also make it a great place to spend a week in June. There are no restaurants inside the hotel but there is a little ABC store right downstairs and many restaurants and shops are scattered all around. Lastly, I had to mention that the hotel is only a block away from Waikiki beach and another two blocks away from the bus stop. I have been all over the world and have stayed in hotels ranging from five stars to cheap little hostels with twelve person rooms. I can honestly tell you that this hotel is by far not the best hotel on the waterfront. If you want a hotel that offers a pool, nice bars, restaurants, and door opening service, this hotel is not for you. But if you are looking for a place to stay that also offers some tranquility, comparable service, and a great location, I recommend this hotel. This hotel is great for people who understand the value of money. This is all that I have to say. Oh, and use the coupons in the book. They are definitely worth it.","San Francisco, California",35,4.0

You always are a little skeptic when booking a hotel but with all the great reviews we decided Ocean Tower was the one. After staying a week at the Ocean Tower Hotel, I now know why this hotel receives excellent reviews. The staff is absolutely wonderful, always polite and helpful! Leonor we called her our ""Hawaiian Mom."" Whatever we needed she was there in a minute. My husband and I checked in and with in minutes Leonor was at our room bringing us bottles of water, much needed after a long plane ride. The next morning in the lobby I was greeted by Leonor with a smile and big hug! Everyday Leonor would give us little surprises in our room, candy, fruit, yogurt, juice, etc. It makes you feel exteremly special as if you are part of the family The day we were leaving we had a late flight out, the staff allowed us to stay in our room to clean up and relax. As we were leaving for the airport, Leonor sent us off with a big hug and a blowing kiss. The hotel has everything you need for the beach, beach mats, towels, boogie boards, blow up rafts, beach chairs, etc. The hotel is under renovation, the new rooms on the 2nd floor were open on Friday. The rooms look incredible! (see pictures)The hotel is extermely quiet. I never heard any traffic or music from outside, no kids running through the halls, close to the ocean and dining. There are lots of greats places to eat. I recommend LuLu's , reasonable and great food. Another little diner is Rock Island Cafe on the corner of Ka'iulani & Koa. If you are looking to book some sightseeing adventures/local activities go to Expedia!fun on the 2nd floor at the hotel next door and they are a huge help. You really don't need a vehicle, except for one day. I reccommend taking a ride to the north shore and stopping along the way. It's a beautiful ride. This hotel is definitely number 1!

Yes, the hotel is 1/2 block away from the beach, but the best part of the beach is a crowded, 5 block walk. I would have much preferred a location closer to the outdoor international shopping mall because that is where the bulk of the bars, the restaurants, and the best part of the beach is. 2. The furnishing, carpeting, bedding, EVERYTHING is extremely well worn. This hotel is badly in need of refurbishing. However, for $120 a night....what do you expect? 3. The hotel restaurant is horrible. Awful. Fortunately, there are lots of eating options on the main drag 1/2 block away. If I was on a tight budget, the Ocean Towers is a great, great option.

Location is great, less than a block to the beach and right in the heart of Waikiki a good enough distance away from all the hustle/bustle of the stores and nightly street performers.None of this you will ever really remember, however....this is a story of good old hospitality...The service was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!Our first day we met and spoke with Pearl and Grace, they took exceptional care of us upon arrival and made sure that we had no concerns. Check in was speedy and our bags were taken to our room before we even realized they were gone! Pearl even went out of her way to help me secure a car rental, reserve shuttle service later in the week and even change my seats for my return flight home!The 2nd day we met Leonor and after her initial warm and friendly greeting, we looked forward to seeing her every single morning (and every other chance we had). She made us feel like she was at the hotel to only take care of us and only us...but not being the case since she does this for everyone actually. She is extremely blessed and talented at what she does. She would do anything for us, even though we never really asked... she went out of her way to make sure every morning we had our own little breakfast pastries, she gave us champagne (twice), chocolate covered macadamia nuts, lei's (sp) and really made my days fun with a pair of borrowed body boards for my wife and I to use on the ocean!!...she even made us a special pair of 4th of July lei's.... she was truly remarkable, always with a warm and genuine smile on her face. Tina did a great job of making sure our room was clean.Terry, her boss was very friendly and kind. We did not have a whole lot of interaction with him, but it was not necessary since his staff was amazing at what they did. That is a true sign of a great manager....letting those he leads, succeed.I truly hope that Terry can keep everyone on this staff together because they are a special group... My wife and I also felt extremely special the very last moments as Leonor was there to greet us and bid farewell. She gave us a special fresh flowered lei and sent us off with a hug/kiss....and waves and blown kisses as we boarded our Roberts Hawaii bus... I can tell you as I watched all of the others load the bus at other hotels that no one else received this kind of treatment...only a cold, personless send off and no one else came on the bus with a huge smile like we did!Thanks to everyone at the Aqua Ocean Hotel!!

I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the ""strip"", it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu.","Fairfax, Virginia",12,5.0

It’s a cheap way to enjoy Waikiki, especially if you plan to spend your days adventuring or relaxing—not in your room! We “splurged” and got a room on the top (ninth) floor, I think they call it deluxe ocean view. It has great views of the ocean and beach from the windows and views of Diamond Head from the balcony and bathroom window. The breakfast can’t really be considered a full breakfast, but it’s fine to pick up some toast and pineapple juice. We purchased fruit and yogurt for the week from the ABC Store next door. Most mornings we would take the hotel’s toast/muffins/donuts and our fruit/yogurt to the Starbucks on the corner. Good cheap breakfast. The desk people were really nice and eager to serve. They always offered fresh towels, beach mats and boogie boards, and didn’t bother to make you “sign” them out. We would definitely stay here again.Restaurants we went to:Genki Sushi - Cheap, tasty go-round sushi.Sansei Restaurant and Sushi Bar – More expensive (but not outrageous) sushi bar, right across the street from the Ocean Tower. They have half-price sushi after 10 p.m. several days a week--definitely worth it!Leonards Donuts – Everyone raves about the malasadas. They were good but not life changing.Kona Brewing Company – Great food and location, live music.Cha Cha Cha Salsaria – Delicious tacos and burritos with several vegetarian/vegan options. In the Koko Marine Center area. Eat outside, there’s a nice patio overlooking the bay/marina.Maui Tacos in Kailua – Good burritos.Killer Tacos on the North Shore – So-So burritos.Sharks Cove Grill – Great burgers (and vegan burgers) and peanut butter milkshakes. Granted, the snorkeling makes it better.","Honolulu, Hawaii",13,4.0

I found everyone I had contact with helpful and very friendly. The front desk staff was great about recommendations of activities and resturants. This hotel is an older structure and currently in need of a facelift. This is just about to begin. The head of house keeping showed me a brochure of the changes that are about to take place.

When they realized we were there to celebrate an anniversary, a pleasant surprise showed up in our room. Less than a block from Waikiki beach, great location. If you need to limit sugar in your diet, forget their continental breakfast.During renovation, no parking was available for us on site, so they directed us to a lot about a block and a half away that charged about half as much per day.Only problem was with Travelocity - when booking the hotel we requested an upgrade to a partial ocean view, and when we arrived the hotel clearly did not have any such rooms. Travelocity did NOTHING to remedy the situation.If looking for a comfortable and economical place to sleep and shower, this is a great value. Little things like the faucet handles on the sink being marked backwards, one shower faucet handle being loose and looking a bit discolored, and some peeling wall paper could use a bit more attention. The mini-fridge was a bit tacky looking and could be used to freeze things or not - no middle ground of making ice and keeping things cold.

We were VERY satisfied with our experience there and would highly recommend the place.First, let me describe the rooms. The rooms are clean, spacious, and have great amenities like cable TV and free wireless internet (which would cost you $15-20 per day in most hotels). It is true that the decor in the rooms is somewhat dated, and the hallways on the guest room floors could be spruced up. However, the rooms are perfectly clean and comfortable. And in my opinion, you're not in Hawaii to lounge around your room, but to enjoy the islands! Unless you are very fussy and want everything in the hotel room to be brand spankin' new, you will be satisfied here. Again, the rooms are large and clean and comfortable.The location is also great. It's literally a 2 minute walk to the beach, in an active part of Waikiki. There is tons of shopping, dining, etc. in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. We felt totally safe and there were tourists and/or locals on the streets all of the time. We also rented a car, and were able to park in an affordable lot a half-block from the hotel. (The Ocean Tower Hotel's was full when we arrived.)Finally, the service. For whatever the Ocean Tower may lack in updated furnishings, it MORE than compensates with exceptional customer service. The staff, and Leonor Wong in particular, are extremely friendly, and helpful. For example, as we were leaving one morning, Leonor asked us what we were doing for the day. We mentioned we were going snorkeling, and the staff immediately printed out directions to our destination and lent us snorkeling equipment! Similarly, the hotel lent us beach towels on several days and gave us lots of good advice on what to do and where to go. The free breakfast was another benefit. Leonor was also very gracious in accommodating us during a short return visit to Honolulu on our way back home to the mainland. Given the location, service, and price, the Ocean Tower is an exceptional value.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",87,5.0

Nice beach area with a break wall in one area. Ocean view was beautiful from the room.No dining facilities (plenty all around you), no pools (beach area was so nice we never missed it), very limited parking ( they suggest you park around the corner at the Banyan and it was $8 a day instead of the $15 a day at the hotel.), no gift shop (ABC store across the street same side as the hotel entrance).Great customer service at the Ocean Tower.

Our room which had an ocean view and also a view of Diamond Head was large and very comfortable. We loved the hotel and very really pleased with the location and great value for money given that we were almost on Waikiki beach. Although the hotel is small and doesn’t have a restaurant or bar this wasn’t a problem at all with so many others nearby. The manager of the hotel made us feel very welcome and spoiled us with some special Malasadas (a cinnamon doughnut) at breakfast and bottle of champagne as we were on honeymoon, which was wonderful and unexpected. We were also given a sneak preview of some of the rooms which have been updated to a very modern / upmarket feel and will be available soon, if you book it might be worth asking about these although the ones we saw were on a lower floor so didn't have the great views that our room did.

What a wonderful place to spend some time while in Honolulu.We never travel without first checking with Trip Advisor about a hotel and/or resort we may be interested in. We travel frequently and have not been disappointed yet and have found some wonderful tips on trip advisor.The Aqua Ocean Tower is truely a wonderful find. Yes, the rooms and halls are dated, however, that is all being changed as of this writing. They have started remodeling the rooms. We saw one of the newly remodeled rooms and it was absolutely awesome. The location of this hotel is excellent. You are within a short walk to so many restaurants. The Tiki Restaurant next door is nice to go to in the evening, where you can sit outside overlooking Waikiki Beach, sipping your favorite drink and listen to live music of both Hawaiian flare and other popular favorites. There is a sushi restaurant around the corner below the Marriott Hotel that is very good and reasonable too. There are ABC stores on every corner, with one right next door to the Ocean Tower Hotel. It's a large convenience store that has everything from Wine to goodies to bring home to your friends and family. I would highly recommend the Ocean Tower. You can beat the price or the location. We booked an deluxe ocean view room several months before arrival and were fortunate to have a room with such a beautiful view of Waikiki Beach. We can't thank Leonor enough for all of the special little things she did to make us feel so welcome. It was like being a guest in Leonor's home, she couldn't do enough to make sure you were well taken care of, and always with a beautiful smile on her face. When we arrived, the first person we saw was Grace. She too always had a wonderful smile on her face and was so gracious, accomodating and helpful.You can't go wrong staying at the Ocean Tower. However, if you are looking for a hotel like the Ritz Carlton with rates four to five times what you would pay at the Ocean Tower, then this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a clean, friendly, centrally located hotel with great rates and a beautiful view of Waikiki Beach for the deluxe ocean view rooms, you can't go wrong with the Ocean Tower. By the way, we were impressed that once you entered the elevator, you had to use your room card (key) to access the elevator.

I even thought that the bedspreads were pretty! (see pic) Breakfast is very basic -pineapple juice, coffee, toast and donuts – but some mornings there were malasadas! Yippee! We received a lovely basket of goodies and some flowers in honor of my kids’ graduations from college & high school (see pic), and every time we came into the lobby were greeted warmly, hugged often and always offered bottled water, juice and beach toys. The only glitch in our stay was the drunk frat boys nextdoor who were apparently having a wrestling match while jumping between beds and shouting obscenities at top volume. At 3:30 am I called the front desk and within five minutes the room next door was totally silent and remained that way all night. I had a similar event at a very expensive and swanky hotel recently but couldn’t get the staff to do anything about it. The OT staff took care of it immediately.We saw the new rooms, and yes they are beautiful and swanky. Frankly though, I like the Ocean Tower just as it is.

I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending $200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often $300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend $400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra $15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled.

There’s a complementary internet access and a continental breakfast in the morning between 7:30 and 9:30. All rooms have a small refrigerator and a microwave. Ocean Tower is an older hotel but the room is very spacious and we were in a room with an ocean view which is pretty nice. The hotel was acquired by Aqua Resorts several years ago. It is currently under renovation that all rooms will be remodeled. The hotel manager showed us the model room which is really really nice, with a very modern feel, a flat-screen TV, trendy décor, and they are keeping the same size of all rooms which is very spacious. There will be 2 big suites after the remodeling is done at the end of 2007. I would surely love to re-visit and stay there after the renovation. Since Ocean Tower is centrally-located at a very convenient location, you probably won’t need a rental car unless you want to see other parts of Oahu. There’re local buses called “The Bus” and also trolleys at the popular Waikiki area ($2/person). The buses even go to other parts of the island such as Hanauma Bay (beautiful bay and perfect for swimming and snorkeling, a must go in Oahu), Pearl Harbor, etc.. We rented a car anyway for time flexibility. Ocean Tower parking is $15 for 24 hours with in-and-out privilege. There’re metered parking on the streets just outside of the hotel and it’s free between 6p-7a, also all day Sundays and Holidays. My husband also found some street parking nearby the zoo area (3 minute walk from the hotel) and some are free for the entire day, some are only a quarter for an hour! If you rent a car for several days or a week, it will definitely save you some bucks by parking on the streets.

We booked two Deluxe Ocean view rooms on the 9th floor as we were travelling with our three teenage sons. Our room had very dirty patches on the carpet and tilesbroken at floor level in the bathroom and even though I new the hotelwas undergoing renovations it was less than I had expected.The next morning my husband went down to see what could be done. ....................WELL!! What happened was Leonore Wong!  Leonore made sure we had everything we needed and with a big hug told me that 'we were there to be spoiled and that we would have a wonderful time and to go out and have fun and not to worry about the carpet'. When we returned at midday the carpet had been shampooed and smelled fresh and lovely. By the second day we were not even noticing the tiles because everything else was so superb. The rooms had glorious views of the beach and the rockpool. Each night we could open our huge windows and listen to the Hawaiian music from the motel next door or just hang out the window and watch the amazing array of ships passing by.The trolley stops are right outside the door, including the free trolleys and it is a main pick up point for all the tours. There is an ABC shop right next door as well as on every corner with quite reasonable prices on everything from food to souveniers.The hotel is a very short walk (100 metres maybe) from the beach and there are quite a few well priced family restuarants such as Wolfgang Pucks right next door. You can go to the beach for a quick swim or spend all day but you are so close to the hotel that you can run back for any bits, or even the luxury of your own bathroom.Snorkels, beach mats and an endless supply of clean beach towels are available from the front desk.The houskeepers do a wonderful job and our rooms were spotless every day.Leonore spoiled us so much that just saying 'thank you' became almost embarassingly insufficient.The basket of treats was a surprise, the fresh flowers every girls delight but the personally delivered breakfast when we were noticed missing one morning was beyond what any should expect.As any Mum knows, holiday or not, we do not really get time off.

Some of the mundane 'Mum' jobs were done for me without my even considering requesting such a thing and some of the little treats were the sort of thing my sisters would do for me. We never returned without a friendly greeting from the wonderful staff who did everything to make our stay wonderful.Leonore proudly gave us a look at the new rooms and they are indeed lovely and will make the hotel a very pleasant place to stay but without Leonore, Terry and the fabulous staff it would still be just another hotel.If you are looking for an excellent location, excellent swimming and surfing and outstanding attention to every detail of your holiday this is the place to stay.Thank you Leonore, Terry and all the wonderful staff................the memories you helped create will stay with us always.",Aussiecoast,54,5.0

These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet; the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles? This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)",Sydney,31,4.0

I have no idea how this hotel came to be rated as highly as it appears on this site. I travel extensively and have visited all of the major Hawaiian islands numerous time over the years.Relying solely upon the high Tripadvisor rating I arranged for two nights in two ""Deluxe Ocean View"" rooms for my wife and I and our two teens in late April 2007. We were on a stop-over en route to Kauai.Both rooms were on the 8th floor (building only has 9 floors) and were equally shabby and rundown. The hallway looked more in keeping with an early Soviet-era apartment building with fading institutional green paint and stained carpets. The rooms were spartan, the carpets stained, the bedspread threadbare and the bathroom had cracked and stained tiling.The rooms themselves were not ""dirty"" - I believe the cleaning staff was doing the best they could with what they had to work with - but the whole place is in desperate need of either a major renovation or tearing the building down. Even some of the furniture in the tiny lobby was so rundown you would be embarrassed to have it in your living room - that should be a clue as to the state of affairs of the rest of the place.Our rooms did have an ocean view (albeit across the top of an adjacent much larger hotel) and there was a complimentary breakfast (a small table set with a coffee urn, donuts and a pineapple juice dispenser) but neither were ""selling points"" in my mind.You are close to Waikiki Beach but at the ""seedier"" end of the beach walk (open drug use and many homeless people).The hotel staff was polite but did not distinguish themselves in any fashion. My wife and I had booked a king or queen size bed for our room and instead found two single beds that, because of furniture arrangements, could not even be combined into a double. We immediately raised this with the hotel desk but were told they were full and so nothing they could do. No apologies. Very unimpressive.In summary, if you can manage an exceptionally cheap price on a room here, and are just looking for a place to sleep, you may be satisfied with this hotel. However, you can find other places, perhaps not quite as close to Waikiki Beach but still within walking distance, that provide much more value for your money and certainly would put you in a better mood for your holidays.","Vancouver, Canada",31,2.0

Since I wasn’t renting a car, and this was my 1st trip to Hawaii, it was very important to get in a good, safe area with restaurants, convenience stores, and various places within walking distance. I got just that at Ocean Tower during my stay April 9th -18th, 2007.My good 1st impression of the hotel was formed when I arrived and the General Mgr. Terry came out and personally greeted me and advised me that he had placed water and refreshments in my room (very nice after a 13 hr trip with an 8-hr straight flight). I was also honored to get a room with a balcony overlooking the ocean as requested. From the beginning, I had the impression that the Mgr. Terry and the hotel staff would go above and beyond and out of their way, to do anything within in their power to exceed your expectations. As another example, near the end when I was almost out of cash and didn’t have the pin# on my newly assigned debit card, Mgr. Terry recommended that I try Travelers Checks at a bank…. But then stated, “if you have a problem, please be sure come see me, and we can see what we (the hotel) can do to help you.” This made me feel really taken care of as a guest. On my last day, when I was too busy packing to fix up and go down for coffee, I had asked if a staff member would drop a cup off at my door real quick. It was Terry the Mgr. who dropped it off himself. I was very impressed with the spirit of excellence, professionalism, & genuine warm hospitality of Mgr. Terry, Angie, Grace, Keenan, and Fai Yun. Local Hawaiians are the most amazingly kind, open, sincere, generous, and finest people I have ever seen anywhere in all of my travels.There then was LEONOR WONG. She is a truly exceptional and amazing lady. She came in (on her day off!) and sent me out with a beautiful homemade lei and flower, bottled water, and a box of chocolates! When she sat down to chat for 20 minutes, I could tell this was no ordinary woman. Her radiant enthusiasm, sincere love for people, and the wholehearted way she thoroughly loves and enjoys what she does, is what sets her apart like a bright shining light. Even though I am an accounting major, my work background and company puts a strong emphasis on outstanding customer service and people-centric skills. After meeting LEONOR WONG, I came back to Oklahoma inspired and re-fired to be an employee with that kind of excellence with people!!! This wonderful lady even called me a week after my trip to ask how I was, and to advise me that she was sending me coffee and a box of goodies!!! Leonor, Terry, and the Ocean Tower staff treated me with such respect, kindness, and care. They really made me very happy on my beautiful vacation. I look forward to recommending Ocean Tower (soon to be Hotel Renew) to everyone I know for years to come. From the bottom of my heart, Mahalo for your “Aloha Spirit”!!! – R.",Oklahoma,29,5.0

After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms.

They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, ""hello"" and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there.

We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches.

The staff even provided champagne for us on our annivarsary which was a nice touch. All in all, a good hotel which will probably be great once the renovations are complete. However, at this time just be sure you know what to expect when you arrive. It will make your stay much more pleasant and allow you to enjoy the hospitaility nd graciousness of the staff.","Bloomington, IL",19,3.0

Our room was on the sixth floor and our view was really terrific. The location of the hotel itself was also great as it's nearly a stone's throw from the beach and buses pick up just next door. It's an easy walk to many destinations in Waikiki. We're happy the hotel is doing a much needed update as our room, while clean, was quite dated and definitely in need of a facelift. Our hope is the rates will stay reasonable so we can revisit in the future. We can't say enough about the staff and management. The desk clerks were very helpful with directions, especially Grace who was a wealth of information. Terry, the manager, was also helpful with directions and suggestions. Leonor was simply wonderful! She made sure our wedding/honeymoon stay was special and definitely pampered us. We had champagne and chocolates and she even presented us a delicious cake for our wedding day.

We wanted simple: a place close to the beach with conveniences nearby. We got what we wanted and then some. The location is fantastic (a half block away from the beach). The hotel is small; the longest we ever waited for an elevator was maybe 15 seconds. The continental breakfast was all we needed to get us going for the day. Rooms are spacious, and after the ongoing renovation, they will be gorgeous. But the thing that made this such a wonderful stay was the people. My fiancé and I are in customer service so we know good care, and boy did we get it! From the front desk to housekeeping, the staff was warm, accommodating, and genuine.And, if you've read other reviews about this hotel, you've no doubt gotten wind of staff superstar Leonore, the Ambassador of Aloha. She is the embodiment of aloha. Our experience with her blossomed from the first time we met her when she grabbed some chairs for us to eat breakfast in the lobby until she graced us with leis she made herself for our trip home on our rushed exit out of the hotel. (Thanks to Roberts Hawaii shuttle for arriving 45 minutes early and robbing us of a proper goodbye.) This woman goes way above and way beyond the call of duty. When she found out we were engaged and considering getting married on Oahu, she sent us champagne, flowers and chocolates to our room. I think she would've even found a way to officiate the wedding herself if we had been motivated enough to pursue marriage plans during the visit. Alas, we were too busy relaxing on the beach to bother with such business.When we return to Oahu, little Leonore will be a big reason we attempt to get a room at the Aqua Ocean Tower. She is the brightest jewel in this hidden gem of a hotel.",ABQ,47,5.0

It's been on my to-do list for a few decades also. This led to many hours of pouring over Web sites about Hawaii, and eventually booking a package on Hawaii.com in which we picked the Ocean Tower hotel for our stay. We were on a tight budget, and it seemed like a good deal. We couldn't have been more pleased with our choice. Although the building was quite a lot smaller that the other hotels in the area, and somewhat dated, our stay was a very positive experience. Many others have reported about the worn carpets, old paint etc., and that was all true at the time we were there. They were actually beginning a full remodel project on the property the Monday after we left. There were two model rooms that had been completed and we were able to view one of them just before coming home: It was gorgeous. Unfortunately this will likely lead to an increase in price, but hopefully it will remain affordable. We stayed on the 7th floor in a small corner room with one bed and a deck. The room was designed with doors to connect it with the adjacent room, and that allowed sound to come through from noisy neighbors. This was the only downside we noticed during our stay. On the upside, we saw no bugs anywhere in the building at any time during our 8 days. Although I must admit that we are not overly fussy, if there had been a bug in our room, you would have heard my wife screaming from the mainland. The bed was new and very comfortable, the room was clean, and the staff was wonderful. The complementary breakfast every morning, even though it was simple, saved us a lot of time and money. Many expensive hotels don't even bother providing breakfast. We got to know several of the employees during our stay, and without exception they were extremely friendly and helpful. Leonor Wong, the housekeeping manager, was always a joy to be around, and went out of her way to be certain our stay was as enjoyable as possible. When we went to the beach we were handed towels, mats, boogie boards, air mattresses, whatever we needed - Wow! Talk about saving hassles and money, little touches like that make all the difference. Not to mention, the location relative to the beach is amazing. Half a block, cross the street and your standing in the sand looking at the water. Fantastic restaurants abound, our favorite was right around the corner and up a flight of stairs, called Lulu's. There was so much good food all over the place, our best recommendation is never eat at the same restaurant twice, and order fish everywhere you go. Don't like fish? Then why are you going to Hawaii?!!Most transportation services and tours have a regular stop on the street outside the hotel's entrance. It's a short walk to the zoo, beach, shopping, aquarium, amphitheater and all sorts of other attractions. One of the greatest treasures we found following the sidewalk just out of town diamond head way, was a rock jetty sticking straight out into the sea. With a sidewalk paved on top of the rocks, it designates a nature preserve in the water. We saw some amazing fish from there, and nice sunsets also.If you're a walker, the hotel is a great place to start from. Diamond head is very close, as are many other popular destinations on that end of town. There are very few hills heading deeper into the city, and we walked all the way to Iolani Palace one day packing our usual truckload of cameras. I wouldn't recommend this for most people unless you're in reasonable shape and adventurous. We stopped for lunch 1/2 way there, and when leaving asked the waitress which direction the palace was. She looked at us like we were crazy and told us it was way too far to go on foot, and that we should call a cab. Well, we don't want to be fat, and we're not lazy, and we're extremely cheap, so we walked. Believe me: the food in Hawaii is good enough that unless you have very strong will power, you will gain weight if you don't sweat it off as you go along.The Polynesian Cultural Center is a must see. Plan to spend an entire day there, it's worth it. We were wanting to go back for a second day, but it will need to wait until the next trip.Overall it would be hard to beat this hotel as a place to stay, particularly if you want to be on a budget and close to the beach. We can't recommend it highly enough, and will definitely stay there again.",Redmond,45,5.0

Besides the usual room maintenance, we had a ""special treat"" in our room every day the delighted us. I have never had such special treatment at a hotel. The hotel is very reasonably priced and provides excellent value. The room we stayed in had a great view of Diamondhead off the lanai, and Waikiki beach with surfers everywhere out the other window. This particular room was old and had some funkiness to it, although it was very clean and well-maintained. The hotel is going through a major renovation, and we had the opportunity to view one of the new rooms. It was incredibly beautiful and well-furnished in a somewhat Japanese motif.

Coming back in the evening, Leonor offered us a complimentary room that had not yet been cleaned for the next guests, and we were able to shower & dress for our long journey back to Canada. She was in a word, Superb! & far & away the best thing this hotel had to offer. She certainly made our first trip to Hawaii so memorable & we are so appreciative.

So when we arrived we rented a car and set out to look for a place to stay. We inquired in at least 15 places. Some had a room but it was too expensive. A few were too skuzzy. Most had no room. The first night we slept in the car, after searching for hours, my husband said with 20-20 hindsight""that's why people reserve"". The next morning was bright and beautiful and we were hopeful. We started looking right away. We parked by the Zoo and walked up the main beach area, took a turn and down just one block from the beach we saw a hotel with a vacancy sign. We went in to inquire and they had room! Wow. They invited us to enjoy the continental breakfast that they serve every morning. Leonor and Grace were very friendly, and the price was right.

One of the major contributions that shed light on our vacation was staying at the deluxe Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. Ocean Tower not only treated us like family, but in addition made every one of our requests come true. We truly felt like royalty in a grand palace. Ocean Tower Hotel had unbelievable customer service, all the way from their concierges to the bartenders. Our stay at this hotel was one of a kind because everything was clean and sanitary, and we felt welcome to the point where we jokingly call it our “second home” now. A truly special person that contributed to our exceptional stay in Hawaii was Leonor Wong, who is the executive house keeper at the hotel. Leonor took care of our every need and made our trip to Hawaii one to remember!!! We would like to thank the staff at Ocean Tower for making our dreams a reality and embrace the quality of this hotel for their Utopia style treatment towards their guests.Thank you very much.Alex & Lisa Gershfang",san francisco,16,5.0

The staff from the general manager, to the head of housekeeping, to the housekeeping staff, to security, to the front desk were all very friendly, competent, and responsive. They made you feel like family. While the newly rennovated rooms are really going to be something (having viewed the models that were just completed prior to our last stay), I am just afraid that the secret will get out and this great niche hotel will be tough to get a reservation at. Even the older rooms while being dated, were very clean and comfortable. The hotel is located one half block off Waikki Beach and is convenient to a number of fine attractions and restaurants. Self parking just a half a block away was very reasonable.Lets face it, while in Hawaii, you really don't want to spend all your time and money in your hotel room, so do the next best thing by staying this hotel.

We had walked around Waikiki for several hours before finding this hotel which had one room left. After about 10 hours of travel, we had walked around Waikiki looking for a new place to stay and found this. The lobby was very nice but the room was not. However, it did not have a cockroach infestation, like our original hotel, so we thought it would be a decent place to sleep. We were wrong. First of all, make sure that if you book this hotel you do not have a corner room, the noise from the street is never ending. The worst thing is that we were woken up very early to what seemed to be drilling in the room next to ours. It continued for hours. Not joking the pictures were turning sideways and almost falling off of the walls. After no sleep whatsoever, we went down to speak with someone about all of the trouble with the noise. We got absolutely no apology and were told that yes they have no control over when their contractors start remodeling (even at 7 am!). The manager said, ""Most people get up really early because of the time change."" and ""Well, you got a few hours of sleep."" When we asked if there was anything he could do, like discount our rate, etc, he said, ""Sorry, you paid at check-in, there is nothing I can do.""

Nothing romantic or special needed, just something clean and basic and convenient...but CHEAP.I worried ahead of time that this place would be a dump, but I was pleasantly surprised - the Ocean Tower easily met my expectations and more. The staff were friendly and helpful. Let's not kid ourselves, though - this is not a luxury hotel; there are few services and not even a pool. The hotel needs serious renovation beyond the nice lobby and renovations have just started (a few floors at a time - you'd never know unless your elevator stopped there). The current rooms are dumpy and dated (paint damage on walls, peeling wallpaper, etc.) but clean. The hallways are painted a tacky bright green. Still, the rooms are not unwelcoming, and I got a king non-smoking room which truly was non-smoking (no hint of smoke) with a balcony (you can barely see the ocean if you turn your head, mostly a view of other buildings). Some of the rooms have balconies (the 01 rooms) but no real ocean views; good-sized balconies, too. I had a ""moderate"" (budget) room reservation but the hotel wasn't full so I presume that's why I got a balcony room. Don't expect one. The king room I had was small but manageable (having the balcony is worth a little less room inside!). There's a combination desk/vanity (with a mirror) apart from the small bathroom. There's also a good-sized closet. I liked the fact that the hotel has only 72 rooms, 8 rooms per floor. There are huge hotels around the Ocean Tower with hundreds of rooms each! The two elevators were prompt and had no trouble handling 72 rooms. And I find service tends to be more personal at a smaller hotel, when it's more likely that the front desk person will remember you.The shower (with a tub) had surprisingly good water pressure and hot water. (Reviews of other cheaper Waikiki hotels complain about this.) Some might fret about the old-fashioned separate hot and cold water controls for the tub water; others may find it a throwback to an earlier era. I used the free wireless internet from my room every day with my laptop (it worked fairly well but was occasionally very slow - but at least it was free!). The hotel otherwise has no public computer to use, no way to print your boarding passes for a return trip, etc. There's also a free safe in the room - very convenient. There's also a little fridge which I did not use. I was bad and ate the cheap pastries they offered for breakfast every morning, but there are plenty of nearby breakfast options.My biggest worry about the place was the thin walls. The first hour after I checked in, the guy in the next room started yelling about something and it sounded like he was next to me - that sure startled me! I was tempted to change rooms but I never heard the guy again - maybe he checked out or was kicked out. If you are unlucky to get a noisy neighbor, you will hear the noise. Also, note that this is Waikiki and you are going to hear ""street noise"" - buses, music playing late into the night at the neighborhood resort bar, etc. Fortunately, the hotel has a good, ""white noise"" air conditioner that blocks out much of the noise and cools quite well too. I slept fine all four nights here. The king bed was quite comfortable also.The location, though, is the biggest perk of this hotel. Being one block from the beach in Waikiki can't be beat. You can even snorkel here very easily - not as good as the spectacular Hanauma Bay, but still very good, lots of beautiful fish; if you have no time to do Hanauma Bay, just buy cheap snorkel gear at the ABC store across the street from the hotel and go for it. There are tons of restaurants around and even a Starbucks on the same block - the hotel does not have coffee makers in the rooms.Parking: currently $15/night and limited to first-come, first serve. However, the Waikiki Banyon hotel about 2 blocks away has a self-park public lot for only $8 for 24 hours with full in-out privileges, and this is what I did. A tad inconvenient but I never had trouble finding a spot in their parking structure. You can stop briefly by the hotel to load/unload your lugged when you arrive/depart. Call the hotel directly before you arrive to confirm the parking options.","Portland, OR",54,4.0

The rooms facing the ocean have a lovely view with palm trees and the beach, but cost $30 more per night. None of the rooms has a balcony, which is nice when in Hawaii, to enjoy th sunset. The hotel has free wireless internet on each floor, but you have to bring your laptop.

It had that rundown seaside town feeling of decreptitude. Definitely a fabulous view from the room - pity the windows were so small and no balcony. You could at least open the window and hang out. This is a budget hotel, although we paid $150 AUD per night. The furnishings and fittings were tired and old. Wallpaper peeling off the walls in the bathroom, the usual poorly ventilated no window bathroom. Room was small, thankfully we had booked 2 queen beds to ensure more room, but you did need to sidle around the beds to get around. Yellow net curtains at the windows didn't really do it for me, and the beds and pillows were hard. Perhaps this is good value for Hawaii, but not for me. At least their was a refrigerator in the room for a change, although no coffee or tea making facilities. Definitely time for a major refurbishment here - they are doing it on the cheap.

For the price and the location, we decided on a leap of faith and booked in from April 24 to May 1st (and having seen MANY ‘like-priced’ properties during my stay, I got the best deal possible). We got our baggage and went to the shuttle/cab area, only to find that at 11pm on a Sunday, chances of getting something weren't good (pushier people would have no trouble battling the throngs but we were too tired to fight). Finally got a Roberts shuttle around 11:30pm ($14 for a round-trip ticket from and back to the airport). Super-friendly & helpful drivers (the Kenyan guy we had on the way back was a HOOT, he really made our last few moments in Honolulu fun). When we arrived around midnight the check-in was super-fast and the gal at the desk was very helpful and in good spirits (exactly what you want when you've gotten through 14 hours of travelling). Our first impression of the room (802) was not too good (stained carpet, tile & bathtub; some peeling paint, etc.) but the bedding & bathroom were clean, it was a larger room w/2 double beds (I am grateful now that we didn't get a single king bed as we requested as we later got a chance to see the room and it was smaller), and it was a non-smoking room that actually didn't smell of smoke! YAHOO!! The beds/pillows were super-comfy, and we slept like babies all week. I never saw even one bug in our room all week, NOT ONE. When our tv wouldn’t work, the security guard was there to help within 5 minutes. The tv had many local/cable channels (the local newsanchors cracked us up each morning), and the small refrigerator worked like a charm. There was also a hair dryer in the room, as well as an iron & ironing board. Lots of closet space & drawers. Our room faced Lemon Street/Paoakalani Ave., so all we had was a view of other buildings, which was fine since we didn't spend too much time in it (if we hung out the window to the right we could see Diamond Head!LOL). We were never bothered by street noise being on a higher floor. Coffee is available around 6am in the lobby (free) along with the daily paper (free), and continental breakfast of YUMMY pastries and juices is available from 8-10am (also included in room price). There is luggage storage (free) if you need to check out well-before your flight as we did (check out is noon, our flight was midnight...the front desk manager was even kind enough to give us a room to shower in after our day on the beach). Have I mentioned that the staff at this hotel is AWESOME?? ;) And Tina, the housekeeper, always had our room impeccably clean and was always ready with a cheery ‘Aloha’ each morning (and she even hugged me tight when I tipped her at the end of our stay). The hotel is right behind a bigger hotel, a half-block from a beautiful stretch of beach (Kuhio Beach...east part of Waikiki). There is a breakwater here that makes swimming in the ocean perfect for small children/families (and we found out snorkelling in this area we called 'the bathtub' the last day we were there that there are TONS of fish near the wall, even some that we didn't see at Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve-Hanauma is also a MUST!!). To play in the waves all you have to do is walk down past the breakwater. With the recent rain/sewage spill trouble that this area has had this year, we never had any trouble with infections or illness (even with open blisters and cuts). The sand is soft and gets gloriously warm. We HIGHLY recommend buying a seagrass beach mat for a buck or two at any ABC store (shake and go, doesn't stay wet; way better than lying on a towel).  There are almost an infinite number of options for food at this end of Waikiki, all price ranges. Our 'best of' picks would be Cheeseburger in Paradise on the beach for breakfast (Mac Nut pancakes are to DIE FOR), Jackie's Kitchen in Ala Moana Mall for lunch (mmmmmm, portobello mushroom sandwiches....drooooool; and CHEAP...tell Mike, the manager, that you're sorry about his Red Wings being beaten by the Oilers LOL), and for supper if you like seafood, the all-you-can-eat buffet at Todai (west end of Wakiki) is unbelievable (we had to go twice)! We rented a car and drove 'round the island, stopping at all of the amazing beaches on the North Shore (a LOT of fun with the bigger surf, white sand, and completely deserted during the week, even in full sunshine!!). But from the location of the hotel, a bus to any destination is a half-block away. $2.00 w/ a 2 hour transfer period. Lots of money-friendly options instead of going for expensive tours or the dreaded time-share spiel. The Honolulu Zoo, Kapi'olani Park are right beside the hotel. Diamond Head, as we found out, is an approximately 3-hour walk from the hotel to the observation deck at the top (the walk back, blessedly, is downhill). Taking the bus to Diamond Head would cut off about 2 hours!LOL The sunset from the beach in front of the hotel is nothing short of breathtaking.  I think that covers it. I would stay here again without thinking twice (and will). Best value for my buck, the best location and the best staff.","Alberta, Canada",123,3.0
