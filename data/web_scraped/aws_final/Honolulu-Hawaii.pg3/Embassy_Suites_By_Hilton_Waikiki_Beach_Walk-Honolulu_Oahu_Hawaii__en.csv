I stayed in two bedroom suite...and upon arrival, room was very worn and in need of updating. Our room was also dirty. So much so, I immediately went to front desk and voiced concern. I provided photos and front desk sent someone up to clean!. Was terribly dust ridden, for $500 a night I expected far better. Once cleaned, things went much better... but room condition not on par with other Embassy Suites. The two best features were the breakfast/pool area and overall location. Breakfast a wonderful experience for family of 5. Pretty much same thing every day but well worth it and good variety. Staff at breakfast wonderful! Every evening also had drinks and snacks...all this included as part of staying with Embassy. Location of hotel adjacent to and connected to Beach Walk on one side, however opposing side of hotel nearly abandoned and run down. Location to Beach just short walk away... maybe one block or so straight ahead on path. Car rental available next door and could return after hours at Embassy for small fee.I would stay again, but not my first choice and currently does not warrant as high a rating as is shown. With remodel...no hesitation... would highly recommend! For comparison, I checked out Trump hotel next door... night and day (Trump elegant and absolutely beautiful), however Trump similar room $1500 per night and no breakfast included, plus very small pool.When I return, I wy check out Embassy again, but if not remodeled... would pass.",Mt Zion IL,26,3.0

Really had a lot of difficulties with the overall appearance of the hotel being worn and dated and a little less than clean. Yes, we understand it is a high volume hotel and location and yes, we understand that is clearly caters to families, but, with that being said, that isn't an excuse for less than stellar front desk personnel and the overall feel of the property.It is in desperate need of an update, some cheerier paint and a wee bit of attitude adjustment in some of the front desk staffing.As a loyal Diamond, we did receive a lovely room upgrade, no complaints there, however with the quick turnaround, the room was just not satisfactorily clean. At all. Grimy would fit the bill and so would dusty.The location is great, a very short walk to so many things and that is an absolute plus.Would we stay here again? For the price...maybe??? If you're traveling w/ family, then I think you'll find this place acceptable and will met your needs.","Bradenton, Florida",257,3.0

First, they had a welcome drink for us when we checked in. Second, we were upgraded to an ocean view room...I think because we have gold status. (I booked the room through Costco Travel.)Third, happy hour was amazing! They had an entire menu of drinks that they served for free every night. Nice Hawaiian drinks too.Fourth, the full breakfast! This not only saved us money, but it’s was a legit full and fresh breakfast. They had two lines, so there’s was never a wait. Fifth, the location! I don’t think I’ll stay anywhere else after staying here and seeing just how central it is to the beach, restaurants, and shopping. Overall, between the amazing customer service, the kind house keepers, and everything listed above, I will return. I will recommend this hotel to there too. I don’t think you can go wring by staying here.  ","Ogden, Utah",12,5.0

The hotel is amazing. Beautiful, clean, spacious rooms. And having free breakfast (which is awesome) every morning was a huge plus. And if that wasn’t enough...from 5:30-7:30 every evening, complimentary snacks and drinks were provided. How awesome is that!But what truly set this hotel apart from anyone else, was their staff. Never have we stayed at a hotel with such friendly staff. Words cannot describe how amazing the staff was, especially Cary (at morning breakfast) and Keala and Keola (at the complimentary evening reception). They truly went above and beyond. These 3 made our vacation beyond amazing and they are the sole reason we will always stay at this hotel when visiting Oahu. They all made us feel like we were at home.

My parents and 2 adult brothers also stayed at the hotel for 7 days. We all agreed that it was the perfect location, walking distance to everything you need! The hotel staff were friendly, and made sure that we were taken care of. The hotel room was always clean, and housekeeping always made sure we had enough towels. We were often in the room at different times during the days so our boys could nap, but housekeeping was extremely considerate and would ask us for the best time to clean our room. Our room was a king room in the Aloha Tower. It was perfect for two adults and two young children. You can hear the elevator throughout the night, but it did not bother me. Some days the elevators were busy and it was difficult to get up or down depending on the time of day. Breakfast was unreal! I was so impressed, never bored of the options. The omelettes were great! Evening reception was good, some people enjoyed the free drinks more than others! The entertainment was amazing!The pool was never crowded even though the hotel was full most of the nights we stayed. Our 3 year old loved the kiddy pool and always found a friend or two to play with!We were unable to use our balcony during our entire stay due to construction. We spoke to the hotel staff and they gave us a choice of late checkout or a free night. We were very thankful and chose to have a free night. Overall, this hotel is amazing for families!

Partly because it's a very nice, clean, friendly hotel, in a great location. The other thing is they have the absolute best happy hour....besides the free mixed drinks/soda/snacks, on Mon, Wed, Fri and Sat. nights they have a group called Kanilau perform during happy hour(5:30-7:30pm). They are the most talented family, GREAT singers, who can pretty much sing everything from Neil Diamond to Guns & Roses to The Righteous Brothers to Bruno Mars...and more. The only downside and it's not horrible....they do have birds flying in the patio area so you have to watch your snacks.

We walked the block to the beach twice, but the water was too cold for us...nothing ES could do about that. Neither could ES do anything about the crying babies at all hours of the night. My wife never eats breakfast, but we ate breakfast here every morning. Waiters in the dining room like Aldrin worked very hard to keep the area clean and welcoming. With 2 chefs and 6 omelettes going at once, it was a very short wait for yours and well worth it. Wide variety of food at the buffet. The evening manager’s party was lots of fun. Drinks were free and very good. Shane behind the bar made excellent margaritas. With 2 bartenders the line went fast...very little waiting. The band on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday was excellent (see picture). The manager of this event kept the room and tables clean and atmosphere inviting. For us the dance floor was a bit small, but we love to dance, and not everyone does. Relying on the reviews, we gave up our king room when we checked in due to the close proximity to the elevators. When waiting for an elevator, they did not seem that noisy, but perhaps in a room immediately adjoining them it may have been noisy especially if you are a light sleeper. Our queen bed was perfect for us...no lumps, no sagging just a great comfortable bed. Would have preferred a king away from the elevators, but I understand there were none. We had a city view room, and we were happy with it Loved having two rooms with each room having its own television. So we would definitely stay here again and hope to make that happen next year.

The complimentary breakfast buffet, evening reception with complimentary drinks and snacks are great value which is not found anywhere else in Waikiki. Four nights a week the Hawaiian family band, Kanilau, plays at the evening reception and is one of the main reasons we keep coming back. We are always greeted warmly by everyone from the bellman, Mr. Dean, to the front desk personnel, to the housekeeping, breakfast and evening reception staff. While all staff are always very friendly and helpful, certain staff stand out each time we stay here. Aldrin, Resty and Jay on the breakfast staff always greet us with a warm handshake or hug and say “welcome home” and ask us what they can do to help us. Cary came by our table at breakfast each day to check on us and to offer suggestions for things to do, places to eat or places to buy souvenirs or clothing for the best price. Justyn, at breakfast and also in the pool area was also very helpful. Our housekeeper, Crisfel, was so nice and made our room very comfortable during our stay. Alma, does a great job at the evening reception. At the evening reception Keola and Dennis, the bartenders, do an outstanding job with the drinks and keeping the line moving while interacting with the guests.We are looking forward to our next trip here.","Marietta, Georgia",0,5.0

My experience is as follows:1. When checking in there is no clear queue, so although I was standing around at the desks for 5 minutes, someone else that just walked straight up pretending they didn't see me was served first. I asked staff if I was waiting in the wrong spot but they said there is no queue and would be next. Then someone else tried to push in front of me, the staff member told them I was next. Given this happened to me twice in the 5-10 minutes I was waiting I am guessing it would be an ongoing issue - I think clear signage is needed for people to queue up. I didn't wait long and not a big deal but annoying for people that wait their turn.2. I booked and paid in full through a third party around 4 days before I was staying at this hotel. When I was checking in I was asked for ID and a credit card. I assumed, (as all hotels do) they were holding a token amount on my card. The lady checking us in whipped it out of my hand and swiped it through the machine in .5 of a second. I asked what amount she was holding and she advised the entire accommodation cost. I asked why given I have paid already and she stated she did not know I had paid and asked for my evidence, which I showed. Then when I said she has now used up the entire credit left on my credit card, she stated I should have told her I had paid already and this would not have happened. So apparently it was my fault that she wrongly charged my card leaving me with no credit, which took over one week to reverse. While I had cash and another card (that I didn't want to use), many people would have been caught short by her doing this. Staff should be clarifying with customers what they are charging the card for before swiping it though taking incorrect amounts. Also don't blame customers, why would I think you were charging my card for a room I had paid for.The staff member said she will get the manager to look at it and stop the payment. No-one followed up with me to tell me what had happened. I had to follow up at the desk the next day to see if had been stopped.3. The rooms were big enough for 2 adults and 1 kid, clean and tidy and I like having the separate lounge area.4. The breakfast was pretty good, some of the food (bacon) was rock hard and gross but the omelettes were nice and there was plenty of choices. Yogurts, fruit, pastries etc. The coffee was not nice. Overall I thought the breakfast was really good. 5. The nightly drinks and food: (the food consisted of carrot sticks or broccoli and dip, chips and goldfish biscuits and some pretzel mix) The beer was fine, the mai tais were fine, the blue cocktail was way to sweet and the scotch and coke (very crap scotch, I could not drink). The first night there was one staff member serving (who was super quick) but massive queues. There was one other person in the bar with him pretty much doing nothing, not sure why he was there. The second night and third night there were two staff actually working and the queues moved quicker. The band on one of the nights was great and it made the night much more fun. 6. The pool area was good, not many seats but there always seem to be some available and the whole area was really nice.7. There was a sign left in our room to say there were going to be renovations during the stay. This was obvious when we were in our room and could hear a very loud buzzing noise. No mention of this prior to booking of course.Overall I felt this place was fine, would I come back if I got a great deal, yep, but it would have to be super cheap, I would not pick it over other places I have stayed, just because of the little things.","Melbourne, Australia",57,3.0

The hotel itself is a little 'dated' in comparison with other hotels. This is in regards to the furnishings in the rooms etc... Although some would see this as a negative, this worked out to be a blessing in disguise. The rooms are bigger and gave a little more space when the kids wanted to finish up for the day and just 'relax on the bed'. The pool area was a huge hit for the entire family. It was the right depth for the 'littler kids. Which put at ease the parents (myself included). This really came alive in the happy hour sessions from 5:30 - 7:30. Special mention must go to Keola - (the resident barman). He has got to be the hardest working barmen in all of Hawaii. Hilarious and super efficient (despite the long lines at the start).

The cleaning lady didn't even say good morning/aloha to us but asked bluntly ""do you want your room cleaned?"" The staff at breakfast was also less than friendly (aside from one ). The other annoying change that happened this year is they added more ""cabanas"" in the swimming area but they decided to charge for them. That just makes me mad. The hotel is not cheap. We paid $350+ a night and you're going to nickel and dime us? That just felt cheap and left a bad taste in my mouth. All that said, the hotel is in a central location to the beach and downtown waikiki (restaurants and shopping). The rooms were clean, breakfast was good despite the long lines.

We have two teenage boys with BIG appetites so we can't beat the free breakfast which is hard to find in Waikiki hotels. We are early risers so we never had a problem finding a table, there are plenty outside as well. The location of the hotel is perfect (I used to stay there when it was the Coral Seas YEARS ago), close to the beach and lots of shops and restaurants. The happy hour in the evenings with the free snacks just can't be beat. The bartenders are SO friendly and entertaining, my boys loved going to get drinks from them. You can't beat sitting out at night, sipping on your free drink, munching on free snacks and meeting travelers from all over the world. Great atmosphere. The ONLY con I would have is that, though the band is AMAZING, the music is SO loud that it made it very hard to talk to these other travelers. You'd have to wait until they were in between songs to talk. If they could keep the volume down just a touch, it would make the evenings absolutely perfect.

And the sun hits the room till late in the afternoon so room is suppppper hot.. and does not cool down . Generally good stay though. STAFF- friendly. BREAKFAST - Yes, omelet is very yummy- unlike those soggy ones you get at other complimentary breakfast places. COCKTAIL RECEPTION - I am not a drinker so cannot comment on the alcohol offered at the reception, but other drinks are plentiful and self-serve so easy. Snack options could have been better – usually 1 type of veggie stick, pretzel, potato chips or chips w/ salsa/cheese. BAND - What I truly enjoyed was the band that played 5 days of our stay. I opened the dance floor most nights and danced every night they were playing (yes, I know I think most guests thought I had one too many to drink but nope – cannot drink a drop of alcohol!). Had many take photos of me & probably on lots of Instagrams but that’s ok. So long as I had fun and quite a few joined me in dancing once I opened the floor! =) . LOCATION- great as it’s close to everything Waikiki.. but if you don’t like crowds… not the best place to stay. Also, make reservations for everything because everything, everywhere is crazy. In fact, the hotel is the quietest place (even though it’s packed)! PARKING is $$. We had a car for the whole duration of our stay and we used it a lot.. but parking and tipping adds up (a lot)! POOL - small but worked for us. Towels always available. They had a towel drop off bin for when you return from the beach which carrying things up & down (including sand) lighter.

They took our bags, which was still available to us to get changed into more comfortable/appropriate clothing.The Hotel has a buffet breakfast with a reasonable variety of food and some made to order omelettes, a couple of varieties of coffee, juices etc which a lot of other hotels don’t have.During the evening the Hotel has the ‘Managers Reception’, which is a couple of hours of free poolside drinks, where there is a variety of beers, cocktails and spirits which are all free. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday you also get free entertainment during these drinks from an awesome local Hawaiian band (Kanilau) doing a variety of cover songs.

It’s well located, in the heart of everything good in Waikiki…… Restaurants, shopping, beaches.The rooms are well catered, spacious, clean and comfortable. The beds are adequately comfortable, with a couple of different pillows to choose from.

There is a plentiful supply of soaps, shampoo’s and other toiletries, which were Neutrogena brand.The rooms have strong, fast WiFi which was reliable and easy to access.Access to and from the Hotel is easy with a number of open air exits to all the best places in Waikiki.Again, the staff were excellent, often chatting and asking about your holiday when they see you throughout the Hotel.I would recommend this Hotel over many others in the area.Cost was $6704 (Aust) for 5 people, 14 nights, this included ALL resort fees, taxes, breakfast, evening drinks and entertainment.","Goulburn, Australia",31,5.0

We heard this year that management of the hotel has recently changed and we can notice a difference this trip. The most visual difference: the pool area has new furniture and cabanas for rent. And there are renovations being done to the towers. The rooms also have changed. Little things like no more pool towels in the bathroom, less bath towels available in the room, overall cleanliness of the rooms isn’t the same - it doesn’t seem to be as clean as it used to be. We don’t blamed the staff as we see them working hard and trying their best to accommodate our requests. The staff also has a lovely attitude and are super friendly. To us, it is obvious that the management is trying to save costs. As we have stayed at the hotel many times, we have noticed the little changes.

It is situated in the Beachwalk shops shops, less than five minute walk from the Royal Hawaiian Arcade shops/restaurants and roughly a ten minute walk from the International market place. Unlike most Embassy Suites there is no central enclosed atrium where the evening reception and morning breakfast are offered. On this property the reception and breakfast is on the 4th floor between the two hotel towers in close proximity to the outdoor pool. On Saturday evening the hotel has live entertainment for your listening pleasure while attending the manger's reception. The breakfast offerings are suitable for both an American and multi-national clientel. There is more than adequate seating for both events. The front area (bell hops, valets and front desk) personnel are polite and efficient. The check in process is well rehearsed and quick.

Soundproofing is clearly not something the hotel cares to invest in. After a sleepless night due to the elevator, I was thankfully moved to another room, for which I am thankful. It beggars belief that these rooms are made available.I also found that some staff (not all) were curt and a little rude. This does not apply to the housekeeping staff.

Great family feel around the hotel, note that this place is full of kids so if you're looking for a quiet romantic break away then this isn't the place for you.We were lucky enough to get into our room having arrived at 8am, check in isn't until 3pm and we had a small toddler with us. We appreciated this gesture and pass on our thanks. The Not So Good:No plates or cutlery within the rooms which seems very strange when there's a small kitchenette. It became a pain having to call down to have plastic plates/cutlery delivered to the room.Charging for shade umbrellas at the pool, absolutely ridiculous to cash in on the safety of families staying at the resort by charging $30 for shade from the blistering sun - Hilton take note and do the right thing. Lifts and proximity to the rooms. We stayed in room 1811 and our relatives stayed 1901 and both rooms are next to the lifts which run all night and are noisy.

We were also offered breakfast which was unexpected - a lovely gesture. We loved our stay at the Embassy Suites by The Hilton. Loved the afternoon canapés and drinks from 5.30-7.30pm. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the beach. It is perfectly located to many shops and restaurants while the busses are a short walk away. The pool was big, clean and comfortable and the pool was perfect for my daughter who is not confident in deep water. Staff were pleasant and very helpful throughout our stay.The only hiccup was our room located right next to the elevator that when starts, you car hear a rattling noise coming from the wires that feeds the elevator.

We arrived early on Thursday morning ( 9:30), and we thought we would simply have to leave our luggage, go out and explore, and come back later to an assigned room. Not at all!To our great surprise, Victor, a Reception Associate, checked us in, gave us our key and check-in package, and we were good to go! We had asked for a nice location, and despite it being so early in the morning, Victor was able to give us a room on the 7th floor with a lovely view. So many high-rise hotels in the area can make having a view problematic, but Victor found us a great room.Minutes after we had checked in, Victor texted us, asking about the room, etc, and indicating that we should get in touch with him should we need anything else. A first for us when it comes to checking in at hotels! He also texted the next day, asking after our enjoyment of Honolulu. Again, a first with any hotel stay we have had. We have stayed at many, many Embassy Suites in our frequent travels because of the value for your dollar, the free breakfasts, and the evening Manager Specials. However, I have to say that this particular location is the BEST of the Embassy Suites that we have experienced. The breakfast offerings are exceptional, with many varied items on the menu to better accommodate the many varied guests of the hotel. Similarly, the Manager's Reception, while quite simple in food offerings, is always kept full, and the bartenders pour a generous drink, especially given the large numbers of guests present in the evenings.Hats off to Embassy Suites Beach Walk!

Place is packed with kids!Especially watch out for Australian school holidays, which we weren't aware of while booking.

(which can be a blessing for some)Not enough lounge chairs/umbrellas by the pool. This is partly because they have these Cabanas and bigger beds that you can pay for the day that take 3 times the space of regular beds (we didn't see anyone rent these, and I think it's appalling to have that many of them occupying all the space while guests are scrambling to find a spot).

First, the upper management was very responsive and kind to a request that we had regarding a late check out. Mr. Miranda, Mr. Otsuka, and Mr. Robinson, all responded to our email which blew me and my husband away. I know these men have busy schedules so it was even more astounding that they answered us within minutes to a few hours. Customer service seems to be a thing of the past but these gentlemen are bringing back high standards. Mr. Otsuka even arranged for us to have a key to hang out at the hotel while we waited for transportation to the airport. Our flight did not leave until 9:00 p.m. and he saved us from hanging out at the airport for a long period. While Hawaii is beautiful, the airport harks back to 1960. Check in at the hotel was very easy and reception was actually aware of our late check out so that went smooth. The same with check out. No issues with giving us a key to hang out until we left for the airport. As someone who travels quite a bit, when everything goes smooth, it is always a delight. The management at the Hampton in Seattle (see my review for that) may need to see the blueprint this administration has in their handbook. The breakfast buffet had an amazing selection. I know some people thought the food was bland but when you are serving that many people it is easier for the guest to add salt/spices than to make something that may not appeal to those who have issues with certain additives. Also, you can have an omelet made to your specifications. The hotel has nice amenities. There is a manager’s reception with free beer and soda, as well as some snacks, a laundry room if you need to freshen up your clothes, a very nice swimming pool, valet service, and you can even drop off your rental care from Enterprise at the hotel. The rental car company closes early so this was a welcome feature. I know I am missing some things but I encourage anyone to stay here. It will start and end your holiday/vacation in all the right ways.Words cannot do our housekeeper Yuat (hope I spelled this right) justice. Our room was very clean and she fulfilled a few requests for us. Also, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention this woman has skills and speed! She offered great advice for us regarding touring the island.The hotel was in a perfect location.

It is a block off the beach and right on the Beachwalk where there are numerous stores and restaurants. It is also very close to the Royal Hawaiian Center where there are many stores and restaurants. The room is just like other Embassy Suites, with a separate bedroom and living area. The rooms were very clean and housekeeping was excellent. We called housekeeping because one of the TV's was not getting a clear reception. They came up within 15 minutes and replaced the TV. The AC worked very well; it was really nice to come back to a very cold room after being in the sun on the beach. The complimentary breakfast was excellent, but I thought the evening reception food and snacks was just okay. Our rooms were on the fourth floor, which is where the pool is located and where the complimentary breakfast and evening reception are also located. That was very convenient for us, as the elevators can sometimes be very slow. There are only two elevators for each of the two towers where the suites are located. I found the valet service to be excellent. They were very prompt in getting our rental car when we needed it You do have to pay $40 a day for parking.

Having a microwave in addition to the mini fridge was great as well, for heating up left overs. Even the coffee makers was good. The staff was super friendly for the most part, especially housekeeping and at breakfast.The breakfast was pretty good, a kicked-up hotel breakfast with both cold and hot items. I had rice and miso soup every morning we ate there, along with salad. Nice and light. There are tons of birds bothering people at the tables outside, but they open up the meeting rooms so we were able to eat sans birds. We didn't really do the happy hour, just a few snacks but we didn't want to drink so that part was a wash.The location is fantastic. A block away from the beach and crossing Kalia was much easier than the larger block most hotels are across from. The beach right there is rocky but pretty, but if you walk down to the Hilton Hawaiian Village past the dock, the beach there is without rocks and calm. Oh, and definitely do that walk at sunset. Simply stunning and absolutely free. The pool got super crowded later in the day. It's small (although large for Waikiki apparently) but it has a little kid area and a hot tub. The area around the pool was very nice and had a tropical feel although it was on the fourth floor.The only negatives were:Wi-fi was awful. Not a big deal for us but if you need to do work on business you will need your own hotspot. No business center to speak of (they closed it) just some computers in the hot lobby area. Fine for us to print our boarding passes but again if you need to do business, you will need another option.Also they assign rooms before check-in. We had to wait until 3, which fine that is the check-in time but even then the room wasn't ready. After all those calls we made to check on the room, at past 3 when we went back they said, Oh housekeeping still has to clean your room. What? On the phone they said it was guaranteed for three at the latest. We had pants from the flight and large electronics bag that we didn't want to check. My 7 year old was hot and sweaty and in tears, and I got upset as well, so they magically found us another room that was ready. There is no airconditioned space to wait. No lockers for valuables so you can change and swim, etc. while you are waiting. Apparently they assign you a room, and that's your room, and even if there are tons of rooms available in the class you booked, you wait for your specific assigned room. If they gave the previous guests in that room late check-out, you have to wait.

During the first evening there, the bartenders, Keola (he's going to be mad if I spelled his name wrong?) and Shan, made sure we were remembered as they poured all 9 of us our usual drinks. Also, our breakfast omelets and egg preferences were remembered and served with a lot fun by John and Dominic. Servers Cary and Aldrin always made our large party of 9 feel accommodated.

Special kudos to the bartenders, night wait staff and morning wait staff who were all super friendly and helpful during our stay.

And although it was adjacent to 3 elevators, it was quiet and peaceful.Breakfast was included and there was a large selection of food to suit everyone. There was also a managers reception which provided complimentary alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks between 5:30 pm and 7:30 pm every day. They were also complimentary snacks which was a nice touch. Our room attendant Yuet Chun was attentive and friendly. She made sure we had everything we needed and always bid us a good day. She is a credit to the embassy suites and her hard work should be recognised.The location of this resort is amazing. Very central and walkable to many shops and restaurants. The bus stop is very close to hotel which took us to ala moana centre and diamond head.

There are tons of selection in terms of restaurants withing 5 minutes walk, which is key having to feed 3 teenagers... The hotel's amenities we liked include a pool, valet parking ($40 per day), daily happy hour with free drinks and snacks, coin laundry services and in room dining. The only con was the breakfast. We felt that the selection was limited and if you stay there for more than 3 night you will have to eat the same food over and over again. The lineups are long and tedious and there aren't enough tables, especially for large famalies. Sitting outside in the sun while birds are trying to share your breakfast isn't our first choice.

We are so thankful to have found the Embassy Suites By Hilton Waikiki Beach Walk.The location is great. Though not directly on the beach, the walk is short and easy, even with small kids in tow. It was nice to be able to head out to the Beachwalk from the lobby area.From the minute we arrived, Cindy at Reception welcomed us with a smile and complimentary juice which was a yummy treat in the afternoon heat. She was very helpful and let us know when we could head up to our room. The room was perfect for our family. We had plenty of space to put away our kids' clothing and have the suitcases out of the way. We had 2 Queen beds in a bedroom and a sofa bed in the main area. The small kitchenette area was a bonus, with a large countertop area, small sink, microwave and mini fridge. The view out of our 14th floor windows was beautiful. We looked out over the pool area and could see the ocean in between the Halekulani and Outrigger hotels directly in front. The amenities offered at the Embassy Suites are superb! The morning breakfast had something for everyone. Definitely better than your typical continental breakfast. In addition to fruit, yogurts, breads, and an oatmeal and cereal bar, they offered a lovely green salad and made to order omelettes and eggs. This was our family favorite. The lines tended to be a little long, but worth the wait. Dominic was always so friendly to our family, smiling, joking, even getting our teenager to smile in the morning! And his omelettes were the best. He also made the best over medium eggs that I had during our stay. Thank you Dominic! Another awesome amenity is their evening Happy Hour down by the pool. They always had a fresh veggie option as well as crackers, chips, and occasionally nachos. The bartender happily made our family Virgin Mai Tais and Shirley Temples. This was the best way to wind down after a day of sightseeing, or visiting the beach, the kids would swim, grab a snack and be ready to rest. The pool area was small, but very enjoyable. Our kids loved swimming and would spend hours playing together. If I had to find a con I would say the elevators could be a little tricky at certain times. There were many times we would have to pass up 3 or 4 elevators that were full before we could get into one. We were never in a hurry so this didn't dampen our stay at all. I cannot say enough positive things about our stay at the Embassy Suites. The staff was helpful and friendly at every turn. They even gave our daughter a coloring book that she enjoyed throughout our stay. If you have a large family, or just want a little extra space on your Hawaii vacation, look no further. Thank you Embassy Suites for exceeding our expectations and helping to make our Hawaii vacation relaxing and fun! We cannot wait to come back.",,42,5.0

A bit further back from the beach but we clocked up our walking miles and great restaurants were very close.

The room was great, we had a nice lounge area and a large bedroom and bathroom, with a balcony. The ocean-views were not unobstructed like shown in the pictures, but it was still nice. Personally, I wouldn't pay the extra for an ocean view as it is not right on the ocean front, and costs a lot more. The location of this place is GREAT! Right in the centre of Waikiki, and a short walk to the beach. The pool was not the biggest, and was full on splashing children, which we personally didn't mind too much, but good to note if you are not looking for a family place. The buffet breakfast was average and very crowded everyday (however I think this is typical American food - more average for those not used to American food). The staff were all super friendly and helpful here too - the only thing wrong was that we had a room that smelt of smoke slightly which is not very nice if you are a non smoker. Comfortable bedding and couches, and a TV in both the lounge and the bedroom which was nice also.

This was made special by the employees, like Michael and Dominic preparing omelettes or Rose distributing kids books with crayons .Ending the day with the Manager’s Hosted Reception (5:30pm-7:30pm) with FREE DRINKS and snacks, from beer to delicious Mai-Tais or Blue Hawaii ... While the children play in a shallow pool (4 ft on the deeper side) Mommy and Daddy get their drinks and chips and talk whatever they want, just watching the kids swimming. AWESOME DESIGN! You could tell so by the parents walking around with their BIG SMILES in the morning and in the afternoon. Worth the rate of $329 per night!  TIPS:- Bathroom got clogged about 3 times, I think it’s because everyone brings sand from the beach . TIP: Wash as much as you can in the public beach. - Wi-Fi is bad. Internet is much slower in Hawai’i as well. TIP: Pre-load what you need in your device or print if needed.- ️ Public Parking around Waikiki is EXPENSIVE. TIP: You’re better off with the Valet service ($40 per day), you’ll notice when you leave your car in the capable hands of Calvin or Abre.- TIP: Refill your water bottles in the only filtered water machine there is, in the Aloha tower, right behind the reception.- TIP: Somehow Tuesday seemed very slow and Friday very busy.- The pool and breakfast area are on the 4th floor and you’ll want to get to them quickly. TIP: Register with Hilton Honors (their loyalty program) and download their App to choose your room as close as possible to the 4th floor and if possible in the Hula Tower (Close access to Big Wave Dave Surf & Coffee, Poké Bar, Ruth Chris and many more stores!)The only issue we had is that the A/C unit ❄️ thermostat didn’t work in one of the rooms but the temperature was SO COMFORTABLE that we didn’t bother to report it.#ruizmedina⭐️ ","Portland, Oregon",19,5.0

The rooms were clean, a good size, and well decorated. The cribs we were given were clean... but I can't say if they were comfortable because I wasn't the one sleeping on them, but the babies in our group had a good nights' sleep on them. All views are amazing, and this hotel is quiet on both towers. The breakfast buffet was delicious and since it is on the same floor as the pool, it's perfect for the adults to sun bathe while watching the children swimming in the pool after a delicious breakfast. The pool was a good size as well as the hot tub. Both were very clean during our stay, we swam at the pool everyday of our stay. This hotel's central location is convenient because it is walking distance to the famous Waikiki beach, ABC stores, The Honolulu Cookie Company, and is near plenty of other fun family-friendly attractions.

The price was well over $300 per night, but I decided it would be worth it. IT WAS NOT!The reception area is big, but not really welcoming. The front desk, while they offer a welcome fruit juice, don’t help you get a good layout of what the hotel has and where those things are. The room was clean, but absolutely a standard basic room that you can find at the cheapest motels.I did have a view of the pool and the ocean, which was nice. However it also looks out to the adjacent hotel and their rooms and balconies.Do not be lured by the free breakfast and free happy hour unless you are with young children and/ or on a serious budget. First these both take place in an area next to the pool. It’s feels like a cafeteria from elementary school, not only because of the trays and the lines, but the amount of screaming children. It was incredibly loud and the opposite of the intent of my relaxing vacation. There is a omelet station, but it took forever and there was no flavor to any of it. The rest is just industrial food from a convenience store. Oh and don’t forget all of the birds that are looking to eat off the floor and your table!The happy hour is free and includes well drinks that I think they are watering down with below well alcohol. My drink was both very strong and terrible. The booze was disgusting. If you just want t get drunk, this is the place. If you want a good drink, go elsewhere.The pool is small and overrun with screaming children.The gym is very small with a handful of treadmill items, a pulley weight set, a few benches, a few dumbbells, a couple of medicine balls and a couple of mats. There is no view. I would not recommend this hotel at all. It’s far to expensive for a basic hotel.

While there were a lot of positives like the breakfast and evening reception. Also no resort fee is a huge plus. There were a couple things that they could improve on.We have been to Maui many times and this vacation decided to stay in Oahu. This hotel was great for our time there. The pool is nice not to big but decent for our pool days. It would be nice if there were more seats with umbrellas to get some shade.The room was nice we had a separate seating area. We stayed in room 532 and it had a great view of the pool and the Friday night fireworks. The a/c in the sitting area was really good and kept the room cool. The one in the bedroom stopped working so maintenance came up and fixed it.Check in was good. It was nice they brought out juice for us. And we got there early so they were very kind to find us a room. but we feel like they could pump some Hawaiian fragrance into their lobby and hallways because of the area you can smell food all the time. We really enjoyed the beach walk area. It was so convenient to go out for food and shopping. The ABC store at the back of the hotel is one of the biggest we have ever seen. If Embassy Suites just improves on these small areas we will be back for sure. ,"Lynnwood, Washington",8,4.0

The room we stayed in was a king room right next to the lift and this was problematic as it was noisy through the night. I tried to change rooms but busy time of year and none available.

On several nights of the week there is also a fabulous band with a chap who I am quite sure could be the best ukulele player in the world! The crowd stood up and cheered each time he played!6.There is a huge choice at the complimentary breakfast with something to satisfy even the fussiest members of the family. The omelettes are cooked to order and are really delicious. Breakfast can be busy though and I could see that at peak times some families struggled to find an empty table.7.Every single member of staff we encountered was polite, helpful, welcoming and smiling!The Bad Points...1. Do not bother with a corner suite. We paid extra for one but soon discovered by looking at the hotel floor plan on the back of the room door that three out of the four corner suites on the floor are smaller than normal suites as they have a big chunk taken out of the room to accommodate the hotel fire escape. Am pretty sure that this would be the case on all floors. As a result, our family of 4 felt a little squashed, as once the sofa was made into a bed for the children there was very little space left. We had to ask for some of the other furniture in the room (coffee tables and chairs) to be removed and even then it was impossible to walk all the way around the sofa bed. This was such a shame and did spoil our enjoyment of the room. It was however, very nice to have different views from different balconies but definitely not worth the extra cost.2. The kitchen in the suite was really useless. There was no cutlery or plates provided, just a corkscrew. The fridge was good for cooling drinks but we never used the microwave and there was not enough worktop space to even prepare a sandwich. We had planned to prepare food and eat in the room some nights but this was impossible.3. We made the mistake of booking the 'premium' option which I had assumed was for a larger or better suite but it turned out was just for a daily supply of fizzy drinks and snacks. I paid well over the odds for this and really regret it.4. Most nights we slept well but on a couple of the nights we could hear traffic noise from the street below, even though we were on the 17th floor. It must have been much worse for guests staying on lower floors.5. There is quite alot of building work going on in the area and this is noisy. it didn't keep us awake but we could hear it from the pool deck and if we chose to sit on the balcony during the day.All in all, we had a good stay, enjoyed our time at the Embassy Suites and would choose to return but we would not rebook a corner suite or the premium option again.",Harrogate,48,4.0

I enjoyed the pool area that had enough lounge-chairs for everybody. The all-inclusive breakfast and happy-hour drinks were good additions to start and end the day, respectively, not requiring us to go out. However, the breakfast food and happy-hour drinks were practically the same every day. That aside, as one of six travelers, I was pleased to eat breakfast inside the hotel and have drinks right next to the pool area in the late afternoon. The only downside to the happy hour was the music that was TOO loud, so loud that we had difficulty talking together at our table. I suggest the music be turned town to make the happy hour more enjoyable. We sat the furthest away from the band but the music still overpowered our conversations.

Everything was clean and well kept.The buffet breakfast got rather busy in the morning serving both of the towers, but the food selection was extraordinary ranging from western food to Japanese staples.

If you have children with allergies, consider asking for a room without musky odour or find another hotel. There was also some construction in the area (not in the hotel specifically).

I can recommend it and would stay here again. I thought I would provide a review of the evening reception as I did not find very clear information on it when I checked earlier reviews.The evening reception is from 5:30-7:30 and is free for everyone staying in the hotel. During the reception certain drinks are free. These include 8 specific cocktails, several spirits and simple mix drinks such as gin and tonic, and beer and wine. There are also free drinks for kids such as cola and sprite, as well as snacks. The snack rotate each night. Chips and pretzels, and a veggie one night and nuts, corn chips, and veggies the other. In terms of what is provided, it is very nice and in a great location near the pool.The highlight of the evening reception though is the band, which is excellent. They play four days a week, Mon, Wed, Fri, and Saturday, and always put on a good show. They play classic pop songs but with unique arrangements and with ukelele as the lead instrument. They have really strong vocals and play tight sets. They are very professional, very engaging, and I found were perhaps the best reason to come to the reception. I have seen them play 6 times now, and my family still wants to come and see them play, as do I. Having stayed in Hawaii five times now, I can say that they are by far the best band that I have seen play. This is reflected by the audience appreciation. The embassy is lucky to have them.Overall the evening reception is a nice time and a great way to start the evening.

Our suite had two double beds in the bedroom and a pull out couch in the living room area. We are a family of 5 and this gave our family ample space. The pool area is also where the manager's cocktail party and morning breakfasts were held. The nightly manager's cocktail party was very generous with their bar service. The bartender is very friendly and pours a strong Mai Tai. He also made our kids happy with fun kid cocktails. There are lots of light snacks to enjoy during this manager's party, but you'll want to get a real dinner in addition to it. We ordered Giovanni's pizza delivered to our room. The next morning we were blown away by the huge breakfast selection. It starts at 6:30am and since we came from the east coast, we were awake and ready to eat.

The location cannot be beat. Theres a starbucks downstairs, the beach is just a mere short walk in one direction and the touristy shops of waikiki is a short walk in the other direction.

The room was large and spacious, very clean and although not brand new was new and clean enough for me. Housekeeping did a great job getting rid of all the sand in the room at the end of the day and we always came back to a nice tidy room. The complimentary breakfast is a really good solid meal! Not your avg cheap free meal. The fruit is abundant and fresh, the make your own omelette station is very filling. The pool is kind of small, but then with the beach such a short walk away I could see why they didnt waste money on the pool area (although its still a very nice and well maintained area). The workers are very nice, especially the valet people. valet only is a pain in the butt at times but the workers are fast, efficient and very nice so its hard to complain. I loved my stay so much the following year when I came back to hawaii for another vacation I had to choose the same hotel again! We didnt get the complimentary upgrade this time since we were not travelling with any honors member (too bad) but the room was still nice, although i must admit the rooms on the higher levels boast a better view and are much more quiet.

Handicapt bathroom had roll in shower which we did not use, but is decent and roomy if you had need to use it. The Manager Reception is held on level 4 - pool level and was extremely crowded. As some have said, nice for families who are still winding down their day. Elevators are extremely crowded - be sure to add more time into your schedule for coming and going. Breakfast was a zoo, food was just okay. Lines were very long. We chose not to eat breakfast here on the second day. There is a Starbucks across the way at the Outrigger Reef and also Cafe Glace on Lewers Street has breakfast items - but limited table space. The pool was lovely but extremely crowded except at breakfast. Cabannas are available for rent in additon to the free regular loungers. This might be a good choice if you want to stay by the pool.We were able to go to the beach and rent beach loungers in front of the Outrigger Reef Hotel.

The location was excellent - one block back from the beach but with easy access via public walkway across the street, and one block away from the main street via the lively, well-lit Waikiki Beachwalk. First impressions at check in were great, as it was quick and efficient with a delicious welcome drink. Our room was a one-bedroom suite with two balconies and a partial ocean view, and we utilised all the beds including the comfortable pull-out sofa. Our housekeeper, Yuet Chun, kept our room sparkling and made an effort to communicate with us every day, making sure we had everything we needed and giving us tips. We really enjoyed both the complimentary breakfast and the evening reception - perfect for our hungry teens. We could relax with an early evening swim and snack before deciding what to have for dinner, or just get some bar food by the pool. Although there were a lot of people at times, it never felt crowded while we were there, partly due to the smiling nature and efficiency of the staff.

I have probably experienced about 20 stays here since this property opened. Rooms: Spacious, clean and well maintained. Nearly all the rooms offer a nice view - most of the rooms offer some glimpse of the ocean. This property has held up really well over the years. They stock the rooms with beach towels, which is great.Service: Outstanding - everyone from the Bellman, to the desk staff, to the cleaning people are full of aloha and tremendously friendly and helpful.Food: Best Embassy suites breakfast offering both standard American Embassy Suites breakfast, but always with local/Japanese options as well. They also regularly have terrific local fruit offerings like pinapple and on occassion, papaya. Breakfast is really crowded so pay attention to the literature in your room on peak periods for breakfast. Even during peak times though, the staff do a decent job of keeping things moving. The service staff are tremendously efficient and courteous in constantly clearing plates and making space. Beverage station has a great selection of tropical juices. Location: This property is 1 block from the beach, and away from the craziness of Kalakaua St. It is fairly serene by Waikiki standards. Lots of really great dining options nearby on both the Waikiki Beachwalk and Royal Hawaii Shopping Center, both of which are a block away. There is an extra large ABC store across the street that has great hot food service and a deli, along with the usual ABC store souvenirs and sundry items. Amenities: Average fitness center with a dumbell rack and lots of cardio machines. Extra large outdoor pool which has a lot of kids. Getting poolside lounge chairs can be a challenge during peak periods.

Not blaming the hotel, more lack of parental supervision (again, busy Christmas week). Biggest issue with this hotel is lack of elevators.

I may be spoiled, but I give this property a C-. I list our pros and cons below:Pros: They did have a suite available that fit our family of 6 (albeit tightly). We didn't want to split up into separate rooms, and suites are not easy to find in the heart of Waikiki.We could see the ocean from our room, but our view was partially obstructed by buildings (in spite of paying for a full ocean view room)Location - this property is in the heart of the action, walking distance to the beach, Starbucks, and the Waikiki Beach Walk Shops and Restaurants. This is the hotel's best feature.Generous breakfast buffet (with cooked to order omelets) and happy hour reception nightly at the pool at 5:30-7:30 is included and offers good value for filling up your family without additional expense. Cons:Check in was chaotic and staff seemed frazzled but they did their best. We were offered fresh juice at check in, but the staff was less warm than we expected for our first taste of Waikiki. The best staff members were the bell captain and valet guys. This place was is LOUD - it was packed with families with little kids (maybe not so much if you don't come during Christmas like we did). If you like the hustle and bustle of Times Square or Disney Cruises, you will probably love it but I found the pool and common areas less than peaceful. I escaped to the Outrigger's Starbucks each morning at 5am for some peace and quiet. People are everywhere.Someone pulled an alarm in the middle of the night! That's not the management's fault, necessarily, but they made loud announcements in multiple languages to let guests know there was no fire. Each room received an apology letter the next day. I know they did their best, but I couldn't wait to leave that place.Small pool and fitness center for the number of guests using it. Maybe that's the norm in Waikiki?Maybe it's me, but this place just did not wow me - especially at more than $900 a night! It was a rough start to our Hawaiian vacation.

We thought being off-beach might be a hassle but quite the contrary! The value was outstanding for what we got here--big room, free hot breakfast, free evening cocktail reception, great pool/hot tub, nice gym, etc. The hotel charges a high (but normal for the area) $40/night for parking (valet only, no self parking available).

A special shout out to Resty, Rodrigo and Aldrin who always welcomed us with a smile and, even though it's a self-serve buffet, always came around to see if we needed anything and if there was anything they could bring us. They made the stay all that much more enjoyable. This time we lucked out with a room overlooking the pool and we also had a view of the ocean, the beach and Fort DeRussey park. The room was great, we went with my parents and the four of us so they had the room with the king bed, one of our sons slept on the hide-a-bed in the living room and my husband and I and our other son shared the 2 queen bed room.

Decided to switch from Hilton Hawaiian Village as we had 3 kids and were able to secure a 1 bedroom here. Emailed hotel beforehand and they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom, which was amazing as 2 of our kids are under 3 years old. The rooms weren't that big, but more than adequate. Free breakfast was a huge plus, and the pool has a small little kid's section where my 2 year olds could stand, which was great for them. Loved the free happy hour each night as well. It was a lot of Hilton Points at 70K a night (I believe it's even higher now at 75K), but in the end we definitely got our moneys worth. No resort fee either which was nice. 1 block from the beach, so very close walk. Also close to shops, pharmacy, etc. Would definitely return.

It’s a very nice hotel, especially for families. We booked the two queen bed suite, which actually comes with an additional sofa bed in the hall. This allows for some privacy and space for a larger group of people. Most hotels in Honolulu do not include breakfast when you book the rooms. This hotel does. It’s said to be a “made to order” breakfast. What is actually made here is your eggs, whether it’s the sunny side up or omelette. The rest (yogurt, fruits, soup, coffee and juices) are available buffet style. The crowd in the breakfast area can be overwhelming, and guests are notified about this in the room. A rough “traffic” guide is mentioned based on the time of the day.There is an additional meal with the room, which is the daily manager’s reception between 6.30 to 8.30 pm. This is a poolside reception with cocktails and light bites. On certain days, there is a band that plays good music. This is a good way to wind down after an outing and then have dinner later, if needed. The reception counter is good, and check-in smooth. However, as in most 5-star hotels, it’s a bit impersonal. Nobody really notes your movements in and out. Laundry service is available at the 3rd floor with dryer services as well, all at a good rate. The beach is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Guests are allowed to borrow towels from the pool area and return it later. The pool is not very big, but adequate. It has a wading pool and a jacuzzi. There is a “travel” counter at the entrance. I would like to mention that this “travel” counter isn’t very good. Sorry guys, but I have to say this. When I asked for shuttle services to Waikele, they were not very helpful. This when actually, there is a shuttle service at the Royal Hawaiian Avenue, which I noted a few days later.

We then had an early tea approx. 4.30 (as some restaurants were very busy, so the earlier the better), we didn't even feel like lunch in between & just had nibbles by the pool.Our suites both had a bar fridge to store your drinks & also tea & coffee facilities.Both suites were very quiet but only negative this time was the wait for the lifts but due to how busy it was, was understandable & if we had to be somewhere by a certain time we just left a couple of minutes earlier.We definitely will be back again & highly recommend","Wollongong, Australia",29,5.0

It's also close to the main strip of shops & restaurants on Kalakaua avenue and near convenience stores like ABC and long drugs. The room is really spacious, we were able to get a room with two queen beds and it was really comfortable.

I was very disappointed to find our room was the one behind the lifts (632) but don't like complaining so stuck it out.The first night was fine as we were very tired but after that most nights were a constant rumble of lift noise - kind of like a distant thunder storm. Maybe I should have requested a move?The room was very clean and we had a great view over the pool deck. It was a little disappointing to find no kitchen utensils except 2 glasses and 2 cups. With the small kitchen in the room it would have been nice to have some cutlery and plates. I may have missed information that said we could request these. The breakfast provided was fine although very busy and difficult to get a table some mornings so after a couple of days we didn't go back. The omelet station is a great idea but the lengthy queues were discouraging. The drinks and music at night were enjoyable the night we went and the band was great.

We saved so much money and time from having this. Even better was the manager's reception with delicious cocktails served by the excellent barman along with light snacks. The biggest surprise was the excellent band that played Mon., Wed., Fri. and Saturday. They are so talented especially the lady singer in the band.The location is right on Lewers st. so there is alway something going on. The ABC store across the road is one of the best in Waikiki.The swimming pool and deck were beautiful, and you could always get a lounger even in the middle of the day.This comes to my only negative about the Embassy, the pool is taken over during the day by kids, with no separation and monitoring to give the adults a chance to cool down and relax. In the evening there are less kids, and you can enjoy the pool since it stays open pretty late. It there was some solution to this I would give the Embassy perfect marks.One other thing, the beach in this area though close by, is not as wide and is quite rocky compared to the area further up across from the Hyatt Regency.All in all, we had a wonderful time, and would return for sure.","Vancouver, Canada",4,4.0

For the first time of my many stays at this ES I found the room assigned to us upon check in was sub par in terms of the air conditioning problem (was88 degrees in the room) tv problem and location and size of the room. Called front desk and advised Garrick of air conditioning problem. He immediately sent mechanic to fix the problem. Told Garrick we would go to lunch to see if air conditioning improved. Lo and behold when we returned from lunch Garrick had already made arrangements to change us to a much more suitable room that reflected the quality I had been accustomed to at ES. This is the kind of personal service that sets this Waikiki hotel apart from its surrounding competitors when you include their breakfasts and happy hours. Thank you Garrick.

This hotel is located in a great spot, really close to the beach, trolley stop, and all major attractions. Also only a 3 minute walk to watch the Friday night fireworks. We had an ocean view room and the sunsets from our lanai were spectacular.The breakfast buffet is a bonus - it saves you from walking around trying to find somewhere to eat. The omelette stations were also a nice touch if you wanted something cooked fresh.The rooms itself are quite good - I wouldn't go so far as to say they are 'massive' but it's certainly handy to have the separation between the adults and the children. The cleaners did a great job of daily servicing. Afternoon drinks at the pool are also a good family bonus, particularly if you are on the way home from the beach. The pool does get very crowded, particularly with unsupervised kids - I'm surprised there are not more injuries! The 'all inclusive' price by the hotel is great, no extra costs for towels etc. if you want to go to the beach. I probably wouldn't bother with the tour desk, it's just an agency booking station (same as anywhere else in Waikiki). You will find better (and less expensive) tours with a 5 minute Google search from your hotel room. Same applies for car hire.All up, we really enjoyed this place as a family location, but if I was staying in Waikiki as a couple I'd probably look at other options.","Brisbane, Australia",83,4.0

Friendly staff and spacious suites, which is great when you have kids and appreciate the extra room a suite provides. Not so great is access to the balconies. I was a bit worried about the kids (4 and 6) opening the door and going out there, in my opinion, the child safety latches are good but not high enough, the kids could reach them, no problem. Also, we had a balcony, but you couldn’t really sit out there, they were so tiny you could not comfortably sit out there without contorting your body on a weird angle!The pool/pool area is nice but it gets full on crazy busy with the kids everywhere, especially in the afternoon. This is fine if you have kids (and even then it can be annoying having kids squirting you in the face with various pool toys), but some kid free adults might find this annoying, especially trying to relax in the spa, which is right next to the pool. Not sure if it’s possible for an adults only pool/spa area?Buffet breakfast was nice, although some variety would have been good. You can order eggs cooked to your liking (not just omelettes), which I didn’t realise until the second last day of our stay, much better than eating those disgusting scrambled, over cooked eggs provided.Managers special happy hour was great, they sure don’t scrimp on the alcohol! The queues can get quite long, although we didn’t seem to have a problem as we went to the other bar, in the corner, which not many people realised, was a lot quieter, with hardly anyone there. The band was just awesome and got the crowd fired up most nights.We stayed here during Hurricane Lane and were always kept informed of the situation by hotel management, which was reassuring.A couple of things to note, which did not impress me, overcharging on some basic services. I realise you are a business and need to make a profit but overcharging on international calls is just ridiculous and left me a bit annoyed. Over $30 US for an international call (which cost me less than $10 US in Maui the previous week) and $38 US for one night’s parking ($14 US in Maui) is just a little too steep and difficult to stomach. When questioning staff member upon checkout, shrugs her shoulders and replies “I don’t know” and in the same sentence proceeds to ask me “charge it to the credit card on file?”. Yeah, thanks, but no thanks.","Melbourne, Australia",3,4.0

Having previously stayed at other hotels in Waikiki (Marriott Courtyard, Queen Kapiolani and Outrigger Waikiki) this place is our favourite! We will definitely be coming back.The breakfast buffet is a real bonus, saving our family $100's on the overall cost of the trip. The morning breakfast and the evening reception really gives you a sense of community. If you are interested in meeting other families it's a great place to start. They give all adults a yellow band as proof you are a hotel guest, don't lose it! I heard someone asking to get another one and they were told it's a $70 replacement fee. I think if you know that ahead of time you're more careful with it. The rooms were really nice, having two rooms and two TV's was a bonus as we were travelling with 3 teenage kids (2 boys 1 girl). We thought the fold out couch would be uncomfortable, as ours is at home, but it was surprisingly comfortable. The beds were delightful, so comfortable.We were located on the 2nd floor just outside of the elevators (hey we didn't pay for a view so we didn't get one :) ) There was no noise issues whatsoever! I was surprised and pleased. Of course if you open the doors to the lanai you're going to get street noise.The hotel is located close to the beach with beautiful turtles off the breakwater. I would recommend the Hale Kona snack shack. For us it was great, we sat in a comfy chair having cocktails (both virgin and alcoholic) watching the kids in the beach. If you're a patron of the shack the chairs and shade are free! There was a hire place next door to the snack shack that you could rent floating islands (like a big thick yoga mat that floats) for $10 an hour or water bikes $25 for 1/2 an our (trust me after peddling one of these things 1/2 an hour is enough!). If you don't want to rent, go to the ABC store and buy a floating ring for $2.50 they have just as much fun with that too!When travelling around the island I would recommend taking the bus, we've been there heaps of times and have never hired a car. Our only luxury for this trip was to get a limo from the airport to the hotel. We went to Top Limousine Services, the price for a limo was comparable to a shuttle and or taxi for the 5 of us. We figured it was a nice touch, our kids were impressed as it was a surprise for them! There are plenty of restaurants nearby and you don't have to walk far to get good food or to access Ross Dress for Less (a must for families on a budget with teenagers that like name brands like Nike, Adidas and Under Armour). I would recommend that when you arrive, go to Longs Drugs and the other end of the block and get your snacks and drinks for the kids. It's cheaper there and you have more variety. The ABC store is fine too, I just preferred Longs.We didn't interact with the staff very much but ensured that we did tip, especially in the free events like breakfast and the evening reception, always take a few dollars down with you - it doesn't hurt. We never had any issues with housekeeping either. We ensured we tipped $5 every day. That ensured we had LOTS of shampoo, towels and coffee. We even got a lovely note from the housekeeper thanking us which was a nice touch.If you are considering staying at this hotel do it! We found it exception value for money with our family of 5, good rooms, good service and great location.","Bendigo, Australia",4,5.0

We love that the all rooms have a sleeping area and living area which give us space to stretch out. We loved that the kitchen had a microwave enabling us to heat up left over food from the previous nights dining for the kids when they were ‘starving’. Clean and comfortable, the room service is top notch and the amenities are of a good quality. Staff are friendly and eager to please across the board.The complimentary breakfast was a bonus. Buffet food, is buffet food and you can choose to eat the whole mass cooked variety or eat toast/bagel and fruit. I never complain about buffet breakfasts as no one ever said you had to load your plate with bacon, hash browns, scrambled ‘eggs’ and little sausages. They do have an omelette station which is a good option for fresh cooked.The evening managers reception was also a bonus. It lacks the atmosphere of a beach front bar but you’re not paying $15 a cocktail....it’s on the house. Snacks are provided. Again, nothing hugely special but you’re not paying for it. You have choices. It’s a bonus, you don’t have to partake.We ordered room service and ate in one night (pizza) which was really nice and the price was on par with going down the road to get a take away pizza.I would recommend this place to families. I don’t think it would be a place that a couple wanting romance would go. It’s a family place.We would certainly return to Embassy Waikiki.

Most of the staff are lovely (with the exception of the guy looking for wrist bands at the reception). The rooms are spacious and our view from the Hula Tower was fantastic. Comfortable beds. The rooms are getting a little tired though. This is our second stay at this hotel and it is showing its age.The breakfast was good. It got a bit repetitive though as there was not a huge variety. Omelettes were great. Just get there early to avoid the big crowds.The pool is way too small for a resort this big. It was full of kids and not what I would call super relaxing. There were kids all over the place (and I have no issue with kids... I was travelling with my kids... it was just super crowded). It is a very family oriented hotel so if you are looking for a quiet romantic adult type place to stay this is not it. Great for families though. But it’s busy. Housekeeping was ok. Not stellar. I paid extra for a “premium suite” (don’t bother, it is not worth it). I was constantly having to call to get things like our coffee refreshed because it was not done. So this was an irritant. One day our room did not get serviced at all. So we had to call and have I done while we were out for dinner. Again, not the end of the world but when you are staying somewhere this expensive you do not want to have to ask for things you paid for multiple times.Check out and check in was great. Fast and no issues.I don’t know that I will be rushing back though (unless I got a crazy good deal). ","Calgary, Canada",39,3.0

The free breakfast is the best I've ever had! The omelet bar is amazing. I also liked the cocktail hour with yummy Blue Hawaii's and a great live band, along with munchies. The rooms are quiet, the beds are soft, and bathroom is spacious. I would recommend a room on a higher level. We stayed on the 19th floor. If you can get an ocean view, this would also be good.

This is Waikiki so primarily a tourist hotel but had no problems with business needs. They welcomed me with a small glass of ice cold pineapple/fruit juice. A nice local touch. Loved the Grand Lanai with live music and appetizers and drinks in the evening on the 4th floor. Free breakfast was also at the Grand Lanai each morning (make sure you get there between 6:30 and 7:15 to beat the masses). It's Hawaii so taking advantage of relaxing outside in the beautiful weather was perfect, even taking my laptop to do some work on the Grand Lanai. This is a very solid, nice hotel but not necessarily luxurious if that's your thing. I personally have no desire to pay a few couple extra hundred $$ for luxury. It is clean and has everything you would need. Rate was pretty good compared to other hotels - a little less than $300 per night before tax. Typical Embassy Suite setup with living area and separate bedroom. If you've never stayed at an Embassy Suites, this is a great hotel for families since alll rooms are set up this way where kids and parents have their own space however small. Staff was all friendly and helpful. I used the workout room once and it was above average size (not a ""closet"" workout room like some smaller hotels) and had most equipment including several treadmills, elliptical, basic weights, etc.Tip: Ask for a room on 4th floor. This is same floor as Grand Lanai so only took me about 60 seconds from my room to breakfast or evening reception plus it was easy to take the stairs down to the street as there can be longer waits for the elevators at peak times. Location was good with easy walk to all the main shopping and restaurants in Waikiki Beach. I never had to leave in the evening to eat a nice dinner or check out the activity in Waikiki. If you do need to go some where, Uber cars are plentiful and you'll have no trouble getting one here.","Springfield, Missouri",84,5.0

We loved each of our stays and love to call this hotel our second home. Breakfast: From families to couples to solo travel, this hotel is for everyone. It's especially great for families looking for a more budget-friendly option in Waikiki Beach in the way that the hotel provides a complimentary breakfast buffet where you can order eggs in any style you'd prefer. This occurs daily and it's the best amenity the hotel provides. For families, Hawaii can be an expensive destination if one eats out every single day, but due to the free breakfast included in your room rate, you do not have to worry about spending $100 USD on breakfast, which can easily be spent in the tourist hub of Waikiki. The breakfast is fantastic, and is the best breakfast we have had in all of the Embassy Suites hotels we have been to (we have visited many). The breakfast staff is also very friendly, and I would like to say a big thank you to Rose, who is so friendly and made both of our stays extra special. There are so many choices of breakfast foods that will leave you full for the majority of the day until dinnertime.The hotel also has a nightly Manager's Reception, which is basically a happy hour with free drinks and snacks by the pool on the fourth floor (the pool area is also gorgeous with many lounge chairs to relax on). Make use of this and try a Mai Tai.Check-In: The check-in process at this hotel has always been so fast and friendly. The hotel's lobby is located right beside where you can park your vehicle via valet (costs $36 nightly but is so worth it; the staff is so friendly and brings out your car so quickly). When you check-in, you and your family receive a nice glass of guava juice which shows that you're starting your stay right.Rooms: The rooms at the Embassy Suites are lovely, and perfect for a longer stay on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. The rooms are decorated Hawaiian style, and the two-room one bedroom suite with two queen beds is where we have stayed in our last two visits. The best part of the room are the two lanais (balconies), which allow you to relax after a nice day at the beach or out exploring. City views are the best as you're able to see what is going on below you on Waikiki's Beachwalk, the nicest area of Waikiki Beach. Each room provides you with bath towels, of course, in addition to beach towels which you can use throughout your stay (new ones are added daily). The rooms are large and perfect for a Hawaiian stay.The cleaning services are amazing at this hotel; our room was always perfectly clean. I would like to mention Nu Yang, who cleaned our room for the duration of our stay. She was awesome and went above and beyond to make our stay more enjoyable.Location: This hotel is located in THE BEST PART OF OAHU: Waikiki Beach. It is less than a five-minute walk to bustling Kalakaua Ave, which is a street full of shops, restaurants and entertainment such as the Royal Hawaiian Center's frequent concerts. My family always enjoyed strolling along the street in the evening and nighttime after a lovely day at the beach or hiking. Waikiki Beach is about a ten-minute walk from the hotel, and it is such a gorgeous beach. However, I do not recommend spending your entire trip in Waikiki Beach or else you cannot say you experienced Hawaii or even the island of Oahu. The hotel's prime location, being only 20 minutes from Honolulu's International Airport and less than an hour's drive to anywhere on the island allows you to explore all that the island has to offer. Eat a hearty breakfast in the morning and head off and see the entire island. It's paradise.Without a doubt, you must visit this hotel if you are planning a trip to Oahu and the Waikiki Beach area. After an excellent two stays in the past, we know we will be back to this amazing hotel in the near future. It is one of the best hotels we've stayed at.",,12,5.0

Kalakaua to me IS Waikiki Beach. The shops, restaurants and beach on that stretch is what I know and love. But then I discovered that I was just a short 10 min walk to the center of Kalakaua ave where the Market is (more on the market later, so much has changed) and was relieved. BUT THEN (yes, again) I discovered the beach access point directly across the street from this hotel and was VERY happy with the view of MY Diamond Head from the beach! You can see more of it than you can from the other part of the beach which is accessed via Kalakaua! AND it felt private!! The hotel is GREAT. Rooms are cozy (if you care for views, I'd spring for a room with a nice view). We had a 1 bedroom king suite and it was very nice! The showers are gooood. Daily breakfast buffet was delish, some of the options changed daily and was a nice surprise! And who doesn't love an omelette station? 2 stations and the lines moved fast (I would go between 8 and 9 am). Also the FREE happy hour nightly reception with the live band is a very nice touch. This hotel definitely makes you feel like you are appreciated, welcome and provides that vacation feel. Here, you'll be close to everything and the grounds are beautiful! They did take a while one day to get to our room to clean it. But we didn't care about that. We ran into one of the housekeepers in the hall, she was super apologetic about not getting to our room yet, but we just grabbed some fresh towels and toiletries and told her not to worry! The rest of our days, they were on point and we had a clean room every time we came back to it.","Bronx, New York",17,5.0

Upon check in we were greeted with guava juice that was refreshing after a long flight. Carrie was an awesome manager at the front desk who took good care of us and even texted each day to ask if we need anything. You’ll usually get that kind of service in hotels if you are a high roller our platinum club member. Not at Embassy Suites Beachwalk in Waikiki; everyone is greeted that way. After a few days there they remember you by name and it’s like passing by friends on your way out. Our maid Nena was awesome! Anything we requested on our notepad she fulfilled; extra towels, shampoos, lotions. Even the cooks and busboys at our free full breakfast and waitresses are pleasantly friendly and hospitable. The bell and especially the valet guys and gals were all awesome! I cannot find any flaws at this hotel other than our stay was too short. And my family all know me to be very picky! Because of this we are planning on coming back again and again! Maybe even holding our family reunion there. Thank You Embassy Suites for a wonderful Hawaiian experience for me and my family! Keep up that great work! And just a side note: please people, tip your waiters, waitresses, valets, etc. Hawaii is expensive to live in, These wonderful people don’t get paid enough for their hard work to make you happy.

The children were also very satisfied with the pool, from the 4th floor poolside, the fireworks which can be launched from Hilton Rainbow Village on Friday 20: 00 could be seen well.

We had been traveling around Canada and looking forward to the last leg of the trip, that changed on arrival. I had requested a floor higher up well they directed us to a room on the bottom floor that looked out to the back lane with all the food trucks on top of that the room smelt mouldy had a small window I couldn't even believe it was a guest room and we where staying nine nights. Within minutes I contacted reception asking to be changed which they did to another room that was on the other side looking out to the abc store. This was a huge improvement although not great. The catch was we could stay in here for a night then they would change us to a better room again on the third night. Apparently this room the abc room was booked out the next night. So we moved twice in two nights couldn't unpack moved our own suit cases it could only get better and thank god the third room was what we wanted. The rooms are now dated and need an upgrade they haven't really changed in years. The breakfast was so so the chef is the only thing that saves it. The place was packed I am sure people come in that are not guests, eg guests friends nobody checks this at breakfast and free cocktail time at night.

Complimentary cocktails and nibbles for 2 hours each evening - well worth the effort!The pool area is great to cool off and relax but is fairly small and was busy!! The gym is very small and extremely stuffy - so if you want to use it I would suggest going outside of peak morning hours. We stayed in their 2 bedroom suites which were basically adjoining rooms - but perfect for what we needed. They also extended the check out time which was great. I would definitely recommend joining their Loyalty scheme prior and you can get early check-in and late check-out on request.A great stay, perfect location and we will return when we holiday again in Hawaii!","Melbourne, Australia",14,4.0

The overall property is very nice and is in a great location in Waikiki. I did notice that the staff at the reservation desks, while friendly, were also hurried and stressed. I did not get a warm, island-welcome feeling that you expect from a trip to Hawaii, but rather felt more like I was staying in downtown Manhattan. It felt more like we entered a big assembly line. On checkout day, we truly needed a late checkout time due to our flight schedule, but after repeated requests - and even as a Hilton Honors member - they repeatedly said no and made no effort to accommodate the requests. I recommend that they increase their staff and show a bit more flexibility. One exception is with the housekeeping and breakfast-buffet staff, who were extremely friendly and accommodating. Again, their location is great and the overall property is nice, but a more friendly, humble, and human approach with guests would make a big difference.","St. Louis, Missouri, United States",4,3.0

Our booking included four buffet breakfast and four evening reception. First of all I must interpolate here to say that the receptionist was really friendly and helpful. She was Lorena. We went very early in order to leave our luggage with the bell boy before we could check in at 3 pm. It was then just at about 8 am. Lorena checked us in and informed me she would try to give us the rooms as soon as possible. She also allowed us to have free buffet breakfast. At about 11.12 am,Oren’s texted to inform me our suite was ready for us. The suite consisted of one two queen sized beds bedroom, one super king size bed bedroom, one lounge, one kitchenette and two toilets and two entrance doors. The rooms were spacious, clean and cosy. There were three balconies with ocean view. The house keepers were very good. We never ran short of amenities like toilets paper hand tissues and tooth paste as there was abundant reserve. Honestly I never experienced this albeit I’m a frequent picky traveler. The location of the hotel was very good. It is almost in the central Waikiki. However the quality and variety of food for breakfast were not acceptable to me. It was very basic consisting of steamed rice, bacons, sausages, chips, salads, two egg stations for omelettes and fried eggs, basic cereals, basic local fruits and basic toast and muffins. There was no cappuccino or flat white but just normal coffee and tea. The food for breakfast were exactly same during our four nights’ stay. The plates were not dry with water still in them. We had to wipe them on dry tissues. The two egg stations were too busy all the time. The wait was at least 15 minutes. The eating area was fairly big but very congested as there were too many people. There were lots of birds there. They would eat your breakfast before you if you left it unattended on the table. You should fully cover it up with a piece of tissue paper. I personally was very disgusted by the birds as they might spread disease if we ate the food contaminated by them. The evening complimentary reception was crap, just chips, raw red carrots and cauliflowers and cheap drink. They served alcoholic drink on plastic cups. I would prefer not to have a glass of complimentary beer or wine than to give a dollar tip! The swimming pool was small, only good for children. ","Sibu, Malaysia",73,4.0

What is wrong with me?There are several people at the pool who are extremely friendly. They appreciate and recognize customers who frequent the hotel. Dennis, Keolu, Shane, Daniel, and PeLani (I’m sorry- I know I spelled some names wrong) and a couple others that I don’t know their names, are amazing and great examples of customer service. The hotel management needs to focus on hiring more employees like them. Now they have arm bands they make you wear to happy hour and breakfast. I have two issues with this. 1) they advertise where you are staying - I’m not interested in giving free advertising to them - but really it is a safety issue. I’m female. Anyone sees it on my arm outside the hotel and they know where I am staying. Yes I know I can take it off. But that leads to issue two. 2). They do not have multiple sizes and it was tight on my husbands arm. He took it off and forgot it in the car. The front desk wouldn’t give him another one and made him get it out of the car which was valet parked! This was hugely inconvenient. There is a woman who stands at the pool and she questions everyone. She is super rude about it and acts like everyone is trying to sneak in to the pool. The first night I was already at the pool with my arm band and I had my husbands in my purse waiting for him. She escorted him over to me to make sure he had an armband. She makes me uncomfortable and she is the main reason I probably won’t stay there again. I appreciate not allowing non guests to use the facility but it is a problem when the person doing that makes guests feel unwelcome. ",,18,1.0

Firstly, you don't just get a room, you get a suite, so a seperate area for socialising. I really liked this, particularly as we did a 12 night stay here during April, 2017. The hotel is very close to everything, walking distance to beach, shops, dining and also to access the little buses that take you everywhere. As breakfast is included it really makes for a great way to save money. On a couple of mornings we decided to eat out and the minimum cost for a sit down, cooked breakfast for two at venues nearby was around $100 - so it really pays to eat your breakfast at the hotel. Breakfast if buffet style with plenty of options to choose from. The Happy Hour (which is actually 2 hours) is very generous. And when they say happy hour, they mean you don't pay anything. Having said that, I felt it was only right to tip the bartender. They also mix the drinks pretty strong!

He called them and made all of the arrangements during Hawaii time. He even got us in at a restaurant that was not available when I was trying to book it online! The prices were the same as if I did it on my own. This really was a huge help in planning our vacation.

The evening drinks were surprisingly good and as well as a selection of lurid cocktails there were reasonable wines and a gin and tonic (and other spirits) available. The breakfast unfortunately was an evil selection of plastic wrapped apples (why?), white bread of the cheapest variety, sugary cereal, sugary drinks, hot but not boiling water for tea and syrup and oatmeal that Goldilocks would declare- too tasteless and too much like warm wallpaper paste.

The location is great, very central. The pool area is excellent for little ones and the Manager's Reception is a great touch.We wont be staying here again, though, for the following reasons:1. The air conditioning units need a clean, or something. My partner and I were both completely congested after one night here and remained so for the duration of our stay. It eased in the fresh air.2. The breakfast options are very limited and we couldn't find anything we'd eat for ourselves or our daughter so it was a waste (I'm sure it hasn't changed since the 80s). We come from Melbourne, where there is an abundance of really fresh, healthy foods, and this was not that. Soy or almond milk was a non starter.3. Very noisy- the band play a few times a week and if you want to put little ones down and have a pool facing room it's just not possible. Granted they were done by 8pm the couple of nights they played when we were there, but speaking to other guests it didnt stop until 10pm the night before we arrived (perhaps ask for a room facing away from the pool to avoid this, but then you'll miss the view and seeing the Friday night fireworks).4. The lack of kitchen facilities- there is a microwave, bar fridge and kettle. No way to cook your own meals, which is hard when you're struggling to find fresh healthy food in the area.5. The sofa bed, which my partner and I slept on was horribly hard and squeaked every time we moved, waking us).

It's not on the beach but it's only a 5 minute walk and Starbucks is on the way which is great. Pool is quite small and not very deep, more suited to children. It can get very busy in the afternoons so we didn't use very much, maybe a couple of times. Afternoon cocktails were a nice bonus and there is even entertainment.

I was expecting a more tropical vibe with beautiful flowers and brightly colored homes I guess Maui would have been a better choice for that. As for our hotel choice Embassy Suites rocks. We arrived around 1pm and checked in with Cindy who was very friendly and helpful, she gave my daughter who was celebrating her bday the following day a box of chocolates and cookies and upgraded our room (thank you again). The first room we had (prior to the upgrade) was in the aloha tower on the 18th floor, the suite was comfortable but a little small. The upgraded room was a nice large suite in the hula tower with an ocean view from the Living area and a street view from the bedroom. I didn't notice much of a difference between the two towers just different views depending on the suite you get. The only negative was the bed pillows they were too soft for my taste, a pillow menu would have been nice or at least have firmer pillows available. The fact that there are no resort fees, free daily breakfast buffet and nightly managers reception with free drinks(awesome) this in my opinion gives you the best bang for the buck of the other hotels I considered.

Also, walk the beach at night, one it is beautiful, and two, people also leave things behind because they are flying out the next day. Pool area is wonderful along with the happy hour. Note there are two bars. The far bar the fish pond usually doesn't have a long line. Drinks are wonderful along with the snacks each night. Great way to save money while in Hawaii. As for the breakfast, it is amazing! Great flow to move people through quickly. Made to order omelets/egg station is spectacular! Again there are two lines, go to the far side. Both sides are the same, just less people. Location is wonderful. Close to beach, shopping, and restaurants. Would definitely stay again! Note: Friday night fireworks are easily visualized in the pool area by the far bar. No need to leave and avoid the crowds while enjoying a drink.",,7,5.0

It is tastefully decorated, clean has 2 balconies to relax on.In the room it has a small kitchen with a coffee machine, kettle, sink and a microwave- no utensils or cups. The small fridge lacks a freezer compartment, so we had to eat a whole tub of ice cream in one fell swoop!There are not many hotels in Hawaii that offer free breakfast, so this was a bonus. The breakfast lasts for about 3 hours and caters for most tastes- Asian, western, yoghurt, fruit, eggs, pancakes, donuts, pastries cereals and you can have as much as you want.The pool - which includes a spa- is quite large which rarely gets crowded and is also the area where they have happy hour (5:30-7:30) where it gets very busy. Happy hour provides free drinks - beer, wine spirits , soft drinks and some snacks.Local buses are 100m away to take you to the ala Moana shopping centre or wiekele outlet stores - $5.50 for adults $2.50 children - all day or it’s a$10 Uber drive both ways.All in all great value for money - we paid $256usd per night and would highly recommend if you’re not looking for a self catering holiday in Waikiki.Off to Maui now!

Location is good, it’s a short 5min walk to the beach, DeRussy Park, Beachwalk is right in front with lots of shops, and dining options, Kalakaua Rd, International Market Place 10-15min walk. Roys and Denny’s is right downstairs. ABC Store across the road. It is however a very busy family hotel. At 6am, the excited kids are already up and screaming.The room options on the online check-in app was very average and all located at noisy busy areas, all by the elevator, by the ice and vending machines and on the corridor to the pool and breakfast area. Having no idea what our Lanai would be looking at, only choice was a room in the Hula tower (many reviewers recommended over the Aloha tower).The first room (4th floor) was dismal, view was to a neighboring hotel (their lanais looked into our lanais and room!), way too close to the street, no privacy. I took this up with the Registration desk (which is oddly located at the driveway of the hotel and did not feel welcoming), front desk staff were also not welcoming at all. Smiles were few and far between, nor was there any warmth nor friendliness. No acknowledgement of HH member. She did change the room for me to the 5th floor (this room did not come up as an option on the HH app). This room had a pool view but it also looked into the breakfast area, it was next to the elevator, vending and ice machine. I felt like we got given one of the worst rooms in the hotel. Pool being on the 4th floor, the 5th floor room was not much better. I just gave up. There was no offer for an upgrade (as HH Gold member) or even option to pay extra for a better room. She gave us our free bottles of water. Note: 2 x bottled water once only at check-in at this hotel. Many others like Hampton and Hilton we have stayed at give you free water every day.The first room on the 4th floor felt cramped and dark. The 5th floor room itself was clean but it is very dated and noisy but comfortable. Good size for 3 of us. Sofa bed was already made up with sheets, blankets and extra pillows in the cupboard. Beach towels and beach bag provided in the room. Neutrogena toiletries. Room was noisy next to the ice machine whirring and rumbling away, or maybe it was the AC or perhaps the elevator??. For a hotel where beach and pool are the main activities, puzzles me why these hotels do not provide drying racks to dry your swim gear, more so, when this hotel has lanais. I pre-requested extra towels and bathmat but none were provided. Only Valet parking available. I must say they were quick in getting your vehicle. Valet, Bell and breakfast staff were nice and friendly, not so much Front Desk. Disappointing as it is one of the first things a guest has to experience when checking in to a hotel, puzzling why hotels do not make the effort to make it a good experience for the guest.Buffet breakfast was included in the room rate. Selections were the usual fare, omelet station, bacon, sausages, etc. cereals (+gluten free), pancakes, toast, juices, coffee, no waffles. Busy hotel, breakfast is very busy, even at 7am! Breakfast staff were friendly and very helpful. One morning I was by myself, and it was busy, they helped reserve me a table.Pool is quite small, mainly for the kids. There is a spa also. There were some quieter lounge chairs. There is a bar by the pool. There is also happy hour with band music.  Having read so many good reviews about this hotel, I’m disappointed and unlikely to stay again. I’m also wondering if this rates highly, then are the other hotels in Waikiki worse?? I think we might stay away from Waikiki!","Melbourne, Australia",33,2.0

Although it's not quite ""beachfront""--nor a ""resort""--we had a terrific partial ocean view from our very spacious King Suite in the Hula Tower, just minutes from the beach. I've always loved the room sizes and free breakfast at Embassy Suites, and would rate this hotel 4 stars. Here are my pros and cons:PROS:- BREAKFAST! The spread here is impressive indeed, with made-to-order omelettes, potatoes, tropical fruits, salad, miso soup, and a wide variety of beverages. There is something for everyone, and the lines were never too long.- Room size: Our King Suite was extremely spacious, with a large lanai (balcony) that went around the entire room.- Location: Although it's not technically ""beachfront"" property, it's about as close as one can get without abutting Waikiki. Great access to restaurants and other resorts, and a Roy's on site!CONS:- Parking is somewhat expensive and slow--and a bit of a hassle. We used the valet service, which cost almost $40/day. I'm not sure there were other options.- Housekeeping threw away a bag of groceries we had bought one night, which included some over-the-counter medicine. Although the front desk was apologetic, all they offered in return was one day's worth of parking fees. This mishap is what's stopping me from giving the hotel 5 stars, as I didn't feel like the front desk agent was particularly sympathetic.- Afternoon pupus were disappointing: We were expecting real, home-cooked finger foods--perhaps even some local grinds--but to our chagrin were greeted with nacho chips and goldfish. That said, they did have a live band one night during the Happy Hour.Overall, I would definitely stay here again. It's a family friendly hotel that's a bit smaller than some of the larger resorts nearby (Outrigger, Hilton Hawaiian Village, etc.), but it's newer--and the rooms more spacious--as well. Five stars for the room and location; four for the service (which was friendly but slow).","San Francisco, California",17,4.0

Embassy Suites was a great solution that still fit the budget. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, living room and a small double deck with partial beach views - pretty tough to complain about. The location on BeachWalk was absolutely ideal. Steps from the beach, great restaurants and shopping. The 4th floor pool and activities area pushed this hotel over the top. There is a daily breakfast buffet - fruit, cereal, omelettes, bacon etc. Start your day with this and you don’t feel hungry until 4. Every evening the manager’s reception takes place by the pool. Light snacks and complimentary drinks. Think about that. Free breakfast and free drinks - yep, that keeps a few dollars in your pocket for souvenirs.

I re-booked at this property because it was so much better than the Hilton Hawaiian Village stay we had previously, and I was again not disappointed.We were arriving very early in the morning (8AM) and had emailed the hotel in advance to request early check in if available. Imagine my surprise to be granted an upgraded room (partial ocean larger than usual; am an Hhonors Gold) which was totally unexpected and really made this second stay even more remarkable than the first; the room was ready on arrival. We were greeted with some complimentary beverages and provided breakfast coupons for that day and the remainder of our stay. The breakfasts have everything you could ever want, and the managers reception at night offers complimentary beverages (both adult and regular) . Everything is in walking distance.

Staff was very friendly and courteous and our room was ready. Nice and clean. The bed was good (not too soft, although everyone is different) and the AC unit kept things nice and cool. We originally thought we might be in for some noise with the patio doors being right on the 4th floor to the pool, but did not have any issues with noise from that area. (Between rooms was a different story but mostly due to yelling/screaming children late at night and in the morning). Oh well, we should be up by 8:00 a.m. anyway I guess. hahaThe free breakfast was very good, I thought. They posted a little sign in the room telling you when ""prime"" hours were, although we didn't seem to notice an issue regardless of when we went (sometimes as late as 9:30). There was always a place to sit at. The only crowd was around the omelette station, but only when you had one person getting like 4 omelletes, othewise the lime moved pretty quickly. No mimosas, unfortunately (haha). But you could get juice and take it back to your room and have some (not sure if you could bring your bottle to the table or not).The pool was warm and the chairs comfortable. Lots of kids though (when we were there--your mileage may vary) so it was a little busy.The evening reception had a nice variety of snacks, usually a vegetable of some sort (broccoli, carrots, sliced zuchinni and dip) and then chips and pretzels and things. The one bartender (sorry I don't recall his name) is excellent. Strong pours/drinks and he was so fast it was like watching the Matrix. The pupu's/appetizer menu was decently priced and pretty decent as well.The location is quite nice as Roy's is on the 1st floor (had dinner and lunch there, it was so good). And the beach walk is right there as well.Walk across the street, turn right and walk a block or so and turn left and there's the start/end of Waikiki beach.I would definitely stay here again if I'm ever in Honolulu again (even though I own at Hilton Grand Vacation's Club).

Sort of like a subway noise. I assume this problem exists in the same room on every floor. I went down to reception the next morning to explain our problem and ask for a room change. I was asked no questions about the issue nor offered any apology, which makes me think it's a common complaint. I was told we couldn't be moved till the following day and then would have to pack up and store our luggage by 11am then come back at 3pm to check into our new room.

No, it wasn't a spectacular selection but there was good food and they switched it up every day and really, the convenience of it was worth every penny. It was so nice not to have to gather everyone up and head out to a restaurant every morning. The free manager's reception every night was just mind-boggling. All that free alcohol and snacks every night!! How can you beat that?!The room itself was amazing! So clean and had all the amenities you could ask for.

Everyone working at the Embassy Suites was friendly, helpful and willing to bend over backwards to make our stay a good one (which they succeeded in doing). A big shout out to the bartenders, Keola, Dennis and Lewis who always made our boys laugh and to Pi'ilani who was just the nicest person I've ever met. To stay that happy and friendly while taking all the tourists' orders every night takes a very special person. The pool was rather large for a pool in Waikiki and we made good use of its hot tub. There was even poolside service if you wanted to eat or drink which was an added bonus. The food was a few dollars more than at a restaurant but the portions were huge and it was VERY good.The only two minor cons that we have was that we found the live music to be a bit too loud (only 3 nights a week though) and the wifi really is awful.

Surrounded by plenty of other hotels and an almost infinite number of shops and restaurants. There is a lot to like about the embassy suites and the near by area. I can’t recall the offical check in time but our room was available when we check ed in at around 13:00. The check in process was efficient and welcome drinks were provided which was very refreshing. In just a few minutes we were issued identification slips for every guest as well as a room key which is required for the elevator. This I’m afraid was probably the biggest problem of the entire hotel. Two elevators for 20+ floors is simply not enough and the wait times were a bit of a nuisance. While the speed of the elevator ride wasn’t slow it was the waiting time that frustrated myself and other guests I interacted with when waiting for an elevator. There was a positive side to the elevator however.I always like the idea of needing your room card for the elevator as it gives you an extra sense of security and I wish more places would implement this system.For people like me who like to walk the emergency exit stairs was definitely a better option but we were on the eighth floor so I’m not sure I’d say the same thing if we were on the twentieth floor. Once we got out of the lift I noticed an ice dispenser. Ice dispensers can be found on every floor with soda machines on alternate floors. This is useful as the tap water in the room wasn’t that cold. Once we got in the room my initial impression was that it’s quite small. This impression never changed which is strange as the name of the hotel suggested the rooms were all supposedly suites. Travelling all over the world I know what to expect from a standard room and a suite and this was barely the size of a standard room in a city hotel. I must say we were unfortunate to be at the end of the hallway by the emergency stairs which cut off some of the size of the room. Immediately on the right was your usual tea and coffee making facilities with a fridge underneath the bench.The room consisted of a lounge with a separate bedroom and bathroom. The lounge had a sofa bed which a five footer would have hardly fit into so being a six footer I slept diagonally across the bed and just managed to fit. There was a television that appeared to be about 30 inches which was identical to the television in the bedroom. There was plenty of seating in the lounge area but there was almost no room once the sofa bed is folded down. There was an air conditioning unit in both the lounge and bedroom which was convenient. Our room had a balcony that was of reasonable size but the view was nothing notable. In the bedroom there were two queen beds with plenty of pillows and a wardrobe. The bathroom consisted of a shower over the bath which was surprisingly small and appeared only to be about a foot high. I didn’t use it but could see that it probably wouldn’t be great due to its size. There were adequate amenities, shower and beach towels for each guest and a standard toilet of course. There was only one sink and plenty of hand soap and flannels provided.There was a desk which would be useful if you need to work along with complimentary unlimited Wi-Fi which is almost becoming standard worldwide but I’m still grateful for it. Small features such as a safe and luggage rack could also be found.While the room had everything you’d want it was quite small so we preferred to spend more time out of it and luckily embassy suites has the facilities to cater for this. On the fourth floor there is a dining area beside the pool and the bar. This of course was a very desirable place to spend time. The buffet breakfast is served here every morning and a decent spread but definitely fell short of European and Asian buffet breakfasts in my opinion. While it had your usual pastries, cooked food and cereal. The variety wasn’t great and the quality wasn’t that satisfying either. However there was still enough to choose from and the highlight was probably the made to order eggs which were of high quality. The breakfast was included in the room rate so I’d say it’s still worth it but I most certainly have had better buffet breakfast many times. The pool wasn’t that big and we didn’t use it due to the fact the beach is nearby. The pool was often over crowded and the deck chairs were often fully occupied especially around complimentary food and drink time. This occurred on a daily basis between 1730 and 1930 and included a whole range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Alcoholic drinks were available at the bar but there was usually a long queue while there were self serve soft drinks.The food included snacks such as pretzels and nachos so perfectly adequate for a pre-dinner snack.Obviously this is an opportunity not to be missed as could be seen by the crowd in the dining area at this time. Every alternate night there was also live music at this time. Other features of the embassy suites worth noting is the facilities on the third floor. This included a laundry room and a gym. The gym had a decent amount of equipment in a small area. This along with low ceilings made it the most claustrophobic gym I’ve ever been in. Once on the treadmill a six footer like me is barely a foot from the ceiling. The flow of air wasn’t that great either making it the hardest experience I’ve ever had in a gym. So definitely not the normal gym environment. Luckily the gym was never that busy when I used it otherwise it would have felt very squished . The equipment was all good quality and none of if it looked very old. There was no major gym equipment missing so most people would be satisfied with what’s on offer. The laundry was next to the gym and had several washing machines and dryers and only cost a few dollars to complete your laundry. On the ground floor there was a concierge which was very useful for booking tours all over the island. From pearl harbour to boat trips there was plenty of choice. Overall this was a very cool place to stay for a weeks vacation. The surrounding area and all the facilities at the embassy suites meant you could always be easily occupied. Even though the rooms were small it didn’t really matter as we didn’t come on vacation to stay in our hotel room. I would recommend to all those on vacation in this area as it has an excellent location. I will definitely consider embassy suites next time I’m in Waikiki but would opt for a larger room.","Auckland Central, New Zealand",25,4.0

It’s not as comprehensive or luxurious as a buffet you’d see at the Fairmont or anything but it’s included with your stay so it’s hard to complain about that. There are made to order omelettes available which are good, and always bacon, sausage, fruit etc. The evening happy hour was nice and there is a good live band a few days a week so we enjoyed that.

We arrived in Honolulu on an early morning flight & got to the hotel around 7:30 am. The hotel check-in is not until 3:00 pm & the hotel was happy to securely store our luggage until our room was ready. Although the hotel rates include complimentary buffet breakfast, our free breakfast does not really commence until the next morning but they gave us extra breakfast that morning. After breakfast, we strolled down Fort DeRussy beach & park which is across the road. A beautiful beach & park! We also walked around Kalakaua Road & downtown Waikiki while waiting for our room to be ready. Kalakaua Road is the main shopping road in the heart of waikiki is around the corner from the hotel, around 3-5 minutes walk from Waikiki Beach Walk which is where the hotel is. We stayed at the Aloha tower so our hotel room view was the Waikiki Beach Walk side and our balconies are directly over the Beach walk shows & performance area.They called me on my mobile phone & had our room ready at 2 pm. I requested the hotel to provide us with two queen beds after I booked a room with a king bed. They didn’t disappoint & gave us what we requested.The complimentary buffet breakfast is a great plus with the hotel. There is an omelette station where the chef will cook it on the spot. There’s a good assortment of bread, streaky bacon & alternates of french toast, pancakes, sausages & chorizo patties. For a family with two grown big boys, the buffet breakfast most definitely saved us money & the boys had satisfied full tummy before we go on our daily hawaiian adventures. The daily managers reception happy hour is a wonderful touch, with good complimentary cocktails & snacks. There is a band performing at happy hour monday, wednesday & friday. The complimentary Wi-fi is fantastic & there is no resort fees.There are a lot of restaurants to choose within a minute going downstairs or a few more minutes walking downtown. There were some nights we stayed in after a full tiring day so we bought poke’ bowls, chicken soup & hotdogs from the big ABC store across the road at Waikiki beachwalk. This ABC store actually have a good range of food/dishes they cook on site.Our room/suite was spacious, the beds are comfortable. Bathroom is clean & housekeeping are done daily & well. Housekeeping provided us with generous toiletries. Any requests were done immediately. I could not really fault this hotel at all and is very satisfied & happy with both the location & services! The hotel staff are always happy to help. Even the tours I booked separately have their pick up location at the Outrigger Hotel across the road which was really convenient! Oh, the guava juice they serve at check in to welcome us was a nice touch!There is a trolley stop we go to to get to Ala Moana Centre at Trump hotel & the Post Office at Saratoga road which is a street away from the Reception side street of the Embassy Suites. I’m happy to recommend this hotel to anyone who wants be in the heart of downtown Waikiki where the beach, shopping & restaurants are conveniently handy within minutes!

Overall, we would rate it as excellent. We booked a 1 bedroom suite and upon check-in they ""upgraded"" us to a corner suite on a high floor which was great. The room had really good views of the city and also looked out towards the ocean from some windows. The room was well equipped with a mini fridge, living room area, multiple TVs and a dining table. We especially liked that it had 2 full bathrooms. As well, it was quite spacious compared to other placed we've stayed at in Waikiki. We thought the included daily breakfast was quite good, with a decent assortment of choices as well as the made-to-order omelette stations. The location of the hotel is also very good as it is close to basically everything in Waikiki and located on a nice and safe street (Beachwalk).What really stood out at this hotel was the quality of the staff. Everyone from the valet parking staff, to the front desk, breakfast staff and housekeeping were excellent and friendly. In just over a week at the hotel, we literally did not come across a single employee who was not friendly and wanting to help.The only suggestion we have for improvement would be the cleanliness of the outside of the windows in the hotel room. As noted, we had an excellent view but the outside of the windows were really in need of cleaning which distracted from the view somewhat (mainly during the day). To be clear, the cleanliness of our room itself was great and there was no issue whatsoever with even the inside of the windows - it was purely the sides of the windows which face outside.We would 100% stay here again on future visits to Hawaii.","Calgary, Canada",42,5.0

As we were going to be doing a lot of errands we did rent a car, and finding the property the first time was an experience. There are a lot of one-way roads around the hotel, and the entrance isn't that well marked off the street. Parking was valet-only and $38 a night, which seemed a little steep. However, the valet staff was wonderful and we never spent more than a couple minutes waiting for the car.Our room was on the 10th floor of the Hula wing, and offered a partial ocean view from both lanais. The location was a little noisy in the mornings with garbage trucks and other industrial vehicles down on the road, but we had no issue with evening noise and never heard our neighbors. Could hear kids down at the pool during the day, but usually quieted down by 8pm. Everything in the room worked well, and enjoyed having the refrigerator in the room to provide cold beverages after long days out of the room. The bathroom felt a little dated, but no issues with cleanliness or mold. Plenty of towels provided for both the shower and the pool / beach.Breakfast offered a good selection of hot and cold offerings, including cooked to order eggs and omelettes. There were also a few Asian offerings to cater to different tastes, including rice and miso soup. The only thing we found disappointing was the fresh fruit offerings - other than pineapple there were no local products, and much of it looked like it had been out for several hours. Drinks and snacks at the managers evening reception were pretty tasty, and a much better selection than I have seen at other Embassy Suites. Both breakfast and the reception were well attended, but seating was never a problem.As this was a working trip we did not get any use of the pool, but it looked pretty nice and well maintained. There were not a lot of seats around the pool, and they were all taken whenever we would look down from our room. Guessing the area is relatively small as Waikiki is just a 5-minute walk away, but given the size of the hotel a little bit more pool seating might be called for.Overall our stay was fine, and we will consider the hotel again if we return to Oahu.","Kalaheo, Hawaii",89,4.0

We are glad we went back. With an older family, we took a two bedroom suite, which is two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living area and kitchenette and balconies off each room. We did not pay for a view but had a pretty good one, being able to see the ocean from the balconies. Evidently the rooms have been refreshed/renewed fairly recently as everything was in very good condition, with an absence of the scrapes, scratches and marks common in family oriented hotels. The rooms are very good sizes and we never felt cramped for space.Our flight from Australia meant we arrived over three hours before checkin was due but we were still immediately given our room. The checkin process was friendly and efficient.Location wise, the Embassy is conveniently located. The Derussy Park beach is a couple of minutes away, Kalakaua Avenue at the end of the street and an enormous number of shops, restaurants and bars in the surrounding areas. Its about 10 minutes by Uber from Ala Moana and 35 minutes from the airport, subject to traffic.The Embassy has a Grand Lanai on the 4th level which is a large pool, bar and eating area. The included buffet breakfast is served here each morning. It is justly popular and it is wise to avoid the peak times if you're inclined to get up a little earlier. Made to order omelets are popular but there is plenty else to choose. Managers drinks are also served here for 2 hours each evening from 5:30, with free drinks from a limited menu but including cocktails. This is also popular and features live music three nights a week. On the Friday night, the band playing was fantastic and by the end of their session had people up dancing and singing along. A great night - and free!Staff are consistently friendly and helpful and maid service was good.My only criticism is the quality of the wifi. Apparently there was a repairman there on the last day we stayed and it did improve after that but before that, it was a weak signal, required constant re logging in and was basically unreliable. Hopefully it was only a temporary problem but should have been fixed earlier.Overall, if you are visiting Waikiki with a family, either young or old, then this is a very good option in Waikiki","Melbourne, Australia",151,5.0

I understand that they are only requests but I did request by sending an email prior to arriving and following it up again at check in that could we have a room away from the lift area and was told by the check in staff member that this room was in fact NOT near the lift. To my surprise and after a long flight our room was the closest room you could possibly get to the lift.

The property is very well-run and efficient, with friendly staff, especially housekeeping staff. The room comes with a free breakfast which is adequate, with a fair amount of choice, although usually pretty busy. A tip - sit outside because the ventilation isn't great and if you sit indoors you smell of frying oil when you leave. The best thing about Embassy Suites is the location - it is a short walking distance to beaches, shops, restaurants and bus stops. You feel like you are in the centre of the buzz, which is great. The public bus system is excellent (download 'Da Bus' app), cheap and easy to use. One tip - we thought we would be clever and take a public bus to the airport - $7.50 for 3 people as opposed to at least $40 for a cab, and there are loads of buses that go to the airport. After dragging our luggage up the street to the bus stop we were told by the first bus driver that you cannot take suitcases on the buses. So we dragged them back to the hotel and caught a cab instead - it turned out that the next cab in line was a limo, which cost exactly the same as a regular cab but was way more fun.

Location was great, two minute walk to the beach, near many restaurants and ABC stores. The rooms are big which is perfect for families or large groups. Nice to have a separate living room with a fridge and sink. Decor was nice and rooms were clean. My first room faced the alley way and I was woken up the first 2 nights early by the garbage trucks as the glass doors were not very sound proof as well as the elevator was basically in my room. I asked the front desk if they could change this and they did! I was moved to an ocean front room with no noise in the mornings! Very happy with them. The breakfasts each morning were perfect, wonderful omelet station and lots of other hot and cold foods to choose from. The evening happy hour I didn't feel was really worth it. Yes free drinks but the food was zucchini and dip or chips and salty nuts/mix. I think stepping up a notch with the evening snacks would make this place an absolute #1 in my books! Pool area is OK, lots of chairs, good sized hot tub but a fairly small pool, not a big deal though. I did leave my battery bank when I left and returned a week later and they had it in lost & found! Very happy about that, however an email would have been a nice courtesy. The one thing that was frustrating was that the TV channel guide did not match up with what was on TV. Normally on a vacation this shouldn't matter, but I was a bit sick and the weather wasn't good, so I did spend time watching TV and correct channel info would have been nice.","Vancouver, Canada",9,4.0

It was cheaper for us to get two rooms than a two bedroom room.Check in was seamless.Room was well set out with lounge and separate bedroom and bathroom. A narrow balcony.Room was well equipped and anything not there was easily received with a call to house keeping.Complementary breakfast was an absolute winner with great selection. Lots of people and the buffet does get busy, the omelette station too. Staff do a great job keeping all stations well stocked, in the 7 days we were there we never had to wait for anything to be refilled.5pm - 7pm happy hour we visited twice. Yes free drinks, two per person, per visit to the bar. So drink as much as you want two at a time. Snack food was plentiful and you could order more substantial food through the pool restaurant, a your cost. Not as packed as we thought it would be. Nice addition especially for families with young kids, grab a snack before dinner or the snack can become dinner.We had a hire car for last few days, very easy access to our car less than 5 mins each time we went to pick it up.Check out again seamless.One last thing this hotel is in a great location 2 minute walk to the beach and even less to a huge variety of shops and restaurants, you are really in amongst it.Would be the hotel we stay at next time we are in Waikiki.","Exeter, Australia",124,5.0

Special kudos to Kenny, our valet/bellman and the front desk/registration woman (we forgot her name, but she was originally from Okinawa, Japan) who helped make our visit so pleasant.

Wifi is fast, gym is good but a little small and the valet ($38/day) is quick in getting your car. Hotel does sit in a busy area but we had a 4th floor room and never heard the crowds around the hotel -- breakfast choices are typical Embassy Suites but area is open-air which is a nice touch. No resort fee which is hard to find (Hilton Waikiki has no resort fee also) so added value when staying here. As a Diamond member there were no benefits awarded us and no concierge lounge -- as evening social and free buffet breakfast included as part of hotel. We enjoyed stay and will be back for sure.Tip: Uber is available so no need for a car if you are to spend majority of time in Waikiki which saves you the daily parking fee of $38. Some come and only rent a car for the day they decide to drive around the island.Tip: Only a few rooms (high facing beach) offer a view as the hotel sits back away from the water and is surrounded by many other buildings -- so if you want the beach view and are willing to pay for it, make sure you reserve the room as busy and complementary upgrades are few.","San Antonio, Texas",396,5.0

I'll start with the good parts of this review. My husband and I spent 4 nights here before joining a small boat cruise on the Big Island. We thought it would be a good place to recover from jet lag after an 11 hour trip. We also wanted to see the sights in Honolulu as it's highly unlikely that we will return to Hawaii. The positives: The staff is very helpful and friendly. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. The cooked to order breakfast buffet has lots of delicious offerings. There is a great cover band at the nightly cocktail hour and cocktails flow freely. We've been to other Embassy Suite properties that impose a 1 drink limit. Now for the reasons for the point reductions: This is a tropical destination that was quite hot and humid when we were here. The halls and elevators are not air conditioned and there were no tropical breezes to make those areas comfortable. Sweating profusely while waiting for and riding in an elevator is definitely a negative. Additionally, this property is located a long block from the nearest beach. There is, however, a lovely pool area that would have been very nice to use had there been shaded areas. There were no umbrellas, except at a few tables, and no other shelters from the sun. We've been to many tropical resorts in many places. In all of them, we could sit at the pools or beach areas and be shaded from the sun.","Yardley, Pennsylvania",24,4.0

We booked a city view room to save $ as we had beachfront rooms at other hotels on our trip and got upgraded to a corner room on the 21st floor that had both city and ocean views (thanks Hilton Honors). The room was clean and comfortable, the bedroom a bit on the small side but the living area complete with dining table and chairs was spacious. The housekeepers were efficient and very friendly, I thought all the staff were good that way. Part of the reason we booked this hotel was the included breakfast and happy hour. I thought the breakfast was pretty good, the chef cooked omlettes were great and poplular and while the range of food wasn't huge it was different every day. The happy hour by the pool was a great deal with a wide range of drinks, the snacks were pretty basic (nuts, veggies & dip and chips), and they have live entertainment a couple of nights per week. Hard to complain when the alternative is being back home at work! Location wise it is not quite in the center of Waikiki but pretty close and everything is in walking distance. Plenty of restaurants nearby (the hotel coupons have a discount for Cheeseburger Beachwalk which was a great spot for delicious messy burgers), and we enjoyed dining by the beach at the Outrigger Reef (where we met in 1989) accross the road. I would say this hotel is a great spot for families, there were a lot of kids there, particularly around the pool which some might not like but we enjoyed the atmosphere it created.

We observed a large bird dive bomb a lady's food tray while she was eating. Another lady left her food tray on the table to go get something which allowed several birds to have a tasty breakfast of their own in her absence.

Perfect size for family. Comfortable beds. I believe that 6 people are allowed per suite. Hotel lobby is open air. Clean. Friendly staff. Pool. Reception hour early evening. Breakfast includes scrambled eggs, made to order omelettes, fresh fruits, pastries/breads, potatoes, white rice, sausage or bacon, cereal, oatmeal, etc & beverages. Only 1/2 block from beach. In the middle of main shopping area. Waikiki trolley depot is down Leward St. inside Galleries parking garage (short distance). Tons of ABC stores (however Longs Pharmacy/CVS is cheaper on many items). Subway restaurant, PF Chang's & Starbucks short distance. Shopping mall next to hotel also has Food Court on 2nd floor. Burger King & KFC about five blocks walking distance. For our family, using the Waikiki trolley (7 day pass) takes you everywhere important (hop on & hop off). If you book the luau at the Waikiki Aquarium, you will need a taxi back to hotel (approx $15 cab ride, too far to walk back with children in evening). City bus also has day routes around shopping areas. If you like flea markets, you can use the purple trolley route & shop to your heart's content (Tshirts 7 x $20, key chains $1, trinkets $1 - $2, shawls $5, etc). Pearl Harbor is also on purple route. Post office one block away. I believe this hotel was in the best location overall for everything. I will stay at this hotel again!! Very satisfied.","Houston, Texas",14,5.0

The only 2 complaints I have is the internet is slow and you must sign in every day on this trip this was the third Hilton property we stayed at and it had the worst internet setup, might be due to all the hotels around the property but it would nice if they could work on this. The other problem with this hotel for me is location, I would not stay in downtown waikiki, too much traffic and too much congestion.

Over the few months before we arrived, I emailed Mr. Asato many many times for information. He quickly responded and would add valuable information that made activity planning a breeze!

We were in a two bedroom suite which was really convenient for the whole family. The two separate bedrooms are joined by a common area in the middle. There was also a working mini fridge (not lukewarm), coffee maker and a microwave. I think there was also a complimentary microwave popcorn but I'm not sure since it disappeared so quickly. Check-in was excellent as was check-out. The hotel was packed an always busy but we never really had to wait for anything. Unlike other hotels we have stayed at (I'm talking to you Royal Hawaiian). The rooms aren't luxurious, but they were clean, well maintained, quiet and had everything anyone could want. If you still need anything, there is an ABC store selling everything you might need right across the street next to the Denny's. We were fortunate to be there for the 4th of July and although we couldn't quite see the fireworks from our room, we figured out that by standing on the beachside terrace at the end of the hallway, we had a great view of the fireworks. The only thing we didn't like was the breakfast buffet. We were traveling with our kids who have food allergies. So our negative experience is only intended to provide information for other travelers with food allergies. At breakfast, we asked if there were any items that would be safe for them to eat given their allergies. Perhaps we asked the wrong person, but the waitress we spoke to wasn't sure and didn't inspire confidence with her response which was kind of a shrug and a general warning that pretty much everything was off limits. I assumed it was because of the potential for cross-contamination. We asked to speak to the chef or anyone else about it to get more specifics. The waitress then went and spoke to what I presume was one of the chefs and then came back and reiterated what she had said earlier. Not wanting to take a chance, we didn't really eat anything and skipped it entirely on the following days. That was the only negative I can think of for this hotel. Other than that, everything was very nice. The location is close to everything, the beach is a short walk away and the main shopping areas even closer.

The breakfast, which received mixed reviews here, really was quite decent, with plenty to choose from and a pleasant place to sit and eat, although it did become a mob scene by 9am. So, if you want to partake of the breakfast, plan to get a fairly early start. The rooms were standard hotel, but clean and comfortable and the hotel is nearly attached on one side to a long arcade of shops and restaurants which runs along Kalakaua Ave. Getting to Honolulu proper and its museums and other sights will cost you a fortune in cab rides, so take the city bus which is both reasonable and convenient from here.

We caught the bus to go to Wal-Mart, Walgreens and Ross (they are all beside each other) and the mall just to experience it. The prices in Hawaii and very expensive so don’t be alarmed. A gallon of milk is $8. The cost of living is extremely high. A 1,500 sq ft house, 3 bd, 2 ba is about $700,000.00 (learned this from Aldrin.) The post office is right up the street.

Their contracted valet service LOST THE KEYS TO OUR RENTAL CAR!! This hotel is near Waikiki Beach and we were REQUIRED to use this service.....they do not allow self park. We were checking out and needed to be at Pearl Harbor in a timely manner for 9am tickets to the USS Arizona memorial which my husband had secured in March (there are a limited number of tickets available for the Arizona each day). There was no valet manager on duty, no urgency regarding our situation, and NO CONCERN FROM EMBASSY SUITES!! We had to become visibly upset and angry with the valet service in order to get their attention. We hassled to get our car and luggage back throughout the day and not a word from the hotel --- no offer to comp the room ($400/night), or any acknowledgment of our extreme inconvenience. They didn't even offer to refund the valet fee!! UNACCEPTABLE!!!! DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU WANT A NIGHTMARE.","Papillion, Nebraska",8,1.0

There were 3 adults so the apartment style room was perfect for us. And while it was a little dated a lot of places are in Hawaii! The room was perfectly clean. The bedroom was average size and while the living area was a little smaller than I expected it was still great having the separate bedroom where you could close a door when someone else was sleeping. The bathroom was really big!Having the mini fridge was really helpful. There was no cutlery though which was fine for us because we didn't use the microwave at all. The breakfast was nice. Nothing fancy but heaps of options and always plenty of food. Most hotels I looked at didn't include breakfast so it as great that it was included. The breakfast area was nice to sit in each morning and night at the manager drink. The managers drinks were amazing!!! I'm not a big drinker but even so it was a great way to get a little entertainment. Seriously such a point of difference and a super nice touch. Especially with the band on a few of the nights and they were great! All the staff were lovely. Saying aloha ever time we saw them. The young girl who checked us in was particularly lovely. Location! It was right in the heart of everything. Big ABC store out the front for everything you need. Only a few blocks to all the major restaurants like Cheese Cake Factory and California Pizza Kitchen (this was my favourite meal!) and shopping like Ross Outlet! About a 5 min or so walk down to the beach which seemed a little bit quieter than the heart of Waikiki beach which I really liked. All in all I would recommend this to anyone. Especially anyone looking for a separate room style hotel which is hard to find in Hawaii.Oh and free wifi is always good! Thanks Embassy Suites for the great stay!,"Melbourne, Australia",8,4.0

We've stayed at other hotels, but the Embassy Suites by far was the best due to the set up and location. We've previously stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and Marriott Waikiki Beach. Since we were traveling with our 16 month old baby, we needed the option of having the bedroom and living area be separated since we had already sleep trained her. Plus my husband is a snorer, and would've woken her up multiple times. Our room was beautiful and overlooked the pool, and you could see glimpses of the ocean. We loved the amount of space we had which is very rare for a hotel in the center of Waikiki. The free breakfast buffet was a huge plus since we had our baby with us. The food was always the same, but the buffet saved us some extra dollars to spend elsewhere. All of the staff (front desk, cleaning, valet) were really friendly, except for a few that would bus the buffet tables. You could tell that they definitely did not want to be there.The pool was nice too, and had a separate area for smaller babies and toddlers that was probably only 1 foot deep. I would definitely give this place 5 stars, if it weren't for the elevators. This hotel only had two elevators located by the front desk. There was one that was constantly breaking down, so that would only leave one for the mass numbers of people getting on and off. There would be swarms of people lining up for that one elevator. They were always super packed mostly with the morning rush, so we'd have to wait for a few of them to pass before we could actually get into one. There were times the staff would be nice enough to open up the service elevator for us though. Other than that one annoyance, we loved everything else about it from the service to the location and to the family-friendly nature of the place.

The have two bedroom suites you can get and have a wonder pool and other amenities for families. This is usually our go-to hotel whenever my family travels to Oahu. One of the best features of this hotel is that it is located near The Beachwalk Shopping area which is attached to the hotel via a tunnel. There are great restaurants and shopping options nearby. Our kids love the gelato shop and my wife is a big fan of the Starbucks which is also nearby for you coffee lovers. Access to the rest of Waikiki is also a breeze since the hotel is pretty centrally located. I'd recommend trying some of the local eateries that are within walking distance such as Arancino (italian food) or Giovanni Pastrami's (for sandwiches and breakfast). Rooms are spacious and clean. The only tip I would tell travelers is to stay in the Aloha tower on a high floor so you avoid some of the noise from the streets below. Also beware of the Trump hotel next door.

Usually we prefer to stay near the canal to avoid the busyness of Kalakahua Ave and surrounding area. However, the hotel was perfect in that we could not hear any outside noise once we were in our room. The air conditioning is loud and if you are a light sleeper you may want to consider ear plugs.The beds are comfortable though I would say the pillows could use an upgrade. I can sleep well regardless of pillows but the 8 pillows supplied in the room were getting old and felt lumpy. Location is very close to the beach and close to the shops and stores in Waikiki. My mother in law traveled with us and she does not wander far. However, because we were so close to restaurants and stores she was able to get out on her own and access the shops and stores she was interested in.Housekeeping was very good (Jin Un was the best) and with the exception of one day with a different individual cleaning our room we were very satisfied. A clean room is my number one priority when booking accommodation.We booked a one bedroom suite which suited us perfectly as either my husband or I had work to do some evenings. One of us would work in the sitting area while the other could relax or go to sleep in the separate bedroom. We chose Embassy Suites for two reasons: no resort fee and the complimentary breakfast. Breakfast was great! There was a very wide assortment of breakfast items which means that anyone from small children to adults can find something to eat. The only suggestion I would make is that there were no gluten free options for those who are celiac, though there was plenty of fruit, omelets made to order, and hard/soft boiled eggs could be requested. I would also love to see hotels offering whole grain breads, english muffins, etc., rather than the while breads that are always offered. The fitness centre had a good assortment of equipment (cardio and free weights). If there were more than 2 or 3 people working out at one time it became a bit crowded and hot! Despite a request to turn down the temperature, it was ignored and stayed at 72 degrees F. Whoever is in charge of the fitness centre should know that a cooler temperature is a must for a fitness room - especially with the small size and number of people who may be using it at one time. Each night free drinks and snacks were offered from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm on the grand lanai. On M W F there was live entertainment which we thoroughly enjoyed. The snacks were basic but were much appreciated by everyone from the looks of all those guests who were present each evening.I would definitely recommend this hotel.

My husband spoke with the front desk and told them our kids were struggling to sleep and they were kind enough to move us the next day up to the 7th floor which was much quieter and gave us a glimpse of the ocean - we were very grateful for it! Afternoon drinks and nibbles was popular amongst the guests, as was the complimentary breakfast, but we found it was not really to our taste. There is a little store across the street where we would buy fresh fruit in the morning which was amazing.

That reservation was for a basic unit, but after I checked things out, including Trip Advisor, I realized I wanted a corner suite with an ocean view. Regretfully however, Air miles could not change that, and Hilton could not amend it either, as I did not book with them. A few days in advance I contacted the hotel directly and asked to pay for the upgrade and try to get the room I wanted, if one was available. On Check-in, they upgraded me for free, which was greatly appreciated. Stayed in Aloha Tower, Room #2008. The Aloha tower goes up to floor 21. Rooms that end with xx08 and xx09, are what you want. 10th floor and above for perfect ocean views from your living room, or your Lanai.

Needless to say I don't travel very well and am always anxious when vacationing. I notice everything - every stain on the sheets, every smudge on the walls - that sort of thing. I was extremely happy to stay at the Embassy Suites Waikiki for our April 25 - May 2 vacation. We stayed in a room by the elevators on the 15th floor. We booked a city view room but we could see the ocean to the left of our balcony, so I think we were upgraded to a partial ocean-view. I was worried it would be noisy when trying to sleep, but because each room is a suite, you can close a second door to the bedroom to block out any noise from the hallway. Not that there was much noise in the hallway - this hotel seems to be a somewhat sleepy refuge for families in the middle of bustling Waikiki. You could hear the elevator itself going up and down through the wall - this was a bit annoying but we were able to muffle the sound out with the AC fan and earplugs (plus it wasn't running much at night). You could sometimes hear faint music/singing once the live entertainment got going around 5:30pm because they keep the door at the end of each hallway open to the outdoors/pool area, but it was quite pleasant and just added to the feeling that you're in Hawaii :) I actually felt comfortable in the bed - the white sheets were very crisp and clean, towels were clean, shower was fairly clean (very slight mildew in the grout in some places, but better than many other places we've stayed). Also housekeeping kept missing the full length mirror behind the bedroom door, so it was super smudgy and kind of gross. Also there was a bit of sand and some hairs in the corners of the bathroom floor when we arrived that never went away, so I don't think they did a very thorough job sweeping. That was really the only ""dirt"" I noticed!Staff were very friendly and helpful. Allowed us to check in a bit early, schedule a late check out, and use a courtesy room after we checked out and went out for the day (our flight wasn't until 10pm that night). I think our favourite part about staying here was the breakfast. Even when it was ""busy"" we only had to wait in line for a minute at the buffet, and another couple minutes to find a table. Most days we were able to grab food and a seat immediately. And it was good food too! Hot eggs, pancakes, made-to-order omelettes, bagels, oatmeal, cereal, some japanese-fare like miso soup and rice. It changed a bit every day, and there was a lot to choose from so we never got bored - we ate all 7 breakfasts here and saved a ton of money! More fresh fruit would be nice though, we only saw pineapple and honeydew offered. Unfortunately we never made it to the Manager's reception for the complimentary drinks and entertainment. Hopefully we will be back, and will be able to take advantage of that great opportunity as well!","Calgary, Canada",4,5.0

Managers evening cocktail reception was hard to leave, and the mai tai was the best I have had. Some reviews mention street noise, but though on level-6, barely noticed it. The location was ideal... Starbucks over the road, Royal Hawaiian shopping centre over the other road, the beach only a few minutes away. Expedia have a tour desk located near reception, and their local knowledge & pricing were hard to beat.

I have to say that I was extremely relieved this hotel was as good as its reviews. With three kids we booked a 2bed/bath suite and it was perfect. Kids each had a bed and the second bathroom made everything easier. The added value with the full breakfast and happy hour were money savers for sure. Kids all enjoyed their breakfasts as did my husband and I. Staff are so helpful and friendly. Kids enjoyed the pool even though it's a pretty simple pool. The pool deck was never too busy and there was always a chair to sit on. If you're picky about shampoo/conditioner/shower gel, bring your own. Very comfy beds and pillows. Wifi was not so good, a bit spotty - kids did complain but hey, you're on vacation. My son could get free wifi courtesy of the Trump Hotel next door on the pool deck. The location is very good. Felt safe letting kids go downstairs and across street to ABC Store. Good restaurant choices all within close walking range. Can rent a car at hotel 1/2 block away and return it right to Embassy (extra $5 when returning to hotel, but so convenient). We booked a tour and again, went outside hotel 1/2 block for pick up. We were in the Hula tower and did not have an ocean view but we were rarely in the room or looking to sit on our deck. Honolulu hotels are expensive but the added value at this hotel with the room size, free breakfast and happy hour, it makes a family vacation more economical and less stressful.

The decor is brown, orange and dated. Of the 3 elevators only one was working and for a high tower one elevator led to long waits to board a smallish elevator. At one point the housekeeping staff tried to push a large laundry cart onto the elevator which led to protests. The pool area is only ok with a number of broken chairs that should be removed. The included breakfast is a bonus for families. The extra room is convenient for a family. The proximity to the beach is about 200 metres.

Thank you so much, without those very accurate reviews I never would have found this wonderful Hotel for my family to enjoy.Check in very quick and easy (a cold tropical drink was a lovely start)Rooms clean and quiet, beds comfy.(We were near elevators and heard nothing).No resort fees (my friends got a nasty surprise when they checked into Hawaiian Village and had to pay over $200 for things that are complimentary here, and I paid less than them)Complimentary Buffet breakfast daily was awesome. Special mention for Aldrin (I think that's his name), he was always smiling as he cleared away and cleaned tables, folks please tip these guys as it's not as obvious to tip them as waiters in a restaurant but they do appreciate tips.Nightly Manager's Cocktail evening was a fav with our family. Just loved it and found it a great time to mingle and meet other guests from around the world.Lovely pool areaGood WiFiVery short walk to beach - walk another 5 mins past all the beachfront resorts to get to the main part of Waikiki Beach (Highly recommend DUKES, great service, food, prices and views - Try the Hula Pie).I highly recommend this property if you don't need to be beachfront. I will definitely stay here again when I come back to Waikiki and will recommend it to my friend's and family. Polynesian Cultural Center is awesome and worth every cent (pay extra for the Ambassador Package and take the bbq lunch that's offered on the shuttle ride there).We also enjoyed Yard House and Cheesecake Factory for lunch.Enjoy Hawaii...we can't wait to go again in a few years.",Gold Coast,3,5.0

All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful, especially the reception staff who helped with phone calls when we realised we had left something in the seat pocket on the flight into Honolulu which we did manage to get back. As a family of 4 with kids aged 12 and 17 a suite was better than paying for 2 rooms in other hotels. We had a city room view, although it did have a great view of the ocean from the balcony!, with 2 queen beds in the bedroom and a sofa bed in the lounge area. My eldest had the sofa bed and he found it comfortable (and he is just under 6ft tall). having the extra living space along with a small kitchen area with fridge, microwave, tea/coffee facilities was great. The only drawback was that although there was loads of storage space with a wardrobe and many drawers once the suitcases had been emptied there wasn't really anywhere to put them.The free breakfast and managers reception in the evening were very good and definitely an added bonus. Another attraction of this hotel is that there are no resort charges. As a Hilton Honours member I looked at all their hotels in the area and this can out the best.Although not on the beach it is very close. We found that the nearest beach was a bit rocky once you were in the water but if you walk around 15 mins along the beach in either direction you'll find areas without rocks. I recommend the Ala Moana beach which is great for younger children. If you don't want to walk there take the pink line shopping trolley to the Ala Moana Centre for $2 per person which is close to the beach.It is also very close to the main shopping area and the zoo (around 20 Min walk) the aquarium is also around 30 min walk and gives a great view of Diamond Head.The hotel does not have a shuttle that runs to the airport but a taxi from the airport cost us $45 and slightly more going back as we went during rush hour so it took longer. Alaine on the bell desk was great at helping out work out the best time to leave and storing out luggage.Internet is free but does require re-logging on occasionally. There are plenty of sockets in the room for charging phones and the alarm clock also has an iPhone dock.Thoroughly recommend this hotel and if I am ever lucky enough to be able to go back to Hawaii this will be my first choice","Bristol, United Kingdom",18,5.0

Embassy Suites in Waikiki? Look no further for an incredible vacation package. We bought a week vacation package at Costco and the property, service, amenities and location couldn't be better. Way to go Costco and Embassy Suites. The hotel is ideally located across from the ocean front Outrigger Reef hotel (the beach sucks in front of their hotel so don't worry). Our lovely 2 bedroom suite (2 bedrooms and one central room) was quiet, on a high ocean view floor. Honestly, it was perfect. The room(s) were large, small compact kitchenette, excellent maid service, high powered aircon in each of the three rooms. I cannot think of any better accommodation for the $ in this area. Free breakfast, which included omelet bar and also free afternoon cocktails and chips, etc., at the pool. The pièce de résistance to all of this was ROSS at the concierge desk. This guy was unbelieveable. When I first emailed him about some activities (a week or so we arrived) he followed up constantly with me via email and phone. Never pushy but informative, I absolutely loved his PR and customer service. He arranged an H2 tour of Pearl Harbor and an hour long heli trip around the island. Both were amazing.

And this hotel was a fantastic part of that vacation experience. We had originally booked a king suite (city view) for our family of 4, along with arranging for use of one of their pack-and-plays for our 1 year old. That meant we would have the nearly 4 year old sharing our bed. So when we arrived at the hotel reception desk, we asked if it would be possible to switch to a 2-bed suite so that the oldest kiddo could have her own room. Cindy, a fantastic lady at the front desk, arranged for our new room with 2 beds. In fact, Cindy had given us a much better room, which turned out to be a corner room (extra windows) with an ocean view (room 1208). This was a fantastic surprise that really made our stay extra special.The room had a great view of the ocean, it was large, it was packed with extra towels for us as well as towels for the beach. There was a nice eating area (table and chairs) by the kitchenette. It was easy to close the door to the bedroom for the tired kids to sleep while we enjoyed the evening views.The hotel is quite near the beach (just across the street and down a short path). We had no trouble going back and forth. The hotel has a great pool (with a separated kids pool at 18 inches deep that both our kids loved even more than the ocean). The food was excellent. Part of our choice to stay at the Embassy Suites was due to their fantastic breakfasts. But we also got a very reasonable amount of food at the evening receptions as well (significantly cutting down on food expenses while there). Our only complaint is that the evening entertainment (live music) was often quite loud, which required sitting as far away from the music as possible for the sake of the kids.I would absolutely recommend this hotel and would use this hotel again on a future trip to the Waikiki area.","Olympia, Washington",68,5.0

The mayor and the city council must do more.3) Walls are paper thin - very unusual for an Embassy Suites4) MAIDS are extremely loud - at 7:30 am, they're shouting, ""Good Morning, Sir!"" ""Do you need anything sir?"" The GM must take these maids into a hotel room and shout outside the door to explain to them not to shout - why can't these simple things be done? What is our country coming to?5) NIGHT LIGHT - why on earth does the Hilton staff think everyone can sleep with a bright alarm clock that you can't unhook from the wall and an even brighter fire alarm right across the bed? It's like having a FLASHLIGHT in your face all night. 6) No fitted sheets - so if you're over 6 feet and like to pull the sheets out, you're out of luck - everything unravels.

From the moment we pulled up for valet parking, we felt like part of the hotel family. Our bellman, Dean, greeted us with a warmth I've never experienced at a major hotel chain and helped us navigate the tourist traps and busy waters of Honolulu. He even went so far as to lend us his own drink cooler for our many day trips and outings. The warmth continued when we met Pi'ilani at the ""all you can drink"" manager's reception. She ensured we were comfortable, treated us like long lost friends, and talked to us about everything under the sun. At breakfast time we were met by more friendly faces and one in particular stood out, Gerald. On our first morning there he was kind enough to give us leis made of dried kukui seeds. As with Dean and Pi'ilani, he made us feel at home. The hotel itself is very clean, beds are comfortable, and there are too many amenities to mention. The food is delicious and the drinks are strong. The pool area is a fantastic place to rest one's weary head after a day out and about.

This hotel was the perfect spring break tropical getaway for my family.

It was alarming and frankly quite scary because I did not know how it got there. No member of management showed up to my room and it took them a while to respond with a member of the security team to respond. Illegal narcotics is a felony and could have cost me my job and for the hotel staff to be so relaxed about the entire situation blew my mind. Upon check, I had to request to speak with the manager on Duty and all he did was deny responsibility and quiz me on how the narcotics ended up on my balcony. I did not appreciate that at all and he made no attempt to make any sort of amends or good faith gesture for the inconvenience. It was not my responsibility as a paying patron and a member of the Armed Forces to figure out how marijuana was smuggled into the hotel. That was/is his job and that would have been the appropriate time to take action. Take ownership of any situation. It is easy to pass responsibility on to the next party. The right answer is always “how can I correct this or make it better!” All I heard was it was another guest or other conspiracy theories on how this bag of marijuana magically appeared on my balcony. The details aren’t important but the experience is. The situation was handled poorly and unfortunately I will not be returning to this hotel. The ramifications of that situation could have cost me so much had it been found by someone other than myself and I don’t think the employees at your hotel understood that, which leads me to believe that illegal drugs being found in this location are common practice and that is unacceptable.

It is right in the heart of Waikiki, smack in the middle of all kinds of shopping -- from upscale, to touristy shops, to restaurants. Like a mini-, much more relaxed, Aloha-infused NYC. Asian fusion ABOUNDS at the little food truck plaza directly across the street. This was a lifesaver when we were tired after a long day sightseeing and didn't want to trek out in the car again for food. Ramen, Korean BBQ, sushi, delicious fresh fish... but, I digress. The free breakfast was the best I've ever experienced. Free breakfast is one of my favorite things about staying at hotels, so this says a lot! There were scrambled eggs and white rice daily, rotating tater tots and diced potatoes, several rotating meats from 2 types of sausage (links and round), to bacon, melon and pineapple, a made-to-order(!) omelette station, oatmeal with more toppings than I've seen offered anywhere, and of course. Steal and breads -- even salad and a miso dispenser. Love the Asian flair. Best of all, a real taste of island paradise was the Manager's Reception 5:30-7:30pm, nightly. There is live entertainment with a great ukulele band 3x/week, plus FREE drinks to put you in a tropical mood, while you watch the sunset from the rooftop pool area. Ugh, can you tell I want to go back? Complimentary newspaper is also delivered daily to your door. The only downsides: 1) $38/night valet parking, which was worth it to us to stay right in Waikiki and walk rather than struggling to find parking, at which we've failed at other vacations in the past. 2) We were in the Aloha Tower and the CONSTANTLY dinging elevators were really noisy, along with the banging from 6am deliveries on the street below (blessing/curse of ""downtown""), but they accommodated us and we switched rooms to a higher floor (20th), further from the elevator. PS- Roy's restaurant is next door and REALLY good -- not your typical ""screw it, let's just eat in the hotel"" place. Pro tip: Roy's has a Yelp deal to get a free SINFUL chocolate lava dessert if you check in! Pro tip #2: Ocean view is sooo worth it -- our 2nd room was a free upgrade and it was just bomb. (Pics made all our snowed-in friends jealous.) Thanks, Embassy Suites, for the memories, free music CD, cute fruity drinks at check-in.... All in all, I'll be trying to find a place to top this one for a long time to come. ","New York City, New York, Usa",15,5.0

Extremely talented musicians. The hotel suite was very comfortable with a little kitchenette and microwave oven which came in handy.The hotel is very conveniently located near all the main shopping centres and eateries - all within walking distance.There is also a convenient store across the road - ABC - which sells everything that you would need including some pharmacy stuff. They can even make up a fresh hamburger of your choice if you so wish.The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. The hotel has a Business Centre (Room) with a number of computers which I had the benefit to utilise. There was a waiter in the dining area - so friendly & greets you all the time - and would always come up and asked whether he can help us with coffee or tea, etc., and with a big smile and always happy and jolly - pity that I didn't get his name.Overall, a marvelous hotel and lovely stay.

The reason we returned was because of the amazing included breakfast buffet and the nightly manager's reception (read: free booze (wine, beer, spirits, cocktails!) and plenty of it over a 2 hour period every night - with snacks!). A cold juice on arrival is a nice touch and all the staff are exceptionally friendly. A very special mention to Aldrin who works around the dining area at breakfast. I remember him specifically from our first visit and was so happy to see him and be served by him again. He is a credit to the company but also just a damn good person, heart of gold, keen to help and even once walked my wife and baby to the bathroom holding an umbrella because it was raining - and it was probably less than 10 steps in the rain! Champion human, hopefully his boss reads this and lets him know! For the keen gym goers the gym is actually pretty good for a hotel gym. Bikes, eliptical machines and 3 treadmills, swiss balls and ab machines, a cable station with 2 weights stacks which includes a pullup bar, 3 adjustable benches and dumbbells from baby weights to 55lb - not that heavy but good enough for a quick workout. The hotel is also in a great location - on the beachwalk with all of the shops and restaurants, adjacent to the Yardhouse, has an ABC (all purpose food/drink/supplies store) store directly opposite and is a tiny walk across the road to the beach.

We could not have made a better choice! It exemplifies the Aloha spirit.The staff (reception, Bell Desk, room, breakfast and pool) were always courteous, friendly and helpful. They regularly asked if we needed anything if they could do anything for us and as we left, all the various staff thanked us for staying with them. Their caring and attentiveness seemed genuine.The complimentary breakfast has many choices, including an omelette station where they will also prepare eggs any way you would like. The food is plentiful and we found that we could have a big breakfast and not need to eat again until dinner.The pool is very nice with an attached hot tub and wading area for small children. There are steps into the pool as well which makes entry easy for children and the elderly.The complimentary Happy Hour is nice. There is music, the drinks are free but the snacks are as advertised; ""light"". The light snacks consist of goldfish, chips, vegetables and dip, taco chips and salsa and similar items. Do not expect to have this be your light dinner. This is not a complaint but a clarification.Our room was plenty big enough. We had a bedroom with 2 queen size beds and a sitting area and bathroom. There was a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker and kettle. The room was very clean and we lacked for nothing.We had a partial ocean view room and it was great. We did not wish we had opted for the full ocean view. We could sit on our couch and look at the ocean; perfect! There was also a small balcony with a table and 2 chairs. We were on the 20th floor and didn't want to sit out there but it was nice to open the door and get a breeze.The hotel location was also very good. There are no resort fees because the hotel is not on the ocean, which is great, yet it is within easy walking distance to the beach. It is also very close to many restaurants and the Waikiki main shopping strip.There is an ABC store across the street which we frequented regularly for snacks, drinks, fruit, wine, etc. You could probably get almost anything that you might have forgotten at home here (sunblock, socks, ibuprofen....). It has lots of souvenirs too.On the day we checked out, our flight was at 10:00pm. We were able to get late checkout (1:00pm). They stored our bags for us and provided us with a courtesy room to shower and change in before we left for the airport. This allowed us to enjoy the afternoon at the pool and have a meal before leaving. We spoke to others who were doing the same thing.

An ABC shop just outside the front door and the beach is only a short walk away. Public transport and the Waikiki trolley is only a block away.

The staff was nice and we were welcome with juice. We were aware of the parking fee, which was really not bad if you looked around in Waikiki and it is valet. We did not use the pool but it looked very decent. We went to the Manager's Reception and alcohol was flowing - although not a big drinker, it was enjoyable. To me there was 2 minus: 1 - The price, but it is Honolulu and if I looked at comparables it was cheaper at some other hotels but smaller rooms and resort fees and no free breakfast. So I guess it is ok for Honolulu. 2 - The noise from the other rooms. We heard a baby crying many times, people screaming at each other, heavy walking...

It is in the breakfast/pool area with numerous tykes running around. Perfect family ambience. The complimentary breakfast is also in the same location, again a family friendly vibe. The breakfast was outstanding and included two separated cooked to order stations, two serve yourself bars and a cereal bar. Drinks were again separated thus no long lines.Although the beach is several blocks away there are numerous restaurants within a block. A Denny's and an ABC store are across the street.

To my eye, this is 3+ star hotel, but with a good value for the money compared to other Waikiki establishments and other hotels I stayed at during my Hawaii vacation. A word for European tourists, you probably will not find another hotel with complementary breakfast in Hawaii in this price and star range. As others have already mentioned, complementary breakfast + evening reception make this hotel stand out among all Waikiki hotels. We stayed at 16th floor ocean view suite, which was big enough, although needs some refreshing as its resembled the 90's style. There were two balconies at the suite, quite small though. Our bedroom was literally next to the elevator, but we didn't hear any noise neither from elevators nor from the neighboring rooms, which was a positive surpise. The only minor issue was a shower gel and a tea spoon. I know, it is silly! But I couldnt understand why the housekeeping was providing soap bars (so 90's...again), but seemed to be missing shower gels; this was; however, fixed after 2 days of asking. I didnt get the tea spoon for my entire stay though; I had to bring it from the breakfast to stir a coffee. Dear Management, please fix this. You provide a coffee maker and hot water kettle in the room along with different flavored teas and cofees with sugar and milk, but nothing to stir it with. Additionally, I liked that I was not bother by anyone; my privacy was sacred and i didn't feel I was nickled and dimed.The hotel is very well located with many restaurants just a step away and the beach not far away.There is a small gym, laundry room.

We had a two bedroom two bathroom apartment on the 12th floor with a balcony overlooking Beach Walk Rd and a view towards Fort Derussy Beach park and the water. Whilst we were not directly on the beach it was in easy walking distance to Grays Beach and Waikiki Beach and the main Waikiki area. Our apartment was fantastic and quiet with amazing beds. The breakfast every morning from 630am to 10am by the pool on level 4 was just beautiful with spectacular custom made omelettes and Buffett. A big shout out to the staff as well who really made my family and I feel so welcome every morning at breakfast - Dominic who made my omelettes just about every day, Rose who kept making sure my mum and dad were looked after and a big big thank you to Aldrin who was always checking we had plenty of tea coffee and water! The hotel was also in a great location for a great variety of restaurants with special mention to Shore Bird Restaurant across the road in the Outrigger Hotel on the beach, Bills for great coffee on Beach Walk Rd, Arancino Italian on beach walk Rd, Ocean House again on the beach in the Outrigger, Cheeseburger Beachwalk under the hotel and Denny's on Lewers street which is open late and does great comfort food. The hotel also does a fabulous free happy hour every night from 530pm to 730pm with complimentary nibbles by the pool. There is also a fantastic band which plays Friday, Saturday, Monday and Wednesday. This was definitely a memorable highlight of the hotel as you met so many different people staying at the hotel and a great way to unwind at the end of the day. Again a big shout out to Piilani who looked after us every night!Also another fantastic service was having an Expedia concierge in the foyer. I would highly recommend using Ross Asato who was in constant contact with me from Hong Kong and whilst I was staying at the hotel and was very patient and responsive to my millions of questions!

Every Friday they have fireworks on the beach and there are weekly dancing and singing shows on the green behind the hotel. The only thing I want to mention is that this part of Waikiki beach closest to the hotel has a very thin strip of sand with a very rocky bottom.

Usually getting the car is pretty fast if it's not too busy. The pool area is nice but a bit small for the number of guests. The larger pool is attached to the smaller kiddie pool. Towels are available and complimentary. Location is also great. It's on the northern end so you don't have to fight through Waikiki traffic to go anywhere. It's next to the Hilton Hawaiian Village which are nice grounds to walk on. They also have a small man made lagoon there. The beach is also a bit less crowded than Waikiki. Ala Moana Center is close too.Breakfast is the thing you cannot miss here. They have a made to order omlet station, fresh fruit, miso soup, eggs, sausage, coffee, juice, soda, and lots of other stuff. Make sure someone guards your food or the birds will come get it. I heard the birds are endangered so they cannot get rid of them. The staff is also pretty good at clearing away used plates. Make sure to come early as it can get busy. At night they offer some limited beer and (non watered down) tropical drinks. There also light snacks like pub mix or nacho cheese. Some nights have live bands also. Both breakfast and happy hour are complimentary.The rooms themselves are large and spacious. Ours usually have 2 balconies, a bedroom with 2 queens or 1 king and pull out sofa bed in the other room. There are 2 TV's. The bathroom is also quite spacious. This is my go to hotel in Waikiki if I can get it for a reasonable price.",,4,5.0

Breakfast buffet was certainly adequate for us - didn't try the omelette station but good choice of hot and cold items. Nightly happy hour was lots of fun. After drinks and snacks we hardly needed an evening meal! Appreciated having some vegetables as snacks, along with chips etc. Bar tenders were fantastic and very friendly. We really enjoyed the musical groups entertaining - the group of all male family members was our favourite!

Our recent Jan. 13-15th weekend at the Embassy Waikiki turned out to be a nightmare. Returning to our 18-floor suite after dining out at Hotel Kohala we were disgusted to find our K-bed visibly stained with gross brown spots. The toilet had leaked deep yucky water all over the bathroom floor. We used all towels to soak it up & called Front Desk immediately. Housekeeking staff came with 4 extra bath towels!. Since it was 1:30 a.m. & we were exhausted after a long day in transition, we delayed engineering service till the next morning. Our suite was still soaking wet, so we had to walk around in our shoes. It was quite disturbing that Front Desk staff & Hotel Manager NEVER check back with us about the issues encountered or offer a change of suite. Upon checking out we had to request to talk directly to the on-site manager about our extremely BAD experience. She apologized but told us she was not aware of anything because she just returned after being out sick the last few days!We've been travelling the world for decades and NEVER had such a situation, especially with the Hilton!","Madison, Wisconsin",4,2.0

I was able to get reasonable rates by booking months in advance via Hiltons honours program - but no upgrade or other acknowledgement of loyalty program membership. The bad was the onion smell from nearby restaurants which was noticeable in the evenings ( I know not the hotel's fault but just so you know - it's not the ocean breezes I was hoping for) and the sofa bed which was truly awful to sleep on. It gave me lower back pain which persisted for several days and made my 9 hour flight home agony. The ugly was the tour desk's invitation to attend Hilton's timeshare presentation for 90 minutes in return for $150 off our parasailing trip. I know, I know, I shouldn't have fallen for it, but it was a waste of a couple of hours of our precious holiday time. I have a sneaking suspicion that the tour was sold to us at an inflated rate, but it was great, by the way. Hawaiian Parasailing - highly recommend them.

This hotel is typical in that sense, but it's definitely a little shabby and the suites are quite small. The breakfast is extremely busy, but the hotel has a system to make sure tables are cleared quickly and there is a hostess who directs the guests to open tables or gets bussers to put tables together. Omelet lines are quite long (as it is at many ES). A smattering of Asian offerings because of the high census of guests from Japan, etc. Miso soup and rice offered in addition to high volume bacon, eggs, and sausage. I wouldn't call it haute cusine, but it's included in the hotel rate so can't complain too much.Location is ideal if you want to be in the middle of Waikiki, which may or may not interest you.

It actually stands out above the rest, with nice touches like dining room coffee service and seating help and an excellent bell staff.

This property is my favorite Hilton branded hotel in Waikiki. I've stayed there about a dozen times over the past 14 years. Best Feature: No Resort Fee!! (A major reason why I started staying here. I hope this policy never changes)Location: Heart of Waikiki. Literally across the street from Waikiki Beach. Walking distance to world class shopping and restaurants. Service: This is THE REASON why I keep coming back. Front desk is always friendly and accommodating if I have a special request. Because of flight schedules I often arrive at 10AM-11AM but they always find me a room if my original one isn't ready.Check-in: always very easy. Front desk staff is fast, efficient and friendly. My pre-arrival requests were honored without any problems. I always look forward to the complementary welcome beverage at check-in, puts me in an Island state-of-mind!Hotel: I would classify this hotel as upscale business travel or high turnover vacationer so expect crowds and wait lines, especially at breakfast time. It has a modern feel with a contemporary Hawaiian design. The Grand Lanai area, pool and bar are very nice with a relaxed atmosphere and the staff is always friendly.The hotel and facilities are well maintained. Some minor issues associated with normal wear/tear you would expect but nothing I found worth giving a negative review. Room: all rooms are two or three-room suites, very spacious. I got upgraded to a corner suite with ocean view so had about 200 degree arc of view. Rooms facing poolside can be a little noisy but quiet down after 10pm. Not many rooms face the Blvd so not much traffic noise. The bed was very comfortable and linens were clean and crisp. Four pillows on each bed is nice. No problems with cleanliness. Plenty of extra power outlets conveniently placed about rooms; two on desk, each side of bed, table lamps, wet bar, etc. Only one USB outlet available which was on the clock radio by bed. Free WiFi available. Wet bar, coffee/tea maker, small safe, microwave oven and small refrigerator in room. Bathroom: slightly larger than the average hotel size. Two people could use it simultaneously and move around with ease. No issues with cleanliness. Nice selection of complementary toiletries. Three complete sets of towels. Good restaurant and bar on property. Prices were typical Waikiki hotel prices but not outrageous. At night the Grand Lanai area hosts the Evening Poolside Reception with complimentary drinks, appetizers, and live entertainment.Nice gym facility with good cardio equipment (treadmills, elliptical etc.) and free weights, open 24hrs.Valet parking only, $38 per day.

The rooms had everything we needed but it all felt like it needed modernising. Beds were comfortable and bathrooms well equipped. The balcony was miniature, the living room really wasn't large enough for a room that accommodates between 4 to 6 adults and it could have benefited from more wardrobe space. These things aren't major issues though given it is Waikiki and you don't spend a great deal of time in your room anyway.The wifi was very average as it didn't seem to like us all logging in at the same time. Breakfast is included in the room rate here but, to be honest, if it weren't for a couple of girls watching their money, I would have preferred to go somewhere else. There's something about buffets where different people of different cultures with different hygiene standards congregating around the open food, touching, coughing, sneezing, poking and prodding that puts me off eating. I also hate lining up for half an hour for an omelette. The service here is good and the location is great. Last time I stayed in Waikiki I stayed on the beachfront whereas this place is one street back but significantly cheaper and it really doesn't matter. When you go to the beach, I would recommend swimming out the front of the military base to the right, it's very calm, not many rocks, fewer people and heaps of turtles.

So, since there were going to be so many of us, we really wanted to stay as close to each other as possible....I contacted reservations weeks before and they were so friendly and helpful on the phone, and promised to try their best to accommodate our request, but due to the extremely busy holiday season they couldn't make any promises.I arrived at the hotel after about a 20 minute cab ride from the airport.....the cab fare was pretty hefty and I'd suggest taking Uber if you can....the fare is almost half. As we drove into the hotel driveway I was immediately greeted by the hotel staff who welcomed me and offered to help with my bags, but I didn't have much and could handle it myself. The hotel lobby is totally open....no windows separating the driveway from the lobby, and no AC.....just nice fresh Hawaiian air.Check in was a breeze.....Victor was really nice and friendly and took care of me, and apparently he also attended to my father earlier, but his room wasn't ready yet. Unfortunately, only my room was ready and my father's would have to wait till 3pm. I went up to my room and ohoh.....this is not what the room looked like on the website! I got a room facing the back...not a bad view....but the room had small windows, no balcony, and just dark and dingy like a dated motel room.....at first I thought no big deal, but then after a few minutes I started to feel really claustrophobic....I had to change rooms. I went all the way back down to the reception and spoke to Victor about this....he was really understanding and fixed me up with another room, but it wouldn't be ready till after 3pm.....no problem, I said.3pm passed and we had been sitting in the lobby for an hour or so...finally we were called that our rooms were finally ready! Yay! OMG! This room was so much better!!! The bedroom and living room both had sliding doors to balconies, and there was actually a very nice partial view of the beach and ocean! My father got the same room, but on a much lower floor and his view was even more awesome!....with a view of the pool too. The room still looked a bit dated, but it was much brighter so the dated look wasn't so obvious.....it was still very comfortable, clean, and well kept. I liked that they had flat screen TVs in both rooms, a low light bedside digital clock,, iron and ironing board in the cupboard, hot water kettle, coffee maker, a couple of glasses, a mini fridge, and some basic bathroom amenities. The bedroom and living room have separate AC controls, which is nice if you have someone sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room and prefers a different room temperature or fresh air by keeping the sliding door open. There is plenty of lighting in the room and what I found neat was that the lamps had 2 prong electrical outlets at their bases. And yes, there is a room safe for your valuables.About the location of the hotel, it just doesn't get much better. There is a mini market located just at the lifts at the Hula Tower (closer to the beach)....there's also an ABC mini mart across the road, and pretty much every corner of every block. But other than that, there are tons of all kinds of shops right at the hotel's doorsteps and within walking distance to the main happening street of Kalakaua Ave where you have tons of shopping, street entertainment, great restaurants, etc..... there seemed to be a at least a dozen Japanese restaurant at every block in Waikiki!Buffet breakfast was included and the quality and selection was quite good...I particularly enjoyed the fresh local pineapple and melons.....there's an egg station for omelets, but the line was always too long so I never got to try it. I stuck with the regular hot breakfast which included scrambled egg, breakfast potatoes, and the mix up offerings of French toast or waffles, or pancakes and sausages or bacon, etc....I liked the chicken sausages, but they aren't offered every day. The drinks station is located separately, and this was a good idea to relieve the crowding at the food area. The dining next to the pool, but it can get really packed depending on the time you come down for breakfast....a card is is provided in the rooms to tell you at what times are peak and what times are less crowded.There's also a small gym in the Aloha Tower which I used as much as I could....it had a bike, a few steppers/elliptical trainers, treadmills, a cable rack, dumbbells and benches, etc. There are a couple of wall mounted TVs in case you get bored on the machines.....the machines look quite new and are well maintained, but the personal screens are not hooked up to cable tv. There is a water dispenser and towels also provided.Wonderful experience, but I think this hotel is better geared to toward families with kids. My brother's family had a great time!Oh, consider the room you get as anything facing the pool you'll here the live band playing at happy hour.....with free alcoholic drinks and snacks.....nice touch.",California,68,4.0

The cofee is disappointing (Duwe Egberts). It truly is a fabulous buffet but the problem is that dining is in a large open air room with birds flying around scarfing up food. I don't know how the Board of Health allows this to happen. For a solution we ate on the terrace outside. We also enjoyed the Managers reception with free beer and cocktails, and very good entertainment on certain nights. It is a wonderful time. Caution; if you rent a car the full day parking is $38.

Suggest not to go below Level 9 (which was our level) which has quite pleasant views through the buildings ahead (there are 21 levels in the Hula Tower), but any lower and I would think you would be missing out on some higher view aspects. The biggest down-side for me, was after you opened one of the two sliding balcony doors and stepped outside, you experienced that dreadful oil/fat cooking smell from the variety of restaurants located below. Complete gag material.The apartment itself was quite reasonable but not outstanding in any specific way. Smallish TVs, basic amenities in the bathroom with a tiny bathtub, and no cutlery or crockery in the kitchen. The bathroom could do with the addition of a magnifying mirror and fog-proof glass. Towels and linen were fine.Relaxed/coastal style furniture which looked somewhat aged in style, but in clean condition. Beds were pretty comfy and housekeeping came daily with no complaints - I accidentally left the safe open one morning and they left a kind message and nothing was amiss, which was very good of housekeeping and management.The breakfasts were o-k-a-y but not amazing as I found the eggs completely tasteless no matter which way they were cooked (fresh-egg omelettes or two fried eggs) but the setup was lean and orderly despite being relatively busy at most times of the service, except first thing in the morning. The hot buffet food is barely luke warm (never hot) so dont expect the food to taste great when it's sitting around for a while.Cant fault the location and this gets a 5 out of 5 - barely 2 mins walk across to the beach (go early to reserve your spot of sand unless you want to pay $20/hr for a sunbed (take your turkish towel as some of these looked a bit worn). Take your reef shoes if your feet are sensitive to shells/small rocks of any type.Hotel is right on the Beach Walk which was very handy and you can go through almost completely undercover walking through to Cheesecake Factory in the event of rainy weather.We spent some time at the Level 4 pool and I only wish there was a completely separate area for adults as the Kiddy-times which start promptly from 9am and finish well after the Managers drinks in the evenings, got rather tedious, as I would've liked some quieter times by the pool/spa without being splashed and the constant squealing. The other annoying pool-side quirk was the three oversize round lounge beds are alwasy taken - please make them have have a 2-hour limit that you can pre-reserve, as every day we arrived early and other pool-goers just stay on the beds continually all day long, without letting anyone else enjoy these great lounges. Half the time, the other guets we witnessed hogging these beds were sleeping completely covered up with towels all over the bodies, so not much sun-bathing going on in any case. All in all, a great stay and I would recommend families and others than dont mind kiddies all day long in the pool.","Sydney, Australia",26,5.0

Excellent price and no resort fees, just remember there is a charge for valet parking, nothing you can do about the high prices all over Waikiki. There is also room taxes and other taxes, approx. $30 extra to the room rate. I think this is the best deal compared to other hotels that charge a hefty resort fee. With this hotel you get a bedroom and living room, not just a basic room. I am not sure if it is a luxury type hotel, possibly mid-range but worth every penny. Eriko was pleasant and checked us in, we were given the refreshing tropical drinks. Yummy, what a nice touch, great first impression of things to come. I like how you can sit down when you check in instead of stand in a queue.There's also complimentary infused fruit and herb water in the lobby every day. We stayed in room 1101, Aloha tower. Our room overlooked the food trucks area below, Ft. DeRussy park and all the high rises. We were next to the elevator and it is a one bedroom suite. Spacious, comfortable, sofa bed and TVs in the bedroom and living room. I usually bring my power strip because other hotels lacked outlets to plug in all my electronics. This hotel had outlets on every lamp and the alarm clock was easy to use. The room was very clean and had a mini fridge to put in refreshments and snacks. Room also comes with a microwave. We put the AC on during our stay because even though it was super windy, it was a bit humid. I also sleep with ear plugs so I really didn't notice the noise of the elevator. I rarely heard the elevator come up to the 11th floor after 11pm. There was a local newspaper outside my room every day, a nice touch to read about what's going on in the islands. The best part of staying here is the breakfast buffet every day (included with room rate). Every morning the servers and bussers were very friendly and helpful in asking if everything was ok, did we need our water or juice refilled, etc... The omelette guy was very talented, flipping the omelettes and cooking them really good. Nice touch to have some sriracha on the side. I was also wowed every day when there were different breakfast items to choose from. Again, refreshing tropical drinks, hot tea, coffee you can make and take to go, flavored sparkling water. Everyone was helpful. Since we are 2 hours ahead of Hawaii, we were at the buffet at 7am every day and there was never a big line for the omelette station or the other breakfast selections. Lots of seating as well. Yes, the earlier you go to the buffet, the faster you can eat and get on with sightseeing or whatever. The manager's reception for drinks and entertainment on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 5:30pm to 7:30pm. Keola the bartender was hustling, making few drinks at a time, very good drinks, kept everyone entertained. When his line got a bit too long, we walked past the pool to the other bar. No line at that one to get drinks, shhh! Maybe other guests didn't want to walk all the way to the other side but I didn't want to wait in line. I liked how the entertainment changed as well and kids were allowed, making it a fun family atmosphere. The buffet and reception are located on the 4th floor in Aloha tower, so I am glad we stayed in this one as it was a quick walk down the hallway. Pack light because there is a laundry room on the 3rd floor, at the end of the hallway past the gym. The wash is $3.25 and the dryers cost $3.50? Bring quarters or pay with debit or credit card. No change machine inside this laundry room. I packed some Tide pods in my suitcase (I always do my laundry on vacation, lol) anyways, there are signs saying no powder detergent. Mini liquid detergent is also for sale in a vending machine (bring quarters) I think these cost $1.25? There's also a table and chairs to lounge while waiting for your clothes and also snacks and soda machine. I appreciate how this property ensures safety for guests. The room key is needed to access the laundry room, room to your floor and even the lobby bathroom. The women's last bathroom stall had a bidet! OMG! I never tried it before, TMI but wow, warm toilet seats and all, they have thought of everything. I felt safe during my stay even though the lobby area is wide open. I can't wait to book another stay here at Embassy suites Beachwalk! Everything has exceeded my expectations from beginning to end.","Los Angeles, California",32,5.0

The rooms are bigger and your much closer to the pool, bar and breakfast lanai. This is a really great deal if you are military, retired or a GOV civilian. Government / Military rates are sporadic and really blind luck if your able to get the rate. I found that by continuing to check daily the rates will just become available if your lucky enough to check at just the right time. This is a great option if you are unable to get into the Hale Koa, and it is just down the street if you want to go pick up stuff for the room since the Hale Koa has an exchange and your room at Embassy Suites has a fridge.","Chesapeake, Virginia",13,5.0

These included the Outriggers (both of them). But this was clearly the best hotel have stayed at on the island. We always arrive on the early flight from Melbourne and I know that some hotels will hold your bags until check in (2-3pm) and not sway from this. However, despite the hotel being full the staff provided a nice refreshing drink on arrival, provided us with vouchers to the buffet breakfast upstairs and towels to lounge beside the pool. At 11.00am we were then told that they had cleaned our rooms and we could check in.We had thee bedroom suite with city views. I was amazed at the size of the suites and knew we'd made the right decision as soon as we entered the room. 2 queen beds were in one spacious room and then there was a living area with a sofa bed, table, mini fridge, coffee making equipment, TV, safe etc. The rooms were spotless, bathroom immaculate and 2 balconies.The beds & pillows were so comfortable and enabled us all the have a great sleep after long days tours, swimming, shopping etc.There are a few things which made this hotel very different. There are a lot of hotels that have a 'resort fee' hidden away until you check out. These vary from between 15USD to 30 USD per room per night. You get very little for them.Embassy Suites had no resort fee but even still you get certain extras that other hotels don't provide.1. Free breakfast. Cooked omelettes, fresh fruit, bacon, sausages, hash browns, cereals, breads/bagels etc. This can save a family $30USD a day.2. Manager's reception beside the pool. Free complimentary drinks (including beer / cocktails) between 5.30-7.30 every night. And boy weren't the cocktails potent! No watering down on these drinks. 3. Wi-Fi was fast and reliable.All in all, we had a brilliant trip staying here. I would find the extra dollars and look no where else.

An extremely helpful resevationist Jinny was able to get us another night in our room. She also enabled us to check in to our room right away. Later in our stay, she provided valuable advice on places to eat, etc. All staff throughout the hotel was very friendly and helpful. Our suites was large with a partial view of the ocean which we enjoyed. The hotel is an easy walk to Waikiki beach and close to more shopping than your wallet can handle as well as lots of places to eat. One downside is that parking is $38 per day, which seems high. (We noticed that at trump tower across the street parking is $34 per day.) The other issue is slow elevators, one of which never worked the entire time we were here and service elevator was broken too. We had a similar problem at the embassy suites in saint Petersburg Florida apparently the Hilton doesn't value maintaining all elevators so that guests do not have long waits whenever they need to go someplace.

We stayed at the Embassy Suites for one week and paid for a Partial Ocean View Room. We received a lovely drink on arrival. Check in was quick. We got a top floor suite in the Aloha Tower which we were stoked about!! We had a lovely view of Diamond Head as well as part of the ocean through some buildings. I knew this building was located one block back from the beach so I still got the view i expect us more.. I thought it was a treat to have a view of Diamond Head! Note: you can also go onto the balconies at either side of the building on your level. For us this meant we could take a look overlooking the pool and the at the other side of the building overlooking the city buildings.The suites are awesome.. I booked this hotel because i wanted the decor to feel Hawaiian. I wasn't interested in a modern hotel room. The rooms were very clean and in my opinion well decorated! Loved the palm tree sheer curtains! Breakfast. FREE. What's to complain about? They alternated the pancakes and french toast each day otherwise it looked the same to me. Fresh pineapple everyday, yum. As a suggestion only; It might have been nice to have some plain low fat greek yogurt as a healthy alternative to the strawberry/berry/banana yogurts. Plus more of a variety of cut up fruits each day. As I said though, I'm not complaining.Evening drinks. Also Free! 5:30 -7:30pm. Great variety of drinks. We just had Mai Tais...delicious. A variety of snacks you can nibble on. Room service although great, came at a different time each day. Once at around 9am (bit early if you are having a sleep in?) And another time after lunch. Didn't bother me, just commenting as Ive read reviews that have commented the same. Consistency would be nice for some people I am sure.Pool. It was closed when we checked in. I won't lie, I was disappointed as we weren't told about the maintenance upon booking or prior to our arrival. They gave us access to the pool at the Outrigger across the road. Luckily for us though the pool reopened sooner than expected and perfect timing for us as a pool day was planned that following day. Beach access. Easy. Across the road down the pathway. Or walk down to the main beach area of Waikiki.Free wifi in room. No resort fees. Close to shops and restaurants. ABC store across the road from hotel is apparently the only one that has the Dole Whip (pineapple ice cream) according to one of my tour guides..another win! In conclusion; Definitely staying here again in the future. I had been to Waikiki before and stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Royal Hawaiian. Obviously the Royal Hawaiian is a prestigious hotel. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is great also but Embassy Suites offers a wonderful location, no resort fees, free wifi, free breakfast, free evening drinks... Awesome stay!

This hotel is a family friendly hotel and there were families with children ranging from almost birth upwards. There is a beautiful pool area with shade umbrellas available and a children's pool, although halfway through our stay they closed the pool for maintenance. But it was more than made up for by the fact that the hotel had made arrangements for their guests to use the Outrigger hotel pool. Happy hour at 5.30 pm was our favourite time of the day. Free drinks and cocktails until 7.30 pm along with nibbles. The hotel is very central to everything - beaches, shopping, restaurants and transport. You could also book buses at the bell desk if you needed to go places such as the Waikele Outlets for shopping or Pearl Harbour. We even walked one street over and caught a trolley bus to the Ala Moana shopping centre. The trolley buses are very convenient and very cheap. The recreation booking desk in the hotel was also very good and helped us to book a day tour around the island with Huka Tours.

Kids loved walking on the balcony and looking at the ocean. Not an amazing view but you could see it from the balcony. Food - The breakfast area was always clean and plenty of seating. There was a lot of people during breakfast but the food was always stocked. Never had an issue. Tables were cleaned quickly as guests left. The evening drinks and snacks was a great way to end the day. The live entertainment was great and the kids loved listening to the band. The snacks usually included pretzels and goldfish. Nothing too exciting but it was standard snack items kids would enjoy. The drink options were limited but was okay. Staff - Nothing over the top for front desk.

Overall - Open area from lobby to the elevator leaving outside traffic to walk around. In order to take the elevator to your room you had to have a key.

The hotel itself is more up to date than I thought it would be. The room was very nice and had a Hawaiian feel to it. The mini kitchenette was more than adequate with a fridge, microwave, and sink. The room also had a desk and chair, a sofa and side chair plus coffee table. We had 2 decks off our suite. The bedroom had plenty of space for our pack-n-play that my toddler son slept in. It also had more than adequate storage including an armoir and dresser plus another TV! Our room must have been upgraded – Hula Tower 2032- ask for it! It had a great ocean view and was quiet even though we were next to the elevator. Avoid floor 4 through – that’s the floor for the pool and breakfast area – I imaging that floor would get loud. The hotel has an amazing happy hour that is essential a 2 hour open bar!! Every night we went at 5:30 on the nose, to grab a drink before dinner. It was a little hard with the time change and a toddler – he was super tired at dinner at night and he woke up for 2 days before 5am, finally on the last day he slept still 6:30. It’s fine though since then you can get breakfast before the crowds and be ready to hit the beach early! The pool was closed while we were there but we made do since the beach was super close and the pool next door was literally a 1 min walk away (don’t listen to the complainers below). They opened the pool a few days earlier than expected and it was open on our last day but we didn’t even use it. The location is ideal – walking distance to everything! Lots of cheap restaurants too – we found a bunch that we liked – there’s spam musubi shop nearby, several amazing ramen spots too. We liked AGU ramen, Ramen Nakamura and Aloha Table. The food court in the plaza next door had great burgers (Mahaloha burger) and yummy desserts. The main Waikiki beach is really nice despite being busy. We rented a standup paddleboard for an hour ($25) and took turns on it – we both got to see sea turtles swimming! My son enjoyed playing in the sand for hours at a time! If you walk down the beach to the sea wall, there is some structure near the wall that you can snorkel around and see a few fish. We love snorkeling but with a toddler we don’t get many opportunities to see fish!We also rented a car and parking was expensive ($38/day) but it allowed us to check out a bunch of other amazing beaches. Lanikai was our favorite. We also went to Kailua next door. And we did a bunch of beaches on the north shore which were less ideal for toddlers. We did see more turtles there though! Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel for families or really anyone wanting a convenient location with plenty of included amenities. We stayed at the Hale Koa (military hotel) with my parents before and it was also nice, but this was even better! Just check for when the rates are decent and be aware that parking is expensive. Have fun!","San Francisco, California",40,5.0

The staff the breakfast and the drinks each night made for a wonderful holiday. Our only disappointment was not being told beforehand that the pool would be out of action for the time we were there. Also our room was located in the aloha tower room 1411 and our bedroom wall backed on to the lifts and the noise from this did not allow for restful sleep. So beware of all rooms on any floor ending with 11. The air conditioning was rather noisy this time. We would stay there again but definitely no where near the lifts.,"Brisbane, Australia",6,4.0

We stay at Embassy suites across the globe (GOLD Honors member) so we know what to expect. In fact, I've stayed at this particular hotel 4 times previously with no problems. This time, EXTREMELY disappointed. So here's my view of the ""Goods"" and the ""Bads"" for this past week.Goods:(1) Easy access and close to the beach(2) Breakfast and nightly happy hour included (I'm not stating ""FREE"" because I'm sure we pay for it in the cost of the stay).Bads:(1) Booked in May, arrived Saturday afternoon 10/15 and was told the pool was CLOSED. We should have been advised prior to arrival and given options to cancel or relocate. When asked, many of the employees themselves did not know until a day or two prior to it closing. How can one go to Hawaii and the pool be closed for the entire week? Although they offered a pool at a different hotel across the street, it would have been very inconvenient to transit back and forth, especially if we needed something from our room. We decided to forego the offer to use a different hotel's pool and did the beach instead.(2) Every time we retrieved the car from the valet, it arrived with more dents and scratches than when it was turned over. Significant scratches.(3) Visitors with LARGE inflatables crowded the small elevators night and day making it difficult to comfortably and conveniently reach the room. When we approached the manager, we were rudely informed that Hawaii did not have laws against bringing inflatables on elevators. Ok, we get that....but shouldn't the hotel think about applying a local ""Hotel Policy"". Either take the steps, or deflate the toys prior to getting into an elevator for the convenience of other guests.(4) The hotel was crowded with kids running and screaming all over the place, in the dining area, on the patio, in the hallways, etc. I know this is not the responsibility of the hotel, but it certainly made the stay less enjoyable.(5) Upon returning to our room one evening, we exited the elevator and were met with someone's dirty, sandy shoes, and laundry laying in the hallway. Again, not the hotel's fault, but really? That's just gross.(6) We asked to speak to a manager about all of the above, and were met with a ho-hum yawning attitude. We were informed we needed to speak with the manager the next morning.(7) Next morning, asked for the manager. Advised him of our concerns and informed him we had decided to depart 2 days early (hence, this is why I regretted pre-paying because we lost 2 day's stay at $239 a night....nearly $500 down the drain). His response to us....""Ok. You're all checked out. Bye."" Now that's Customer Service (not). Additionally, we had to pay 3 nights at another hotel because of our disappointment in this Embassy Suites. Another 3 nights is not cheap on top of what we lost by moving early from Embassy.So, would I recommend this hotel again? Maybe or maybe not. If the hotel values its customers and customer service, they should review their policies and make a few changes.","Chesapeake, United States",5,2.0

Views were nice (blocked a bit by the Outrigger, but didn't bother us). We had a fantastic view of the fireworks from the big Hilton complex up the road. The free breakfast daily was good - reasonable freshness and variety, and very convenient. Bills Sydney is just down the street (about 200m walk) if you need a 'real' coffee. The accessibility to Waikiki shops and the beach was good. A short, easy walk. Our kids are 6 and 8. And they are happy with just the beach, so we only need to carry a room key and a towel each. There's a free Managers Reception each night. This involves 2 hours (5.30-7.30pm) of a basically open bar (free cocktails, beers, juices, etc) and snacks (nachos, breadsticks, carrot sticks, dips). Some nights there were big lines. Some nights were quiet. They also have the kitchen open, which made an easy dinner option after a big day. The hotdog and cheese pizza were winners. So was the grilled chicken and veg. The spring roll appetizer was extreme (see photo).Only frustration with the dining was some mornings at breakfast they were really slow at clearing and cleaning. And some nights it was near impossible to find a server to place a menu order with. The room itself was good. It had a lounge/dining space with a sink and bar fridge. The bedroom had 2 queen beds. Beds were comfortable. Pillow options were amble. There were balconies off both the lounge and bedroom. Bathroom was a good size. Room was well cleaned daily, by lovely staff.

We enjoyed our last 9 night stay here so did not even look at alternative locations for our recent 9 night stay in Waikiki. I must say that we were extremely disappointed this visit and found that standards have slipped significantly.I'll start with the positives.. Breakfast and evening drinks are included in the room rate. Housekeeping service was excellent and our Housekeeper quickly learnt our routine and cleaned around it. She was great! The location is as good as you can get in Waikiki - close to everything without being over-crowded. The rooms are an ok size. Valet and Bell Service were very positive and helpful and the team who worked the breakfast were happy and friendly. Pool area is nice but shade is limited.Unfortunately, the negatives outweighed the positives for us. We arrived a 2:55pm from another island and were told our room was not ready but would be ready in 5 minutes. We were then left waiting for 35 minutes with little care factor from the front desk. In fact, every dealing we had with the team at the front desk ended with us feeling disappointed and upset. We never received our welcome bag. The bag would have come in handy. The quality of the breakfast has declined and we found one of the omelette cooks did not know how to cook an omelette. Being Australian, we learnt from our last visit and brought Vegemite with us so that we could have toast each morning. Pool side service was slow (if any was provided). Advertising states a kitchenette. This is little more than a teeny fridge with a basin and microwave that doesn't work. No crockery or cutlery provided. Probably deceptive to call that a kitchenette... WiFi was simply awful. If you need this to work or it is important to you, stay elsewhere. It was frustrating having to log back into the system with passwords every time you wanted to access WiFi and then wait 30 minutes for a couple of emails to download.I also hate to say it, but many of my fellow guests would leave their children at the pool for hours at a time unsupervised and as there are no hotel staff present, nothing was done and the kids running wild impacted the safety of other children in the pool and the comfort of other guests. On check out, they stuffed up our room charge and then charged us twice. The girl on the desk clearly did not know what she was doing. Whilst we managed to get this resolved about a week later, the entire incident ended up costing us an additional $300 in currency conversion fees and lost currency rates. This was not about holds on funds (which is standard hotel practice). They do take random holds on your funds throughout your stay of amounts that do not make any sense - we never queried this. I was left feeling extremely unhappy with the way the situation was handled and could not trust them to conduct any more transactions. Please ensure you check all transactions they conduct against your cards.Do ask for a higher floor. We had no major issues from noise on the street.

We ate breakfast early to avoid long waits and it provided us with a good start to the day. There is no doubt that this is a family oriented hotel, lots of young children occupy the pool all day, so this may not suit those looking for a quiet or romantic get away.

We were able to check in about an hour early if we went for a lower floor. We opted to do so it was the 12th floor. We did still get woken around 6:30am by the rubbish trucks as we were city facing but it wasn't too bothersome. Probably the higher you go the better this might be. This was the end of our stay after been to Maui & other end of Waikiki, so great to have breakfast included for convenience. We didn't find it too busy at breakfast. Kids loved the pool. And spa was great too. Strong smell of chlorine on our togs after but better that than germs! Elevators are slooooow. Don't expect to get anywhere in a hurry. LOVED location after staying right down other end of Waikiki much preferred this end by all the great restaurants/shops. Roy's is practically in the lobby. And beach isn't too far. Check in was easy, we didn't have big cues like other hotels. Options for families can be more limited in Hawaii i.e. Getting 2 bedrooms etc can be hard/expensive. And did lots of research. Embassy isn't cheap, we were able to cover some with air miles which helped but there's no doubt having 3 rooms i.e. 2 bedrooms, a lounge & 2 bathrooms was great for our family. We booked about 4 months out but lots of the more family type hotels were already booked out so my advice is to get in early.

With the whirlwind of graduation, getting him ready for college and everything in between, this review is long overdue (since we stayed earlier in June), but the service at the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk was by far the BEST all around service we have ever experienced and they deserve an EXCELLENT review.When I began looking for a hotel in Waikiki, I soon realized there are very few that offered the amenities we were looking for. This Embassy Suites seemed to have everything we wanted: two queen size beds (difficult to find in Waikiki) in a separate room; a sofa bed in the living room; an ocean view (this means we were able to sit on our sofa and see the ocean through our window); not one, but two lanais; a pool; a complimentary full breakfast buffet with a wonderful omelet station; an evening reception with snacks and drinks (including alcohol); centrally located to everything; and no resort fees. The Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk is well-appointed and an outstanding value for your money.The amenities are wonderful, but the hospitality is even more superior. From the first time I called to make the reservation (with Malia Espinda, Guest Experience Manager) to the moment we were departing the property, we were treated with the essence of the Aloha spirit and felt like family the entire stay. Malia did not announce herself on our call as a manager (I only learned that later when we arrived), she simply took great care to answer all of my questions in a friendly way and did not make me feel like I was bothering her at all. Based on that call alone, I was even more excited about our upcoming trip. In addition to Malia, all the staff persons we encountered were fantastic. However, there are some I would like to recognize by name because, like Malia, they took extra good care of us. A special thank you to Jay and Cindy at the front desk for the regular aloha greetings and laughs; to our housekeeper Angela who made sure our room was tidy and well stocked; to Aldrin and Cary for welcoming us to breakfast and offering island tips for ways to spend our days; to Bryan for happily making great omelets and eggs to order; and to Keoni at the Bell Desk for sharing great tips for Pearl Harbor, including transportation. In fact, Keoni went the extra mile to have breakfast-to-go meals ready for our family one morning because we had to leave extra early for an excursion and did not have time to enjoy the breakfast buffet.It’s the exceptional service at the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk that made this family vacation exceed our expectations; it’s not very often that you arrive not knowing anyone and leave feeling special like you’re family. The next time we return to Waikiki, we will only stay here. Mahalo to all of you, especially Malia, we miss you all! - The Samoy Family","Stockton, California",8,5.0

Checkin is actually an enjoyable experience, staff are attentive and friendly and actually care about their job. One nice feature about the checkin in the tropical feel of the checkin area and the complimentary tropical drink that is served to all guests. (Non alcoholic - sorry booze hounds :P) The bell boy doesn't ask for a tip, even with a family of massive and heavy bags. (you still should give him a few $ anyway though)The rooms are nice with a balcony (Which is the first thing to be barricaded off from my infant and 6 year old. The rooms include a decent bathroom with an empty vanity, hairdryer, and a shaver? The shower/bath has a nice little system to alternate between the systems which can be a bit finicky (the water can come from the bath tap instead of the shower head.) but overall, it was pretty nice, temperature can be adjusted precisely, (I like very, very hot showers and occasionally freezing showers and both can be achieved.) the water pressure however, isn't really anything to rave about. Pressure can drop a massive amount if all the taps are on in the double room (two rooms join to make one massive one.) but it is usually manageable. The room layout we had is called the ""Grand Lanai"" (with balcony and double rooms) which includes a living room/kitchenette and balcony, flanked by a bedroom on either side. I HIGHLY recommend that you dead-lock the bedroom doors if you like to sleep late (until 10 or 11 or so) as the maids can come in accidentally and that isn't a fun way to spend your holiday. I don't sleep in so I really don't have anything to worry about, just a heads up. One gripe I had about this hotel is the elevators, there is two of them for everyone in the hotel. (theres a staff one, but you cannot get into that too easily ;) Wait times at the elevators can be a few minutes as they aren't rockets. Just plan your elevator trip carefully! ;PThe dining area offers a full buffet breakfast with a two chef's manning the omelette stations. The food includes breakfast staples - all of them, fresh fruit, spreads, (please have Vegemite, I'm Aussie and NEED Vegemite - it's also fun to see people who aren't used to the taste, go and try a big dollop of the black Aussie delicacy and spit it out in disgust - you would know how funny it is if you're an Aussie) and a variety of juices, water, ice, soft drinks and tea/coffee in a separate booth. The hall where you eat has a MAJOR PROBLEM, though, if you take your eye off the food for even a second, it gets commandeered and eaten by the birds instantly. There is a area for families the is separated by a door but that is small and I don't really like it! This area as well as the pool area mentioned below has a live band playing there every night.The pool/spa area is usually quite empty (why would you like to go to a pool when you are at the Surfing and beach capital of the world?) and has a bar/cafe right next to it. Food is nice overall. If you go to reception and go down the corridor out of the building, you will be on the main drag, with shops, food courts and everything else around you.Overall, it is a great hotel and has many nice features, a few area that need improvement but I would recommend it to anyone without thinking twice!","Sydney, Australia",4,4.0

Our room faced the city and its okay. Balcony kind of small but really spent our time outside our suite exploring Waikiki. Our room had a mini fridge, sink, microwave and coffee pot. Enough to store our drinks and leftovers. Pool is okay, but rather be on the beach anyways. Slept like a baby even if our room was next to the elevator.

Pool was great got our two young boys but pool side deck chairs were in hot demand early on. The staff were great to reset deck chairs when they are not being used. Makes it easy to get to a good spot to keep an eye on the kids. Valet and concierge was excellent proactive and eager to help with all rhe shopping and give advice for excursions.

The 0.5 point off is b/c at the breakfast, their fresh cut fruit, either melon or cantaloupe, went sour every morning, and their peach tasted blend. I can understand this, as most of the fruit was ""imported"". Their local pineapple tasted great!And that's all my complaints. Great location. In the middle of everything. Very short walk to the beach. Hotel gift shop, a large ABC store, and a food truck yard right down stairs. Royal Hawaiian Center and Aloha Landing , a tour bus pick up center, and the post office were within 3 minutes walk. Farmer's Market is held outside hotel on Thursday afternoon/evenings. Like I said, in the middle of everything.We stayed on 14th floor in Hula tower, facing Imperial Hotel. Although it is a City View room, you will see the ocean from the balcony. Separate climate control in the living room and the bedroom. Very quiet and spacious. If you happened to be awake at 6 am, you would hear the truck backing in, but it was not loud enough to wake you up. With the water sink in the kitchen I got to do dishes without interrupting my son's nap, and while have swimming suites soak in the facial sink in the bathroom at the same time. Unlike other Embassy Suites, there was a electric kettle in the kitchen! I liked it very much. If you do the on-line check-in, the map shown during the process is misleading. It shows as if the elevators were next to room **26, but they are actually located next to room **21 and **32. Don't pick those rooms. Every hotel asks you to save the Earth by reusing the towel, but this Embassy Suites had more than that. It has a simple robe hook next to the bath tub! That's all it takes! I reused my towel for the entire week. No, I don't use fresh towel very day at home, I put them in the washer every one or two weeks. But I got to hang them dry properly at home. Most hotels expect you to do the same at their property, but don't offer you the hooks! In fact, the more hooks you put in the bathroom, the less towel you will see on the floor. I like the effort ES made. Although I do hope there were places to hang the wet swimming suites, especially you know people will get in the ocean or the pool every single day. My son loved the salt water pool. There was a area just for babies. The water was only 1 and 1/2 feet. Anyone can sit up properly should be safe in there. The free breakfast was great other than the fruit, the evening snack was good. Bell and valet services were fast. Overall, great place and I will stay there again.",CA,29,4.0

There are 3 elevators in the hula tower so you were never waiting very long for a ride. Their breakfast staff did an amazing job keeping the food well stocked and tables cleaned. Their selection of food was great and they tried to switch up their selection from day to day. Look for Aldrin. This guy makes working look fun. He always greeted us with a ""Good Morning"" and made sure tables were cleaned for the next group right away. He never stopped working and always had a smile on his face. He is a great asset to this hotel. I was a little hesitant on the valet parking, but their parking staff was great. We never waited more than 5 minutes for our vehicle, even during peak time. The only disappointment I had was with the rate. I booked the AAA family fun rate because of the faster internet that they advertised only to find out at check-in was there was no faster internet. I could have saved $85 or so if I knew there was no difference. I did let the staff know about this issue upon check-in and check-out and they said they would let management know.

My wife and I stayed in a one bedroom suite with our 2 sons (13 and 5)The rooms were amazingly clean. Even the vents were spotless. Bathroom is hugeBeds are super comfortable. Breakfast was great. It had so many options and kept us full until early evening so we saved money!! Some reviews complain about a line but even during the busiest times I had my food and was sitting in less than 10 minutes. Evening reception was great and live entertainment played well. The snacks were mostly pretzels and chex mix. They have free drinks and soda.Staff is very pleasant and always helpful. Definitely meant for families. Tons of kids in the pool which is not ideal for me to swim in but the kids always had someone to play with. The pool also has a soft bottom which does feel odd. It could use an update.About Waikiki:The best beach area we found was in front of Dukes. No rocks and had huge sandbar. Nice waves to body surf but also great for little kids too. It is like a wave pool. We had our 5 year old wear life jacket which have us piece of mind. You can rent rafts, body boards and umbrellas. There are plenty of places on the beach so take a look around for the best price. If your going to eat out anywhere do so early. By 8p it was over an hour wait anywhere we went. ",,4,5.0

The managers drink were extremely popular and a great way to finish the day. The nibbles were appreciated as well. The location was spot on. To catch the pink line shuttle to ala Moana shopping centre you simply cross the road through the trump building, there's a pathway down the side, and walk down to the post office where the punk line bus/shuttle picks you up.

We have stayed at numerous hotels in Waikiki but think we would now come back here.The breakfast buffet provided has many choices and we always managed to get a table, even during very busy time of 9-10am. Staff provide you with a warning for final drinks / food before they start closing. The buffet provides a good start to the day, then at 5.30 we enjoyed the complimentary snacks, drinks and good live music. Never stayed anywhere that provided all that as part of the room rate.We liked the great location. Previously stayed at Ilikai hotel which was good for walking to Ala Moana mall but this hotel much more central to restaurants. We regularly walked though Trump hotel to Saratoga Road to get the $2 Pink line trolley bus to the mall and back. This is very handy.The pool is great for kids and adults, would recommend going in morning as later in day gets very busy, however always seemed to be seats available. Spa nice as well and staff regularly walk round to provide drinks and food. We were on top floor level 21 and enjoyed a wee view of sea/mountain, and handy as we could always get in the lift down! I did a tour to Shangri-La (Doris Dukes museum which I'd recommend as change from sun/sea) and when I asked for taxi they provide the hotel taxi- a stretch limo which was a bit of fun.The staff are very friendly and have just provided a CD of Hawaiian music as a goodbye gift.If I could request one thing it would be a few mugs, plates in the wee kitchen. We usually bring food from the foodlands supermarket a couple of nights which is fantastic (unfortunately they are reloading in Ala Moana so currently closed).

The Embassy Suites was one of the only 'hits' that came up, and I am really glad we ended up choosing it.One thing to realize is that food is very expensive in Hawaii, as so much (75%?) is imported from elsewhere. Thus having a complimentary breakfast for 5 daily is worth at least $75 on every room's price. We knew this and were glad we factored that into the decision.We were amazed by the friendliness and outgoing helpfulness of everyone on the staff. The manager at registration (Ray) was great and made us feel very welcome. The breakfast staff was also very friendly - even offering to get us drinks when they were 10 feet away from us. Resty stands out as one of these great staff.We also had a very nice extended conversation with a female manager on staff (Selema?) when we were just relaxing. All in all we found the staff extremely friendly.The location is nice - its a block away from the beach, and above the beachwalk, which is an urban strip-mall and entertainment space. Lots of things going on and tons of restaurant options nearby. Also a great nest of 5 ethnic food trucks that we went to twice.The only staff complaint we have is that it was very difficult to communicate and coordinate with our housekeeper on when she would be able to clean our room. We would leave at 7am or so each day, return around 1pm for our 4-year old to nap, and somehow she wouldnt try to clean our room until 1pm. After the second day, we started making a point of explicitly telling her when we were leaving and expecting to return in the hopes it could be done by then, but it wasn't helping. One day our room wasn't cleaned at all, and another we had to leave at 2pm while she cleaned. This is a relatively minor issue, but it was frustrating (likely just a communication issue - she was very nice).The other small suggestion we had was that there were only 2 hooks in the bathroom to hang towels and clothes for 5 people! This might be something to consider given that its a beach hotel (with a big pool).Overall, we had a great stay and would come back tomorrow if it were possible. Our comments above are just suggestions. Congratulations on a great property and for attracting and retaining such great staff.",Pittsburgh,15,5.0

It has a large pool, baby pool and spa with shaded and non-shaded lounge chairs near the bar. They have live bands every second night, which is enjoyable and family friendly. The buffet for breakfast was amazing, including a variety of food from range of cereals and juices, to pancakes, eggs and bacon and different pastries alongside fresh fruit and much more.

I'm just submitting this review a little later. Also see me review of Maui Coast Hotel with information of my stay on maui.The room (had a balcony), breakfast and the location was excellent. Our room looked over the main lanai and the pool. The room is clean. We went running every other morning. There were parks nearby to run to. I'm never psyched with a forced valet service ($30/day). But in this area, it's worth it if you rented a car. I couldn't imagine finding parking everyday and worrying about parking rules and meters.It was nice to have breakfast within the hotel. It's a hot breakfast (omlette station, eggs, waffle maker, pancakes, home fries, toast station, bagels) with cold breakfast options (fruit, yogurt, salad). There is an acai berry juice that is soooo good. Breakfast is great to say the least.The hotel is not on the beach but it's a short walk to the beach. Waikiki beach is rocky. It's ideal to get a car rental and drive to the north shore. It's also less hustle and bustle on the Noth shore.The pool was peaceful-not too many people and not too many kids.We went to Pearl Harbor and hiked at Olomana trail. Pearl Harbor is entirely free but you do have to go to the window to get a ticket for the boat ride to the Arizona Memorial. The ticket is free but you need the ticket to reserve a seat. Check the website for peak times and peak seasons where they run out of tickets. When you get on the boat, sit on the right side of the boat brcause you can get a nice photo as you're approaching the memorial. When you get off the boat, linger behind everyone because when everyone gets off, they all rush to the wall of names in the back of the memorial. You can get a nice picture of the wall of names when a boat is arriving to take people back. When you're leaving, sit at the back of the boat because you can get a nice photo of the memorial with the wake of the boat in the foreground. The hike at Olomana was difficult for me (I have short legs). I'm also not an experienced hiker. Just remember you have to decend wherever you ascend.

We stayed at this property before and knew what to expect. As stated above, we like the central Waikiki location of this property, because of its closeness to shopping, restaurants and the beach.While a good value, the breakfast buffett can be a challenge to get to its 4th floor Grand Lanai location.

The hotel itself is good, the pool and gym facilities are adequate and the short walk to the beach is a plus. Our room (2101, One Bedroom Suite One King Bed City View) was a little small but very clean. Whilst I am a light sleeper, the room was right next to the lifts and I found the noise unsettling. Also, we found the air-conditioning to be highly unusual - sounded like there was a storm happening!Pro's:- Excellent staff (all extremely friendly and helpful).- Buffet breakfast included (make your own omelette, basic fruit and hot breakfast, cereal and drip coffee).- Swimming pool is great for little ones (not too deep), though very busy with the many families staying at the hotel.- Rooms are very clean and well stocked.- Gym is adequate (i.e. 3 treadmills, 2 bikes, elliptical, free weights, cable and pulley machine and other small weight machines).- On-site washing/drying machines (look at cons below).- No resort fees.- Good internet coverage.Cons:- Washing machines are only credit card operated. Can be costly as our fee per card transaction was $8.00. - Our room was very noisy (between the lift operation and air conditioning sounds, I had to buy ear plugs).- LOTS of families with young children. This makes the buffet breakfast and pool outings an ""adventure"".Overall, our experience with the hotel was good.

I did not book through the hotel itself as I said but next time as a Hilton Honor member I would see what the price was and check with hotel first.Our Jetstar arrive 6am and we knew very well check in time was 3pm. Because of hitch in another matter I sat in the foyer as I was completely spent till around midday. During that time others were being place in their rooms. In fairness we were given voucher for breakfast and lift to 4th floor only, a very nice move by the manager. I think we arrived in our room around 1pm on 21st floor. We looked over the street below front entrance. Quite and very nice. A few rooms up from lifts.Breakfast for us was I would say, catering for Asian and US patrons. As well travelled Europe travellers we do enjoy the healthier options more that are offered there. But saying that we did not go hungry. There were great self-serving drink stations, juice, water. Coffee, soft drink and water. And the staff a few face I recall form 2012 were still there offering to get your coffee saying hello to everyone and clearing continually. Don’t leave your food unattended as birds are frequently steal it. One in particular staff there was outstanding. 50/10Pancakes, sweet cakes, toast that you can make, omelettes that they make and varied food offered daily. Fruit was there also.Every second night music from band was absolutely fantastic, they got the joint rockin.. every single time. 100/10 for them. The Happy 2 hours nightly offered with an assortment of drinks and coffee and soft drink if you wanted was available 30/10. If you did not want the nibbles that are available, you could have ordered reasonably priced food too. I thought the food that was free was average. But hey the drinks made it all quite a good. Serving staff during the night were very nice both at the bar and the food. Drinks were strong and generous. 2 faces that there in 2012. Worth their weight in gold.Our room staff were so nice and very friendly.So if you are looking for fun entertainment each 2nd night, happy 2 hours big breakfasts, lovely pool area and friendly staff then this is your place to be.I would go again if I could get a better deal for sure.",Sydney,27,5.0

Our room was ready when we arrived from the airport around 2pm so no waiting. Everything went smoothly and we loved the punch that was presented during checkin. We had an Oceanview room 1908 in the Aloha tower (further from the beach) that had a great view of the pool area. While the view of the ocean was OK, we all preferred the pool view so we could see what was going on there. The room was a classic Embassy Suites room. 2 Queens in the bedroom and the living area with a kitchenette with microwave and mini fridge. Our room was clean and we had no issues with daily housekeeping.We were so tired from traveling the first day but could not pass up the managers reception. We truly enjoyed our complimentary cocktails everyday from 5:30-7:30p. The drinks were strong, sometimes too strong, but were easily fixed by adding a little more of the chaser. Also, don't be put off by the drink lines. They go really fast!Breakfast buffet was also really good. Made to order omelettes, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, pancakes, French toast, yogurt, fruit, beads, danishes, cereal and a bunch of stuff that I didn't eat. I believe they were Japanese options. All of it was delicious. We always found ourselves up at 6am so would always be waiting for breakfast to open at 6:30a. The time change really messed us up. Haha. But it helps to get our day started off right.We used the Expedia travel desk to book our Luau. Ended up at Chiefs and it was amazing from start to finish. Pickup was at Trump Resort next door with entrance on Saratoga. We splurged on the Royal package because I wanted to be in the front and didn't want my kids to have to look over too many heads. It was perfect!Little tips :--Check out the Long's drug store on the corner of Beachwalk and Kalakaua for all your needs. It's in the CVS family. --There's also an ABC store directly across the street on Lewers. --There's an entrance to the hotel right beside Yardbird on Lewers (found this out after two days). Don't miss the Lobster Garlic Noodles there. Yum. --Don't miss the Steak Shack. Cheap delicious eats just 3 minutes away right on the beach. --Cute little place called Beachwalk Cafe had the best macarons. It's two minutes away on Beachwalk and Kalia. --The beach is a two minute walk away but we much preferred the beach in front of the Outrigger Beach Resort (not Outrigger Reef Resort). The vendor there rented beach chairs and umbrellas which was important to us. It was about $10 per hour for the 2-chair and umbrella set. And we didn't have to worry about the rocks. --You can easily catch the bus (routes 42 or 20) to Pearl Harbor with no transferring. Ride is about one hour. It's $2.50 one way per adult and $1.25 per child over 6 (exact change). Sure beats the high cost of tours and you can go and leave when you want. Just one tip. If you MUST go to the USS Arizona memorial, you need to reserve tickets online in advance for about $1 per ticket. Otherwise the ticket is free on site but there may be a wait. For example, we arrived around 11a but the tour to the memorial wasnt available until 2pm. There is a lot to see without the memorial and we found that with my kids, the museum was enough. We stayed about 2 hours. We would have stayed another 2-3 hours to ferry over to the memorial and back.Last but not least, our flight home on the last day was not until 7:30pm. After we checked out, we were able to store our luggage with the bell desk. After that we had a pool day until around 3. Then asked for the hospitality suite to freshen up. This one last thing really made the Embassy Suites stand out to us. We are able to shower, repack our things and get ready to head out for our flight. It really made a world of difference for our family. Great service overall!","Houston, Texas",24,5.0

I don't know if most travelers are rude or what, but just a couple of words of conversation and it was like we were family to them. Everyone went above and beyond if we had a request, even called the bus company to check on routes and times for our return trip from surfing because of the memorial day parade. Lleuellyn had a bright smile every morning when we headed for breakfast and a cheery ""how are you, what are you doing today?"" followed by a short conversation. We got on the elevator with a smile every time because it was contagious. Aldin at breakfast picked up where she left off, John the omelet chef, Kenny at the bell desk, Ray the night manager, Tali on the checkin desk that arranged a late checkout, and on and on.

I was also somewhat disappointed in my ""ocean"" view. I know that there is always a difference between ""ocean view"" and ""ocean front"", but I didn't know it would be that drastic. I had to look to the left just to get a sliver of the ocean that was blocked by another hotel. Had I known this, I would have just reserved a standard room.

It has two tall buildings with pool and restaurant (for morning breakfast buffet and afternoon happy hour) in between two buildings on the fourth floor. There are many restaurants, shops, convenience stores, and one drug store within walking distance.  Our family of four stayed there for 4 nights last month. We had a pleasant time. However, we felt we did not get good advice from the concierge service. I talked to the staff at the concierge desk a couple of time. I told her we were going to drive to North Shore one day and she recommended Polynesian Cultural Center. I followed her advice and bought 4 tickets at $453 total for luau and show (Breath of Life) on a weekday night. She said very specifically that the earliest check-in time was 4pm as luau seating would start at 4:30pm. The time was also printed clearly on the receipt. When asked if the park entrance was included, she said NO. We thought the price was high but accepted it as we did not know any better. After tasting the garlic shrimp (from the famous shrimp truck) and shaved ice in Haleiwa, we drove around North Shore aimlessly because we did not want to arrive too early. Once we got there at 4pm, we were told that park entrance was included in the tickets we bought. In other words, we could have seen shows and taken canoe rides in various parts of the Cultural Center if we had arrived earlier. I was very upset when I heard what we had missed. The customer service person regretted that he could not give us any credit but we could go back within the next three days which was no help because we were leaving the next day.  After expressing our displeasure to Embassy Suites, the assistant general manager responded as follows: I’ve forwarded your comments to Expedia as it appears that you were given some misinformation. Their area manager will recommunicate with his staff about providing the correct information to all Expedia agents about all tours, especially the popular ones like Pearl Harbor and Polynesian Cultural Center.

The location is very central to Waikiki - there are several top restaurants nearby as well as food truck. We literally could go downstairs to Henry's place to buy sliced papaya or mango and come right back upstairs to eat. The breakfast was included and bountiful - egg station, miso soup, salad, fruit, and many more. Valet is $35 and there is no self parking. The only thing I felt that could have been better is the swimming pool area - too crowded especially at the Manager's Reception, but it's minor. Overall, I'm really happy that we stayed there.

We were provided with a suite on the southeast corner of the hotel on the 11th floor, so we had balconies on both the south and east side of the room. Now the ESH Waikiki Beach Walk is not directly on the beach, but back about a block - however our south-facing balcony had a nice view of the ocean, though flanked by the Halekulani and Outrigger Reef hotels on either side.If you like to shop - particularly in high-end stores, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better location than the ESH Waikiki Beach Walk. You are literally in the middle of a newly-renovated shopping district with Beverly-Hills-esque shops and galleries in every direction. Chanel, Gucci, Tiffany's, and many more, all within a block - and of course, a Starbuck's on just about every corner. Lots of well-reviewed restaurants within minutes as well, though, to be honest, the best meal we had during our 7-day stay was at the Denny's just across the street!Our room was open and airy, comfortably appointed in a tropical style, and included a little kitchenette containing a mini-fridge, microwave and sink. The fridge didn't have a freezer section in it, so stocking up on Haagen-Dazs ice-cream bars for a late-night snack was not an option (I think that was the only negative criticism I could come up with!). The beds were firm but comfortable, and everything was scrupulously clean and in good repair. And the SHOWER - let me expound a bit on hotel showers...Most hotels - even the really nice expensive ones - use these ""water miser"" shower heads, where you have to stand under them for a five full minutes before you can even properly call yourself wet. I think that if you're spending hundreds of dollars every night to stay at a four-star hotel, management should spring FOR MORE THAN A NICKEL'S WORTH OF WATER!!! (You can tell that I feel strongly about this.) Okay, that said, the Embassy Suites by Hilton Waikiki Beach Walk hotel's shower, at least in my room, was quite possibly the best hotel shower I've ever experienced. I'm talking awesome-water-pressure, full-on, high-volume 'water-waster', get-wet-in-five-seconds, best-ever shower! And even though we were on the 11th floor, the water was hot in under 15 seconds. Now, the ESH Waikiki Beach Walk is not a new hotel, but it IS well-run, well-maintained, and all other aspects of our stay were just as pleasant as were our showers.From concierge to housekeeping, the entire hotel staff was extremely attentive, efficient and friendly, and we had the feeling that they were actually happy to be working there. Just good energy all around. Next time we stay in Waikiki, this hotel is where you'll find us!","Waikiki, Hawaii",4,5.0

This hotel is great, especially the location it is in the centre of everything. No you are not directly on the beach but just in a minute walk your on the beach, just across the street! There is ABC store on every corner, there is two next to the hotel it just takes 30 sec to walk to both. Also there is two Starbucks in a 30 sec walk, for all the coffee lovers. All the activity was right next the hotel, you walk a couple of minutes and you in the heart of the shopping area. For the Aloa Moana mall and the Outlets you will have to get a taxi but its a short ride(we never went there). The staff were great, especially the concierge(the Expedia expert) who helped us book The Pearl Harbour Tour (highly recommend). It was around 40 mins from the airport, when we arrived we got a taxi from the airport which cost $50 (bags and tip included), on the way back from the hotel to the airport we ordered a Limo (recommend, so much better) it was $60 which included our bags and plus tip which was $70. The buffet breakfast was delicious, every morning I had a fresh omelet with fresh fruit, especially pineapple so good! The only negative comment I would have to make about the breakfast was the coffee was not good (personal opinion, so I went to Starbucks to get it :)). Also, just a heads up, in the morning getting breakfast, seeing how its beautiful everyday you get to enjoy breakfast outside, there are a few birds flying around, the staff do their best to shoo them away but your outdoors with food! The rooms are beautiful, we stayed in room 2106, the top floor with an amazing view of Diamond head, the beach, a partial view of the ocean, and the city with a nice size patio and the sun hits it in the morning. Just use caution when out on the balcony with kids, to me the railing is on the low side for being so high up. The room had two comfy queen beds and in the sitting area a pull out sofa (which we didn't use). The bathroom was nice and big. Also there was a wet bar with a mini fridge(we bought water, some fruit, and sandwich meat). The pool area was amazing the sun is on it the whole day, and just a tip when we were there was not that many people there so it was nice to get a break from the busy beach area for a day. In the evening time the recepetion time had the bar opened (which the bartender was great, knew how to mix drinks which is always a plus) plus it had a few snack to munch on and on certain days they had a live band playing music from different eras (they were very good, they also played todays music but with their own twist, which I loved). Overall I would definitely come back to this hotel and highly recommend this to anyone going. To me this is the number one hotel in Honolulu.","St. John's, Canada",3,5.0

Rooms nice and clean everything top notch. However front desk has not added points to our hilton account. As a hilton gold member we should not have to call to require as to the status of points. Fruit punch upon check in very nice. Kona coffee would be nice in rooms since this is a trademark of Hawaiian Coffee. The resort has more asian guests then previous years but therefore a more subdued and quiet atmosphere. The managers reception every evening 5-7 with free alcohol and non/alcohol drinks fantastic. Pool side service has slipped a bit so you need to go to the pakini bar to order. Food very good! The Pool is small but adequate. Sun does not hit the pool till around 11:30am. Go to the beach for the am then hit the pool and order food for lunch. Always chases available. Staff has been there forever saying it is a great place to work and they love their jobs. Dennis is awesome. Only annoying thing is the alarm sound across the street from the trump hotel when vehicles exit the parkade. This goes on till around 2am. Garbage trucks park and are noisy very early every morning with engines running and backup beepers waking you up. Not a bad thing if you want to go for a walk at 6 am. Enough said.!!

After a long day at the beach, the complementary Managers reception with drinks, nibbles and a live band (?!!!) was a beautiful and fun way to end the day, meet some new friends whilst the kids frolicked in the pool and head out to dinner relaxed (thanks to the complementary mai tais!). All in all we were so impressed with the value this hotel provided along with the lovely suites, friendly staff and great amenities that we cant wait to get back for our next stay.

What started as a nightmare stay from booking the reservation at the get go, turned out to be very accommodating thanks to the front desk manager Garret O. Who helped us to acquire the 2-bedroom with roll in shower as we had requested. The breakfast buffet is always a delight, and since grandma was in a rented wheelchair, it was easy for us to enjoy having breakfast with her. I suggest eating at 6:30am as the buffet is open then, it is not busy, and the staff are nice (probably because it's not crowded). There's a business center, but only in one tower, so if you are in the second tower you may have a little walk but it's easy to get to. On Mondays, Wednesday, Friday's, and Saturdays there is live music during the managers reception (complementary non-alcoholic/alcoholic drinks and snacks). It's fun, you could have a quick show for 2 hours and just relax with some drinks from draft, blue hawaii's, white, and wells liquor. The bartenders are very nice and courteous - I tipped a $1 per drink - but it's not necessary...as I'm sure the price for the complementary drinks are factored into your bill. The cleaning staff are really nice, and very helpful if you need more towels, pillows, or toiletries. The room gets pretty cold if you have it on high, so be prepared to stay cool and enjoy it after being outside at the beach or walking around waikiki. This hotel is close to many stores, main malls, and eateries. If you want to dine in, I suggest Ruth's Chris steakhouse - it's connected to the hotel, just have to take the elevator from the pool deck down one floor or you can take the escalator - very convenient. Also, there's yard house - good beer, good burgers, good fish and chips (make sure it's not too oily before you bite into it- that sucker burns). Other than that, it's an overall nice place to stay, and leave from to roam waikiki.",oahu,13,5.0

It definitely felt like our treatment would have been better if we had gone through the hhonors program.When we finally checked in, our room was nice and it was very clean. However, there was almost no natural light in the room. We were one floor off of the street and the window light was blocked by all the tall buildings in the area.

The location was perfect, at the start of Waikiki Beach and with lots of tourist amenities (shopping, restaurants etc) surrounding the property.The staff at the location were excellent and the entrance to the hotel is very impressive. I received a complimentary upgrade to a two bedroom suite which was far too much space for a lone traveller but would have been nice for a large family (one king, two queen and a sofa bed with two bathrooms, living room and small wet bar area). Although, the room did seem dated but in tune with the Hawaiian theme. Internet speed is enough to do some basic surfing but certain times of days (evenings) it does slow significantly.I opted for room service on my first day after a long trip, my lunch (burger and fries) was nice and very fulfilling for one person however my evening meal was a let down (Mahi fish with rice), everything was very bland and boring which was a surprise to me in Hawaiian. The hotel services complimentary buffet breakfast but it's pretty basic even though they cook to order your eggs/omelets.I'd probably stay at this hotel if I travelled with my family given the size of rooms and the proximity to the beach/restaurants but I think the value and star rating there are better hotels nearby.","Austin, Texas",47,3.0

The shower head sprayed all over but everything else seemed to work. Small frig and microwave provided. The breakfast was well run and offered a fair number of choices and the hot dishes rotated every other day. The staff in the hospitality area was excellent: the omelette lines were run better than any Embassy Suites I have visited and there were helpful attendants to clear tables and even offered refills on juice and coffee! The same area is used for a lovely happy hour each day--it has an open covered area next to the pool and also seating inside. HH features basic bar snacks but a large variety of drinks. The bartenders are really great. 3 days a week there is live music during happy hour. It was an impressive perk of staying at this hotel. The hotel is not on the beach, but only a block away from a beach access path. While not my favorite part of Waikiki beach, it's only 5 minutes by foot to the ocean. The main reason that I gave only 4 stars is that the lobby area is lacking any feeling of cohesion. The two towers are connected by long corridors and a walk through the entrance to the parking lot/valet area and a rather unimpressive lobby. When compared with the nearby Sheraton, Outrigger or Moana, the lobby and public areas of the Embassy Suites don't measure up. For me, it didn't matter at all. The pool and hospitality areas made up for the lack of a nice lobby but I've been to Waikiki many times. Also, in a fairly tough area to drive around in, the Embassy Suites is easy to navigate. Valet parking is efficient, though expensive, and there is room to unload luggage and passengers. Also, there are many shops and restaurants in the same block as the hotel, including a deluxe ABC just across Lewers which seemed to be open all hours.

My wife & 2 kids (16 & 12) & I found this 2 room suite to be perfect amount of space & very clean & comfortable which is most important to us! We had a fabulous ocean view in 1831 Hula tower on the 18th floor to enjoy incredible sunsets & all the warm Hawaii nights!! The hotel is in a perfect location on beach walk with tonnes of restaurants, shopping nightlife & a super fast < 5 min walk to beach! Great place if you do t have a vehicle. The room was always kept very clean & spacious enough that we weren't't tripping over each other in the minimal time spent in the room. The only 2 things that keeps this from a 5 star rating in my view is that the pool area was swarmed by very young kids from early morning until at least 9-9:30 at night everyday which even my 12 & 16 year old found annoying & exhausting. It was very loud & I can only imagine how hard the chlorine had to work!! But it is a family hotel so if you are looking for a quiet space I suggest the Trump or Halekulani but those will be in a different price category as well. The other disappointing part of the stay was the managers reception every night at the pool area from 5:30-7. We were looking forward to having a nice place to relax at the end of the day, have a couple free drinks & some nice appetizers before going out for a later dinner. When we checked it out on the first evening we were disappointed at the quality of the drinks & especially the appetizers....nothing more than some tortilla chips with melted cheese & some broccoli florets, ranch dressing & goldfish crackers......really!! And it was basically the same every night, a little more upscale & some variety would have been nice. Even though it was free, it wasn't worth it to us.Overall, a great family hotel in a perfect location on Waikiki with some potentially terrific views. If you are looking for good quality at a reasonable price (for Hawaii LOL) this is your spot. If you want a little more quiet or upscale, it will be too loud & hectic with families! I would probably not stay again as we like more peace & may look elsewhere but it is everything it promised to be.","Winnipeg, Canada",72,4.0

Our last week in Embassy Suites has convinced us that it is difficult for the other hotels to match the price value of ES in terms of location (we prefer Beachwalk area to central Kalakaua because it is quieter, cleaner, and close to our preferred less congested beach area around Hilton, Fort DeRussy area). ES is surrounded by its own area of shops and restaurants right outside its door. The room size and cleanliness and up to date decor of ES was right on with a living room area with a pull out sofa, dining area and microwave/sink/and mini fridge and two full size TVs. Nice size pool and lounging area and a small fitness center. In terms of service, top drawer from Garrick taking our request for early check in and higher floor room assignment, to Ray with his wonderful Jamaican accent who greeted us royally when we checked in. Great first impression. Housekeeping was great and did I mention the room rate includes full breakfast in addition to a daily cocktail reception with wine/beer/ and specialty drinks with local live entertainment. Traffic entering and exiting hotel is efficient although there is a daily parking fee. Example of excellent service is Lacy, catering manager who graciously allowed us to see the last minutes of the San Antonio Spurs game at the cocktail area. Note their General Manager personally responds to all social media reviews. This general manager's attentiveness to service and details is reflective on the management of this specific ES hotel. The Tom family no longer needs to check out hotels for Honolulu vacations.

And there was no one in line or around the desk.We were told to go away at 1PM because the room wasn't ready, no offer of a ""hey upstairs is our bar, why don't you go enjoy a drink there we will call you"", we just got a ""your room isn't ready till about 3, come back then""When we turned up at 3, and I said to the guy ""we were told to come back around 3 to get our room"" his exact response was ""did we say 'around 3, or after 3'? Because im sure we said after 3"" then someone came around him and said ""the room is ready just let them have it now""Infront of us.I didn't want to create a scene, so I thanked themTook the keys and my wife and went to the room, but when you pay almost 4000$ for a weeks stay, I expect some courtesy.On the plus side, all other staff, including the porters are very friendly.

I had stayed at the Hilton Waikiki beach several times before, but likely never again. Our stay at the Embassy Suites was simply amazing. I had some interactions with the Hotel manager, Malia Espinda, and she was incredible. Very polite and attentive and everything I would want if I were hiring a manager. She was everything a Guest services manager should be and more. We also had a couple of instances to talk to Dean at the bell desk and he went out of his way to help us and set up transportation as needed. When we checked into the hotel, the wrong tower, but correct room number was written on our check in ticket. Dean noticed it and insisted on going up with us to make 100% sure we were in the right place. He actually said, ""i don't want you to have to come down get another key if its wrong so I'll make sure. If a different key is needed I'll let you into the room and personally go get two new keys for you"". Who does that anymore? Service from top to bottom at this hotel was no less than some of the best we have ever had.Family friendly for sure, but very quiet overall. The only noise we noted was kids having a blast at the busy area around the pool as they should. There were quieter parts of the pool area is you wanted them, but we had fun watching the crazy kids. The food and happy hour (or two hours) at the pool every day was great. We met many people and had a great time mingling. The full breakfast buffet was also amazing with cooked to order eggs or omelets. 100% a very good breakfast with no room for complaints. Breakfast is also served from 6:30-10:30 which is great. Many hotel limit these hours, i'm assuming in an attempt to limit the number of breakfasts served. The Location is truly the best part. Very central to Waikiki, the Royal Hawaiian Shopping center and the beach. Its really about the best of all worlds when you are looking for vacation. We looked out our balcony at the Prada store and all the shopping up and down the area. Extremely central. The Royal Hawaiian Village is also a very nice hotel, but just a bit far from everything. This hotel gets a 10 for location without question.The rooms are very clean and very nice. Not extravagant, but very nice and very quiet. Linens are top notch and the mattresses are very comfortable. Tons of pillows as well! Great selection of TV channels for everyone and incredible views of Diamond head from the one side of the hotel. The only thing we really didn't like was leaving!

The pool and hot tub are great, but a little crowded at times. Get to breakfast early to beat crowds and it makes lunch an option! The free drinks are nice to unwind in the evening. Don't spend twice as much for a hotel on the beach - this is less than a block away, all beaches in Hawaii are public, and they even encourage you to take the pool towels to the beach! Traffic noise is bad on the Beachwalk side, even though we were on the 9th floor. The day before you check out they leave a CD of Hawaiian songs for you and there's a free beach bag in your room when you check in, among other niceties. The store off the lobby is great and has most anything you'd need. The staff, without exception, is fabulous; they want to make sure you're having the best vacation possible, especially Cindy at the front desk. Only gripe is that they only have valet parking $35 a day. There is a big parking ramp down the street; not sure if that would be cheaper.

I really want to give Embassy Suites an excellent, but there is one point that is keeping me from doing so. The hotel is not on the beach, and therefore does not have beach chair/ cabana rentals. I have been trying since yesterday to get some chairs reserved on Waikiki, to no avail. The Royal Hawaiian has some public chairs and umbrellas available to rent, but they sell out quickly. I wish I had known this. So, if you are coming here and want to spend the day on the beach, in a chair and not on a towel, reserve your chairs early. Also, the pool here is small, but it looks like all the hotels have small pools from what I have noticed. All in all, this is a great place. Just reserve your beach day early.","Chapin, SC",47,4.0

The main reason is that it provides suites and free breakfast. But, the so called suites are kind of small and not very comfortable. The breakfast, other than omelets, is rather poor and selection of food is really unsatisfactory. Did they see the selection at Hilton Frankfurt for example. Orange juice does not taste like real orange juice and there is only one kind of milk. I had to get eggs in addition to the omelet since I did not know what else to eat. Overall the hotel seems much better in photos and on paper than in reality. In order to get to the beach you have to walk quite a bit through a narrow alley between other buildings and, at least in the afternoon, this is the smallest beach I've ever seen. The pool is not big enough for such a big hotel. It's overcrowded during the managers reception where you have to wait in line to get a lot of ice and a bit of orange juice in your glass. There are some carrots and other snacks...it seems like they spent a minimal amount of money. Small fridges, no utensils in room. The location is nice but it's much better to stay at hotels right across the beach like Hyatt Regency which are also cheaper and closer to everything. The Beach Walk stores and restaurants seem overpriced. For example the Cheesecake Factory has the same prices as Chesee Burger on Beach Walk, but Cheesecake Factory is so much more superior in every way. Perhaps this would not be so bad if Embassy Suites was not charging more than others because of things like breakfast but then they warn you to better come at 6:30 hour... or later you may have to wait in long lines. The view from the room is onto several concrete buildings. It does have flat screen TV but the kind that's outdated at this point. No smart TVs.The Internet works but it's not strong enough for streaming TV for example.","Chicago, Illinois",19,3.0

The short order cooks making omelets are the best. It's amazing to watch them while they cook your omelet. The staff in the breakfast area couldn't be more accommodating. The breakfast area is outdoors adjacent to the pool deck. This was my second stay at this hotel, and there isn't any place that I'd rather have breakfast.

The buffet breakfast is an amenity that is not included in the rate at most other Waikiki hotels and the food and service are excellent. The breakfast service staff are all very friendly but one in particular, named Aldrin, has always greeted us personally and goes out of his way to see if there is anything we need. The evening reception with snacks, free drinks and entertainment four nights a week is also very nice. The local band which plays at the reception is very good and is one of the reasons we continue to stay here when we go to Honolulu. The bell staff are also very friendly and courteous. One in particular, named Dean, has always been very helpful to us and always says to us, ""let me know if there is anything you need"". During this stay, Ray Rodney who is a customer service manager greeted us personally at almost every evening reception with an offer to let him know if there is anything we needed to make our stay more comfortable. During this latest visit, Mr. Rodney and one of the servers (Christina) delivered a complimentary large fruit, cheese and crackers tray to our room, which came totally unexpected to us. The tray was excellent. Our housekeeper, Josie, was very friendly and helpful our entire stay. Also, the check-in process went very smoothly and when I asked if there were any complimentary upgrades available we were put into an ocean view room. We couldn't have been more pleased with the room and I only wish I would have gone back to get the name of the lady who checked us in.

The cocktail reception provided a choice of beverages, snacks and entertainment – a relaxing way to end the day. Breakfast and cocktails are located on the 4th floor Lanai near the pool – a lovely partly open space. The hotel only offers Valet Parking, no Self-Parking – it seemed quite expensive at $35 per day but it proved to be a great service.

The room was great, very clean and spacious. We had a ocean view corner room (SE side of hotel, Aloha tower which is closer to the beach side) so had two lanais. We were on a lower floor (< 10) so the smell of the grills from the restaurant below (Roy's) could be a little overwhelming if the lanai doors were open - not a problem if closed. The two queen beds were comfortable but on the soft side. The sofa bed was actually very comfortable since it had a memory foam-type mattress vs. those old spring mattresses.The free breakfast was a good bonus but got less appealing after the 2nd day as the selection was mediocre and the pastries were horrible. The best part were the omelette and cereal stations. We're not much into to drinking alcohol but the evening reception seemed popular.The location was both good and bad. The good - close to shopping and restaurants and a 5 minute walk to the beach. The bad - it is surrounded on all sides by other hotels so street noise at night is a problem. Starting at about 3am, you can hear semi-trucks, delivery trucks, trash trucks, etc. backing into to bays in the various hotels and they make that loud beeping noise as they reverse in. This happened just about every night except maybe Sunday. If you wear ear plugs, you should be OK.

There was no limit on the drinks and the snacks could certainly fill you e.g. nachos, crisp veges with dips like broccoli and carrot; edamame beans; nuts and other snack mixes. The swimming pool was a great size and had a large spa pool attached; there were plenty of poolside chairs, tables, loungers and canopy day beds. If you're lucky you will get a room with a view out to sea; however, the surrounding views are also pleasant. We did ask for a room change (which was no trouble to them at all) and that was because our first room was right beside the lift i.e. the lift walls were in our bedroom so we could hear it going up and down all night; that would be our only recommendation: ensure you're not beside it! Also, the word apartment (which was used to describe our accommodation at booking) in this case means your room does not come with crockery, cutlery, glasses or tea towels etc. You can request them if needed. The room has a microwave and kettle/jug, tea, coffee etc but no other cooking facilities. Overall, a great place, located in a really handy position with relaxed staff who make you feel at home. I would definitely go back!","Snells Beach, New Zealand",13,5.0

One day before I was to leave the bedbug bites started showing up on me. The day I left I was loaded with them so much and itched terribly. I was with my wife and we went to the manager. He gave us back the money for the room with the bedbugs, but had to pay for the other room. I went to the doctor the day I arrived home and he told me they were bedbug bites. He couldn't believe how many I had. When I got home I had to throw away my luggage, wash all clothes in hot water and dry them, freeze my shoes and any other things I couldn't wash. They didn't reimburse me for that. It was a lot of work to keep the bedbugs from coming into the house. My wife and I were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary. Some trip. It was awful",,2,4.0

I’ve only recently been reminded that I did not post this (second) review, so it my now be “out-of date”, but still relevant. If I was aware of this prior to posting my first review of this venue, I would have included it in my first review of 24th July 2015.My review on that date applies in all respects to this visit as well.HOWEVER:Firstly, our advice is ENSURE THERE ARE NO USA SCHOOL HOLIDAYS during the period you wish to stay. The local Hawaii paper publishes weekly snapshots of how many visitors the State receives. I think (from memory) the average is 70,000. 50,000 come from mainland USA and 20,000 from other countries. So accommodation venues are pretty well booked out over holiday periods (which is also reflected in their room rates).Also,VERIFY CHECK-IN TIMES. If, like us, you have arrived at your accommodation after a long, sleep-disrupted overnight flight you may find that you have to wait several hours for a room to become available, even longer if you are in a group and want suites close to each other. Reception staff do the best they can, but it’s just the timing – they are waiting for other guests to book out so rooms can be prepared for the next “wave”. They are happy to hold your luggage. BEWARE of rooms ADJACENT TO LIFTS– we had room 1901 in Aloha Towers for over a week and were awoken every night by the noise of the lifts. Perhaps Management might consider staying in this room for a few nights when the premises are “fully loaded” to assess the problem? SAFETY ISSUE – in support of other reviews already posted by others - Management appears to have no reasonable procedure or communications in place to deal with evacuation in case of emergency e.g. fire alarm. To hear a loudspeaker blast out in the early hours of the morning and having to cope with stairs for 15 floors without sighting or receiving instructions or assistance from anyone in authority was not a good experience. A printed apology delivered to rooms did not mention the cause of the event. That was left to word of mouth and a statement by the General Manager in response to another review days later. Hopefully this will be resolved before I next visit Hawaii?","Blenheim, New Zealand",29,4.0

Just not as much street noise @ the ES. We had a 2BR/2BA in the Aloha tower, which is the tower furthest from the beach, but looked out onto Diamond Head & a slice of the ocean if one leaned far enough out. The breakfast buffet is not the usual ES buffet, likely due to the high number of Japanese tourists who stay, but that is fine-made for a very nice change of pace. Beach/pool towels provided in the room along w/the usual ES room amenities including fridge & microwave. Unfortunately also the same annoying Hilton internet that has to be renewed every 24 hrs on the nose-this is one area where Marriott wins hands down!

Valet Parking is $35.00 per day and twice they brought me the wrong car. I could have easily driven away with someone else's car. They need to check closer. My biggest complaint was that you need to swipe your room key in the elevator. More than once I had my hands full and could not select my floor because my room key was in my pocket.

You aren't on the beach, but you are within a 1-minute walk. The breakfast has many gf options, and the chef was able to point out what was safe. I have many food allergies, so I used their gf bread and bought some less processed jam at the ABC store. The omelettes are a great gf option. One thing I have to say about this hotel is that not only is the staff great but the guests are as well. For all the Australian people who go and can't find the Vegemite, I sent a bottle to the hotel for you. Please ask for it while it lasts :0) It seems that many of the cocktail items are gf as well but check on the drink mixes. I didn't have time to do that this trip. Directly across the street is a food truck park and the chicken from the truck in the photo is excellent. They say it's gf, I didn't get sick, so I'll agree. $18 for a whole chicken but we're gf so we're used to those prices, right? Go out the back side of the hotel to The Yard House for fabulous gf choices. This was our third stay at this location, and the room we got was spacious. I give this hotel 5 stars not because it's the Ritz but you are treated very well, and the rooms are great for the money. The beds are more comfortable than the Heavenly Beds at Westin. The bathrooms are a nice size; you get a living room and the kitchenette is perfect for the stuff you lug up to the room. We had free wifi but I'm not sure if that was a perk of being an HHonors member or just the way it is. I always enjoy the Embassy Suites and, this time, was the best.

I read the previous reviews on this Embassy Suites hotel. It helped making my choice. I am happy I did. The location was great. Walking distance to shopping, restaurants, and the beach. I booked an ocean view room. Yes, there are other hotels blocking the full view of the ocean, but our corner room 1030 was perfect. You could see the ocean on the front balcony and the ocean and pool on the side balcony. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel was nice and quiet in the evening. Loved the strong water force in the shower. No trickle of water! We had breakfast both mornings at the complimentary breakfast buffet. The chefs accommodated my dairy allergy with care by preparing my eggs exactly as I asked them too! We traveled on to Maui and stay in another chain hotel for a much much higher cost.

We liked the Embassy Suites a lot, but it may have been a little too much for us. It was just my husband and me traveling, and the first hotel was Vive, which is a small boutique hotel. The suite style room ended up feeling huge and wasteful. We were there originally for business for my husband, but made a vacation out of it.The room was beautiful though. Had balcony that overlooked city, and view was still gorgeous. Had a corner room on floor 15, plenty high to see over pool deck. Also, got view of ocean out of the front window in the living room. Breakfast was, of course, typical delicious Embassy Suites breakfast--no complaints here. It was also very nice if you have a business meeting or something early in the morning, it starts at 630. They also have a ""manager's reception"" from 530-730 every night with cocktails and snacks. I only participated one night, and since I was 7 months pregnant, did not have any cocktails. But it looked like a pretty cool thing.The walk to the beach was short and there is a pretty nice stretch of beach for Waikiki.If you've never been to Waikiki before, many hotels are across the street and you use a public access walkway (they are located all over). All beaches in Hawaii are public so they are very easy to access. To stay actually ON the beach, you would probably have to book a resort, which charge resort fees on top of the ridiculous tourist prices. We walked down to the Hilton Hawaiian Village Wakiki to see what all the fuss was about. It was a very nice hotel, but there was really only one pool that was key card accessible, so really we could've just used the amenities as random people off the street. On our last day, we checked out early to hike Diamond Head. Embassy suites provided a ""hospitality room"" for 30 min or so to shower before our flight home. I found this is fairly common of Hawaii hotels, if they are not completely booked. Definitely worth asking about. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay, and if you're looking to splurge a little (but not so crazy as to do a resort) we recommend this hotel. If you do it right, you're not going to be in the room much, so to me as long as it is clean and has a bed, that is all I need. But breakfast does cost something, and it is very convenient to have it there and be pre-paid...and delicious!","Portland, Oregon",5,4.0

Some pluses to the property are the breakfasts which are included in the price of the room along with a two hour ""happy hour"" where your drinks are whatever you want to tip the bar tender. There also is an area that serves sodas and snacks for those not wanting any mixed drinks. The hotel is very close to the beach as well as to some excellent restaurants and good shopping areas. The only thing we would have done differently on this trip is not rent a vehicle as the hotel does charge $35.00 per night to store your vehicle. Since we took several tours from the hotel we should have just taken a taxi from the airport and saved the cost of the rental plus the storage costs for the parking.

We have two teenage girls and a 14 month old toddler, so we booked hoping that the girls could have a separate bedroom and we would have enough room for a crib. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the suite. Girls had separate bedroom and bathroom, our room was spacious and the central lounge room was great. It also had an alcove that had a sink and a small fridge/microwave (something most of the hotels we stayed at in the US didn't have). I haven't even got to the good bits yet. The hotel itself is nicely located in Waikiki. It's within walking distance of everything. Directly downstairs is the Yard House restaurant (which has 130 beers on tap) and just across the road is the beach. On the 4th floor is the pool/spa area. It had ample room when we were there, but I could see it being busy in summer. The hotel offers a free breakfast, which is awesome to get you off to a good start before exploding all that the area has to offer, and more importantly, for the parents, between 5.30 and 7.30pm each night they have a 'managers reception' which basically means free drinks. Beer, wine, spirits and nibbles!! It's pretty awesome. We ended up making dinner plans around getting back to the hotel to catch a little bit of happy hour each night, along with most of the other guests. Add to that a band 4 nights a week and you have s great little spot to meet other travellers whilst the kids are in the pool. Staff were great, no issues what so ever. I'm sure there's nicer, more expensive hotels in Waikiki, and some with better views or better pools, but if you want a nice, comfortable hotel, with a great atmosphere, this might be the place for you....

The booze wasn't always the best buy you can't complain when it's all you can drink! We really liked the red sangria that they served and ended sticking with that throughout our stay. It was $30 a day for valet parking (now $35) and there is no self parking. I can really fault the hotel for the $30 since it seems to be the average for all the hotels. You do have in and out privileges. The Hotel is close to everything with just a ten minute walk to the beach. Some reviewers warned of making sure not staying on the second floor where the pool is because of the noise. I guess this is true if you are older or just need your quiet time. I was place on the second floor but didn't realize it until I got to the room. I figured I would complain the next day if it was too much for me, It wasn't. In fact, I was the one making the noise (sorry!) by staying up till the pool was closed. Then in the morning I just stepped out the back door and walk to breakfast with the wife and friends. So I would actually recommend staying there. You don't have a private balcony or much of a view but I was happier with what I got in return.Whenever I'm back in Oahu (and I will be back!!) we will for sure be staying at the Embassy again!","Pasco, Washington",19,5.0

On previous holidays I've stayed at Trump and Hilton Village and this sits somewhere in the middle. Hilton is just crazy and chaotic and crowded whilst Trump is luxurious and quite peaceful. Embassy suites are dated and the service average but it met our needs for this trip. We had two suites opposite each other for 2 teenagers and it worked well. Breakfast was ok, nothing to rave about, bit cafeteria like but at least you didn't have to queue up and wait. Same goes for poolside chairs. No towel draping invisible guests in sight! Didn't go to the managers drinks as not really into that sort of thing so can't comment. Location was great for getting about and safe for 2 teenage girls to do ther own thing.The noise factor at this hotel was just awful. We actually went out and purchased ear plugs as we could hear everything going on in the next room (and I mean EVERYTHING!) extremely annoying. Moving rooms was not an option as we needed to be close to the teenagers. For this reason alone I would not stay again. You could literally join in the conversation, and at 1.00 in the morning, it just is not on. I can honestly say that it was the worst I have come across in years of travel. Housekeeping was also of a very low standard. Beds made, towels changed and that was it. In summary, this is a 3 star hotel and 3 star is what you get all around. If you prefer a more upscale place, this is not for you. And noise is a problem. It wins on location and is not as chaotic and busy as many waikiki hotels. For 2 of our group this was their first trip to Hawaii and so the obligatory lei on arrival was greatly anticipated but none to be seen, budget cuts maybe?

Our family of 7 stayed at the Embassy suites for 6 nights in a 2 bedroom plus living room (pull out sofa bed) suite immediately after staying 3 nights at the Trump (right across the road) in a 2BR plus den/3 bath suite at almost the same nightly price (we got a suite deal) so we can’t help but compare. Aside from the excellent location, everything at the Embassy was simply good. We frequently commented that the hotel and what it offers seems to be on par with a P&O ship (as opposed to a Celebrity/Royal Caribbean). although breakfast is free you know the saying you get what you pay for....The breakfast dining area is busy, not particularly tidy and perpetually occupied with hard working staff pushing trolleys of either mass produced foods (in) or trash (out), which partly explained why the floors had that slippery feel to them. The queues to the omelette/egg stations were invariably long but eggs well prepared (John was fabulous). The rooms were older but good – a tight fit for 7 but great for a family of 5: the bathrooms were compact and a little old but clean, they had the old school shower in the bath; the bedrooms were comfortable; amenities very basic; kitchenette tiny but useful; room service questionable (when would the cleaner not remove pizza boxes, empty the trash etc??). The pool area was very good – in particular the kids shallow section that was perfect for under 5s and the bar snack menu gave us an alternative for lunch (even if it did mean being snapped at by the grumpy barman).  We must single out two people that constantly provided excellent service: Carlton on the concierge desk provided fantastic job in arranging hire cars, recommending day trips, restaurants and chatting with a great sense of humour and upbeat attitude. Aldrid was fantastic to us and many others in providing service and arranging tables for our large group each morning that we had breakfast at the Embassy. Thank you to both. Overall, we were happy with our stay but we won’t be back. We look for the finer things on our holidays and the Embassy didn’t have the polish or added luxury we expect on holidays. We have marked the hotel down noting that comparing it with the 5 star Trump is almost unfair, but this hotel was the same price. It is a very good hotel for families, but just not for us. Duke’s view: breakfast was good for scrambled eggs and toast, but no chance of getting an apple juice; the pool was great – particularly the shallow part for me; the pull out sofa bed was good but I was always the last one asleep; the location was great – easy for Mummy to get to the best shops in Waikiki and for all of us to get to the beach.","New York City, New York",215,3.0

With this being said, I have to say we were really dissapointed during our last stay in December 2015 not only at the service but also for the very uncomfortable bed. We arrived after midnight from a late inbound flight and we sat in the valet drop off for 15 plus minutes waiting for a valet to take greet us. On top of that there was no offer of a bell hop to assist with our luggage. Maybe because it was late there were less employees to assist but why should your service suffer? After all, we are not paying less for the accommodations. In addition, the king bed that we had in our room was a mattress in which it appeared the ""pillowtop"" was all but gone. It was very uncomfortable even with the memory foam that we brought with us.

The place needs to be revamped.The breakfast as usual is superb. Ate tons of pineapple and enjoyed the omelet bar.The hotel staff were not very friendly which was a surprise to me since coming to Hawaii a few times I've always been treated so kindly. The room wasn't ready when we arrived at 4 pm and when the front desk called to check when it would be ready the person on the other end was complaining we checked in early...again we arrived at 4--that's not early.The concierge asked us to wait 20 minutes so we obliged but something must have happened where he might have mistook us for being upset and said he'd upgrade our room. We were given the top floor. The views were AMAZING! Talk about the real experience--180 degrees of beautiful views. We originally were given floor 17 but got upgraded to 21. No complaints there.I wish that was the end to the experience but sadly no. The toilet was leaking terribly and we called it in and no one came to fix it. It was so bad we had to put a trash can to catch the water and that filled up quite fast. The maintenance guy eventually came and he still didn't fix it. We dealt with a leaky toilet the entire time. It was ridiculous. It's a good thing we weren't inside the hotel the entire time because it would have driven me nuts.There's many other hotels to stay in Waikiki and even though the hotel is close to many good restaurants I do not think anyone on vacation should have to deal with the stuff we did.

Loved the complementary tropical juice that was offered to get you into the Hawaiian vacation mood. We are a family of five and we stayed in the 2 bedroom - 2 bathroom suite and it was perfect. Plenty of room and with three teenage daughters, the second bathroom was surely appreciated. The beds were super comfy and the towels were soft and plush.Breakfast was served each morning from 6:30am to 10am and it was always delicious.. very fresh and plentiful. A bounty of hot and cold choices and outstanding omelets and eggs that were made to order with a smile. Speaking of smiles.. the workers at the breakfast had a huge task of clearing hundreds of plates to get the tables ready for the next occupants and they did an amazing job.. all while being incredibly friendly and welcoming.From 5:30pm to 7:30pm there was a complimentary cocktail party each night on the same open and scenic space where the breakfast was served.

There were enthusiastic bartenders and lovely entertainment.. could not have been better.The location of the Embassy Suites was right smack in the middle of it all.. easy walk either direction on Kalakaua Avenue. Walk 20 minutes to the ""left"" and you were at Ala Moana Mall.. walk 5 minutes to the ""right"" and you were right on Waikiki Beach.

So during the night when trying to sleep you hear the lift going up and down during the night. I apologised to my friends for the room they have been given. If you are considering staying here, please don't expect rooms that finish in 01 because your bedroom is next to the lift and in the Aloha wing city view. It's not nice. I'm embarrassed I suggested the Embassy Suites to my friends tonight at dinner. ",,1,2.0

They had the salty crunchy snacks but I ate tons of fresh sweet carrot sticks and black olives; what a nice change. I don't drink alcohol but those who did in our party said they did not skimp on the alcohol in the free Mai Tais.

The hotel was in a great location, very close to shops, restaurants and only one block back from the beach. Usually I prefer to stay in accommodation facing the ocean but my friend wanted to save a little on the room cost so this was a great alternative. Our room had a little balcony and if you slightly leaned over you could actually see the water.Another reason we chose this hotel was the suite rooms. The bedroom is actually separate to the lounge area which would be ideal if one wanted to rest and the other didn't. The bathroom is also on the lounge side so that was handy if one wanted to use the bathroom whilst the other was sleeping. Have to say the beds were great, very comfy.The room also had a ""wet"" area on the left hand side near the door. This had a sink, a small fridge and a microwave which all maybe useful if you were travelling with children. We were on the 12th floor and had an ice machine on our floor so the wet area was great to empty the ice bucket.Breakfast is included in your accommodation cost and catered for everything from a cooked breakfast to a continental breakfast with the chefs preparing individual omlettes, eggs etc on request.One highlight was the free cocktails and nibbles between 5.30pm-7.30pm every night around the pool area. Also some nights a live band played and they were great and entertained the crowd quite well.Also had free wi-fi.All around Waikiki there are lots of these shops called ABC shops that sell food, alcohol, souveniers, chemist stuff, suitcases etc. There is also a similar shop on ground level of the Embassy Suites that was excellent.Overall we had an amazing holiday, amazing weather and a fantastic time. The staff were lovely and friendly (except for the lady checking us in at reception who didn't even say welcome or thank you for staying when we left). I would highly recommend the Embassy Suites if you are thinking of holidaying at Waikiki.Tip: If you go to Concierge and ask for a taxi and a limo is there doing nothing, you have to be offered the limo for the same price.",brisbane,39,5.0

The location was great, not far from the beaches, shops, and restaurants. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and kept clean. The breakfasts (apart from the coffee) were good with a nice selection of items and an omelet station. The late afternoon/early evening snacks were a bonus along with the band that played nostalgia music four nights a week. We did not try the pool area as it was noisy and full of children. Most of all, we liked the feel of the hotel. It is mid size and does not have an institutional feel like, say, the big Hilton nearby. People get together for breakfast in the morning and music and fun in the late afternoon, giving the place a sense of community. We certainly would return here.

I tried looking through VRBO for homes or condos. The problem I ran into was that the condos are usually rented for a week at a time and they are specific to days to check-in and check-out. I came across this hotel offering a 1 bdrm suite conveniently located in Waikiki near the beach, restaurants, and shops. Check-in was a different experience... pleasant and along the theme of ""Aloha and welcome to Hawaii"". The registration desk is none like I have ever seen... when its your turn, you sit at the desk versus standing and given a guava juice cocktail to quench your thirst from the challenging stressful day. The registrations was also very nice and accomodating. For security, the room keys are tied to the elevators so you cannot go up and down the elevators without a room key. When we got to our room, 1 bdrm suite, we were amazed at the view. Instead of a city view, we got an ocean view! Who am I to complain about that! Room was spacious since there is a living room and separate bedroom and there was a microwave and fridge. Keep in mind that since its a kitchenette, there are no pkates, bowls and cutlery. No cooking in the room just enough to warm up leftovers or microwavable meals. Wi-fi and full breakfast is complimentary a included. The breakfast is the best where they included breakfast items for everyone even miso soup and kimchi!

Embassy Suites by Hilton Waikiki Beach Walk DELIVERS! I was pleasantly surprised that this level of customer service still exists today. Upon checkin, Ray (manager on duty) came to greet our party with drinks. Everyone had the warmest smiles. We were offered assistance many times with our luggage. Our suites were clean, nicely decorated, and spacious enough for our group to congregate in the living room before leaving out. Breakfast was really good each morning and I think the staff handled it really well for the large crowd that they hosts. You have the option to eat in the covered area or patio area. Both are nice. During happy hour, there is an awesome band that plays each night. I think what really, really, let me know that this is where I have to stay when I visit Honolulu again is my housekeeper Lleuellyn. Her spirit was so warm and personality so bubbly that I know she has to be a long-lost relative from 5,000 miles away from my home so I called her ""Aunty"" while I was there. She remembered ALL of our names and maintained our suites with the highest standards. When she found out it was my birthday, she was so excited and sang to me.

I took this to the manager on duty who proceeded to find me a king room by the elevator. I took this room and found the air conditioner was inoperable.

I was ready to become a permanent resident (as the suite is bigger than most NYC apartments!) Bathroom is very clean, nice towels. 2 big screen tvs, lots of storage room/drawers. We had ""ocean view"" on the 18th floor (see pics). I'm not sure anyone has a great ocean view at this hotel, and not of Diamond Head. The lanai is VERY narrow and made me a little nervous that high up. Breakfast buffet is awesome - the omelets ARE best in the world. They really cater to their Japanese clientele with miso soup and rice etc at breakfast. The nightly happy hour is nice and the band that was there 10/30 & 10/31 were awesome (didn't get the name). Halloween they brought out lots of extra treats.The place was full of families & kids. So pool & hot tub weren't quiet unless you go first thing in the morning or late at night. There aren't enough lounge chairs especially in the sun so you sorta have to stalk those who are leaving. The beach closest to the hotel is very rocky. If you want the nice part of Waikiki walk down to the Hyatt and past there for the nice sandy areas.The staff were pleasant but sort of invisible. The check-in & out was as impersonal as can be. Not much explanation just given a booklet and that's that. Only cons- the mini-fridge froze everything and there was no visible way to adjust it so had to call for someone to fix it (dial is behind the fridge), tea kettle didn't work and the coffee at the breakfast buffet tasted like instant coffee.We were sorry to leave and look forward to coming back!","Johnson City, New York",14,5.0

Our hotel room was amazing. Nice and big. Room was very clean. Was happy with the service from the hotel. Breakfast was average. And sometimes our shower was cold. But the maintenance guy from the hotel attended to the problem almost instantaneously. They served happy hour drinks and snacks down by the pool every night between 5.30pm and 7pm with a live band every second night. Andrew from the hotel concierge was very welcoming and friendly. And the tour desk was reasonably priced and very helpful. They were able to answer all our questions on things to see and do in the area. Overall a very good hotel.

After spending many days researching hotels, it became clear that the best value was simply Embassy Suites. you are literally across a small street from the beachfront hotels who will charge you twice as much for half the room, and most likely with worse views. A walk to the beach was 5 minutes away.We stayed on the corner of the 19th floor facing the ocean and it was fantastic. The one bedroom suite had plenty of room and was nicely furnished. The bed was very comfortable, the staff was incredible. Breakfast was included each morning and was first rate. Overall, a super good experience and I will definitely return here when visiting the islands again.","Baton Rouge, Louisiana",571,5.0

They are what we love for family travel because the living rooms typically have a fold-out couch so a family of 4 is set if you get the two twin set-up for the bedroom. The hotel itself is centrally located, not on the water, but behind the waterfront Outrigger Reef hotel and is part of a newer shopping and restaurant complex called the Waikiki Beach Walk with good higher end chains like Hawaiian Roy's (very goof fish) and Yard House (great beer selection and good food and sports on TV) and Ruths Chris Steakhouse restaurants among others. The hotel itself has two towers, the Hula Tower, closer to the water and the Aloha Tower. If you can get one of the end ocean view rooms in the Hula Tower, you will get one of the few water facing balconies with a view between the Holekulani hotel and Outrigger Reef. The hotel has valet parking for $30 a day that is pretty quick and efficient and open air to the lobby. Check-in was smooth where you sit at desk and are treated with a welcome tropical juice drink. Because of the open nature of the lobby to the street and its central situation in the shopping area, you need the room key to access the elevator floors. The rooms themselves are large with two tvs and include the usual amenities like coffee and tea and water and a small fridge and microwave and popcorn. I think they are the most comfortable room set up in Waikiki. The BIG plus with Embassy Suites are the complimentary Manager's Reception from 530 to 730 in the evening with full cocktails and various appetizers like chips and salsa and cheese sauce and also vegetables and dip, etc. This in held in a large open area by the big pool on the 4th floor (they call it the Grand Lanai). The big bonus is the complimentary breakfast buffet with cereals, an omelette bar, and fruit and rolls and juices and coffee. Food in Hawaii is expensive and with a family. The breakfast alone more than offsets the slightly higher room rates. The Shorebird where you can grill your own steaks and enjoy a huge salad bar and is a fun place to eat on the beach under the Outrigger Reef hotel across the street (your dinner receipt will get you a discount on a meal on another night) and you can catch a glimpse of the Hilton's Fireworks from there on a Friday night if you sit on the rail. There are also some good food trucks if you want casual on same side as valet (Beach St). There's also free decent fitness area, beach towels and wifi. Overall, Embassy Suites isn't a full scale resort and its not on the water but their great staff, location and nice rooms and nightly reception and breakfast makes it on my shortlist of hotels especially if you are with a family.",,31,4.0

The floor plan was perfect for our family. The two bedrooms are separated by a living room. The room, and the entire hotel, was very clean. All of us found the beds and pillows very comfortable. The rooms are quiet, and we never heard other guests. There is a separate thermostat in each bedroom and one in the living room. We were in room 1824 which had a great view, better than we expected. From the balconies, we could see the Beach Walk to the left and the ocean to the right. The hotel itself is in a great location. There are many shops and restaurant within walking distance. The beach is a very short walk away. The breakfast was good every morning with a good variety of food. The tables are cleaned and turned over quickly for the crowds at breakfast. The food at the manager's reception could have been better. There were nachos a couple of nights that we went. There was broccoli one night. There was usually goldfish or chex mix also. People seemed to like the free drinks as there was usually a short line. The pool was nice. It was clean and cool enough to be refreshing. The hot tub was very relaxing because it was hot like a hot tub should be. One thing that needs improvement is that there is no foot shower. Whenever we came from the beach, our feet and shoes were covered in the very coarse sand. We didn't want to track it into the room. The only place to find a shower is at the pool, but there is no foot shower. There is a shower halfway up the wall that has a fine spray, so you must lift your foot up to waist level and put it right next to the shower head to get the sand off. It is very awkward and difficult to do. I love that the entire hotel is non-smoking. There is a lot of cigarette smoke on the sidewalks and streets. But, not at the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use the balcony without having to run back inside because of smoke. When we go to our beach condo or on a cruise, we cannot use the balcony much because of the smoke. So, the non-smoking is great! Our room was very expensive, even using the non-refundable cheaper rate. We were there for eight nights. It was worth every penny. However, I'm not sure why they have to charge $35 per day for valet parking, which is the only option if you have a car. We also tipped the valet every time we took the car out, which was at least once per day. Even though it was pricey, the guys at valet were nice and always got our car quickly.

This hotel is a block from the beach, and you can easily walk. I think that the staff is exceptional at Embassy Suites. Everyone we encountered (valet parking attendants, bartender, hotel manager, cleaning staff, and Ester - who replenished the snacks during the daily happy hour) was friendly and helpful. I got the feeling that many of the staff have worked at this hotel for many years. With Embassy Suites, you get two rooms, and I really like having that extra space when you stay for a week. There is a small kitchenette with a sink, microwave, and small refrigerator. We were happy to have those amenities. We also had a balcony that we used frequently. No, it did not look out onto the beach, but it did look out onto Beach Walk where we could see the food trucks. We loved the breakfast that was included. This is probably the best breakfast you can get at a hotel. We had salmon two mornings, and always had bacon. You could get a made-to-order omelette if you wanted one. The Japanese influence was seen in the breakfast menu: Miso soup, tofu, and salad. There were always scrambled eggs, yogurt, fresh fruit, potatoes, pancakes/waffles/French toast, juices, coffee, and pastries. In the evening, the manager hosted a cocktail hour where you could have free alcoholic beverages. There were also snack foods provided such as chips, celery, carrots, pretzels, and nuts. On some nights, a wonderful local band played all sorts of music. You do have to pay to park your car - $35 a day - but every time we went to get our car, we never had to wait.

We chose the embassy since we've had great stays at other embassy hotels in the past and we love the big breakfast spread they offer in the morning.This hotel is very close to the beach area. Only one small street and another hotel (their sister hotel) separating you from the beach. There is a sidewalk like walkway that takes you there. Be warned though the beaches are not very big. There is not a lot of room to set up chairs and towels or umbrellas etc due to the fact that other hotels are beach front and use that space for their chairs etc..Upon check in you are given a wonderful delicious fruity drink. This was great and I only wished they offered this pool side. We were given a room on the top floor facing the pool and ocean. There really isn't wonderful ocean views as the other hotels are very tall, so you basically have a ocean view between other hotels. There is a trump hotel next door that is huge and towers over the embassy preventing you from viewing anything in that direction. But we still enjoyed sitting out on the balcony. The rooms were nice and the hotel staff was very nice. We met several people who went out of their way to remember our names and help us with whatever we needed. The maid for our floor was very friendly and very accommodating to clean our room around our schedule. This hotel is situated in a great location. You can walk to many restaurants and sites. There is plenty of shopping. Built right on the side of the hotel is a two level shopping area with some great restaurants. We didn't feel the need to keep a rental car. Instead we rented from the airport and drove to the market to pick up water and snacks we wants (and alcohol) and then dropped the car off the next morning across the street at a hotel that was a satellite drop off location. The cost to park your car at the hotel is $$$$ very high so we opted to get rid of the rental. Public transportation is everywhere and its very easy to get around Waikiki. We also booked some tours and embassy is a big enough hotel that most tours stop right out front to pick you up. Only one did we have to walk across the street to wait in front of the Trump resort. The morning breakfast buffet was very good. There are fresh made eggs and lots of choices on the buffet for things like pancakes, bacon, and fresh fruits. There is a lot of people from Japan who vacation in Hawaii and their menu includes many items that were custom for them as well.At night they have complimentary h'orderves and drinks available in the pool area and a great house band to plays live. Over all we were very pleased with our trip and our choice of hotels. The rooms were decorated nicely and everything seemed clean and updated in the rooms. The elevators were clean, but I don't enjoy having to swipe my room card to get the elevator to go up. This led to a lot of confusion in the beginning as no one told us we had to swipe our card prior to pressing the floor button. The hotel itself is very open so once you are out of the room you do feel the humidity everywhere inside.

The hotel is in a good location though not on the beach, and the rooms on the lower floors can be quiet dark and noisy due to being close to street level, and not a lot of natural light due to surrounding buildings. Always get a room as high as possible to avoid this. Breakfast standard has dropped by Australian standards and seems to be catering more to the Asian and American markets. Basic cereals would be nice in the breakfast bar rather than sugary cereals. Simple rice bubbles, corn flakes or special k would be a better alternative. The hotel has been redecorated to modernise though it probably wasn't required and lowering the prices on the hotel rooms would have been a better objective. I think the extra lounge room area and second television is great for a family but the extra room comes at a cost as does the breakfast as this hotel is pricey for the standard and location.

Great location, lots of stuff just steps away from the hotel doors. The rooms are all suites, and are a great size. They are in good shape but I would stay renovations will be needed in a year or so. The rooms are clean. Minor issues most related to keeping me as a Hilton Diamond Happy, as someone who is in and out of a lot of Hilton hotels, this hotel just feel short on something that would make me second guess booking with all the options in town.#1 Check in line, I waited over 15 min. There was no HH line for Diamonds. I also did ""online check in"" but there was no way to get access to an agent to get a key. After a wait it did get an agent who was nice but just did not listen to me. I said I did the online check in. She kept asking for items like credit card and other items that Hilton corporate tell hotels not to ask for when a guest uses the online check in. Also there was zero Diamond recognition. Again just little things. #2 Did not get the room I picked online, my profile states away from Elevator, and on a high floor. They got 1/2 that right. High floor yes, put a room right next to the elevator. #3 Slow elevators, that are packed most of the time#4 Breakfast is not as good as many other Embassy's but they do have a lot of people to feed. It is like a feeding for people who never ate before. I do not fight for food, I had to here. Very sad how people act. Also peoples kids, dirty little hands touching all the food.#5 The speed of the internet is slow, as a Diamond I should have gotten the faster internet for free. If I did the speeds are bad. My room was nice, beds were nice, bathroom was good. Night time managers reception is nice, but if you want a strong free drink make sure you tip the bar tender first, this will effect your service.","Oahu, Hawaii",357,4.0

You have one hotel between you and Waikiki Beach and a good restaurant in that hotel called Shore Bird. There you cook your own meat with an all you can eat salad bar and watch the sun set over the ocean. We rented a car for the week and toured the island at our own pace. The only downfall of E.S. is the valet parking fee of $35.00 a day. Parking was more than our car rental fee. However parking is at a premium so there is no other option. The local transit did not work for us and the traffic requires you to pack your patience with you. It is not uncommon to take 45 minutes to get 5 to 7 miles. Honolulu has not done a good job of streets and mass transit. Do your homework before you go and have an idea what you plan to see each day. Running over to the North Shore is not that far away but the traffic could make it an hour or two or longer depending on the time of day. The H2 and H3 can be a little confusing and our GPS sometimes gave us a route that was not the best so again homework first. Some of our favorite things were a helicopter flight with Blue Hawaii. A little pricy but since my husband is a helicopter pilot too safety and equipment are very important. It was so fun and a great tour. Be sure to see the big Turtles on the N. shore just to the right of hwy 99's intersection with hwy83. Snorkel in Hanauma Bay, take your own equipment or rent theirs. Make reservations for Pearl Harbor early tours fill up quick. We found a great Italian restaurant in the large shopping mall two blocks west of T J Maxx. IT is located just off Hwy 92. We can't wait to go back. My Husband had to work and I felt comfortable driving on my own. Have a great time. E. S. staff was great after a day or so they recognized us and went out of the way to make us feel comfortable and welcome. Look for Adrine at breakfast He will always meet you with a big smile and welcome. I even got a big hug the day we left!","San Juan, Puerto Rico",6,5.0

This hotel lived up to our expectations and more. We booked a one-bedroom which was perfect for our family of four. We have two children 12 and 8. Our room was serviced daily, unlike Australia where in most cases a long term stay in a one-bedroom normally means self-servicing. The beds were super comfy and the layout suited our needs. We appreciated the free daily breakfast and enjoyed the reception most nights by the pool from 5:30pm - 7:30pm with free cocktails and soft drinks for our children. Live music played during most of these nights which was an added bonus. Our kids loved the pool. I was happily surprised by how well the hotel was located to EVERYTHING! We were so lucky. We all agree that this would be the place we would stay again. Only downside was the tour desk which was with Expedia - they would only accept visa or travel cards to book tours and we only had cash. There were no signs to advise this or anything in the Embassy brochures to indicate this. After we spent an hour organising and booking tours we came to pay for them and discovered this. We were really disappointed. We then had to reaarange visa finances to finalise our bookings. Had we of known this we would have put some money on a travelcard. Other hotels advised that this was not common practise in other hotels. Although we could have gone elsewhere we would have wasted our time and we trusted the Expedia name as a booking agent. That aside our experience was overwhelmingly positive especially since after arriving with little sleep our room was ready on arrival at 2pm and we were able to go straight there with our luggage. Thank you for everything!!!!! We are raving to our friends and did so on all our tours to guests from other hotels.","Sydney, Australia",10,5.0

This is a family friendly hotel and gets good raves from people who have children who like to spend time in and around the pool. There are two towers which make up the complex, both of which were full during our stay. So a very busy place. The  ""complementary"" buffet breakfast which runs from 06:30 to 10:00 am is fairly extensive but it reminded us of farm animal feeding time, especially the closer you get to 10:00am. Great for watching human nature though.  We didn't make it to the nightly Manager's reception and free drinks but suspect it might  be similar.The hotel is adjacent to Beachwalk with its many shops and restaurants and is close to Waikiki Beach and the Army Museum at Fort de Russy. We also found it fairly easy to walk to Ala Moana Shopping Centre. We had a corner unit which had partial views of the ocean and a much bigger view of the neighbouring Trump Tower....which looked nice...maybe next time! Most rooms have small balconies (lanai) but they are not much more than a chair width so we felt nervous sitting out there and opening the windows shut down the aircon. Room was quiet with no discernible street noise. The hotel has self service coin operated laundries in each tower which are very good and open 24 hours. Housekeeping staff were friendly but perhaps some more attention to removing the foreign black hairs from the bathroom is called for.We had complementary wifi which was pretty fast so a big tick here. Checkout was painless. Overall commentary ... ot bad if you are comfortable with a resort style crowded hotel.","Auckland, New Zealand",77,3.0

We had a wonderful time. The staff was great. Our housekeeper was wonderful, and went the extra mile by always getting us fresh towels for the beach. Our room was clean and comfortable, but was a bit smaller than I viewed on the website. The sound proofing was excellent. We couldn't hear from one room to the other, bathroom included. The manager's reception was fun and lively. There were drinks and snacks for the entire family. The snacks consisted of pretzels, nachos, vegetables with ranch dressing, and chips. You can order food there as well from the restaurant in the hotel. The prices are reasonable. The food was good too. The breakfast was superior. There was something slightly different from day to day in the buffet. There was even green salad and white rice on the buffet if that is something you enjoy for breakfast. The beach is a short walk across the street. If you need to get around town, I would recommend taking The Bus. We went all over the island on The Bus. It cost $2.25 for adults, and $1.25 for kids. Take EXACT change, because they don't give it. If you would rather rent, there is a rental company in the basement of the Outrigger Reef across the street where the Starbucks is located. We rented a car for one day of our stay, and it was super easy to get the car. We even returned it to the Embassy Suites and they took care it from there. The Embassy Suites also has a limo you can rent. We did this another day, and his rates are very reasonable. We will definitely stay here again.","Modesto, California",19,5.0

It is in a fabulous location surrounded by shopping and dining and just a block away from the beach. There is a band playing on four nights during the happy hour and the band really got the guests into dancing and having fun. There were more drink options at happy hour at this property than other Embassy Suites I have been to. The happy hour food consisted of chips, gold fish crackers, dip and veggies. The service from everyone from the front desk, tour desk, housekeeping, bell hops, etc. was outstanding; maybe the best I have ever had. The one thing that I did not like is that the lobby was not air conditioned nor was the floor we were on (16th); our room was the only place with a/c. Since it was so humid while I was there it was awful to sit and wait for a pick up ride or talk to the tour desk after being outside.

Our favorite part of the hotel was the free happy hour every night. The drinks were very good and the bartenders were friendly. We tipped a few dollars each time we got drinks, but tips are not required or expected. The band that played during happy hour was fantastic. Some guests even got up and danced. We stayed in a one bedroom suite, and we had plenty of room for 2 adults and 4 teens. There was an extra sink outside the bathroom. We liked having the refrigerator in the room for water and soft drinks. We had 2 balconies with a view of the ocean. Housekeeping was excellent and always cleaned our room before noon.

Three things that were negative and worth noting:1) Trash trucks make a substantial noise beginning about 6AM through 8 or 9 AM.2) I think hotel workers union has it written in their union contract that they get to use hotel facilities like the pool on weekends.

ABC shops on every corner you will love them, deli food, snacks, post cards, beach items, tshirts all at ABCs. We ordered pizzas from Pizza Hut, one night in and they deliver to reception, make sure you have the correct cash. This was the best Hawaiian pizza we had there Aussie style.

Great laundry and gym with a lovely spa & pool, happy hour with free drinks, snacks included. You can take back to your room & enjoy on your balcony or laze at the pool.

We really like the suite option, having the physical separation between the bed and other area lets us watch tv, unwind, etc. without disturbing the sleeping kids.Here's how the experience should go for you:1. Drop your car off (it's valet only, and a bit pricey, about $25 a day, but at least there's in and out privileges).2. Check-in, and get a complimentary POG drink (passion orange guava). nice touch.3. Get into your room. Small little details, big difference sometimes. The rooms are always clean. The bathroom door opens into the living room, versus opening into the bedroom, so lights, sounds, and...smells...don't affect people in the bedroom.4. Free breakfast and manager's reception. Full spread, not your typical lite continental breakfast.

We were given a room near the pool. I didn't like it. There was no privacy and I thought it would be loud. We asked to change the room and they immediately complied and we got a room on the 9th floor. It didn't have an direct ocean view but if you stood out on the balcony you could see the water. This hotel is not directly on the beach. It is about a block from the beach. This didn't bother us. We were visiting 4 islands and there is so much to see in Oahu that we figured we really didn't have time to go to the beach in the three days we were there any way. We did walk over to the beach. It is less than a 5 minute walk. The hotel had a nice pool. As with all Embassy Suites, there is a free cocktail hour at night. The bartender made a mean mai tai. A decent variety of munchies were served. They had a live band one night we were there. Breakfast is also included: made to order omelets, bread products and a variety of things that appealed to their Asian guests--soup, salad etc...

It was a bit of a shock to the system after a relaxing week in a huge 2 bedroom villa on the beach in Kauai, the rooms are on the small side but as big as you will get in Honolulu. We specifically chose this hotel as have 2 young children and wanted separate rooms. We were given a room on the 10th floor with a city view, which was adequate, until that night when we went to sleep...the bedroom was directly next to the lift (on another note, 2 lifts are not enough to service 21 floors, it stopped at every floor seemingly). After a terrible nights sleep my husband spoke to Vic who managed to find us another room on the 20th floor, a corner suite. What a difference! It was quiet and had lovely ocean views. The bathroom for this room also went off the bedroom rather than the living room which was great for us as could close off the other room once kids in bed. Breakfast was a shock to the system as the whole hotel seemed to turn up at once, but once you got over that and relaxed it was reasonable and the best such a large hotel can do (we did eat at Bills around the corner a couple of times as craved real eggs and bacon and most importantly non American coffee)! The evening drinks were great but unbelievably too potent, which is very unusual! Also provided snacks which was good. Pool was huge and plenty of sun lounges. Free wifi which was a bit slow at times, but free. Hotel is very central and easy to access all the sights, we avoided the pink trolleys to Ala Moana as they were so unpredictable and a cab wasn't much more.

There are lots of positives for this hotel, including the generously sized suites, clean, well-maintained rooms and a good location surrounded by shops and restaurants. We were on the 18th floor of the Aloha Tower and had a lovely view of the Royal Hawaiian ""pink palace"" and Diamondhead. The suites are typical for this hotel chain in design and amenities. The ""kitchen"" area includes a sink, coffee maker, electric teapot, microwave and mini refrigerator. The typical Embassy Suites breakfast is included and it is well done, although less ""Hawaiian"" than other hotels where we've stayed. No macadamia nut muffins or banana pancakes, but a freshly made omelet with ""choose your own"" fresh ingredients is always nice. The staff is friendly and helpful and we have particularly been impressed with the fast and very friendly valet service (which is good because valet parking at $35/day is the only option available). The only two negatives are that the elevators and slow and seem inadequate for the size of the hotel and the air conditioning, while it does work, is not impressive in its cooling ability.

The bathroom was a touch small and after we asked housekeeping for 5 of everything ( we are the fun 5) even less room. There were 2 big TVs with plenty to watch and balconies in both rooms( very good for drying swim wear).In terms of facilities very well suited for our family ( and others too as the place was full). Good laundry facilities . It was great to see enough washers /dryers and even better they all worked!Each day breakfast on the pool deck was a great way to start the day and there was plenty for all .the Buffett style has lots of choice and even though the hotel was full worked smoothly ( even the wait for the omelettes was ok). What's even better is the managers drinks 530-730 each night. Lots of drinks ( soft, beer,wine , cocktails and nibbles) was a great way to end the day and move on to the various restaurants around the area.The pool is good , a little shallow and the spa very hot! At times a little full but the bonus was less than a 5 minute walk you were on Waikiki beach. The hotel is very centrally located and the trade off for space for 5 vs beachfront smaller room worked well for us.Special call out to the front office who I went to see at 11pm on what we thought was out last night who after working some back room magic accommodated in a full hotel and even better same room after our flight was cancelled back to Oz. really good service in the situation.Would highly recommend for families and anyone looking for space...

So when I received the conf. it had no room details at all, I have 4 people traveling, I told hot wire about this as well. So worried I called them the rep was less than helpful, she said that she could not tell me what type of room I was going to get but the hotel would ensure that 4 people could stay in the room type. I said that I need to ensure that I get double beds to accommodate my group. I was told that would not be a problem since I had 4 people the hotel would do that. So I had to wait a couple of days to get confirmation of room type. Well when I called the hotel I found out from their reservations that 1, hotwire requested 2 queens but confirmed 1 king!! I also found out that when the reservation is being made by hotwire they know the minute the reservation is made, so the rep lied when she was on the phone with me just ensuring that the 24 hrs I have to cancel the reservation would expire. So I called hot wire 2 days before my trip and as of writing this have spent 4 hrs being passed around and hung up on by mistake. any savings was not worth this DONT EVER BELIEVE THEM when it comes to details get it in writing 1st before you do anything.

We had requested a one-bedroom suite and were surprised to find we were given a two-bedroom unit – en suite off both rooms, small kitchenette and small, but comfortable lounge/dining area. TV in both bedrooms and 1 in the lounge. More than we required. Iron, ironing board and hairdryer are in the suite.The roomy bathroom/ensuite comes with a shower-over bath, toilet and vanity unit. More than sufficient towels, hand towels pool towels and flannels provided. On a hygiene and aesthetic note however, NO toilet brush!!!.Kitchenette equipped with an electric jug, coffee maker, microwave and small under-the counter fridge. No mini-bar. Drinking glasses and disposable cups are provided. I subsequently noticed that in other reviews the General Manager, Bob Y informed clients that cutlery and crockery are available on request. Perhaps if you are eating in your suite while you are staying you might consider throwing a tea towel and dishcloth in your luggage or finding out what the staff can provide in this respect.The suite is on the inland east corner of the Tower with a view of the business/retail sector and Diamond Head. Nice to relax on the balcony and enjoy the view. Made use of the small but adequate gym on the 3rd floor. The laundry is also on the 3rd floor, providing coin-operated washers and dryers. A coin machine is installed which accepts notes so you can use the machines and purchase detergents etc.An electronic safe is in the lounge. Separate air con switches in the lounge and bedroom/s.Many people have reviewed the breakfast (included in the room rate) and Managers Reception (5.30pm – 7.30pm) (free drinks and nibbles – though the busy (and humorous) barmen appreciate (and deserve) a small tip) We considered the breakfast (starts at 6.30 till 10???) catered to all – children and adults, light eater, health conscious and “gonna eat all I can” diners.There is a poolside bar which appears to operate from about mid morning to late afternoon and also offers a limited snack/meal menu. You can have a laugh with the barmen, especially Lewis.Location has been covered by numerous reviewers as well. To precis, if you just want a coffee, pizza, Chinese, burger or a-la-carte fine dining, they’re all within a couple of minutes walk from the Lobby. A Dennys and ABC shop are in this street. The main street, Kalakaua, is within easy walking distance. The beach is about 200 yards away, and about 300 yards to the Army Museum. The Bus is about opposite the Museum, a cheap alternative to hiring a rental If you have a high enough room on the west side of your building you may catch the fireworks display at about 7.45pm on Friday nights, otherwise it’s a short walk to the beach to see it. In conclusion, an enjoyable stay, great service, friendly staff, and comfortable accommodation.HOWEVER, tune in to my next review which I shall post shortly (as this one is getting rather long) which deals with the shortcomings of our second visit.","Blenheim, New Zealand",29,4.0

The free daily buffet breakfast with made-to-order omelettes, fresh fruit, meats,potatoes, rice,, pastries, oatmeal, cereals, yogurt, juices, milk,coffee, tea, was abundant and constantly kept filled. Their free cocktails/snacks in the afternoon is very generous - very delicious sangria, beer, wine, mixed drinks. Parking is pricey in Waikiki so I wouldn't 't rent a car - absolutely everything in Waikiki is within walking distance and the public bus system is really easy to get around. If you want to tour outside of Waikiki, rent a car for the day.","Kihei, Hawaii",55,5.0

Firstly, its in a good location close to (but not on) the beach. Secondly, its right in the heart of the night time action with a very nice set of shops and restaurants immediately close to the hotel. Thirdly, breakfast is include in the room rate as is a nightly ""manager's reception"" which includes free drinks for a two hour period, this makes the room rate seem quite good value.The less good things:The rooms are quite small and while this shouldn't be a problem (as you will be outside most of the time) it is a factor. Secondly, this is a hotel where you will feel at home if you are one of those people who like to expose their tattoos and believe that the salsa with your evening nacho's is healthy eating. I.e. it feels a bit low rent.Parking is $35 a day which feels expensive and their are few alternatives locally but on the other hand there are no resort fees. WiFi is ok but tempremental and you have to reregister every day.Make sure you ask for a room on the highest floor possible as otherwise the rooms (expecially those overlooking the pool) can be noisy. We asked to be moved from by the pool to a higher floor which they did but then put us next to the elevator. Very annoying.So overall this feels like a good value family hotel but if you're looking for something more upmarket then stay elsewhere.",Frankfurt,94,3.0

I arrange and book all of my families holidays and I put many hours into research looking for what will best suit our family of four. We have travelled the world and I believe that staying in the right Hotel can make all the difference. I looked at many images of the Embassy and my concern was that it looked like it needed updating. We booked an Ocean View room hoping that we would get a ""real"" ocean view. I made contact with reservations and Kay Lee was very helpful and always quick to respond. Our room was a corner room in the Hula Tower (level 20, room 2029) which provided lovely views. You need to be located high in the tower to look over Hotels located on the beach front. We had a room with two queen beds and a lounge room which includes a sofa bed. There is a TV in both rooms. There is a small area with a sink, tea & coffee making facilities and a small microwave. The microwave comes in very handy heating up takeout and leftovers from the night before. The furniture is a little outdated but very comfortable and very clean. From the moment we arrived, the staff were extremely friendly. As we came out of the lift making our way to our room we were greeted by Yuet Liang Chen, Housekeeping, who was so incredibly helpful and friendly and continued throughout our entire two week stay. Yuet is the nicest Housekeeping staff we have ever come across! Yes there is a Managers Reception from 5:30pm - 7:30pm each night where the drinks on the well listed menu are free. It was so nice to end each day with a refreshing drink made by the very funny bar man Keola. Every second night entertainment is provided with a band. For all those Australians who know Bill Granger (TV Chef), he has a restaurant called Bills Sydney a couple of minutes walk from the Embassy on Beach Walk. We picked up a latte each morning and we ate many many times at his restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Very Very Nice! I want to end this review saying that our family loved the Embassy's hospitality and we can't wait to return. Thank you :-)","Melbourne, Australia",34,5.0

Fresh fruit either cut or whole. The package also had a 'Happy hour 'down by the pool which was great as well, even though we only managed to get to one.The pool was great, but you had to pick your time or share with a large amount of children, the hydro pool was especially popular, with another area for children which was only 30cm deep. the only problem I found was that the artificial turf around the pool burnt your feet when it was hot, but I guess that made for some remarkable people watching and their reactions to the turf....the rooms are nicely decorated, very comfortable, lounge and two TV's, microwave and small fridge.

Breakfast was delicious and the location was very central to all the things we wanted to do in our short stay. I had booked a three night stay even though we were leaving on the third night with a late flight to Anchorage (I did not want to have to get packed up early that day then check out and have no where to rest until the flight left). So imagine my surprise when checking out to be told that instead of paying for a whole extra night she would only charge us a 'late checkout fee'. This reduced our bill by about $180!

Quite comfortable. The check in process was smooth and efficient. We missed the famous Hawaii garlands, though. There is a happy hour thrice a week where a live band plays and drinks are on the house! We sampled all the Hawaiian cocktails and ended up with quite a buzz!The breakfast was adequate and on the last day, realising that as vegetarians we didn't have much choice of a hot meal, the chef presented us with superbly made sautéed vegetables. Much appreciated.There is one of the many ABC stores right opposite the hotel and it came in handy to pick up essentials . There is also a good selection of shorts, swim wear, beach wear and stuff. The live band played with gusto and were cheered all the way. The cocktails did help. There is a guest laundry which helps in packing clothes to a minimum.

Was easy to get a beach chair and we were able to get a cabana on two of the days.Reception drinks each night & the band that played 4 nights a week created a fun & lively atmosphere.Fantastic that the bedroom is separated from the living room.

But we enjoyed a great view of the ocean & pool in the hula tower.Close to beach-but not the best part of Waikiki beach.Some considerations for families: Whilst the resort is child friendly, the staff generally are not as welcoming & accommodating of children as some other places I've stayed. We looked into hiring a babysitter, but it was a little pricey as we were informed by concierge they would need to use an agency which incurred a significant fee on top of the hourly rate. The beach closest to Embassy isn't the nicest part- we worked towards the Hilton Hawaiian resort and found the sand softer and less of a drop off which suited our young children better. It would be great if the hotel had a little play space for young children.Other: There is a great little organic cafe around the corner from the hotel called Marie's health food organic cafe.

It was a lovely touch.We would recommend this hotel to families and couples. It is suitable for both given the proximity to great shopping, restaurants, beaches and tour pick up points. Staff were helpful and friendly. Though we did not ask for much, all of our needs were met promptly and with a smile. Room service food was very average and not something we would recommend (unless just ordering a pizza as these were ok).A couple of tips. We payed extra for a partial ocean view and got just that. However, it came at what we consider to be too big a cost for the extra charge. A quarter of what would have been room space in any other room was taken up by the stairwell. This made for a cramped living space for 4 people and 'partial oceanview' was not worth paying extra money for as a result. We would not recommend a room ending in '09' in the Aloha tower on this basis.The bathroom was also SMALL (though clean) and there was nowhere to hang up wet clothes after a day swimming in the pool or at the beach. This was a bit of a problem for us and we found it very unusual given every hotel we have ever stayed at provides this facility in their bathrooms. These could be installed at the hotel for very little expense and it seems a glaring omission that this is not in every room.Also, we booked a transfer to Hanauma Bay through the Bell and later found out that we were charged $8 extra per person than if we had booked direct. I was not impressed by this and would tell others to book this particular transfer direct with a vendor (there are A LOT on offer).We stayed as a family of 4 (two 'tween-aged' children) and really loved this hotel.

The housekeeping service here is excellent and superior to that I have experienced at other Embassy Suites in the US. Sleep quality was truly excellent with great beds and good block-out curtains. Internet service is excellent and free.While this remains primarily a family hotel I was surprised to see many US government guests staying on business. The second half of May is usually quiet but the hotel was full for most of my stay.The pool is very good for families with younger kids. It is not really a relaxing venue for couples or singles. There was no competition for sun lounges and the pool was kept pristine.The hotel has the standard complementary breakfast and evening reception but with a Hawaiian twist. The breakfast is good but varies little from day to day. The free cocktails at the reception are well mixed using quality ingredients. The drinks are definitely not watered down. An excellent Hawaiian band plays 3 or 4 times a week and their performances were a real highlight of the stay.Hotel staff were generally knowledgeable and genuinely helpful. Check-in (with Andrew) was really well done. The food and beverage manager (Lacy) was well on top of things and other frontline staff (particularly Aldrin) were notably enthusiastic. I used the concierge service for some general advice and they were also excellent.The location of this hotel is very good - one block from the beach and right on Lewers St where there are many good restaurants suitable for families.While not cheap, I still really love this hotel. More importantly my wife and 6yo daughter absolutely adore staying here. Still a highly recommended option for families seeking to spend a few nights in Waikiki.","Sydney, Australia",59,4.0

For this trip we booked multiple hotels ar different price points and in the end we chose this one. Although on the more expensive side, many other reviewers often comment you get what you pay for. The rooms are clean and safe. The bathroom is moderatley large. There are two thermostats. The balcony is good. The pool is med size and is no more than 4 ft deep.

They are in a great location, right on Beach Walk which is ""almost"" pedestrian, with lovely shops and restaurants all along the way. You are not on the beach, but it's virtually across the street, so it's easy to be on the beach in a matter of minutes. We opted for the city view, but they do have ocean view rooms. Our bedroom had two comfortable queen beds and was very spacious, as was the bathroom - lots of room for the two of us to spread out. Our living room had a nice balcony where we could sit and people watch. Housekeeping kept our room tidy every day, with plenty of towels, shampoos, soaps, etc. Breakfast was very nice, with a wide array of fruit, pastry, cereal, juice, etc. as well as scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and made to order omelets. My advice - go for the omelets. They are made while you wait, so the eggs are hot. In the early evening there is an open bar with tropical drinks, beer and wine. The snacks are pretty pathetic - chips and cheap savory mix - but the drinks are good. They have a band three nights a week and they are really good, which made the cocktail hour much more fun than just sitting there with a drink and some chips. Front desk was prompt at check in, and the valet was super-helpful with advice on getting around town - and Honolulu is not an easy town to navigate. I would not attempt to drive here - worse than NYC! The valet arranged for taxis to take us to various sites, and also arranged for a shuttle back to the airport, which saved us money. It cost $45 for a cab from the airport, and half that for a shuttle back to the airport!

I had been debating whether or not to splurge at the Trump (which is literally next door) and am glad we chose this spot because the breakfast buffet and ample lounge chairs makes Embassy more of a kid zone. The omelet station was a great plus, not something that is at every Embassy Suites. We got upgraded into a two-bedroom suite and that was ideal with the kids. They each had their own bed in the extra room and we could use the main room for those who stayed up late or got up early without disturbing anyone. The fridge and microwave come in handy, especially if have leftovers or want to grab a few things at the ABC stores nearby. Overall, a more budget-friendly option in Waikiki that is great for families.","Bellevue, Washington",38,5.0

We booked a two bedroom suite on the 9th floor, paying extra for a partial ocean view which was worth it. I am a bit OTT with cleanliness and was pleased to see that our accommodation met and exceeded my high expectations, cleaned daily with fresh shower and pool towels. The lounge, bedroom and bathroom were a good size as was the sink/bench area that included a fridge. Freebies in our room when we arrived were bottled water, chocolates and a tote bag. Free daily newspapers and wi fi was a nice bonus. The breakfast facilities at the Embassy seem to cater for everyone. Pancakes, Made to order Omelettes, donuts, bagels, toast, porridge, bacon, eggs, rice, miso + so much more. The breakfast drinks self serve station had fresh orange/ fruit drinks, coke & coffee facilities. The breakfast was so generous that we managed to fill up and not require lunch which saved $ on food during the day. Free cocktails and nibbles poolside in the evening were fantastic. The only downside (but I am being picky) is the pool itself isn’t that big and can get slightly crowded, there is nothing unique or themed about its design but it is functional and the kids enjoyed it. The loungers beside the pool were generous and comfortable. The Sheraton hotel puts on a fireworks display every Friday night and with the great, central location of the Embassy we could view for free. The hotel was centrally located and within perfect walking distance to restaurants, ABC stores and boutique shops. The Embassy lobby area was well positioned and I especially like the open space (no walls) breezy and tropical like. The hotel was adorned with external gas lanterns that were lit in the evening providing a really nice ambiance. There was a bit of construction and maintenance going on around the Embassy (which you can’t fault the Embassy for) so there was a little noise pollution during the week but given that we spent most of our time out and about exploring the Island this didn’t affect us much. We had a small problem with our door swipe system which hotel staff swiftly corrected and then presented us with bottles of water and chocolates for the inconvenience which was a nice gesture. The Embassy falls within the middle to high price range of Waikiki Accommodation but we highly recommend it and would most definitely stay there again.","Auckland Central, New Zealand",2,4.0

Complimentary drinks offered each night 5.30-7.30. No checking drinks vouchers so place becomes similar to queuing for a Disney ride. Buffet breakfast ok- not much fresh/wholesome choices. Omelettes on demand best bet. Would return if better deal. Avoid pool/dining level on 4. Would be too noisy.","London, United Kingdom",98,3.0

Stayed with husband and 17 yo daughter in one bedroom apt. Room was big enough and whilst we had a 'city view' room we had a beach view from our balcony which was nice. We were next to the elevators and yes they made a little noise - but not enough to make an impact - we certainly didnt feel the need to ask to move or anything like that. The only issue we had with them was they could be slow and then when they did come were often full so had to wait for the next one. Its in a great place, just back from the beach is good, some of the hotels right on the beach are quite open and have a lot of 'non guests' walking through - this didnt happen here so it was good. Breakfasts and the evening drinks were really good - lots of choice and the staff moved very quickly to keep the place clean to ensure the birds were not a pest. It dosnt take long to get to the beach - we prefered the beach in front of the Sheraton and thats just next door so was easy to get to. Pool not fantastic, but ok and comparable to others - not needed anyway with the wonderful beach. Plenty of good restaurants nearby - and not too hard to walk Waikiki anyway - highly recommend this hotel - would stay here again.","Melbourne, Australia",23,4.0

We really enjoyed our suite on the 18th floor of the Hula Tower. The suite was clean with modern amenities. The beds were very comfortable...even the sofa bed for my teenager. We enjoyed the view too from the balcony. Our room was across the hall from the elevator. We stayed for a couple weeks and heard absolutely no noise from the elevators. We were bothered more by the noise outside from Waikiki...loud garbage trucks, traffic noise, beeping sounds of vehicles backing up....etc. We spent a lot of time at the pool. It is an awesome pool in a fantastic location. Great for the kids with a shallow toddler section and lounging area in the water. The pool has a new and modern type soft flooring which is really nice. The pool is shaded from the Hula Tower for most of the morning. There is a nice artificial turf area beside the pool to hang out or play with the kids. Be sure to remember your pool towels from your room. There is limited supply of towels at the pool placed on the bar. At night, the pool is fun too with all the Tiki Tiki torches. There are a lot of reviews about the amazing complimentary breakfast. These are all accurate and true. Love the omelette stations! Enjoy! The complimentary beverages during the Manager's Special are fantastic. You will not be disappointed with ""free"" drinks and snacks. The ""live"" entertainment was very enjoyable and fun. We found the Wifi to be fastest in the covered Breakfast eating area with tables and chairs.If you have a room without a view, take a ride on the elevator to one of the top floors and walk to the end of the hallway. The doors are always open for a natural breeze and a beautiful view.The ABC store is close and convenient across the street from the Hula Tower elevators.Tip...When you are going the beach with inflatables, take the beach walkway beside the Museum...you will find a rental stand for Aqua Cycles at the end of the walkway that offers ""free"" inflation. Its also a good idea to buy water shoes for swimming in the ocean as some areas are very rocky. Or walk towards the pink hotel for a more sandy section of the ocean.Aloha!","Calgary, Canada",14,5.0

At the side of the omelet station there are potatoes with peppers and onions other sides included bacon, sausage, french toast, pancakes. Let's not forget about all the fresh fruit you can muster and if pastries are your thing there is a selection of breads, bagels and muffins. If soup is your breakfast item there was a miso soup station. Drinks included fresh Kona Coffee, Passion Fruit/Guava and Pomegranate/Acai Berry plus an array of juices. My kids 8-10-13 loved the breakfast and it kept us going all day until dinner time the price FREE this would have been an easy $80 tab every day.Thirsty - from 5:30 - 7:30 every day there is a mangers reception which includes beers, wines, mixed drinks and cocktails. Munchies were also provided usually chips, pretzels,peanuts and a fresh vegetable with ranch.The facilities were just fine, i read a review regarding a room near the elevator being noisy, we were next to an elevator and didn't hear a thing. The pool was extremely clean and well looked after. I noticed hotel employees taking water samples from both the pool and hot tub every hour.

Very convenient location.Lobby -- what lobby? Reception area is adjacent to the valet/drive in area. There is no wall between the valet and check-in. Bizarre. Check-In -- I had an end room and was told it would face Fort Derussy. It didn't, it faced Diamond Head. Was this a factor in my enjoyment of the hotel? Of course not. But I thought that if the receptionist was going to offer the information it should be correct. Room -- in the Aloha Tower, ninth floor. Clean, bathroom was nice, bed was comfortable. Noisy. Very noisy. Could easily hear people in the next room and noise from the street. Sitting in the living room -- scratchy upholstery and uncomfortable sofa. Definitely not for my back. Housekeeping -- very nice lady, did a good job, friendly.Breakfast -- a highlight. Plenty of variety, quality was decent. Made-to-order omelets were excellent. Staff was friendly. Baked goods were mediocre. I appreciated the miso soup and the pineapple was delicious. I liked that they offered salad.Evening reception -- I don't know why they bothered with the food. Some chips, some veggies and a dip. Hot cheese sauce one night. Not worth attending for the food but the entertainment was quite good.

I have stayed in a variety of places in Waikiki and this is one of the best especially for families. The hotel isn't very old as the Beach Walk was only developed about 8 years ago. The hotel is well maintained and very well organized.We arrived quite late (almost midnight) and was greeted by Miles who was very helpful. I had checked in online and chosen my room via the Hilton Honors app but the only rooms available for me to choose for my category (1 King bed Oceanview) were rooms next to the elevator. I asked Miles if there was anything else closer to the corner as recommended by many reviews. He would look into it as the rooms roll over, overnight and would leave me a voicemail if he could find something.We proceeded up to the room and spent the night in the room to the left of the elevators when looking at the elevators. You could definitely hear a bit of elevator noise but I never found it to be annoying. It was noted that the property was changing out some of the rolling parts of the elevator to quieter parts as they've noted the previous comments. The only thing that is a bit annoying about this room is that the elevator shafts do take up part of the room so you do get reduced space.Upon waking up I saw the message light flashing and Miles had indeed found us a room away from the elevator. And, we ended up getting 1630 which is the corner room.This room has two lanais. One facing the ocean and the Halekulani and the Outrigger Reef. The other faces the Trump and the pool and Grand Lanai below. The room is very spacious with a nice sitting area and wet bar when you first walk in and the bedroom is quite large with the adjoining washroom. I was there with my wife and my 15 and 12 year old sons. It was a good amount of room for 4 of us which is what I was looking for in an all suite hotel. Everything worked very well and it was well maintained and clean.The service was also very good at this hotel as evidenced by our front desk reception. But, also the cleaning staff and the staff that run the bars and food service.Included in the price of the hotel is a made to order breakfast each morning and a manager's reception. The made to order breakfast is excellent and we took advantage of it each day. Even the omelette line moves quickly given the demand. And, it was nice to be able to sit in the open to eat.The manager's reception is also a nice perk with some light snacks and free drinks. On many of the nights they had a live band that was also very good.The parking is valet and costs $35 a night. The valets were always very quick so don't worry about waiting for your car to get to you.Just another note, this is one of the hotels that does not have a resort fee so remember that when you see how much the hotel costs. That and the other added benefits makes this one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Waikiki. We would definitely return.","Vancouver, Canada",74,5.0

The first room I checked into was on the 2nd floor right next to the elevator. There was no lanai, and it felt cramped. I requested a room change, and they were able to move me to the 4th floor next to the elevator. This is NOT the place you want to be if noise bothers you, as I heard kids running in the hallway and the elevator going pretty often. Noise doesn't bother me much, so I was content.The rooms are modern, spacious and clean. Beds are comfortable. I've stayed in rooms all around the world, and this one is definitely a notch above most as far as the room goes. The made to order breakfast was wonderful, as were the complimentary drinks every evening. This hotel is in a great location. Close to the beach, plenty of dining and shopping options.The valet parking is expensive, but normal for Waikiki ($35/day).

So nice and so accommodating. Congrats to the hotel for the consistently great staff.Having said that, this hotel is like most of the properties ive been in in the Waikiki area. Definitely has a 60s vibe and that's part of the product offered in Waikiki. Not many big glass towers here. The property location itself is tough to get to...you will spend considerable amount of time in traffic getting to and leaving the property. There are two elevators for the Aloha tower and three for the hula tower. The elevators in the aloha tower are very fast.It is not beach front and beach view generally consists of a glimpse of ocean between two high rise condos.The rooms are very clean, the beds are comfortable and water pressure is good. The internet was free for diamond members and was also very fast. Again definitely a 60s vibe but that is consistent with other hotels I have stayed in in Waikiki.Upon check in I was given suite 1809 and informed by the very nice front desk attendant that I had been ""upgraded"" to an ocean view room. The reality was this is one of the smaller rooms in the property Like all the 09 tier rooms in the aloha tower, the living room lost half of its space owing to the fire exit stairs at the end of the building and the ocean view was a silver of blue between two massive condo towers. The primary view off the balcony was the tail end of a 40 story condo which was about 30 yards off my balcony. The rest of the view is a nondescript streetscape. I had to keep the drapes closed for the times I wanted privacy. In the evening with the room lights on in your room you will have an audience of 100 plus people who can easily see into your room.The bathroom door is right off of the bed in the bedroom so beware if you have a friend sharing situation you will have to deal with the bathroom traffic and smellsSo that's what I have observed. Hope this helps others when they plan their stay.I rated the location low only because I had to travel to downtown and the airport for work so had to use a car. Pedestrians will fare much better. Vehicular traffic in the Waikiki area is very bad",,29,3.0

In such a touristy and busy urban area, it can't be easy to keep good staff like that. We stayed in a 2-bedroom unit with my in-laws on a quick visit to Oahu to see Pearl Harbor. The location is very convenient to the beach and plentiful shops and restaurants if you are without a car. A note if you are taking an early morning tour: breakfast starts at 6:30 - if you need to leave before that, make a reservation well in advance for a takeout breakfast. We tried to get a takeout breakfast the evening we checked in and were told we were too late. Have to say I was kind of disappointed that the breakfast buffet was fairly typical of any other Embassy Suites. I was expecting a profusion of tropical fruit, this being Hawaii, but there was just the standard melon-and-pineapple on offer (though there was miso and rice for folks of Asian culinary persuasion). A quibble - we were four people staying in a 2-bedroom suite, but there were only enough coffee and tea supplies for two people, which we did not notice until morning. The staff did, of course, remedy the situation as soon as we brought it to their attention. I downgraded the sleep quality because of street noise. Even though we were on an upper floor, I was still disturbed by partiers on the street in the evening. Then there was the early-morning awakening from street construction. BANG!!! Chunks of concrete being loaded into a dump truck. Why do they have to start this before sunrise?? No fault of the hotel, but note that this is an urban area and street noise happens.",Nebraska,26,4.0

When I first tried to make reservations in Jan. 2014 for our Christmas trip the Hilton website stated there were no rooms available, so we ended up using a wholesaler to book our rooms. Ended up with three families, one in an ADA room, a two bedroom suite and a one bedroom suite. The ADA room and two room suite had a great view of the air conditioning units of the hotel next door. The one bedroom suite (14th floor) had a nice view. The pool was great, the breakfast gets very busy but the staff was great. The shower in the ADA room was flat and water ran everywhere. The two rooms on the fourth floor received lots of street noise, especially at 6 am when trash and delivery trucks were making there rounds. Evening drinks and snacks were awesome. Close to lots of good restaurants and a short walk to the beach. When we checked out we found out that we received no Hilton Honor points since we had to use a wholesaler to book the rooms.

Minor issues, the coffee could be a bit stronger and the juices more interesting, but we loved having breakfast on the patio. free Morning yoga: loved it! Very easy paced class taught in both English and Japanese. Great way to start the day, especially since the time change will probably have you up anyway.

Absolutely loved the hotel location, staff, and hospitality. Check-in was smooth and comfortable, and friendly. The room was spacious, with a nice view overlooking the bustling night life below, and a small ocean view. Amazing breakfast is included, with a super friendly staff always available to help out. The managers reception every night is great, with a nice selection of free beers, cocktails, wine, soda, juice, and finger snacks, and a fun band a few nights a week playing sing a long music. Warning - be careful. The drinks are not watered down and weak - they will bite you. The only negative thing I could say is that the room we were in had double beds, instead of queen size. I'm not sure if that's standard throughout as we booked last minute (airline employee going standby). It was tight sleeping with 5 of us (1 took the pullout couch).There is so much shopping and restaurants in the immediate vicinity (I recommend Giovanni Pastrami's for New York pizza), you never worry about having to walk to far to dinner after a long beach day. And the beach is only 1 - 2 blocks away as well.I'm going to end on a real positive note. I had forgotten my Ipad in our room. When I boarded the plane home, I realized this. I was hoping it was packed away in my checked luggage. It wasn't. The next morning, I received a call from house-keeping that they had found it and turned it in. I guarantee that wouldn't happen everywhere. They were kind enough to take down all my information and deliver it to the UPS store on property, and I will be receiving it next week. So kudos to the good, honest, hard working house keeping staff.

Plenty of choices for all nationalities and food was fresh and delicious. Nice benefit as most hotels don't offer this option. Rooms were very clean and well-kept; housekeepers even smiled and said ""Aloha"" when passing them in the hallways. The only two issues were a slow drain in the tub, reported it to the front desk and within 10 minutes a maintenance man was there and fixed it. The second issue was our initial room was next to the elevator and the sound kept us awake the first two nights. The front desk was helpful in moving us to another room further away from the elevator. The manager's reception was also excellent - free beverages and snacks but even better was the live band and the opportunity to mingle with other guests.

My mother and I went to celebrate her retirement, and although she was off, I still needed to work (albeit remotely). The internet in this hotel worked very well and was high speed. Our suite was perfect since it had a bedroom separate from the other ""living"" area which was great. I was able to work very early in the morning, and my Mom couldn't hear me being on conference calls. The beds here are very comfortable. We had a suite with 2 double beds that were so comfortable, I didn't even miss my bed at home. The breakfast buffet here they have is good with an omelet station, either french toast, pancakes or waffles each day, eggs, japanese soups, etc., cereal and a decent selection. Since it was included in the price of our room, this really helped us save money on our trip. Also, if you're a Loyalty member, they have a nice Manager's reception daily, and music on several nights a week as well. The bartenders were very friendly and generous with their pours (please make sure you remember to tip them even though the drinks are free :-)) This also helped us save money during our trip, since on those nights we weren't too hungry, a few veggies, light snacks and a drink hit the spot. This hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of many, many restaurants and great shops. Since it is a busy part of Waikiki, I recommend that you request a room on a higher floor, as that really helps to avoid a lot of the noise. We stayed on the 19th floor and I didn't hear much at night or in the morning at all with the windows closed. The balconies are VERY small though... I am afraid of heights, so didn't venture out there much but there was a great breeze coming through leaving the window open. Good news in this hotel, at least on our floor, our room was right by the elevator and we also never even heard it. Our room didn't really have too much of an ocean view, but that was OK because in Waikiki, there is always something else to do. We could walk to the beach in just a few minutes.All of the staff here were very friendly and accommodating.

I would not consider staying anywhere else in Waikiki. Our stay was perfect. Parking is rather expensive, $35 a night, but we knew this before we came. Valet service was excellent.

But be aware that suites are not always as described. I checked in on-line to what was described as a king suite only to find it was actually a double bed in a very small bedroom. Having arrived at midnight we just collapsed into the bed for the night and were given another room in the morning, but rooms should be accurately described, and doubles should not be charged at the same rate as kings. Be aware also that suites with king beds are mostly by the elevator so you get a lot of rumble rumble creak ding ding throughout the night. If that is a problem make sure you let them know and take double beds.Only other caveat is don't plan on using the pool for swimming - way too many children, but there are comfy loungers for us adult types.On a more positive note, the hotel guests comprised a very nice mix of age and ethnicity which created a happy relaxed atmosphere-- much nicer than a regular business Hilton or a crazy busy resort.

And on our second and last night there, we were woken by the people in the room on the other side when their alarm clock went off a 5am.

While not inexpensive, if travelling with a family the additional room in these large suites makes a big difference to enjoyment. Even if not, that extra space really changes the hotel experience. Check in was courteous and prompt; we arrived early and a room was not ready, but they gave us pool towels and a key to go to the pool. We enjoyed a drink, watched the superbowl, and had something to eat while we waited. We were treated to a partial ocean view room (I am Hilton Gold so not sure if that was it) even though I had booked city view.The hotel is very conveniently located. It's one block from the beach (public access is well signed) and has a very nice, large pool area with a bar adjacent. The kids really liked it. The hotel is located just off the main Honolulu strip, so it's easy to get into the nearby mall etc. The mall is a short $10 cab ride or there's the bus nearby as well. Breakfast which is included is complete in every way I can think of, including cooked to order eggs. They also have some Miso Soup and rice out, should you prefer that. There is the standard Embassy Suites managers reception, but the timing never worked for us so I couldn't comment on it.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel over all the others I've stayed at, and expect this to be our preferred choice in the future.","Oakville, Canada",33,5.0

They say it can house up to 6 people but I feel it would probably be a bit tight for 6 unless they are small children. The coffee machine in the room was a nice touch. The rooms were very clean and the cleaning maid went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. The Embassy is about the only hotel in Waikiki which includes breakfast. The omelettes were really lovely and fresh as they cook them in front of you with fresh ingredients that you choose.The rest of the breakfast was really average. The staff were very attentive.The cocktails at night was such a bonus. And 3 nights a week they have a band playing while you enjoy your cocktails. The band was fantastic. It was a lot of fun. As Waikiki is quite expensive for drinks and food the complimentary Cocktails, nibbles and breakfast made this hotel the best value in Waikiki in my opinion. The location is very central, only a block from the beach and lots of shops and a ABC store just opposite is very handy. The pool area was also very lovely. It was not too hard getting a seat beside the pool compared to other resorts I have stayed at.There didn't appear to be people reserving chairs with towels and leaving them for long periods unoccupied.

This was the ideal place to stay for several nights each way to recharge from a long flight and enjoy the beautiful resort area near Waikiki Beach. Spreading out in a suite is always a preferred option to doubling up in two beds in a room, or spending on two hotel rooms. The service and staff were well organized, professional and very friendly. Buffet breakfast is included in the room price and was a big bonus so that we could leisurely go downstairs to eat and start the kids favorite part of their day, which was swimming in warm hotel pool. The pool was actually a highlight of our stay as it has a shallow swimming area for the babies/toddlers or kids just learning to swim, as well as a large area for better kid swimmers. And for the parents, a huge hotub pool that was attached where you could easily relax while watching your kids in the pool. They were also flexible about letting the kids come into the hot tub, which both of our kids enjoyed for brief periods. And the best part - the pool was always warm and had night swimming, which became part of the daily routine. The hotel interior is clean, nothing fancy, but again, worth it for having a suite with kids. It could use a refurbishment but that would probably drive the price up quite a bit and I would rather have this as an affordable family option for the spacious rooms. I would recommend asking for an upgrade to the larger suite, which really had considerable more space than the standard.

It is certainly a comfortable place and although it was a bit more expensive than Hilton Hawaiian Village where we stayed at the end, the included breakfast and evening drinks make it a good choice if it's more than 2 of you. It is right bang in the middle of everything so it's an easy stroll to the beach and only a few minutes walk from Kalakaua Avenue with all the shops, restaurants, etc. The breakfast was very nice, a couple of egg stations with hard working guys making omelettes (but not getting tipped much, unlike bartenders in the evening who were getting A LOT of tips!). Perhaps they too should have displayed some dollar bills around (like the bartenders) to hint :-)...Coffee was rubbish though - really weak, but that's more to do with the way Americans like it, I think. I would say that the only other disappointing thing was that the (rather small pool) was always full of kids splashing around and I was (during our 4 day stay) never able to swim a length without having a kid in the way. It would have been nice if there was a time/ an hour or so allocated for adults only or if at least one section was cordoned off for just adults.

Bed was comfortable.As stated by others, this hotel is in a good location, close to shops, restaurants and beach.The Expedia concierge at the hotel organized an enterprise car rental for us to pick up across the road at the Outrigger Reef and we were able to drop this back at the Embassy Suites after hours (compact car, 1 day, $80 (+$40 insurance) ).Breakfast at the hotel was OK (omelettes were very nice).Evening reception, great drink selection and food was nice for a quick snack.All in all this was an OK hotel - only let down by the unrealistic glossy brochure type website. What you see is not necessarily what you get!I feel the ratings on this hotel are dependant on the room that you get….had we been given a decent room it would have been given 5 stars, with the average room we were given it gets an average rating of 3.",Gold Coast,92,3.0

Our favorite part was the complimentary breakfast bar with cooked to order eggs/omlets and the Manager's Reception in the evening that included complimentary snacks, cocktails, and a wonderful band who played classic tunes as well as top pop songs with a unique sound.

We spent three night at Embassy Suites, then moved to the Hawaiian Hilton Village for four nights. After just one night at that less than pleasant hotel, we checked out, phoned you and asked if we could return to Embassy Suites for the rest of our stay. We were even given our same room-929. How lovely! Your hotel is in a great location and provides a quiet, intimate setting in midst of the bustle of Waikiki. I needed a late check-out for January 29th and was provided a most generous offer for a very reasonable rate. We will be back! My daughter and I look forward to future stays at Embassy Suites.

The breakfast is one of the better ones that I've experienced even when compared to properties across Asia where they can get quite elaborate.  The evening reception was always enjoyable - the snacks are not suitable for a substitute for dinner, but the complimentary cocktails and live music were great. The rooms were nicely equipped and the beds very comfortable. The pillows weren't to everyone's liking in our family - some found them too soft. The hotel is relatively easy to get in & out of if you drive - it's just off the very busy Waikiki beach road - so you get slightly less traffic. Only downside is the elevator capacity is pretty limited. 2 banks per building - and during busy times we'd sometimes get frustrated and walk down 10 flights of stairs vs waiting longer than the 5 minutes we'd already wasted. One night the people above decided to have a jumping competition or something to cause a lot of banging around 10PM - it subsided around 30 min later and when we called the front desk the next day - they asked us to let them know if it happened again and were very apologetic.Finally - the staff everywhere in the building were always so positive and helpful. Maybe it's because they live in HI, but they certainly made us feel great about our choice for a hotel.",Florida,4,5.0

We initially had lvl 6 aloha which overlooked the busy street below. It was a tired room and noisy from airconditioning units and street noise. The lovely gentleman at reception moved us due to wrong bed configuration. We were moved to level 20 same building but it was next to the lift shaft in fact part of the room accommodates the lift shaft. The room was extremely tired, small and noisy with view being rooftops, back alleys and air conditioning units. Stay well away from the lifts. No balcony just tired windows that open 15cm or thereabouts. At 6am we approached reception who were very understanding and looked for another room. We ended up paying for an upgrade to get something decent. We were moved to the hula building lvl 17 ocean view. This tower was not as tired looking. We didn't expect street noise to be a problem but we were awoken very early each day by trucks collecting trash and truck reversing noises. Once we accepted the fact the view was worth the upgrade we opened the windows only to close them as the people next door were smoking! Sadly and I don't blame them but I think reception was hiding when we went and 'aired' our concerns!The location of the hotel is great and the people who work there are friendly. The swimming pool is small for the size of the hotel, and it is quite shallow. The free buffet breakfast was lovely especially the custom omelettes. Reception man at front desk was very kind and helpful.Probably the best part of the hotel are the included extras--breakfast Good selection of juices, omelet station, miso soup etc. So, The location is both good and badIf you're looking for a posh resort experience with an ocean view, spa, water features, beach, etc., definitely look elsewhere.

Obviously, since it is an Embassy Suites, you got a separate bedroom and living quarter - which in Waikiki is like a palatial manner. We got the top floor and a great view (course it was rainy and windy for a few days on our trip so we didn't get to enjoy the balcony as much as we would have liked). Loved that it was ver quiet!! thank you to the staff for putting us in that room (I am not a fan of loud and unruly people). Some reviewers don't like the security card for elevators, but I appreciate them. The layout of the hotel is very open. While you can't guard against everything, deterring unwanted would-be thieves is a good thing. The added layer of security is nice.The breakfast buffet is huge - and included Japanese favorites (miso soup and greens) that made me feel like home. The staff at the breakfast were all super friendly and helpful. We only looked at the manager's reception - which seemed like a very nice benefit (we noticed a couple who seemed to really take advantage of it - we counted 14 cups of alcohol).The gym was fine - typical cardio and free weights. Just perfect for me (love that it is a 24 hour facility as I workout very early).

Good breakfast each morning, not to mention happy hour each night from 5.30-7.30 and fabulous band. Staff were excellent, very friendly and pool was great - there were always enough lounges and spa pool was nice way to relax. Great location - close to restaurants & lots of shopping. Downside to eating out is turning up & having to wait 45-60 minutes each time as they're so busy - ie: Cheesecake Factory, Yard House, Dukes - they take your name & while you wait outside give you a 'beeper' that flashes when your table is ready. We tried different times varying from 6.00pm - 8.30 pm but always had to wait as these were popular restaurants. Would definitely stay at Embassy Suites again.","Melbourne, Australia",8,5.0

We were unhappily staying down the road at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and realized that we (now a family of 3) needed more space. So I stopped in and spoke with one of the managers who was happy to accommodate us. We made the move for the remainder of our trip (6 days at embassy suites) and I couldn't have been happier. Brandon, the manager, was very thoughtful and found us a very quite room as I requested. While this hotel is not located on the beach, we made the decision to pay for ""partial ocean view"" and I was beyond thrilled with the view. I could sit on the couch in our living room and see the ocean and sunsets. The hotel's physical location is in what I call the ""heart"" of Waikiki surrounded by the best shops and restaurants. I don't know if the hotel is new or recently updated but the entire property was very well kept and seemed new. All of the furnishings appeared in perfect condition and I'm a sticker for chipped furniture or peeling paint and I saw none of that. My only criticism would probably be with the quality of the bed linens. They were not that soft and the sheets on our king bed did not reach or tuck under the bed, but those seem like minor complaints for all that the Embassy Suites has to offer.The pool, though not fancy, was never crowded and got a good bit of both sun and shade. I loved that they had several cabanas that were FREE. I've paid $50+ per day at the fancier hotels to use a cabana, that alone was a huge savings. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that they had waitstaff to serve food/drinks at the pool, something I wouldn't have expected of an Embassy Suites. We definitely took advantage of the free breakfast and managers reception. I thought the food was fine, not gourmet, but the reception was the best. Again we saved a ton on cocktails that we would normally have paid for at other hotels. Best of all the service was excellent. All of the staff was beyond friendly and helpful. It seemed like we saw the same faces throughout the day, bartenders, housekeepers, valet etc. It really had a friendly homey feel. I'm so glad that our need for additional space brought us to the Embassy Suites. It is now one of my absolute favorite hotels and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The location, service and amenities make it equal or superior to all others. I can't wait to return!","Washington, DC",66,5.0

They are great.This one is great although the rooms are smaller than other ES's. The staff is great, the rooms are clean and up to date, and the location is good. It is not on the beach but is just a short walk to it.Suggestions: go to the Army Museum nearby- It is free and worth your time. This location is in the heart of the tour district and there is good walking.We went to an oceanfront bar at the Sheraton that was good. At night we went to a restaurant called the Shorebird that was in the Outrigger Hotel (?). The Shorebird is different in that the server brings your entree to you raw and you have to cook it yourself. It sounds odd but was fun.Negative points: Honolulu has a very bad pigeon problem. During the free happy hour my wife put a tray of tortilla chips on our table in order to get some more treats and upon her return there were five (count 'em) pigeons duking it out to wolf down the chips. They are aggressive in the afternoon. In the morning during the free breakfast the sparrows have that shift and they are more low key.Overall, I'd give the E.S. five stars.

The Embassy Suites fit the bill as a good value, conveniently located option. Their suites are built to accommodate families--particularly if you have more than four people. Our suite had two queen beds and a queen sofa bed so could have slept six. For under $300/night in Waikiki it was good deal. It is a landlocked hotel but only a one block walk to Waikiki Beach. It's surrounded by other towering buildings as well so there's really no ocean view to speak of. It has a pool/lounge area on the fourth floor terrace that was okay. It wasn't super crowded when we were there so there was plenty of room. Probably the best part of the hotel are the included extras--breakfast is included and is great for being free. Good selection of juices, omelet station, miso soup and kimchee--not bad. Each evening they have happy hour with free alcohol. Free drinks are free drinks--can't deduct stars for that! They also had a pretty awesome band playing--it's kind of a evening pool party. Wifi is free and works well. Parking however is $35/ night valet. The location is both good and bad. It's landlocked as mentioned so it's not a beach resort. It is absolutely surrounded by awesome shopping and dining options all within easy walking distance. Roy's Waikiki was right outside the elevator door of our tower. Probably the biggest downside is that this hotel--like most of the hotels we've seen in Waikiki--looks old and outdated. This place was probably the bomb when the original Hawaii Five-O aired, but not anymore. The walls are old, the furniture is old, the fixtures are old. The rooms need updating. The beds don't have fitted sheets. The microwave and mini-fridge are old. The bathroom fixtures are old. The balconies are tiny and scary and we just forbade the kids from going out there. There's nothing to see anyways! But having said that, everything was functional and the service was perfectly fine--we had zero problems during our stay. In summary, if you're looking for a posh resort experience with an ocean view, spa, water features, beach, etc., definitely look elsewhere. Heck, get out of Waikiki and go to Ko'olina! But if you didn't come to Hawaii for the hotel and just want excursion/attraction convenience and a place to sleep, you could do worse. ","Las Vegas, Nevada",499,3.0

We had the option of the lower-priced, on-the-beach Hale Koa Hotel, but ultimately decided on the Embassy Suites because of the extra space (separate living and sleeping rooms), the included hot breakfasts, and the daily free drinks at happy hour. We made the right choice for us.The location is quite central and an easy walk a block to a nice beach. Surrounded by restaurants, from Subway to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and everything in between. Lots of high-end shopping in the area. Seven Eleven and ABC variety stores/delis/grocery nearby. Useful to have a car to get around town and the island, though parking is a bear everywhere and the hotel's efficient valet-only parking is approx. $37/night (+ tip). For military folks, the hotel offers a military family rate that is reasonable for this hotel and the area.Breakfasts were hearty (cooked to order eggs/omelets, Asian choices, scrambled eggs, sausage/bacon, fresh fruits, yogurts, cereals, breads/muffins, etc.). Efficient - we never had a wait in line except for a few minutes if you decided to order specialized eggs. (Signs discourage you from taking food out of there to eat later.) It's in an indoor-outdoor setting (with birds awaiting your crumbs) on the 4th floor.The staff throughout the hotel are incredibly friendly and helpful. Security is excellent - you need a key to access your floor (& can't access other floors except 4th floor) and the housekeeper challenged my husband when he came into the room when she was cleaning (she took his key and tested it in the lock).It's child-friendly, including the nice pool area (has decent-sized pool - though don't count on space to do laps; hot tub; 1.5 foot child pool area). Bar food is reasonable there (approx. $8 kids meals, good adult burgers and other choices for approx. $15). Every other night (M-W-F; maybe Saturday?) there's live music at the happy hour, which is lovely.There's also free yoga (7am) classes and hula (3 or 4 pm on Thursdays?).Since Embassy Suites is a Hilton Property, you can sign up for a very soft-sell timeshare presentation for $100 Am Express credit card or 20k Hilton points, etc, for 2 hours of your time.The rooms were quite comfortable and included a mini-fridge and microwave. We were on the 15th floor, city view, next to the elevator, but it was very quiet and the room (odd numbered rooms) overlooked a city park and hotels in the distance, with a peak of the ocean. This was a family trip, but I've also stayed here for a business trip in the past and was equally satisfied then.We did some of the area activities such as the Atlantis submarine (it was great - the regular/lower-priced version was perfect; no need to pay more for the slightly larger window sub) and a luau (at Hale Koa). The 4 year-old loved them both, as did the adults.",,75,5.0

You're more likely to hear typical morning traffic sounds and the occasional dood stumbling back to his hotel. Solution: close the windows. The soundproofing in the rooms is great. - Parking ain't free. It's not cheap, either, but you get in-and-out privileges and the parking attendants will treat you right if you treat them right (*cough* tip *cough*). - This is not a sleek boutique hotel where you're likely to find half-naked, glossy, celebutantes on the pool deck. You're going to see dozens of laughing kids and their pale, doughy parents (like me) splashing each other in the pool. - You are not going to walk out the hotel and be able to flop onto the beach. It's about a block away.Now to the good: - The staff. The staff here are great. Everyone goes out of their way to make sure your vacation is incredible. If you don't see something, or need ideas for activities, feel free to ask. - The rooms. Despite family recommendations, we've stayed at other properties. If you're into European or Asian hotel rooms, all the others are fine. If you're used to American hotel rooms, this is really the only option in town unless you're prepared to spend serious cash. - Breakfast. It's not fancy, but the breakfast buffet is great for putting some fuel in the furnace and planning the day. You can mix and match American, Continental, and Asian breakfast items to your heart's content. - The pool. Sometimes I just want to sit around by the pool and fry in the sun whilst enjoying an umbrella drink. The pool deck is perfect for this. It's not huge, but it's one of the biggest in Waikiki. - Location. At first, you might be dismayed that the hotel isn't on the beach and that it's at the end of Waikiki. After a few days, you'll realize that's perfect. Less traffic, less drunken frat kids, a little more quiet, and really, it's a pretty easy walk to the beach. When you get to the beach, it won't be a mob scene. - Dining options. Looking for a Spam musubi and a can of iced coffee? 7Eleven and ABC are just out the door. Oh, out for a romantic evening? Roy's is just downstairs. There are also noodle shops, tonkatsu restaurants, and more familiar American fare all around. Take a little stroll and you might find some of the hidden jewels in Waikiki. - The staff. Seriously. They are awesome.","Chicago, Illinois",8,5.0

It is short walk to the beach, just down Lewers or Beachwalk and hang a right, there's beach access next to the Outrigger Reef. The manager Happy Hour is a fun start to the evening and there was music on Monday, Wednesday and Friday when we were there. Also, there's little park just below the Embassy on Beachwalk where they had a band and hula dancers for free on Tuesday around 5 pm and we could see them from our balcony. There are lots of restaurants nearby, but there's also a food court in the Royal Hawaiian on the other side of the Sheraton. It's worth it to walk through the Sheraton lobby for the sand sculptures. There is an ABC Store/Deli just across the street from the hotel. It had basic groceries and a deli in case you don't feel like going out. There's also a Giovanni Pastrami across the street on Lewers that we ordered pizza from and delivered to the pool one day. It was good pizza and service was very quick.Just West of the hotel on Kalia Road, there is the Hawaii Army Musuem, which was interesting.","Richardson, Texas",61,5.0

There was a balcony which looked over the pool and offered views out to sea.The beds were very comfy, including the pullout in the lounge for our daughter. The pool area was great, with plenty of room and lots of loungers available. The free buffet breakfasts and nightly manager's reception drinks were a great bonus. The nightly free drinks and nibbles meant that guests got to know each other, with the wonderful family band (four nights a week) adding to the happy vibe. All the staff we encountered were professional and friendly, nothing seemed too much trouble. I would note that this is more a family property than a place for couples wanting a quiet romantic spot.

Chose the hotel based on staying at other Embassy Suite hotels. Was not disappointed. Check-in was different as registration, bell desk and valet are all out in the open, at least the area is in the shade-not a bad thing. There are two hotel towers and ours was the Hula tower on the 3rd floor. Enter the room and to the right was the wet bar area with coffee maker, hot water maker for tea, microwave and mini frig. The bedroom was a couple more steps to the right, two beds, armoire, with hangers, iron, ironing board. One nitpick-the height of the hanging space was too low for dresses and pants. (After reading this before posting I got it-the height is because this a handicap room geared for a person in a wheelchair, so the height issue is a non-issue for a person in a wheelchair.) Also a dresser. The bedroom and living area both had separate temperature controls-NICE.Bathroom nice counter space, plenty of towels, and this was a handicap room-roll in shower. Slight raise into the bathroom, shower seat. I just wish there was a bathroom fan to exhaust some of the heat and moisture. The breakfast area-open lanai, friendly staff there. They kept up with cleaning the dirty dishes, asking if we needed anything-drinks, coffee. Expect birds in the area, and do not leave your food out in the open for any length of time. One suggestion-place spikes in the rafters so the birds don't roost there.Convenience store in the tower and a small souvenir store. There is also a restaurant that we didn't use. For additional souvenirs go across the street to the ABC store, and there are plenty of other restaurants in the immediate area as the area is two level shopping area. One bad experience-the fire alarm went off one night about 12:30 am; forget everything you have but grab your room key and cell phone. Hint-keep your key near the door or the dresser in the bed area.Close to the beach, did not use the pool area on the 4th level, nor did we use valet parking.

Now it is. And wonderfully set in the heart of the Beachwalk area is the Embassy Suites. We have stayed here several times, with each stay being wonderful (other than one stay made less enjoyable due to an assistant manager who was candidly a jerk to a large group of guests watching the World Cup four years ago). The hotel is benefitted by the #1 aspect of real estate, location, location, location. You can walk out the front entrance and are within a very short walk to the beach, great restaurant option, and plenty of early and late happy hours. The location doesn't get any better. And I must say the Yard House restaurant under the hotel is a great option. And a short walk to the Hard Rock, which is first class. Ther are numerous options nearby if these don't meet you needs.Besides the location, this hotel does it right. Rooms are clean and comfortable. The morning breakfast and afternoon reception (read free drinks) are well done. The bartender (local Hawaiian gentlemen) at the Managers reception is a friendly great guy. Never forgets your drink. And this year the Manager has music (entertainment). A family band named Kanilau. These guys are awesome.MANAGER TAKE NOTE - this was a great decision and selection. Kanilau are very talented, friendly and worth every penny that you pay them. We have attended many Manager receptions at Embassy's (we are Hilton Gold and HGVC owners) and your reception with Kanilau is by far the best.I also have to say thanks for the room upgrade we got (Hilton membership has some benefits), we were assigned a high floor ocean view (corner room). We had an adjoining room with family and our stay was the best yet as we got to enjoy both the first class rooms and the views. Thanks to the staff and manager for this room assignment. In closing, if you need to consider this hotel if you are visiting Waikiki and want to be in the heart of the action. Have a great visit. Aloha.","Southern Shores, North Carolina",167,5.0

First off, we would stay here again the in future. Service was excellent. When registering, they provide you a glass with fresh juice. Walking distance to the beach and you can walk to Ala Moana Center but it is a longer walk. Many shops and restaurants closeby. The hotel is composed of two towers, Hula and Aloha. We were in the Aloha tower. The Aloha tower contains the Fitness Center (quite large), Business Center (4 computers/3 printers), Guest Laundry (5 washers and 8 dryers - $3 for a wash and $3 to dry, coin change machine, and laundry soap/etc, dispenser) on the 3rd floor. Note that if the washer becomes unbalance due to what you are washer, it will stop. The breakfast and pool are on the 4th floor between the 2 towers. Being Hawaii, the lobby is open and not enclosed and generally comfortable, I would have liked a common air-conditioned area to just sit and relax. Only valet parking ($35/day) with in/out privileges. The room key is needed to select the floor in the elevators. The breakfast is very good with the normal Embassy Suites fair, but they also have local items like white rice, portuguese sausage, hawaiian fruits, etc. The line at the omelet station can backup quickly. We didn't partake in the free happy hour in the evening. Our Aloha tower room had a TV, dresser, desk/stool and wardrobe (ironing board and iron, 10 hangers) in the separate bedroom (we had a single king bed). No built-in closet. The living room had a sofa, chair, desk/chairs, and safe. The cabinet under the living room TV has additional drawers for clothes. Unlike other Embassy Suites, there is no full kitchen. There is a dorm size refrigerator which was really good in terms of keeping things cold. Bar size sink, coffee maker and microwave. There is no stove, utensils, plates, etc. Air-conditioning worked really well with separate controls in the bedroom and living room. Also both rooms have a sliding glass door to a narrow terrace with chairs/tables. Both rooms are slightly smaller than other Embassy Suites. Bathroom is good size with a single sink, large counter space, hair dryer, and tub/shower combo. We were on the 16th floor and wifi work great. Wifi is normally not free unless you have the HHonor status, etc. Ice and drink machines located across the elevator.","Honolulu, Hawaii",46,5.0

We could see ocean glimpses from our Lanai and I also used the fitness and business centres that were well equipped and free. The inclusions of a buffet breakfast and free drinks each evening makes this hotel very good value for money.

We waited and went to have a little sushi for lunch and took a quick walk around the area. When we returned we were given the keys and a bellman came up with our luggage, gave us a quick tour and a great suggestion for dinner (Room With Out a Key).

I always love having two rooms, one to hang in and one to sleep in. Makes it nice!! We went to the managers reception two of the nights and the bartenders were efficient, friendly and even remembered what we drank. One evening there was music with a great local band, a Father and his son. WOW, they could play, songs that you would recognize but with a local flavor and of course a ukulele, we called the restaurant we were going to and moved our reservations back to continue to enjoy. The manager and assistant manager were taking around pizza and making sure that everyone was having a great time (which we were). Breakfast was good, and quick but you do have to watch out for the birds. The pool was great and with the buildings one side stays in the shade (which we like). Only problem was that they had 6 cabanas and I guess do not have rules about just ""claiming your spot"". Someone came out early we, were there by 9:30 put their towels down and came out sauntering out at about 11:00 am to claim their spot.

The front desk staff was super friendly. Unlike typical hotel lobbies where you stand during the check-in process, here you get to sit to do the paperwork. Another staff member soon appeared from behind a door with refreshing tropical drinks for everyone in our family (fruit juices for the kids, too!).We had a two bedroom suite, with a ""moderate"" view from the lanai. The suite was clean and nicely decorated, though not super fancy. The pool and restaurant (where complimentary breakfast and afternoon receptions are held) on the 4th floor are easily accessible. The pool is not huge (no lifeguards on duty), but it is clean and warm, and the kids enjoyed it. The breakfast is quite nice, as compared to other Embassy Suites (which I've stayed in many). There are numerous Hawaiian and Japanese items available, in addition to the usual American breakfast selections.Outside of breakfast, the on-site restaurant doesn't serve any food, but plenty of food options are within easy walking distance.As a family traveling with 4 adults and 2 kids, this hotel was pretty ideal as few properties on the Waikiki strip offer 2 bedrooms. We would definitely recommend it for large families, or even small ones that appreciate the extra space that a suite provides (not to mention you'll save big money on breakfast given the high cost of everything in Hawaii).",San Francisco,485,5.0

All of the staff were very pleasant and helpful. The location was great for accessing the beach and the main area of Waikiki.

It was nice to have a sink outside the bathroom to wash water bottles and containers in. The hot breakfast was definitely a high-lite! There was so much to choose from! The one complaint that I have about this property is that the elevator were so slow most of the day (2 elevators for 21 floors!). There is also no way to bypass the elevators if you want to go up (they lock the stairwell access). Most days we would wait at least 2 or 3 minutes before being able to get onto the elevator. The elevator was faster early in the morning and late a night.,"Ponoka, Canada",9,4.0

This hotel is perfect for families with a decent sized living area that is separate to the bedroom (we stayed in a one bedroom suite). Our room was wonderful - right on the end of the building, so we had a ocean view out the living room window! We travelled with our 7 month old and so it was perfect for his day sleeps and putting him to bed early - we could relax in the living area on the comfy sofa and have a bit of peace and quiet to ourselves. It had a sink, microwave and mini bar fridge which we needed for our babies food and bottles. Strangely though, there was no washing up liquid, cloths or plates, cutlery etc ...this small thing would be a big help. We loved the inclusive breakfast and even better - the cocktail hour from 5.30pm to 7.30pm! The location was ideal ... close to everything!

I burned 140,000 Hilton points for the 2 days we stayed here. Why did we choose here and not the Hilton Hawaiian Village? Well that was an easy choose as the HHW is now so big that they have no room around the pools and the staff are damn right ignorant. i have stayed there many times and progressively it has got worse. I have stayed here once and it was a good experience but as they say ""one swallow doesn't make a summer"" and I thought we would run with them again.It was the right choice for sure. We checked in and were handled very well and the bags dealt with by the bell service. The room was OK. I say that because we got a nice room but a big chunk of it was lost because of the stairwell next to us.The breakfast was fine. A little busy on one morning but take note of the signs that show when the quieter times are. That is very valuable to know. Food was good. I see there are posts about oats missing etc but guys you are in Hawaii for goodness sake, eat what they do. A good fruit selection, omelettes, good range of Japanese choices. The chef at the omelette (and yes this is the correct way to spell it!) station was fantastic. I cannot each cheese due to an allergy with certain types and he make a fresh egg omelette for me each day. I saw no one was tiping as they seem to do in other Embassy Suites but he deserved it. There is an issue with birds as you pretty much eat outside. One of the guys clearing tables was always trying to get rid of them. He was really helpful and I wish I could remember his name to give him the kudos that he deserves. He cleared tables helped with drinks, really good guy.On the first night the managers reception was short lived. We were at 11 hours time difference so we grabbed a drink and hit the sack. The second night we attended by accident as we were late back from going shopping (yeah, no my idea but let the girls shop and I get to play a couple of rounds of golf!) and caught a last couple of drinks. The band that were on were pretty good too. Once it finished though it was like the bar shut! I am guessing people dont like to buy drinks out their own money! Note to Bar Manager, get a decent Bourbon, the one you serve is really poor and for the price difference surely cant be a problem.Check out was good, but the staff in hotels need to realise that when you knock on a door when you havent checked out, I am not going to tip you! Off we went to the airport to fly to the Big Island (see my report on the Hilton Waikoloa and Kohala Suites). Got half way to the airport and my daughter realised that she had left all her jewelry in the safe. I rang the hotel and to cut a long story short they arranged to get it all shipped to the Big Island for me. Thank you.I would recommend it for sure. The 2 bedroom suites are great and it was a shem we didnt get upgraded as Diamond Members but when we are back in Waikiki we will be back here for sureMahaloPS.

We cannot recommend this hotel enough. We were there when a hurricane was approaching and the hotel was so organised with information and advising us what to do and what the hotel was doing. They organised breakfast boxes to have in our rooms and it ran so efficiently. The location is perfect with shops and restaurants at the door, the beach is a minute away. Thank you to all the staff for totally fulfilling our expectations, and a big thank you to the family who entertained us. The impromptu Hulu dance from the daughter and son on the father's birthday was a highlight. The only issue is the birds. Keep an eye on your breakfast, and don't sit under the eaves as I did.

It was in an outstanding location, the only way it could have been better is if it was directly on the beach, but frankly, in Honolulu, that isn't necessary. The beach a 5 minute walk maximum and there are tons of places that rent chairs & umbrellas right on the beach. The pool at Embassy Suites was a great size, heated just right and the pool & pool area were always clean. I can't say enough about the room set up if you have kids. Essentially it is two rooms, ours had two queen beds in the bedroom, and a pull out queen in the living area. The microwave & mini fridge were ideal for the teens too! The room was very clean & nicely appointed. In order to fit two adults and two teens, at most hotels you would likely need two rooms, so while the price was higher per room than some of the other hotels, you get more space for your money! There is a daily breakfast that runs until 10am. Having teens, 10am was a little rough so they didn't get there everyday, but the days we were there, we were very pleased! Omelets cooked to order, and they were fantastic! Lots of hot food choices, fresh fruit, various breads to toast, yogurts, and the list goes on. Great value. My favorite part was the 5:30-7:30pm manager's reception/cocktail hour. There is a fairly good variety of cocktails to pick from, and a snack bar that varies each evening with things like chips/salsa, veggies/dip, potato chips, nuts etc. This too was a great value for our stay! There were two things I didn't really like, one was that parking is $35/night and it is Valet only. I felt that was a little high, and in our situation, we were moving my daughter in to college at UH, and we did a lot of in/out of hotel, so tipping each time gets a little steep. The second was the Hospitality Suite after you check out, if your flight leaves late at night like ours did, they only allow you to freshen up in the suite for a half hour and only if it's not already being used. I have traveled this route several times and other hotels have had better hospitality suite set ups. Other than those minor details, you literally walk out of the hotel and you could go towards the beach, or to any number of shops & restaurants. I would stay there again for sure if I had kids with me again!","Bellingham, Washington",61,5.0

From start to finish, the hotel staff went above and beyond the call of duty to make everyone feel welcome and cared for. Yes, it is pricey (actually very pricey -- from the view of a timeshare owner), but well worth it. Just a note; Our family owns 2 timeshares, and after this experience, we will call our timeshare association to see if they can add this hotel in their resort directory. The location and most importantly the level of service alone is worth the price. Some hotels charge a lot less, and some charge alot more, but even if you cut Embassy's level of service and amenities in *half*, it still would be alot more than what you get from those other hotels. Located just one block from the Waikiki beach front, it can get quite ""loud"" outside, but we had a 1 Bedroom Suite (City View), for 4 adults (which could easily fit 8), and not only had 2 queen size beds, but the living room had another pullout queen sofa bed. It came with a half kitchen (I've seen mini fridges which should be called ""ice boxes"" and if there ever was a true ""half"" fridge, this is it) and the bathroom was fully (and I mean *fully* stocked with all the toiletries (towels, shower caps, etc.) as well as beach towels. The in room coffee maker and electric hot water pot came with an assortment of instant coffees (decaf/caf) and teas and even convenient cup covers/holders. The hotel staff (which is quite possibly the best I have ever encountered *ever*) is ready to assist with any supplies (toothpaste, for example) that you might have forgotten to bring. The balcony overlooked the city, and through the buildings you can see a part of the ocean). Families, you will love this hotel, as the hotel hosts alot of complimentary activities: three yoga classes each week (Mon, Wed., Fri), two hula classes each week as well as two hoop introductory classes *all free*. They also have a nightly managers reception by the pool where they serve complimentary drinks, and have live music. However, what separates this hotel (apart from their outstanding staff) is the complimentary breakfast buffet (it really should be called a feast) every morning. This buffet has everything anyone could ever want (eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, pancakes, waffles), and features a cooked to order omelet in which you can add whatever fix-ins you want (green peppers, onions, tomato, sausage, ham, bacon) and even salmon!!You just can't go wrong at this hotel: the Business Center on the 4th floor was a wonderful resource with 5 computer workstations, two printer/fax machines, 1 scanner, just wonderful. The hotel also has a gymn, bathrooms on the 1st and 4th floors as well as a bar by the pool.Speaking of which, a special shout out to the outstanding staff at Embassy Suites Waikiki, especially to Cary, who took the time to map out key spots for us to visit, and gave us helpful advice particularly in regards to the two storms (Hurricane Iselle & Julio) which fortunately didn't affect the island of Oahu too much. The hotel also went out of their way to keep all guests informed about emergency procedures and supplies to keep in hand in case of evacuation which fortunately, did not occur.The hotel is located right in the middle of Waikiki Beach Walk, a three level shopping extravaganza with all types of stores, restaurants and cafes. This hotel is literally right next to the #1 restaurant in the city: Roy's. Pricey, but if anyone is looking for the Food Network Master Chef experience, this is the place.The only negative thing I can say is that it is easy to forget that you don't need your room key card to go down to the lobby, and sometimes it takes several swipes to get the elevator moving. Also, the open resteraunt area where they have the breakfast is also frequented by birds who know where the good stuff is. The hotel staff are responsible for cleaning up after each table is vacated, but sometimes the birds get there first!Also, even though there were 5 computers in the Business Center, one needed troubleshooting which left 4 and sometimes there was a waiting line of people.Can I just once again thank the hotel staff for their exemplary service: The guy who came and unstuck our toilet in the wee hours of the morning, many thanks! The housekeeping staff for not throwing us out everytime we called for yet another item we forgot to bring. The front desk for working with us and making sure we made our shuttle after check out. We definitely will be coming back soon!","Silver Spring, MD",33,5.0

We were very satisfied with our stay and would recommend the ES for families. I selected the Embassy Suites based on the style of accommodation offered. The fact that it offered 2 queen size beds (as distinct from the double beds that seem to be standard at most Hawaii hotels/resorts) and a separate living area suited our family circumstances. We found that it certainly delivered in this regard. The beds were comfy, and being queen size, relatively spacious. Those of us inclined to go to bed early(or late) or get up early (or late) could do so without disturbing the remainder of the family. We appreciated the space we had here after having previously spent 4 nights sharing a room. We found the rooms and furniture to be well maintained without being flash or fancy in any respect. The living area had a small but adequate mini-fridge, a coffee maker which we used every day and if my memory is correct, a microwave (which we didn't use). My 12 and 14 year old sons rated the wireless internet connection as the best we experienced in Hawaii and Housekeeping were very thorough and accommodating (for example when we asked for an extra towel and were provided with 2). A minor point of criticism is that there was limited space to hand and store clothes - but this wasn't a huge inconvenience. Although the nearby area can be quote noisy of an evening, we found the rooms very quiet once we closed the sliding doors. Being on the top floor and at the end of the corridor would have helped with noise. Unlike the Sheraton (where we stayed for 3 nights after the ES), we were not disturbed by noisy neighbours or noise from the hallway. We booked an Ocean view room and were given a corner room with a view of the ocean in between 2 other hotels (Halekulani and Outrigger I think) in one direction and a view of the Waikiki area (including the iconic Pink Palace) from the other direction. We were very happy with the location of the rooms within the hotel and the view. The ES Hotel is conveniently located, being one block from the beach and close to various restaurants and shopping options. A word of warning - it can be difficult to get a table for dinner during peak times - so you may want to make reservations ahead of time. The Ala Moana Shopping Centre is only a $10 (approx) taxi ride away or if you prefer, the public bus stop is in the next street. Various other shopping options are available in nearby streets. We used the Expedia desk to arrange a trip to Pearl Harbour and also to arrange a car for a couple of days. We didn't think that the prices were any higher than what was available via the internet (the car may have been even a little cheaper). We were able to return the car to the hire company by just handing it over to the valets at the ES hotel (they have an agreement) and this was very handy. Breakfast was varied and plentiful - lots of different hot and cold options, sweet and savoury, replenished regularly. The birds in the open air breakfast area were a bit of a nuisance and quick to pounce on any food left unattended. I can't comment on the manager's reception or the pool facilities - they both looked nice from a distance but we didn't access either. I had booked the room with a late checkout option included (based in availability). I had to assert myself a bit before they agreed to the late check out, however I do understand that they were very busy given that it was the day before 4th of July. We compromised on a checkout time that worked for us. One staff member that I spoke to in this regard was a bit abrupt but I spoke to another staff member on the morning of the check out who was very cordial. In summary, we found the ES well maintained, well located, very functional but not fancy or flash. I would recommend it for families and would certainly consider staying again if I ever return to Waikiki.",,10,4.0

It was great for us as we had a bedroom with queen size beds and a separate lounge/kitchenette, two way bathroom and balcony - which meant we were not under one another's feet!! It also included a free breakfast every morning - which was more than ample for us. Mind you - a lot of people wasted a lot of the food (their eyes were bigger than their stomachs)! Another bonus was the generosity of the happy hour (actually two hours) from 5.30 - 7.30pm. A very generous occasion both with the alcohol and snacks - a lovely time for the families there. They also provided live music four out of seven nights - a great family of males who sang and played well - especially their ukulele player. It was also in a great position and it was good to do a lot of walking (although not too far). The beach was nearby, the pool satisfactory and all around - a great place that made our holiday very enjoyable. Two disappointing comments I would make was we couldn't use the gym or laundry in our Tower - and although a small kitchenette - there wasn't any cutlery or plates. In view of large servings of food when we went out - and everyone happy to give you the leftovers (which were very ample) - there wasn't anything we could eat on or eat with.

It is a fantastic Hotel, located a block from the beach with all sorts or stores and restaurants within easy walking distance. It is also very close to the Galleria where you can catch the various trams. We had a room overlooking the pool which was excellent. There is a large pool with attached large hot tub and children's pool. These pools have an incredible bottom surface which is so soft! There are cabana type double chairs available on a first come basis [no extra charge]. There are also plenty of regular lounge chairs. Included in your stay is an amazing buffet breakfast including an omelet station, fresh fruit, juices, tea/coffee/milk, pastries, pancakes, cereals, yogurt, etc. They also have a happy hour in this area, which is a huge lanai adjacent to the pool. Complimentary drinks [beer, wine, cocktails, sangria] and munchies are available nightly from 5:30-7:30. The 2 room suite set-up is very nice and includes 2 TVs, a work desk, complimentary internet, bar fridge, microwave, kettle and coffee maker with the accompanying amenities. Also, for those on a longer stay in Honolulu, I really appreciated the self-serve laundromats on the 3rd floor of each tower. The staff at Embassy Suites were all very professional, friendly and most helpful. They will also hold your luggage at no extra charge if you have a late flight or are travelling onwards.

Check in is usually from 3pm. However, our flight from Australia arrived at 7.45am and we were at the hotel by 9.30am. We were able to check in straight away, as they had a room available. We had a 2 bedroom unit and it was perfect for our holiday. We stayed in room 524,for 6 nights then went across to Hawaii Island for 3 nights and then came back and stayed in room 724 both in the Hula Tower. On both check ins we received a lovely, refreshing cold juice punch drink. The units were identical and consisted of a room with a queen bed and an ensuite, kitchenette (not much crockery or cutlery), lounge dining and a 2nd bedroom with 2 single beds and a bathroom, perfect for our 2 teenagers. The units were very clean and comfortable. Usually I find pillows a problem at hotels, but this place had great pillows, so I could get a good nights sleep each night. The Embassy Suites include breakfast, which is very good, lots of variety in the food and a nightly Managers Happy Hour from 5pm - 7pm. There are free drinks and snacks. We went a few times to this. Some nights there was a great band entertaining everyone. Our accommodation package also included a Roberts Stars and Stripes tour for everyone. Embassy suites is conveniently located across the road from the beach, there is a Coco Cove convenience store under the building, a large ABC convenience store and a Denny's across the road, the Royal Hawaiian centre is near by and many other places to eat are only a short walk away. It is about a 20 minute walk to the Ala Moana shopping centre. It is about a 2 min walk to the Sheraton, which is a bus terminal pick up point for some of the Islands tours. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful and made our stay enjoyable.

There was great live music 2 of the 4 evenings we were there. I didn't get a chance to take advantage of the free yoga class this time, but it's nice to have the opportunity to do yoga while on vacation. For all of the amenities and services, it is the best price for a 1 bedroom suite in this location compared to other hotels along this popular block.

My husband and I have traveled to Waikiki at least once a year for the past 15 years, he used to live there and we met and were married in town. We know the area very well and have always stayed at either the Outrigger Reef on the Beach or Outrigger Waikiki. We love both of those hotels (I have reviewed them in the past) but since this was the first time we were bringing our children (ages 11 and 13), we wanted a little more space while staying in the same location and very close to the beach. Embassy Suites definitely fit the bill. For the same price as a room at the Reef, we got a suite at Embassy Suites, plus the hot breakfast every morning and the manager's reception in the evening, which was one of my favorite parts of the day. We arrived at 8:30 pm, hungry and tired and were greeted by the friendliest staff. We were offered an icy cold tropical fruit juice cocktail (my kids begged me to ask if we could bring a bottle home) and a fast and easy check in process. The bellman brought up our bags very quickly and gave us a tour of the room, letting us know that if we needed anything to please let him know. The rooms are a good size. It is a remodeled hotel, I believe it was originally an Outrigger, so the ""suites"" are more like two hotel rooms, with a connecting door. One room has the bathroom, a kitchenette (microwave, mini-fridge, coffee maker), a pull out sofa bed, television and table with chairs that could also be a desk. Both rooms have lanais, and I would suggest that if you are bothered by city noise to request a room on a higher floor. We were on the 6th floor and the noise doesn't bother me at all, but it isn't quiet as our room faced Lewers Street and Beach Walk. The bedroom had two very comfortable beds, an armoire, television, etc... Plenty of room and storage space for the four of us. We did call housekeeping for extra blankets and towels and they were delivered almost immediately and with a smile. In fact, every time we ran into housekeeping we were always greeted with a smile and an aloha, the women were all very sweet.The pool is on the 4th floor on a large deck that has beautiful views. Our first morning was spent eating breakfast there with a view of palm trees and a rainbow. We spent a lot of time on that deck, swimming and sunning. The pool was crowded in the mornings and later in the afternoons, but never so crowded that we had trouble finding a seat or feeling like there was too much going on in the pool. I did like that there were loads of kids, my son met a group of kids he played with in the pool everyday we were there which was great. The daily breakfast was perfect for us and after a few days you realize there isn't much variety day to day, but there is plenty to eat and something for everyone. It never felt crowded and we met many nice families while we were sitting out enjoying our food.We did order food from the pool bar for lunch one day, and while the coconut shrimp were delicious, they took forever to arrive. I'd like to chalk it up to being on island time, but it really did seem to take forever. It seemed that there was only one server working with the bartender, so maybe that had something to do with it. The service at the pool might be the only thing that wasn't great about this hotel. There is a pool bar with a television (which was great because the NHL playoffs were in full swing), and the bartender was a nice guy who made a mean lava flow. He was also the bartender at the manager's reception, so all of these guys are working hard! My husband and I loved the manager's reception every night, two hours of drinks included in your room rate! We sat on the deck and listened to live entertainment while the kids swam in the pool. Just a tip, the soda fountains that are open during breakfast are also open during this time as well, so you can send the kids over to get their own drink (or you can get one too!). I would say to PLEASE remember to tip those bartenders, especially since you aren't paying for your drinks. They served many a cocktail the nights we were there, and I was surprised at the number of people who weren't taking care of their bartender. There were also light snacks (chips, salsa, crudite, etc...) It was a great way to start our nights.The beach is a very short walk away, not even a block. It's not the best beach on Waikiki but if you can get past the rocks, the water is beautiful. Kayak and surfboard rentals are easy to find and it's a gorgeous walk in either direction once you're at the beach. You have beach (or pool) towels in your room to take, but remember to bring them back or you will be charged.The location of this hotel is perfect, great dining options close by, shopping, etc... I'm really glad that we chose it for our stay.","Los Angeles, California",32,4.0

Upon check-in, we were placed in a room that had an unbearable aroma (details of which I will not go in to right now - let's just say that no one would want to remain in that room for any length). The individual at the front desk told us (in a rather unpleasant tone) that this was the only room available that would match our needs. We immediately returned to the front desk to inform them that this room was unacceptable. Another member of their staff was able to correct the situation (surprisingly, another room became available). This seemed to be the mantra for our stay - basics would require correction which some members of the staff were able to address after the fact. Our experience left us with the overall sense that perhaps the management of the property is in transition. You can see/feel the influence of strong leadership in the service industry.

Unfortunately at the time of booking it didn't appear that an ocean view suite was available. As we liked the hotel so much the first time we decided to still stay there even without the ocean view. I have to admit the suite we were allocated didn't live up to our usual expectations. The suite itself wasn't bad as such, but it didn't have a view and it wasn't as big as the corner suite we had previously stayed in. As there were 4 of us (myself, my husband and our 10 year old twins) we felt closed in. t just didn't have the same feel and after the fist night I decided to speak with reception to see if there was any chance of being moved. Thankfully the lovely lady on reception took quite some time to search the booking system and eventually came up with a solution. We spent one more night in our suite and were then moved to a corner suite on a high level in the Hula Tower. It made such a difference to the rest of our holiday and we were very grateful for the time taken to help accommodate our request. Obviously this was at an extra expense, but it was well worth it. If you can afford it, I would suggest to ask for an ocean view suite. Although most people don't spend a lot of time in their suites, it's a beautiful view to wake up to, and to look out at whenever you are in the suite. You also don't feel so closed in, and the corner suites are definitely bigger than the others..... plus they have 2 balconies.Everything else about our stay was wonderful. The staff were friendly and helpful from reception and the guys who organised taxis etc, to the bar staff and chefs who cooked our eggs each morning. One chef even remembered us from our visit nearly 2 years prior. The person who stood out the most was Aldrin. He also remembered us from our previous stay and was there each morning with a smile and a lovely welcome. He's a real asset to the hotel.Of course we took advantage of the Manager's Drinks each night and the wonderful live entertainment. Our children loved meeting other kids at the pool and there's a real family atmosphere. We have recommended the hotel to many friends and they have not been disappointed. We love the location, the size of the suites, the Manager's Drinks, the breakfast, the staff and the feel of the place. Yes it has hula girl bedside lamps and pineapple tree carpet, but there's something very charming about the almost tackiness of the decor.

This experience left a bad taste as we were leaving. As annoying as this was, I cannot really justify marking the whole experience down based on it.","Newburgh, Indiana",13,5.0

Honolulu is a disgusting city, we were offered LSD (out with our 2 teenaged girls who don't dress/look like drug users!) and saw a prostitute working a deal the first evening we walked to Waikiki Beach - it was still light out and we were in front of the Out Rigger, not lurking in some seedy area.

There was plenty of variety each day and my kids (ages 3, 6, 10, and 14) had no problem finding something to eat. We especially loved the staff in the breakfast area. Aldren and Lei were very helpful when we asked questions about the destinations we were planning on visiting. Aldren was so sweet and greeted us with a ""Hello family!"" each time he saw us. Coronado was also very helpful when we needed utensils or napkins after the breakfast area was closed.We loved the pool. It was just the right size for our kids. I loved the couch cabanas that were around the pool.If your schedule allows, I recommend the free Yoga classes that are offered.

She quickly assisted me with check in and even gave me free POG (passion orange guava juice)! The open air lobby is beautifully kept, well staffed, and convenient to both Embassy towers.Because I'm a HHonors Diamond member and was using my points for the stay, I was upgraded to an ocean view, corner room on the 15th floor of the Hula tower. When I got up to my room, I was pleasantly surprised to find 2 spacious rooms and the biggest bathroom I've ever seen in an Embassy. The best part was, the room had three sliding glass doors leading to two different lanais, overlooking the Waikiki shoreline on one side and the Embassy pool and Trump Tower on the other side. A nice touch was the voucher for Honolulu Cookie Company cookies that I found on my pillow as a welcome gift.I arrived late afternoon, so the evening reception was my next stop. Fun island music and fruity drinks will whisk you away and help you forget the troubles of the mainland. The band is extremely talented and all the bartenders who served me made excellent drinks (blue Hawaiian, Hawaiian Punch, mai tai).The next day, I was jet lagged and woke up early so I was at breakfast when it opened at 6:30am. The breakfast staff was so friendly and accommodating -- anticipated my needs, and they even made me a custom juice blend!! Breakfast selections are plentiful ... something for everyone here.I was a little unsure where exactly I wanted spend the limited time I had on Oahu so I stopped by the Hilton Vacations desk adjacent to the hotel's front desk before I took off for my day's adventures. If you haven't been to Oahu before, I recommend stopping here to get tips on how to maximize your time on the island. The agent there who helped me was knowledgeable about the island and pointed some 'musts' out to me that I would've otherwise missed. She was extremely patient -- took about 10-15 mins -- to explain everything to me. Her recommendations were spot on! Not a moment of my day was wasted.The next day, I spent some time by the beautiful pool even though the weather was a tad overcast. The cabana pods come with pillows and are so comfortable. Theres only five cabanas so if you want one you should plan to strike early. Otherwise, there's plenty of chaises -- they were never full that I noticed. The nice thing about the cabanas and chaises is they're all FREE. I've been to places in Florida that charge you if you so much as glance at a chaise. The pool is well maintained and clean, and there's a hot tub and a children's pool all attached to the big pool so you're never far from either of those.The location of the Embassy is walking distance to Wakiki Beach and also upscale stores (Kate Spade/Coach/Tory Burch, etc.) and restaurants (Ruth's Cris/House Without a Key/PF Changs, etc.)The last night of my stay, I found on my pillow a complimentary Hawaiian music CD as the hotel's parting gift to me. Such a nice way to cap a truly amazing stay! I was grateful to take a little bit of aloha back to the mainland with me.I took the red eye out of Honolulu and was able to sight see before leaving for the airport because the valet will let you park at the Embassy until 11pm the day you check out. The hotel will even let you use their 'hospitality suite' for 30 mins to freshen up before departing for the airport.I highly recommend the Embassy Beachwalk.

Breakfast was included everyday (including cooked to order eggs/omeletes). Every afternoon we had drinks and nibles by the pool. The band that played on most nights was good.

They gave us a third room in the tower facing the pool and ocean (the partially view)--much better. It was clean and fairly quiet except the alarms. The fire alarm went off 3 times in the middle of the night while we were there. We had to call down the first time to see if it was real. It was not. But a loud speaker wakes you up telling you to leave your room and take the stairs. We were very high up and disabled. Not fun to hear at 3am. Okay now the good part. Great location! Walking distance to the beach and many fantastic restaurants and shops. We could also get fresh fruit close by. The concierge puts on a presentation so you can get information on things to do around the island. Many good tips. The free breakfast and happy were really great. Lots of food choices plus many Asian selections-- my daughter loved it. We had a nice full breakfast everyday then a nice happy hour in the evening. You get 1 or 2 free drinks and snacks.

Let me say that I did a lot of research on Trip Advisor for hotels in Waikiki as the rooms are pricey and there is a vast selection to choose from. I am happy to say that we were overwhelmed with our stay here!While this is one of the pricier stays in Waikiki, it truly offers the most value for the money. It is not how much you spend as opposed to what you receive in return, and let me say that the Embassy Suites Beach Walk offered amenities by the bushel!Our suite was nice with double queen size beds in the bedroom and a large living room, kitchenette and wet bar. The rooms were spacious by Waikiki standards and each room had a separate balcony. Although we booked a city view room, by looking to the right, we had a nice partial ocean view. Location is important in Waikiki, and in my mind the Beach Walk area is the best place to stay right now. This area is modern, clean, nicely lighted and offers a great variety of mid and upper end dining, stores and boutiques. All within close walking distance is Starbucks, P.F. Changs, Cheesecake Factory, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Hard Rock Cafe and many others too numerous to mention. Right next door is the new Trump Hotel and high end Halekulani Hotel. We did not see one sleeping bum on the street during our entire stay here unlike many other locations in Waikiki! The hotel is also just across the street from the beach. The complimentary breakfast buffet does change slighty each day and does offer fresh made to order eggs and omelets. Also available depending on the day were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, chinese soup(miso) and salads, pastries and fresh sliced fruits. This free breakfast served 6:30 -10:30 daily competes favorably, if not better, than many of the breakfast buffets in the area that you are forced to pay for. My compliments to the chefs!Unlike other Embassy suites that I have stayed at which offer one or maybe 2 free drinks, this one has a Happy Hour like none other running from 5:30 - 7:30 nightly, and it is all you can drink! Not only that, it's not no name liquors, but all name brands and are the drinks are garnished nicely! Tip these guys as they deserve to be tipped and they will not only remember your drink, but they will provide pours that comparable in the best drinking establishments. The mai tais that I had almost nightly here, were the best on the island by far! Snacks like chips, salsa and sliced veggies and dip were also provided each night. Four nights a week live entertainment is provided, and they play a mix of Hawaiian and current hits. The staff are all friendly, always with a pleasant Aloha and smile, no matter the day, time or situtation.I would like to put a special thank you out to our housekeeper Lleuwelynn on the 7th floor of the Hula Tower. She did a wonderful job in cleaning our room and providing us with plenty of fresh towels as requested. She was always around and would ask us how long that we would be gone so that she could clean our room without interupting us. No matter when we were coming or going, she would always greet us, strike up a brief conversation and wish us a pleasant day. Thanks for all of the notes and for the Hawaiian music cds, which were really a nice touch! She became almost like our Hawaiian Mom and on our last day she wished us well on our journey and said that she would miss us!Thinking back of our lovely stay at the Waikiki Embassy Beach Walk puts a smile to my face and you can bet that we will stay here on our next visit to Waikiki!","Hamburg, New York",108,5.0

I would also highly recommend Victor at the front desk to anyone needing help with reservations or any matter concerning your stay. He was always one step ahead of us on any questions or help we may have needed. Thousands of people stay at the hotel and when we checked in he remembered our name's and where we are from.

The breakfast certainly catered for everyone- we ate at different times every morning and never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a yummy freshly cooked omelette. The managers reception was greatly appreciated. We had expected watered down cocktails, due to them being complimentary- in fact, they were the opposite. I'm already missing my nightly blue hawaiian.

If they were not it would be lower. Feels a little dark and make sure you get a room away from the elevator. For the first two nights it felt like the elevator was in my room and I really could not sleep. After I was moved it was much better. And the room was bigger too. The rooms are small compared to other Embassy Suites I have stayed in. When going to the free breakfast do not go when it first opens or you will stand in line a very long time. Also if you get the omelette ask to have not a lot of oil. They pour too much which can make the omelette greasy. When I was checking out there was only one person on duty which made for quite a wait. The pool was very nice. ,"Chicago, Illinois",33,4.0

Then there is the happy hour crew, Keola, Dennis, Lacy, and Lewis making EVERYONE feel like they are royalty. They treat everyone the same, like every person is their favorite guest. it was wonderful. The valet staff was also fabulous! They were sprinting back and forth getting everyone's cars as fast as they could, which is no easy task because some guests were a little demanding! They busted their butts and were also wonderful.

This was my 9th trip to the Islands and 6th to Waikiki. Of all the places I've stayed I would rate Embassy Suites as the most kid/family friendly. The hotel is located in a very good area of Waikiki. In my experience I would say Waikiki as a whole is a clean and safe place for families to visit, but I have found that the areas closer to the zoo have a number of street people hanging around, sleeping on the streets or begging. There is virtually none of this in the area of the Embassy Suites. The area nearby has lots of shopping and many good restaurants to choose from as well as a bunch of ( get ready for it ) ABC stores to shop at. This hotel is a short walk, less then 5 minutes, to both Waikiki Beach and Fort DeRussy Beach Park.We stayed in a one bedroom suite in the Hula Tower. The bedroom had two queen beds and the living room had a sofa bed. The suite, while not fancy, was very functional and had more then enough room for the 5 of us. The beds were comfortable and the sofa bed was ok. Our suite had an excellent view of the pool area as well as a view of Fort DeRussy Park and a partial view of the ocean. The pool area is simply outstanding. The pool is fairly long and has a tot wading area and hot tub attached to it. The pool is not deep, about 4 feet at its deepest, but it is big and provides lots of room for the guests. The deck area is very large and has an excellent layout. The deck has plenty of lounging chairs and five larger cabanas. The cabanas were a great place to hang out as a group or have a nap. There are a number of palm trees on the deck as well that provide shade. The deck has two bars as well. One is open for lunch and the other opens around dinner time. They serve a wide variety of drinks and some decent pub style food. I had shrimp tacos that were pretty tasty.The hotel offers it's guests a complimentary buffet breakfast. When traveling with a larger group/family this makes life easy in the morning. The food has your standard fare, scrambled eggs, sausage, yogurts, cereals, juices etc as well as a made to order omelet station. The entire property was renovated about 8 years ago and is still in good shape. The staff at this location were excellent. They were friendly, attentive and easy to locate. Overall this hotel provided us with an excellent experience and I highly recommend this property to families. We will stay here again.","Vancouver, Canada",39,5.0

I had to insist that they ask the manager before it was corrected. The manager not only honored the promotion package, but lowered our rate as well!One item I had forgot about when booking, because in small print, was $35/night valet charge because we had rented a car. But real estate is a premium, esp Waikiki so it makes sense that parking would be expensive. Valet staff very pleasant.After that, our experience continued to be exceptional for our week stay. Breakfast was as healthy as I could ask for - great salad, miso soup (with tofu, kimchee, asian pickles if desired), fresh fruit, eggs to order in addition to the assortment of rolls, cereal, various cooked meats and potatoes.Manager's reception had live music, free drinks 3-4 nights a week, and had veggies with dip and chips or munchies nightly. This was a fun way to hang out with our kids and saved us a lot of money eating out since we already had our ""appetizers""The walk to the beach is a very short distance, about a block through the Outrigger Reef where you had use of their amenities as well. Location to walk to shops and restaurants was fantastic. Henry's, a hole in the wall right across the street, serves the best mango ice cream we have ever tasted!What made me decide to write the review was our experience the last day. We asked for a late check out because our flight was at 10 pm. They gave us an extra hour, so it allowed us to go the beach in the morning (even had time for surfing), We went back to check out at noon and put our bags in secure room with the bell staff. The staff let us know we were free to use the amenities so we went back to the beach and later returned to use the Hospitality Suite they recommended - no reservations, first come first serve basis. Since we weren't ready to change our clothes quite yet, we thought we would use the pool. The front desk person on duty even asked if we wanted fresh towels to go the pool with!! When we were ready to check if the Hospitality Suite was available, there were a couple of families ahead of us so we had time to go to the hot tub for a last bit of relaxation. We then used the Hospitality Suite for our allotted 30 min to shower and change. Picked up our car and drove to airport. What a perfect last day in Hawaii!

The complimentary breakfast is all that you could ask for or need. The nightly managers reception on the pool deck with complimentary drinks and nibblies for 2 hours was really great.

That in and of itself creates a set of dynamics most institutions would much rather opt out of - regardless of the potential bottom line infusion. However, this hotel was a 9.5 on a scale from 1 - 10. I only remove the .5 because they all too efficiently awakened me at 05:30 each morning (they could have forgotten me once!). :)) They displayed a pleasantness and courtesy not too often experienced any longer in this business, it was the norm in hospitality environs.

The location is superb with all in walking distance: food, booze, clothes, 24-hr conv. store, Waikiki Beach, a museum, ice cream, Hard Rock Café, a mall & more bars. If you don't have a car - don't get one. A waste of money if you're staying here-just get a cab.  For those that are interested....breakfast is free. FREE. And it is good by any standards. Not the usual 'continental' dope, but the real thing. Put it this way: the food served here would make any East Coast or New York diner owner cringe with envy, it's that good. Full buffet of -you name it- and an omelet station. At City prices this is a big $$ savings to be factored into the daily rates. As is the Manager's Reception with an open bar and munchies in the afternoon. FREE. Yup open bar. With lite food to curb you from $17.95 appetizers before $24.95 chicken entrees. FREE. When is the last time you heard this at a hotel. 1985? As one adds up the freebies, not nearly as costly as it initially appears.  I will return here with wife & daughter in tow next time.

We required a two bedroom suite because my husband and I were travelling with our daughter, her husband and their 21 month old daughter. The suite on the 17th floor, met our needs perfectly - well we did have to get a few items from housekeeping, like spoons, a knife, coffee cups and wine glasses, but they were provided promptly and without question. You can't cook a meal in the suite because there are no suitable facilities but hey, when you go on holidays, who wants to cook? Anyway, because of the location there are any number of eateries within a short walk and there are quite a few restaurants underneath the hotel. The suite itself had two bedrooms separated by a living area with lounge, chair and small table with two chairs. The bedrooms each had its own bathroom, one bedroom had a king bed and the other two queen beds. It was very comfortable accommodation, plenty of room for us all (including a portable cot for the baby) and a lovely balcony which looked north over the park with a glimpse of the sea even though it was classified a city view room. There is a kitchenette with bar fridge, coffee and tea making facilities and sink. The hotel has a laundry for DIY washing and drying of clothes for a small charge and the energetic could have a workout in the gym while waiting for the washing if so desired. There is a really nice touch in the form of a manager's reception each afternoon from 5:30 - 7:30pm where drinks and nibbles are provided by the hotel and on some days entertainment by a local group of professional musicians. The staff were all very friendly and obliging especially our housekeeper and those on the concierge desk. The location of the hotel is great, just a block from Waikiki Beach and the same from Kalakaua Avenue where there are more shops than any husband wants to know about!! Just think of a designer name and you'll find it there - heaven. Immediately outside the Embassy Suites in Lewers Street is a fountain which entertained our 21 month old constantly - a lovely family friendly area. We were in Honolulu in February and the weather was mixed, a couple of wet days to start, a few overcast days and a few sunny days. Temps. were mid-late 20's celcius (77-84 f) but the humidity made it feel much warmer. Honolulu is such a popular place that we had to make dinner reservations a day or two ahead in order to be able to eat where we wanted without queuing for an hour or more. We all felt very much at home at the Embassy Suites and wouldn't hesitate to return (soon I hope).","Mona Vale, Australia",60,5.0

Fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, potatoes, breads, cereal and oatmeal, you could not leave hungry! There as one gentleman that was so personable, he greeted everyone with a smile and a refill of coffee. There was a few working the breakfast but not at cleaning but planning their nite etc....the birds were different but you get use to them fast.

We pulled into the very well festive embassy lobby only to be greeted by the very attractive vAlet staff. When we pulled into the lobby, we were impress by the physique these young men possessed.

Professionalism was assured and each handsome face said ""aloha welcome to embassy suites hotel"" I was assisted by a fine young man, middle aged whose name was Michael . I can't forget him because I was embarrassed when he asked for my reservation name and it wasn't on his list. Not only was I taken of guard but the staff had bell service On its way but valet took all of our many luggage out from our trunk and neatly lined on the curb. Before I could catch my breath Michael said "" I'm sorry but I don't see your name here. Don't worry come on out, right this way as I find your reservation."" I looked through my bags and realized the documents with my confirmation was lost in a bag that I left at the car rental agency. Now I was furious, Michael assured me he had contact information to every car rental at HNL airport. I couldn't resist. I apologized for my lack of attention and he escorted us to the front desk. He gave my information to front desk agent and our keys was given in no time. Michael then assured me once he got in touch with the car rental he would promptly let me know. Not even 45 mins after check in Michael phoned me informing me that my belongings would be delivered shortly and not to worry about a thing! When I retrieved my belongings at the valet desk 5hrs later Michael was there to assist me. He assured my relaxing stay was going to be starting soon and he had a bunch of information on where we could start. For the next 4 days the valet desk was comfort for us. They had our car waiting for every early morning adventure and addressed all our questions and concerns with maps, directions and great service.

Well we were not dissapointed. From the moment we arrived it was nothing but outstanding service. We were welcomed with a lovely tropical fruit drink and a fast check in- nothing better than getting off a 10 hour flight! We stayed on the 21st floor with a ocean front view and wow, it was breath taking. The room is not as modern as other hotels, however it had that lovely hawaiian feel to it, which in my opinion is what you want. The rooms are spacious and clean and have great views. For couples or people going for the more luxury side, I suggest going for the Aloha tower which is nicer. The free wifi is fantastic and the daily housekeeping is great. There was only 2 negatives. The first one was the breakfast. We ate here once as we couldn't again. It would suit possibly families, however if you like a nice breakfast I suggest going somewhere else. We were unable to eat the omelettes as they were awful, they had only 2 types of fruit, 1 cereal and the rest was oily, reheated food. The second one was the pool. The pool itself looks lovely, however if you are wanting to relax by the pool, get a bit of sun and enjoy the peace and quiet, this is not the place to do it. It is full of kids all day and it was because of that I didn't get to enjoy the pool area. Waikiki beach is only a couple of minutes away so I suggest going there. Apart from that it was a lovely, relaxing and enjoyable stay, I highly recommend staying here, you will not be dissapointed. I can't wait to return!","Sydney, Australia",9,4.0

The concierge arranged our car rental for a day; we picked up the car from the Enterprise location in the Outrigger hotel across the street from Embassy Suites. The breakfast buffet (included in our stay) provided several choices along with attentive service from a friendly staff. Keep in mind that an ocean view is unlikely because this hotel is not on the beach and Waikiki beach is bordered by high-rise hotels.

Since this would be our first time in Hawaii, we all wanted to stay someplace that evoked a real “sense of place” and evoked a “tropical island vibe.” We also required a hotel that offered some good value for money for our six night stay. The Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk fulfilled both of these criteria and made for a very pleasant stay for our family.We arrive at the Embassy Suites around 8:00 pm and checked in at the registration desk, which was located in the hotel’s open-air lobby and driveway. Our room was ready and as we completed our check-in arrangements, the efficient and professional staff served our group some fresh, cold guava juice as we waited. The feeling of warm tropical breezes helped set the tone for our upcoming Hawaiian holiday.This property is the only all-suite resort hotel in Oahu. Since we were going to be in Honolulu for six nights, having the extra space of a suite to “spread out” made our stay comfortable. Although hotel prices in Waikiki are generally not cheap, I found that the Embassy Suites offered excellent value for money. As I comparison-shopped for hotels, I found that for roughly the same rate as a standard room in other nearby mid-range / upscale hotels, I was able to book a suite with a full buffet breakfast included at the Embassy Suites.The Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk consists of two high-rise towers with an open air Grand Lanai on the fourth floor separating the buildings. The Grand Lanai is the location of the hotel’s pool, breakfast area, bar and meeting rooms. Our room in the Hula Tower overlooked the hotel’s pool area and consisted of a living room with a sofa bed and a flat screen TV.The Suite also included a small dining area that featured a mini-fridge and microwave. This feature was really convenient since it provided us a place to store cold drinks and snacks over the course of our stay. We were able to stock up on provisions at the ABC Store located across the street from the hotel. This branch of the ubiquitous Hawaiian convenience & souvenir store chain (another one was located just down the street about a block away) also featured sandwiches, fresh refrigerated ready meals and hot takeaway options.The bathroom was spacious and well kept. The separate bedroom had a king-sized bed (rooms with two queen-sized beds are also available) with another flat screen TV. The room also featured a dresser and armoire. It was great having the ample storage space for our clothes.Although we were only located on the 7th floor of the hotel, we did manage to get a peak at the ocean in between the buildings (the Trump Hotel Waikiki is right next door) which made for some great sunset views from the room’s balcony. The balcony also featured a small table and two chairs so you could use it as a great vantage point for your morning coffee or a nightcap.A full buffet breakfast (6:30 am to 10:00 am) is included in the price of the hotel. The buffet offered a wide variety of traditional morning options including fresh fruit, cereal and bread / bagels. Hot options such as French toast, bacon, sausage, potatoes and steamed rice were rotated regularly. In addition, a cooked-to-order egg / omelet station was also available.The hotel also features a nightly Manager’s Reception (5:30 pm to 7:30 pm) with complimentary drinks and snacks on the Grand Lanai with Hawaiian entertainment on select evenings. Outdoor morning Yoga Classes are also offered on weekly basis. In addition, free Wi-Fi, a Business Center and a Fitness Center round out the amenities that are available.The Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk is very conveniently located. Although it’s not located right on the water, the beach is only about a 5 minute walk away and we were able to incorporate a morning oceanfront stroll into our daily ritual.The adjacent Waikiki Beach Walk area features a wide variety of shops (including the two ABC Stores I mentioned earlier) and restaurants within easy walking distance. Just down the street is Kalakaua Avenue which is one of Waikiki’s main thoroughfares and home to most of Honolulu’s luxury hotels and designer flagship stores. My only complaint with the hotel is that I heard quite a bit of elevator noise (e.g. the mechanicals of the cab going up and down) in my bedroom. Although a minor annoyance, I didn’t find the sound distracting enough to merit a room change. That said, on any future visits I’ll be sure to request a room as far away as possible from the elevator to avoid this problem. While I’m at it, I’d probably also request for a room much higher up in order to improve my (partial) views of the ocean. In addition, the quality of the wine, drinks and snacks (consisting of primarily of potato chips and pretzels) could also stand to be upgraded.Although the Embassy Suites is part of the international Hilton chain, the hotel didn’t feel cookie cutter. Hilton made a real effort to infuse local Hawaiian flavor into the décor and atmosphere of the hotel. Each night, little cards that recounted bits of Hawaiian history (e.g., the origins of the Luau, Surfboards, Lei-Making, etc.) were left in our room. Hawaiian-themed artwork and furnishings decorated the rooms and public areas. Service at the hotel was consistently friendly and welcoming. In particular, the service staff at the breakfast buffet always were cheery and ready to assist. Their positive attitude really got our days off to a great start. I was also very impressed that when we were looking for the Business Center (which turned out to be located in the adjacent Aloha Tower), one of the office personnel stopped what she was doing in order to personally escort us to where we needed to go. That type of proactive action went above and beyond the call of duty.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",11,5.0

As for the manager's reception, the live entertainment is nice (the band is there most nights but not all) but the snacks are lame compared to other Embassy Suites. Basically, it's one raw veggie, a chip of some sort and gold fish or small cracker like thing. We, like many other guests, would have preferred less alcohol selections and better appetizers.

After scouring reviews of all the hotels, we chose to pick embassy suites as our special place. I even added a note on our reservation and asked if they could possibly give us a nicer room or upgrade due to our special occasion. I know we did nothing to deserve it but figured I would try and maybe considering the fact I'm a longtime hilton honors member who was also once a diamond member they would make one nice gesture. I cguess the nice gesture resulted in a low level floor right next to the elevator, facing the pool. It's only our second night here and i awaken to the screaming noise of people at the pool and our next door neighbors conversating right next door, with the busy elevator noise bustling all the hotel guests to the 4th floor for breakfast and out to the lobby to start their day. We come home after a long day and just wanted to take a nap but had to battle the loud band for the managers reception, then right after listening to a group of drunk people at the pool blast their subwoofer speaker as loud as they can for hours. I've called the front desk to complain but 30 minutes later, it's still my problem. I'm now awake and struggling to hold in my sadness from the poor choice of hotel we chose for what is probably one of our most special trips we could have planned. 3 more night to go here, I hope we make it through without anything worse.

Front desk staff, excellent. Breakfast is terrific and slightly different from other Embassy Suites. If you want miso soup and salad for breakfast, stay here.

And the ABC store across the street includes a deli. We were on the 21st floor with a view of Diamond Head and the Ocean. Beautiful views throughout the day. The breakfast area is on the 4th floor. I am not sure I would want a room on this floor just because of the heavy foot traffic for breakfast, the pool. and the manager's reception.

That was a very tiring day. As HHonours members, no special consideration was given. As we were there at a non- peak season, I would have expected they could manage an earlier check in.-yes there are birds at breakfast, but they weren't as bad as some of the reviews mentioned (and I have a Bird phobia!). They do have a room opened for guests to sit inside if they like. A few hanging mobiles around to deter birds- this was pointless and had no effect. They will need to put more effort into solving this issue.-breakfast was typical American style buffet. Made to order omelette is good, but not every day. More sliced fruit options would be nice- only 2 offered each morning. And never saw a banana or mango on offer! (Thought they would be aplenty given this tropical destination)- the nightly cocktails gave a great holiday feel to this hotel. The snacks are exactly what all the reviews say- definitely not a meal replacement.-always plenty of lounge chairs around the pool. Lots of beachfront hotels were very crowded with no seating in sight. The pool is only 4ft, which may have been nice to have a deep end.-byo cutlery/plates to the room. The ABC stores are everywhere, but grocery items are not cheap. We didn't have a car, so we didn't get to a supermarket.-location is perfect. Access the trolley easily to Ala Moana shopping mall, and restaurants.-restaurants I would recommend if you don't want to eat American fast food all the time are Kaiwa Japanese (Beachwalk), Yard House, Cha Chas Mexican, Agostinos (takeaway wood fired oven pizza only. $20 for any 20 inch pizza- best pizza on the island, looks dingy as it is a mobile wood fired oven on a trailer in a crappy car park, but don't be turned off. This is great pizza).-staff were friendly and always helpful- if you plan on sleeping on the sofa bed, be warned that it is not comfortable. This is why I scored the sleep quality average.-security to your rooms is good, since you need your room card to access your floor. However anyone from the street can access the pool area (also where breakfast and night cocktails are served).

We stayed at the Embassy Suites the whole time and could not fault it for location, comfort, cleanliness and family requirements. Being an all suite hotel is a major plus as we could put our two children to bed each night (age 4 and 6) and still stay up and chat, eat, drink and plan our next day in the living room. The room had fabulous views straight through to the water and we could sit on our balcony and watch the goings on of Beachwalk. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom very clean. We ran into our housekeeping a couple of times and they were always polite and asked if we had enough towels and if there was anything more we needed.There was a kitchenette with a fridge and a microwave, coffee machine and some glasses. Yes you do need to buy some plastic cutlery but this is a small price to pay for such necessary facilities when holidaying with children. Front desk staff were very welcoming and I could have kissed them when we arrived after 12 hours of travel and they had our room ready 4 hours early! Everything is within easy walking distance of this hotel (even for a 4 yo). ABC stores aplenty, Honolulu Cookie Company (if you haven't been you need to!), amazing restaurants and cafes and great shopping. Lets not forget though, waikiki beach. Just a 5 minute walk and you are there. On ground level you have the Yard House, which we frequented. Put your name down in advance and take your pager and lay under a palm tree until they have a table for you (totally worth it). Take advantage of the nightly Managers happy hour. Complimentary cocktails, snacks and non alcoholic beverages for a couple of hours. We did this a few times. The kids loved the fruit and nachos and we loved the Mai Tai's......all enjoyed by the pool for a late afternoon swim and to watch the sun go down. Complemtary breakfast each morning was a hit as well. Fabulous, made to order, omlettes, gorgeous fresh fruit, cereal and a selection of pastries.

In short, it was wonderful and the best time I have ever had at this hotel (this was my third stay). Occupancy rates appeared to be a little low and we were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a partial ocean view which was fantastic!Check-in was very welcoming and professional (thanks Sandra) and the bell staff were very helpful. The room was spotless and comfort levels were very good indeed. The maid service was consistently excellent with very friendly and efficient ladies every day. The beds were very good in terms of rest quality and the blackout curtains made sleeping-in very easy. I heard no noise from adjacent rooms or the street (from Level 17).The room had both wired and wireless internet access. The data rate and signal strength were excellent. I didn't watch much TV but channel selection appeared to be basic cable with one or two good kid's channels. The included breakfast is standard fare for Embassy Suites with better than average fruit selection, great omelettes and a fair selection of pastries, cereals etc. It does get a little monotonous after a while and we chose to have breakfast out every few days (Dukes is a good option). Service at breakfast is very good with Aldrin doing a fantastic job with a genuine smile and true enthusiasm.Evening drinks are really very well done at this hotel. The bar staff know their stuff and the free Mai Tais are deadly so look out. The snacks on offer are basic but keep kids happy until dinner. Live music is provided with an excellent Hawaiian band playing 4 nights a week (I think).The hotel pool is clean and well maintained and excellent for kids. It is not really a great place for couples to lie around and relax. The beach is a 2 minute walk away.The location of the hotel is hard to beat. It is one block from the sand and views are not as good as the beachfront hotels. However, there are dozens of quality eating options very close to the hotel. The Yardhouse is an excellent family dining option and it is literally under the hotel.This is not a true luxury property - there are plenty of those dotted around Waikiki. Rather, this is a great hotel which caters very well to families and offers very good value for money. My wife and 5yo daughter loved it here and we will definitely be coming back.","Sydney, Australia",59,5.0

On the negative side, we were given a room in a tower on the opposite side of the building from the reception area. While you need to swipe your key to call the elevator, there is nothing stopping anyone from getting on with you. This did not feel like a safe situation. We discovered our room was right next to the elevator. This made for a lot of noise all day and night. Added to the elevator noise was the noise from the air conditioner, which was very loud. The ""suite"" was tiny. Once the flimsy pullout sofa bed was extended, there was no room to move around. The main bed was very uncomfortable. There was one dated bathroom. You had to exit the bedroom to get to it. Towels were extremely thin and we were only given one small towel for each person registered in the room (3). There is a small refrigerator in the room, which was helpful. During our stay, one elevator was shut down for maintenance, which caused huge delays in getting up and down, especially during breakfast hours. Had one free breakfast poolside but was not impressed. There are plenty of better, but more costly, options in the area.","Las Vegas, Nevada",96,3.0

The room was clean and it comfortably accommodated the 6 of us (there were 2 beds in the bedroom and a living room with a pull out couch). After we had dinner at a nearby restaurant (there are several great restaurants within walking distance from the hotel), we walked across the street from the hotel to the beach to watch fireworks from a nearby hotel. We then went swimming at the pool which was opened until 10 p.m. The next morning we all had the complimentary buffet breakfast which offered a great selection. Some of the items at the breakfast included: scrambled eggs, breakfast meats, fruit, and muffins. There was also a made to order omelet station.

The location was also great and the 5 minute walk to the beach was not a problem at all. We also prefer to stay at Embassy Suites, no matter where we travel and this was the best experience we've had with the hotel chain.

Our first stay we requested a 1 bedroom, 2 bed suite and was very impressed with our end of Aloha tower room. We enjoyed our stay and room so much we had no hesitation in rebooking the same room type for our next stay. It was with much dismay at check in to find out we had been allocated a king bed with pull out sofa for the girls. I was told the hotel was a near capacity and they did not have any of the 2 bed configurations available. Its not like we were only staying for a couple of nights with little children, we had an 11 night booking with 18 - 16 year olds! to make matters worse the room was right next to the elevators! The next day we managed a room change, still only a king bed with pull out but an ocean view with 2 balconies overlooking pool and Outrigger Reef on the 19th floor of Hula tower but at a cost of an additonal cost to us of US$25 per night.Despite our bedding request not being met we still love this hotel and would return again without hesitation. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The linen and towels smelled fresh. The pull out bed was not comfortable for 2 and we made a single bed out of the swabs on the floor!! Although on the 19th floor we never waited long for a lift. The breakfast was always well replenished and fresh, the birds a bit off putting and dont leave your table or they come and pick food off the plate. The band that plays Fri/Sat/Mon/Wed night were fantastic and a highlight of our evenings along with the free drinks and nibbles, We used the tour desk to book a rental car from Enterprise Rentals located in the Outrigger reef drectly across the road and the drop off point was the Embassy suites so it was very easy and efficient.If the manager is reading this review, please know how disappointed I was your hotel didnt not meet my booking request but as your hotel is so fabulous in all other ways we will be back for a third time. I dont know why anyone would want to stay at the Trump towers, our room overlooked the hotel and pool area and it was super small and lacked any personality, no trees, no free drinks, no band, it was boring and bland!ABC store directly across the road for supplies and I can recommend the Yard House for great food but get your name down early as they are busy.Cant wait to get back.",New Zealand,32,5.0

We had a 2 bedroom suite in the Hula Tower on the 11th floor. The rooms were very clean upon arrival and the daily maid service kept it that way. The staff at the Embassy Suites were all very helpful and polite. The beds & pillows in the suite were quite soft, which I liked but my husband had to sleep on the floor with the cushions off the lounge as they were too soft for him. My children loved the pool. I found the pool to be very busy and crowded. (No fault of the Embassy Suites, but parents really do need to keep their children under control while in such a busy pool. On numerous occasions I had the baby in the toddler pool and older kids would run through pushing & shoving. I get that we are all on holidays but courtesy is still nice). Breakfast was pretty basic but had food that we liked. The Managers Reception of an evening was loved by the children. A range of drinks and snacks were available between 5.30-7.30 and some nights they had a live band, very enjoyable. The location was fantastic. Close to trolley/tour pick ups, a short walk to the beach and shops and an ABC store just across the street. If we travel back Waikiki I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

On arrival we were all provided with a lovely cold juice and we stayed in a one bedroom suite with a pullout couch which was suitable for us.Our room was on the 17th floor in the Hula Tower which gave us a nice ocean view from the balcony/lanai. The room was nice size, with good bathroom amenities and little kitchenette with a microwave and bar fridge. Cleaning staff did a good job and loved the little history cards they left on the bed each night, great for the kids.The bonus of this hotel is the inclusions it provides. The breakfast that was provided has a good variety of foods and loved the omelette station. Especially loved that you could put the extras that you want in your omelette in your own bowl so you have control of what goes in. Another extra provided is the Managers Reception by the pool every night which was great! It went from 5.30pm to 7.30pm and serves complimentary beer, wine, spirits, selected cocktails, soft drinks, juices. Be aware though that the barman are great and they don't hold back so some drinks can be quite strong. They provide 3 different snack foods during the Managers Reception as well every night like potato chips, celery, carrots & dip, corn chips etc. On a couple of nights there is also a band that provides some entertainment. It was nice to have a few drinks at night while the kids enjoyed the pool.The pool is not huge when you compare it to resort pools but our boys still loved it. We did stay off peak season though so it wasn't too crowded. I could imagine during peak season that it may get quite crowded in there. There are plenty of lounges around the pool and never had any problems getting one. The Pakini Bar is by the pool which you can order food and drinks. They do stop serving drinks at 5.00 though due to the Managers Reception starting at 5.30 .

It was large enough to invite several friends that were not fortunate enough to stay at this hotel. They were amazed at our great sunset views and the rainbow on Sunday morning was stunning (almost double rainbow quality!). The Friday night sailing from the harbor brought smiles to my sailing enthusiast husband to watch dozens of sailboats coming out for a 5 PM sail framed by the sunset. It was wonderful. The room is large with a good Kingsize bed. The shower has a removable shower head but is positioned high enough that the tall member of our room had no trouble standing in the shower. The staff were very helpful, friendly and the staff in valet parking always had our car ready by the time we came down stairs. I love the access to the street from the Hula tower. I was able to attend meetings at the Sheraton with a half block walk and stay at the Embassy Suites, which I prefer. This is my second visit after a 5 year hiatus and the hotel is better each time. The evening entertainment is fun and the drinks are very substantial. Breakfast is just a joy with everything one could ask for in a breakfast, including a miso maker, made to order eggs and lots of side dishes that were healthy! The staff at breakfast don't get mentioned enough. They are wonderful. They went out of their way to catch my errant newspaper that was caught by a breeze, brought coffee and juice and cleaned up quickly. The afternoon bartenders have wonderful senses of humor and are quick to recognize returning guests from the previous night. There are several comments about noise levels from garbage and delivery trucks in the mornings.

The balcony was long/narrow and we could access it from both the living room and bedroom. The only 'surprise' was the size of the bed. It was a queen and I don't see how a king could have fit in the room. That made for very tight sleeping conditions, but I didn't complain because the location was perfect.Breakfast was good with lots of variety. I had an omelet one morning and it was cooked just like I like it. The evening reception was nice, with entertainment on 4 nights.

We researched nearly every hotel in the area, and couldn't have been happier with our accomodations. We initially booked a one bedroom suite with a city view through their website. When we arrived and walked into our room, we found that we had been upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite! The room was beautiful, clean, and quiet. There is a small fridge/bar area, a living room, outside lanai, and two separate bedrooms. Our tower was the further away from the ocean, but our views from the 17th floor were phenomenal. While the other tower overlooked the noisy pool and surrounding buildings, our room overlooked a beautiful park, downtown Honolulu, and the ocean. We were one block from the beach. Waikiki really has been cleaned up since the last time we stayed there 16 years ago. The beachwalk has nice shops and restauraunts. If you are a runner, you can go on a really nice run in the mornings along the beachwalk, along the ocean, and up to diamond head. Breakfast was typical Embassy suites, and was ok. The pool is nice, but we mostly avoided ""free drink"" happy hour in the evening. The staff was friendly and helpful. There is an ABC store and a 7-11 on the street, so you can stock your fridge with sodas, etc. Restaurants like the Hardrock Cafe, Cheeseburger beachwalk, Jimmy Buffett's, etc are all within close walking distance. We found a small (around 5-6 tables) sushi restaurant across the street (can't remember the name) which had a bit of a wait, but was amazing. There is a restaurant in the hotel toward the ocean from ours, which was fun and right on the beach. We were able to have drinks, grill our own steaks/seafood, and enjoy the sunset there. Our whole experience was great. I would recommend this hotel for anyone. One other hint. If you are planning to go to pear harbor, you don't really need one of those stinky bus tours. You need to go to the national parks website and make your reservations for the Arizona memorial. You can pick your time for the Arizona, and pay for one or all of the memorials/museums (Arizona, Missouri battleship, Bowfin, Pacific air museum). I would recommended getting the audio tours for each. We made our reservations 4 months in advance. We took a cab to get there and back, which was reasonable and quick.

The location is great, lots of beach, food, entertainment and shopping in walking distance. The room is what I'd expect from an Embassy Suites, nice and modern. I would recommend the Aloha Tower which is closer to the beach. We booked an Ocean view and talked our way up from the 4th to 15th floor at check-in, ended up with a great view. The free Wifi was great and with the high breakfast prices in Waikiki, you can't beat the free breakfast. The 4th floor Lanai pool was a nice place to relax, especially for the manager's reception.I see some reviews complaining about the parking fee, but most hotels in Waikiki that I researched had similar fees, and with this location you really don't need a car. If you want to do a drive around the island you're better off taking a tour IMHO because traffic and parking is not fun on Oahu. If you must drive, you can do a day rental from Avis that has an office at the nearby Sheraton.When we go back I'm planning on staying at the Embassy Suites again.","Naperville, Illinois",17,5.0

At the start, greetings made by the entire staff were friendly and cheerful, including Andrew at the front desk who greeted us with a fruit drink and Jeff who brought us to the room. The suite was large, immaculate, with A/C truly efficient. The breakfast buffet was handled beautifully with many entrees and the cocktail hour reception in the early evening truly wonderful. Where can you have free cocktails and snacks plus entertainment on M-W-Friday? I loved the pool area with plenty of lounges and a bar to order food with Lewis, the best bartender in the world. But I also loved seeing all the small children having the time of their life in the pool as this is a truly family place with the pool safe at only 4 1/2 feet. In the evenings, I enjoyed the quiet of swimming until 10:00 o'clock; during the day, I loved watching the children with their parents and did not miss having just adults. Walking to the beach was a breeze; the shops at Beachwalk just outside the hotel are modern and interesting. You could not choose a better place; Coco Cove is a grocery store/deli on the ground floor which, by the way, is cheaper than ABC grocery across the street. Also across the small street is a tiny place called Henry's Place where Henry makes his own ice cream,sorbets and sandwiches. What truly makes the Embassy Suites wonderful is the way it is run by the general manager and the efficiency of the staff to satisfy our every wish. We were impressed with everyone's friendliness, even the maids who greeted us every morning as we left our room with a friendly ""Aloha, have a nice day."" This place truly emanates the Aloha Spirit.

Even though the drinks were complimentary, the bartenders made them full strength and with a smile. The entire staff was courteous and wonderful. My only complaint was with the Jacuzzi by the pool. There were many infants and toddlers in the Jacuzzi and I think most know what happens when small children immerse themselves in warm water. Hopefully the Embassy Suites uses a lot of chlorine in it otherwise you are having a bath in others' urine. Also, these kids brought rafts, noodles and beachballs into the Jacuzzi. I think they thought it was a hot, bubbly kiddie pool and no one told them otherwise. Also, there was no sign restricting usage to adults only.

It's about a 20 min ride from the airport. Check-in was quick and easy and the passion,orange guava juice that you get during your check-in was a refreshing treat. This hotel is one of only a few in Waikiki that offer complimentary breakfast daily which was not bad at all. They not only make omelets to order, but will cook your eggs anyway you like. There is quite an assortment of breakfast items on the menu for you to choose from. In addition to the eggs, bacon, sausage, there is also and assortment of cereal, fresh fruit, bread, pastries and yoghurt. The hotel was clean, comfortable and we found the staff to be very friendly. My only advice is to try to get a room on an upper level - way up. If you have a balcony that faces the pool/bar, it can get noisy at night once the entertainment starts. The location is perfect.

The rooms are quiet, I never heard any of our neighbors. The meals at the café are good, plus there is entertainment during their evening reception. We only had breakfast there and enjoyed it! We used the tour/travel services within the hotel, which saved us money from renting a car, which I recommend. (Valet parking is $35 a day.) The hotel is within walking distance from stores, restaurants (several located within the hotel), and the beach. Nearby is Kalakaua Street which is like Rodeo Drive.

Our holiday was very much needed after a crazy few days before dealing with a natural disaster at home - but our pre-paid holiday could not be deferred, and we had a really great time. After staying in hotel rooms in Europe in 2008 with our then 18mth old, we didn't want another hotel room stay where we had to hide in the bathroom while she went to sleep. The Embassy Suites was a great option rather than getting a second room for a then 2.5yo. We could stay up in the lounge while she went to sleep in the bedroom.We went back to the Embassy Suites in 2012 on our second family trip to Honolulu. We enjoyed the location and amenities of the rooms so much we barely looked at other accommodation options in Honolulu. The nightly manager's reception was great on both trips to help tide our little one over and ensure she wasn't ravenous at 6pm if we wanted dinner at 7/7:30pm. We noticed that the entertainment quality was the same between 2009 and 2012, but in 2012 it wasn't offered every night. We were in Honolulu about a month earlier, I'm not sure if it was the time of year or due to economic reasons over those years. The breakfast spread is great; watch out for the pesky birds who are cheeky and will try to get at your food if they can. Love getting made to order omelettes each day, and having a range of healthy foods for our daughter to eat. The location at Waikiki Beach Walk is great, lots of restaurants nearby, and easy to get lunch at the food court of the Royal Hawaiian shopping centre across the road. (Actually stayed here in April 2012) The rubbish collection trucks in the streets below can be very noisy; they come by every second day.

The view was wonderful. The hotel is short block from the beach, so very convenient. For the most part, the staff are just great. The folks in the breakfast and evening drinks dining area are great. The concierges are also outstanding and offered great ideas for tours and activities. Additional staff attend to the pool area and do whatever they can to make the stay nice -- clean up, bring towels, etc. The one service exception are the bartenders, who are oddly grumpy. Barely a word when they serve drinks or when you stuff a tip in their jars. Not a big deal, but it is a bummer to work with staff who don't seem to enjoy their jobs. Nevertheless, we would definitely stay here again. Beautiful site and a very good value for Waikiki.One bit of concern, though. During our stay, there was a midnight fire alarm resulting in evacuation of both towers. Literally hundreds of guests in the lobby parking area. The staff in attendance were clueless, and seemed to have no interest in finding out what was going on or how to help. After about ten minutes, one fellow came out and yelled (but nobody could hear him...) that we could return to our rooms. We felt terrible for families with little kids and seniors who were greatly inconvenienced. Even worse, I would not trust these folks if it were a real emergency.

We chose to stay here because of the value offered as a family of five. We need the space and would have to book two hotel rooms elsewhere. That said, we'll most likely book the two rooms next time. We have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and we much prefer the feel and tropical atmosphere there, along with the pools and wider beach. It's just a more relaxing vibe overall. We also found the lanai to be small and un welcoming. We stepped out to look and the view of the ocean to our right, but could not see it without leaning a bit to catch a glimpse. Another thing was that there were lots of windows from nearby hotels facing ours. Felt a bit like a fish bowl with the curtains open.The pull out bed (in my opinion) is useless for anyone over 70lbs. It is really thin and slopes. My six year old slept there for nine nights and didn't complain. Our ten and twelve year olds could not bear it. The breakfast and Manager's reception are basic as well. Convenient and nothing more. We got tired of it after a few days but went anyway because it was there. I did have to wonder though, how does one make even a donut taste bad? On the up side, the staff are wonderful. The location is close to lots of restaurants and shopping, and there is a Starbucks right across the street!

The friendly front desk presented us with tropical drinks and got us checked in quickly. My room was on the first floor of the Hula tower facing Lewers Street. The 1 bedroom suite itself was roomy and spotless clean. I loved that they provided a ton of Evelyn & Crabtree shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The mini fridge came in really handy for our drinks. The downside to being on the first floor facing Lewers is that you hear all the delivery vehicles beeping at 4am. There was also roof construction going on across the street. I recommend a higher floor as I was up each morning before the crack of dawn.The breakfast buffet was fabulous. There are made to order omelettes and a huge variety of foods including fresh fruit. It's not a gourmet breakfast or the best breakfast I've ever had. But considering it's free, I think what they offer is great. As the eating area is open air, birds do get in. Always leave someone at your table with your food or the birds will be on it. I enjoyed the eating area being open as you feel the tradewinds blowing through. For those concerned with the birds, staff did open a couple of the ballrooms facing the eating area. You could eat inside in a air conditioned room. The manager's reception offers a few snacks usually chips, veggies and pretzel. There's a list of free beverages you can get from the bar. The best part is the live entertainment. When we were there, the band played a variety of music. I don't think they have entertainment every night but they did 2 out of the 3 nights we were there. The location of Embassy Suites can't be beat. It's 1 block from the beach. There's a huge variety of yummy restaurants within a 1 block radius including Roy's which is right downstairs. There's an ABC Store right across the street for souvenirs, snacks or toiletries.The pool was small but having stayed at the Wyndham Waikiki Beachwalk across the street, I can say the pool at the Embassy was bigger than Wyndham's. There was never a shortage for lounge chairs. The lounge chairs were nicely padded and perfect for afternoon naps. The only thing I wished was that they had a towel exchange so that you could get a fresh towel. You're pretty much stuck with the same beach towel until the housekeeper replaces them in your room the next day.Lastly, staff here were all very friendly and pleasant. I was quite impressed that our housekeeper noticed and replaced the light that had gone out over our shower. We were in a rush to the North Shore that day and forgot to report the burned out light.

The hotel is not right on the beach but not even a quarter block away from the beach access, so it is very convenient. Embassy suites staff was always polite, courteous and helpful. The rooms are fantastic. We enjoyed having a room to ourselves and our two children slept on the pullout in the living room. The breakfast 'buffet' is fantastic! Anything you could ever want is available, hot and fresh. We enjoyed the snack time, as our kids called it, from 6 to 7 pm. Drinks are free as well as the snacks. We'd suggest a few more condiments for the nachos though, as all that is offered is a bit of sauce. The other option is trail mix. It would be nice to have fruit, too, after a log day in the sun. Valet service is excellent and wait time for anything we needed at any time was provided promptly. Our travel agent booked one day short and the hotel was able to accommodate the extra day even when we noticed the error right at the end of our stay! I read one review that claimed the decor in the hallways was dated. Seriously? There is so much to love about this hotel that I can't imagine worrying about carpeting in the hallway. I also saw a complaint about the 'business' of floor 4. I think that floor is used mostly for families so that might be why. We also stayed on floor 4 and were very happy with it. We only had one night that a noisy neighbor had to be told to quiet down, by hotel staff, at 11 PM, but that was it. Staff made sure that everyone was respected. The laundry facilities on each floor are clean, well stocked and maintained. The pool is great also. We liked the fact that it is in an area that gets a lot of shade so that if you've had quite a bit of sun on the beach you can still get out and swim and be protected from heat. This is a hotel that has something for everyone. It is appropriate for couples and I'd come here even without the kids. The following year we stayed in a hotel that also had condos to rent...and we rented one. We definitely noticed the difference and missed Embassy Suites.

We are a family of four, mum, dad and two young adult children. We booked this hotel as it boasted extra space, a kitchenette and was part if the Hilton chain. Our room was dark and depressing, outlook was awful and we were woken every morning by deliveries of goods to the Beach Walk by large trucks, this entrance to the Beach Walk was right by our room. Our kitchenette was a joke! We had no cutlery, crockery or cooking utensils of any kind. This trip was a celebration for our daughters 21st Birthday and was our third trio to Hawaii. We had been spoilt in the past by staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We paid an enormous amount of money for the Embassy Suites but would never choose to stay here again. It was very disappointing and my Husband got food poisoning to boot. One day he was unable to leave the room due to the illness and we received an odd note pushed under our door regarding the cleaning of our room, despite having the do not disturb sign out.

To begin with as part of the Hilton chain I assumed it would be like the Homewood Suites rooms (we stayed in Homewood Suites Anaheim a couple of years back and the kitchen facilities were excellent). Our room at Embassy Suites only had a small bar fridge and microwave - that was it - nothing to cook on or with so that was a real disapointment. However that did not compare to the disapointment both myself and the kids faced when we got to the pool area - it was horrible!!!! The pool was literally 4ft deep at its deepest point (not much past my waist!!!!). And the water was all cloudy and dirty looking like they had forgotten to chlorinate it - and this didnt change for the 6 days we stayed there!!! When we checked in we were given a room that did not have the bed formation we had requested 6 months before and had to resort to a 1st floor room to get what we wanted. And that was a big problem - the street noise was very loud and we discovered after the first night that the window in the bedroom actually had been cut - so it didnt seal at all - there was a 1cm gap between the wall the the glass - so you can imagine the street noise all night long was deafening. We were able to change rooms after two nights up to the 15th floor - thank goodness - but even then the street noise was noticeable - you would have to be on top floor I think to avoid it altogether. But as I really love my hotel pools it was the small and shallow excuse for a pool that really put a damper on our holiday. The staff were not very friendly - the porters at the lobby didnt even offer to take our luggage to the room and you had to go and ask for help when you went to the lobby - normally in US when they live on tips they are falling all over themselves to help - NOT at Embassy Suites! We wished we had stayed in Maui for more days and just flown through Waikiki for some shopping. I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel to anyone - go somewhere else - the beds were like rocks and so tiny (Queen = double in NZ terms obviously) - my husband and I had to share with the kids otherwise we would have fallen off the sides!!!! The only saving grace was the nightly reception of free alcohol - however again we were expecting the level of service that we received at the Homewood Suites where the nightly reception actually served up yummy food and alcohol (so you didnt have to go out for dinner if you didnt want to). At the Embassy Suites the only food on offer was some tasteless cornchips or raw brocolli and cheese sauce. The breakfast was included but was only ok - nothing to write home about. Certainly did not justify the nightly rate which was quite expensive compared to other hotels on offer. I just wish the pool had been nicer (and significantly deeper!!!!! and bigger) as I could have lived with room conditions - you only spend a small amount of time in your room - but when you are in paradise and the weather is gorgeous you want to be able to hang by the pool and read a good book while the kids have fun the in the pool - my kids didnt even want to go to the hotel pool it was so unexciting for them - we walked to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and hung out at the lagoon most days (if not shopping at Ala Moana). As you can guess I was not at all impressed by the hotel and that is why I give it a POOR rating - I hope I have saved at least one unsuspecting family from ruining their awesome holiday by staying there!!!!,"Auckland, New Zealand",3,2.0

I would say the rooms are very comfortable and clean and slightly outdated but as we were only there to sleep, it wasn't an issue and we were very happy with it. Beds are comfortable too. Breakfast was good, everything is help yourself including tea and coffee. Felt a bit like a cafeteria, compared to other b'fasts we have had in Waikiki, but the quality of food was fine and John looked after my girls every morning cooking their eggs with a smile and a chat. The pool area is really good with the spa and toddler pool being part of the swimming pool- making it easier to watch kids. I found it big enough and our girls had a ball every afternoon. The location is great on beach walk, close to lots of restaurants and shops. A short walk to the beach through the outrigger, but the beach there is very rocky underfoot so we walked further around in front of the royal hawaiian. Still, not far and the walk home, loaded with all our beach gear was only 10 mins at most. The managers drinks at night are great and very popular. It was great to come back to the pool for a swim, sip on a drink while we watched the kids.

I had read the reviews about the outdated furniture and I must admit, I got a little nervous. My fears disappeared when we got to our suite. It was very nice and it was clean. I didn't not get the feeling that it was outdated. I'm sure there are prettier hotels in Waikiki but the suite here really suited our needs and we were quite pleased. In terms of the birds at breakfast, yes they are a bit of a problem. I know that the hotel is working on it but our problem was not the birds but the mess they left behind. One morning we had to shuffle around quite a few chairs to fine some clean ones. Until the problem is solved they need to do a better job of keeping on top of the cleaning.","West Windsor, NJ",13,5.0

In fact we did not need dinner...There was Wi Fi in the rooms, Car parking at $35 was expensive, but the Valet service was great they unpacked our car and bought all (my) shopping up to the 17th floor...Only negative about Waikiki - we were in peak season we could not book a restaurant, first in first served basis so unless we wanted to eat by 5.30pm we had to wait til late to get a table....

We were not disappointed. We were supposed to arrive on Tuesday 6/25 but due to a screw up by United Airlines we could not get to the hotel until Wednesday 6/26. I called the hotel to say we were going to be late and they assured me that they would hold my room. I then called back a couple hours later and told them I wouldn't be making it at all. They were fine with it and gave me two options of either paying and keeping my room so that when we did finally make it I could check in right away or not pay for the night and then check in after 3:00 pm on Wednesday. I opted to check in on Wednesday. We arrived at the hotel at 1:00 pm and we were able to check in immediately. The check in desk was outside and it had a tropical feel. We were given cold drinks while we checked in. We were in the Hula tower (I think that's the name) and we were located on the 21st floor. There are only 21 floors so I was happy to be out of the noise of the city. We didn't hear a thing at night. So I would ask for a room on the upper floors. I had a nice water view which I didn't request. The room was smaller than I thought it was going to be. We had one bedroom with two queen beds and then a pull out couch. We were traveling with our boys ages 18 and 21. It worked out pretty well for us. The bed was comfortable and I enjoyed sitting out on the balcony. We went down to the pool a couple days. It was really nice and relaxing. It's located on the fourth floor. We also stayed for the managers reception which is held most days from 5:30 to 7:30. Free drinks from the list offered, snacks and a live band, what more could you ask? The band was a father and his three sons. We enjoyed them very much. The free breakfast was great. It was in an open air outdoor/indoor area. They had a ton of choices, something for everyone. It does get crowded but we were able to find seating without any problems. We also used the laundry facilities which I found rather expensive but necessary. They charged $2.75 for each washer and $2.50 for the dryer. Being on east coast time we were up so early that we went down to use the gym in the Aloha tower. Great equipment. Go early or later, it gets crowded. We also parked a car there for $35.00 a night.

We were on on a family vacation (1st trip to Hawaii), spending 2 nights in Waikiki to briefly tour Honolulu and Pearl Harbor before heading to Kauai. We are a family of 4 with 2 teens (ages 18 and 16). We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite = 1 BR with a king, a separate BR with 2 queens, connected by a common room in the middle. Quality of the room was great, and we REALLY appreciated having the suite set-up with a family with varied sleeping habits. Beds and pillows were really comfortable. Flat screen TVs in each room. 2 ensuite bathrooms. Complementary wireless internet. We stayed on the 4th floor...the same level as the pool deck = where the breakfast buffet is located and where the manager's happy hours take place (live music on certain nights of the week). This did make for a busy location, but the convenience of being so close and almost never using the elevator were BIG positives. Noise wasn't really an issue, since the music was over long before bedtime. There was some street noise being on a lower floor but nothing disruptive.Valet service/parking at this hotel is expensive ($35/day), but the service was REALLY quick - I think the best I've ever seen. When we called for the car, it was always there waiting when we got to the lobby. In fact all of the staff were super helpful and friendly and really seemed intent on making our stay a good one. Another example = we got up early one morning to tour Pearl Harbor to ensure that we were able to get tickets for the USS Arizona memorial (left the hotel at 5.45 AM). Breakfast does not open at the hotel until 6.30 and there is no room service at that hour. The staff made up box breakfasts for us...with a cute written note to us saying ""have a great day at pearl harbor"" = nice touch!Location = the hotel is a 5 minutes walk from Waikiki beach and is right in the center of shopping/sights of Waikiki. From the 4th floor/pool deck, you can take a series of escalators straight down into Beach Walk, what looks like a recently developed shopping/restaurant area. Teens liked the location since we seemed to be in the middle of the ""action"". The Beach Walk area is a street that runs directly off of Kalakaua Ave, the Rodeo drive of Waikiki. Clientele at the hotel was mainly families with younger kids = location and great pool deck area make it a great choice.

The hotel staff are very welcoming and were very accommodating to our many requests (I guess you could call us a ""high maintenance"" family-ha!) we mistakenly reserved a ""two room suite"" instead of a ""two bedroom suite"" it was my fault as the room descriptions were very accurate, We only stayed at for one day and decided to keep the two room suite. I wish we had 1 more bathroom, as getting 6 people out the door with only 1 bathroom required a true strategizing session :). The complementary breakfast was a full service buffet with custom omelet station. Everything from pancakes to miso soup and salad were presented beautifully and the very clean and well kept counters made us very comfortable with the buffet style dinning. The pool deck is behind the restaurant and has a delicious lunch menu and full bar available for poolside fun. The property is not beach front, but was a quick 5 minute walk to amazing Waikiki Beach. Beds were very comfortable, but the warned, the sofa bed is not good sleeping option for older children or adults as the bed is lumpy and uncomfortable. There are no feather bed, or tempurpedic toppers available. But young kids won't care. We went shopping and found the hotel was confident to many stops on the public transportation services routes. Only three stops from the shopping mall, and return was easy as well.

Also when we did go by the pool there were always loungers available, a real plus in Waikiki. The location is also good. On the downside, the balconies were very narrow and I thought almost useless. For us this was quite important as we always enjoy some quiet time reading/coffee/evening drinks. Also the suites are really two hotel rooms with a lounge which was fine for us but could be an issue for others. We enjoyed our stay but it helped refine our thoughts that we really like the space, the laundry and the cooking facilities of a condo.","Auckland Central, New Zealand",40,4.0

The room was very clean and well laid out with a small balcony with two deck chairs and table.Rooms -21 and -32 back onto the elevators (3) and although the noise can be heard it wasn't terrible although if you are a light sleeper and had the AC off you may want to avoid those rooms. The medium sized pool was nice but quite shallow (3~4 ft.) and was designed with kids in mind ? as there were always 10 to 20 of them splashing around... Luckily there are plenty of loungers away from the pool to enjoy the sun and great service from the pool bar staff ! The hotels location is right in the heart of all the best shops and a main ABC store opposite for all supplies.  Having a tour desk in the lobby was great and saved time figuring out where we wanted to go on day trips. Enjoyed the buffet breakfasts and went to two of the nightly drinks and nibbles events and the hotel puts on a great band for everyone to enjoy while the suns setting.

The guest fell and hit her head on the floor. The first person to assist was a member of the band. A second member of the band ran for help. One of the bartenders came to assist the guest also, while the second bartender closed-down the bar. The third member of the band placed chairs around the area on the floor to secure the scene. The reason I detail this is that extensive training is obviously part of the regime for staff of every nature. Each person knew exactly what had to be done. This just shows that the hotel takes great pride in training staff not only to ensure your vacation is enjoyable, but to respond to emergencies should the need arise. Incidentally, security does a fantastic job of remaining convert. Until that incident, I had no idea there were so many!

Knew about the cooked-to-order breakfast and the no-resort fee (unless it's already built in the per/night charge) but did not know about the proximity to the center of Waikiki. We stayed in Waikiki Parc a few years ago and found it to be the ideal location for more bang for your buck, but Embassy Suites takes the cake. The lobby is only a few steps away from dining, shopping, and Kalakaua Blvd. In fact, there's a short pathway that leads you to the middle of Waikiki Beach Walk. If beach fun is what you seek, simply cut through the Sheraton lobby and find a spot in front of the Royal Hawaiian (this part of the beach has less corals and smoother sand than the beach directly in front of the hotel). The arrival was easy and direct. Once you are dropped off, you simply mosey a few feet to a sit-down counter while they server guava/passion fruit beverage. The suite is not modern but efficient especially with a microwave and mini-fridge. There are LCD TV's in the bedroom and the living room. The lanai can be accessed from both living room and bedroom but it is a tight squeeze. We stayed in Ste 1109, directly across from the Trump Hotel, where the view was awesome. It is an end suite with the living room view overlooking the grand lanai pool and the pacific ocean. The bed is extremely comfortable, though can't say much for the pull out sofa bed. The grand lanai is directly above The Yard House, Ruth Chris, and an entertainment stage where various Hawaiian singers/hula dancers performed every night (we stayed during the weekend of Pan Pacific Festival). SO, if you do not like street noise, ask for a higher floor. We had breakfast every day (prior accommodations with free breakfasts would only be enjoyable after the first 2 or 3 days - not this place). The omelet chefs were extremely friendly and helpful. Although some days are greasier than others, just simply ask for less cheese on your omelet. Remember, do not leave your food unattended while you grab your morning coffee or juice. The pigeons and tiny birds will have a feast on what could be your best omelet creation. The Manager's reception is also fun with complimentary cocktails and live entertainment. Since it's a family friendly hotel, there are TONS of children in the pool which our 11-year old enjoyed, but there should be a separate Jacuzzi where the grown ups can enjoy it without feeling uncomfortable. The only complaint I have is the constant humming noise of the air condition unit from the Trump Hotel. Since we were directly in front of its infinity pool and hotel back side, we heard their air condition through the entire duration of our stay. Non-issue when we're not there but very noticeable when trying to get a good night's sleep after a long hard day of having fun. Bottom line, we would definitely book another stay at the Embassy Suites. That we were sure of after the first day!!!

For any families travelling with small children, suites are the way to go! (Our last visit, we stayed at another hotel within this chain, that was excellent as well, but when mama and kiddo get separate space and decent sleep, everyone is much happier :)). We had a double queen suite so we still had to share a room, but at least there was a living room and the bathroom had two doors, so sleep was hardly ever interrupted. However, walls are a bit thin, so you can hear EVERYthing your neighbors are doing around you. We were in the Aloha tower with a partial ocean view, which we could see if we stepped out on the small patio and looked between the buildings, Mr Trump's building was blocking the rest of our view, but that was fine. Housekeeping staff was excellent, and accomodated our needs. The nearest beach is only a block away. The room also was equipped with a fridge and microwave, which was great for our week-long stay. The free breakfast in their lanai by the pool was excellent with cooked to order omelettes and a variety of fruit, yogurt, pastries, and even an Asian twist with a miso soup bar. The only thing to watch out for is always make sure you have someone at the table watching your food while you grab seconds or drinks. The birds know where the good stuff is! The staff there is friendly and always willing to help. The manager's reception is great for unwinding at the end of the day, with entertaining music by a local family band, endless drinks, and light snacks. Don't expect to get a whole meal out of it, it's chips/pretzels & salsa, but good to tide you over til dinner. Sunday night entertainment while we were there was a nice treat with Samoan dance performances & fire dancing! It can get a bit loud, and can be heard throughout the hotel so might as well let the kids stay up and finish watching before heading up to bed ;). The pool area is well kept, and they have a kiddie pool area attached to the main pool, so the kids are safe, and you can relax as well. The hotel is a quick walk to the beach, and extra towels are provided in the room. Our kiddo grew especially attached to the penguins at the nearby Hilton Hawaiian Village, so it was nice to be within quick walking distance to catch their morning feeding time. The Waikiki Beachwalk shopping/dining area is right below the hotel, so there is lots to choose from there in terms of food/shopping/entertainment. Also across the street within walking distance the big Royal Hawaiian shopping center. If you have a car, parking is the most expensive on the island at $35 for valet (no self parking), so you might want to do some research on other options in the area if it's an issue for you.

Great value. I don't have an ocean view, but I do have a view of Diamond Head. I do believe they have ocean view rooms here, but I see the ocean all day long from the beach so why do I need to pay extra for a room that has a view. The location of this hotel is one back from the ocean. We are right on Beach Walk so the location is perfect. We are right behind the famous Halekulani Hotel, which if you have $995 to $7,000 to spend per night for a suite you should stay there. Their advertisement has a Bentley in the carport. It is a beautiful hotel and fun to walk through. I am not quite there yet, but I know I am in good company if I am staying across the street.Back to the Embassy Suites. They have a fantastic staff. Everyone is super friendly. The room rate includes breakfast, which is a full on omelet station, fresh fruit, breads, bacon, sausage, hash browns, you name it. There is also a complimentary happy hour every day with drinks and appetizers. The pool is nice. It is not huge and it is not one of the fun pools right on the beach of Waikiki. It is on the fourth floor of the hotel and it is open air. My kids liked it. It is a pool, but this is Hawaii and it ain't about the pool for me. There is a view of the ocean. The ocean is 75 yards away and their is a sweet little private beach right in front of the Halekulani. When I say private beach, I just mean secluded. I don't know if there is any private beach at Waikiki. So you are allowed to go there and there is a public beach access from the street right near the hotel.The value of this place is great. I have a bedroom with TWO QUEEN BEDS, a living room and a small kitchenette (fridge, microwave and sink). The suite has two flat screen TVs, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. This is Hawaii, so it is not about the TV, but if it was you would be good. We have two kids so one adult sleeps with a kid and having the queen instead of a double is great. Hawaii has not figure out the two queen bed thing yet. This is the only place we could find with two queens. That is a bigger deal than you think. I am 6'4 and over 225 and I cant sleep with one of my kids comfortably in a double bed.I am right now in my living room typing away while my family sleeps in the other room. I did not have to leave the room to conduct early morning business. This is a great feature. I am a working class stiff and I need to stay connected. The Wifi is free and very fast. Everything about this place is value. The room is huge, the place is great. They washers and dryers on the fourth floor so you don't have to bring two suitcases. There is a fitness room with three treadmills, some free weights, a couple of Stairmasters, an ab machine, complimentary headsets, TV's on the machines. It is above adequate.I would definitely stay here again, unless I win the lottery This place is a no brainer if you have a family and you want quality and value for your money. There is an Expedia travel help desk in the lobby that is very helpful for setting up tours. There are tons of shops and restaurants all around. They give you beach towels. Parking is 35 per night, but you have access all day and night. We drove around a lot and were in and out so it worked out fine. Every place you go is going to ding you for that. There is a parking garage down the street I believe, but I did not figure it out. Valet is super efficient so the value is there. Use your car, travel around the island. Enjoy Hawaii.

Our room was huger than the 4th floor so we didn't need to evacuate our room however not knowing what would happen and not having our children with us was stressful.

We only got a one bedroom thinking the pull out sofa would be enough but really was quite ""tight"", my girls had nowhere to move, would be ok for smaller kids! They loved the pool and spa, although I thought the spa was way too hot. I usually complain everywhere that there are notenough sun lounges, but never found that here, any time of the day. Plenty of staff coming around during the day offering drinks and food. Loved the Managers drinks every day for the free cocktails, and the live music one of the nights was great, we didnt want to leave to go out to dinner (snacks were a little ""dodgy""). Biggest gripe was the free buffet breakfast. It was absolutely awful, (except of course for the made to order omelettes where you can't go wrong!!) unless it came in a package, it was pretty unedible.....the scrambled eggs tasted like cardboard and everything else was high in sugar and they always ran out of fresh bananas.... also thought the actual breakfast area was ""grubby"" with staff struggling to clear up tables and the floor ...we tended to grab something and go and sit on the sun lounges....

This was NCL's most highly recommended hotel, but even with the AAA or AARP discounts, an admitted splurge.The location is superb, close to Hilton Hawaiian Village and only 1 block from Waikiki beach.Unfortunately Trump Towers all but obscures all the great views formerly enjoyed to the West, (Ewa) side of this highly energized tourist zone...some lovely green views of Hale Koa and a park we've enjoyed in times gone by.On one side of the hotel is Lewers Street with dozens and dozens of on-trend but pricey shops, lots of eateries and directly on bus lines. Great for walking tours, shopping and noshing, too. It is a short detour through Trump valet on the other side of Beach Walk to Saratoga Road, with specialty shuttles, Hard Rock Café and more.Of special note, Roy's Waikiki is situated Makai, on the Lewers Street corner nearest the water, for a fabulous meal. Yardhouse, ubiquitous ABC stores and an upscale Italian dining venue are also quite handy and decent stops within the Embassy grounds. Two towers make up the guest rooms, some with ocean/partial ocean views but the majority with city views.We booked well in advance, a AC, (handicapped) suite with 2 Queen beds, nonsmoking. From the moment our Roberts shuttle dropped us at the covered valet entrance, I could see it was going to be a walk of at least 2 city blocks through the hotel before this semi disabled person could reach that blessed bed.Nicely greeted with a flavorful, iced fruit juice even though we were 1 1/2 hours before check-in, we were invited to leave our bags with the bell desk, and shown a comfortable seating area with sofas and upholstered chairs. Local newspapers and the addition of serve yourself iced water wih lemon slces was appreciated after a long flight and in the very warm, muggy tropical air.It turned out our room wasn't available as booked, however the helpful check-in clerk did give us an upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite that still provided sturdy grab bars in the bathroom that worked for our needs. We didn't budget for a view so weren't terribly disappointed when our city view, to the rear of the hotel gave glimpses of a slightly seedy condo with lanais sporting everyone's laundry, surf boards and da kine.We booked this hotel knowing a full, hot breakfast was included. A breakfast bountiful enough, that factoring in the resort's free cocktails and salty bar snacks would tide us over until dinner.Best were the omelets made to order and local Maui Gold pineapple. Melon, juices, coffee, tea, milk, waffles, pancakes, bacon, sausage, Spam or diced ham, cold and hot cereals and toast were very good. The yogurt, bagels and biscuits and gravy not so much, but a great value overall.The rooms were clean, the beds comfy and our midlevel suite, near stairs but the elevator, was quiet. Adequate maid service and assist from the bellmen met our travel needs. The sticker shock came with the 'discounted' price bottom line at checkout time. Let's just say, one night at this very nice but not wonderful place was the cost of a regular coach airfare from the West Coast.Yes, it was handy to be near the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and International Marketplace and Roy's but at what cost? The hotel I'd originally booked was situated between Ala Wai Canal and Kuhio Streets, a couple blocks from the action, but with 2 queen beds and a kitchenette would have run us only 1/3rd of Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk.In conclusion, if budget is no concern, then I can heartily recommend this hotel as a solid 4 star value with location being foremost. In retrospect, we could have saved a nice chunk of change and still been overall satisfied with 2 days comfy stay in a clean, attractive surroundings, just without the bells, whistles and cache.",San Joaquin Delta,43,3.0

No spoons or wine glasses, no bottle openers.

Check in was quick and easy. The location was convenient to be able to walk down to the beach, or walk to dinner somewhere. Right on Beach Walk Avenue, so lots of shops to see. Just a couple complaints. First, I reserved and prepaid for a room almost 4 months prior to arrival. But when we arrived, (still about an hour before official check in time) I had requested an upper floor, with two queen beds. The clerk spends time looking for a room. (no idea why, shouldn't they have already had us set up in one?) then informs us the only room available was on the 3rd floor. I mentioned I had requested a higher floor. She then found one on the 7th floor, but it had only one king bed, and a pull out sofa. I took that room as she informed me they were ""booked"" that weekend and that was all they had. We went to the room and it was literally right behind the elevator shaft. My husband called back down to the front desk to tell them this was not going to be acceptable, we did not want to hear the ding of the elevator all night. They then suddenly found a room on the 16th floor, but it cost $25 more, since it has a ""partial"" ocean view. We went ahead and paid the extra just to get a higher floor and away from the elevator. This room was perfect, on the end so no foot traffic walking by the room. Later that evening, we were glad we moved up. We could still hear the music coming from the ground somewhere. I feel the desk clerk should have looked at all the rooms and offered this room to us first thing, instead of waiting until we complained. Also, housekeeping needs to be better at filling supplies. As the coffee and tea in the room was out. No biggie as we just got coffee at breakfast, but sometime to check. Breakfast was ok, and seemed to be done well.","Broomfield, Colorado",70,4.0

This hotel knows how to treat customers. After a little shopping we headed down for the Manager's reception...ie. free cocktails and snacks for two hours. I don't have to tell anyone here that Hawaii is expensive, so the value of this alone is priceless. Hubby got a Blue Hawaiian, I got a Cab sav and son got virgin Mai Tai. Live music on M,W,F....band was awesome....I mean awesome. Snacks included nacho cheese and chips, snack mix and celery and carrots with ranch dressing. Atmosphere is fantastic and bartenders were keeping drinks flowing so there was never a long wait. We went out late, but our 17 year old son loves the room with free Wi Fi and two separate areas so the parents don't cramp his style. Beds are super comfortable and each room has 2 TVs and a highly awesome item...a refrigerator! Next day, full breakfast for free with omelet station, fresh fruit and several choices to accommodate any diet. This IS the best deal in town for everything, the room may seem a little higher, but the reception and breakfast make up for it, especially if you have a bigger family. Tons of shopping and restaurants just minutes away....don't miss this place, you will thank me later.","Wahiawa, Hawaii",2,5.0

It was spring break, so the place was PACKED always. But even though the hotel was probably at capacity, I think the employees all handled the crowds very well, and with smiles. The hotel is in a great updated location and there are new shops and restaurants literally outside your doorstep. Many choices for shopping or dinner. Casual burger and pubs, to upscale Roy's right downstairs which is one of the best restaurants on Waikiki. We were lucky to be upgraded to a corner suite which had -3- balconies with sliding glass doors, 2 in the living area (corner side) and 1 in the bedroom. It's true what people say about the higher the floor the less the street noise, we were on the 10th floor, but still shut our patio doors at night due to the noise. Everything worked great. The free breakfast was good, with lots of variety for the internationally mixed guests. A nice touch was the omelets station where you put whatever you wanted in your omelet into a saucer and then simply handed it to the chef making the omelets. This really hastened the process and the line moved quickly even though the place was usually super crowded. The coffee station was also in a different area outside of the breakfast area adjacent, so it didn't congest in one area. The happy hour was also nice. There were LONG lines for everything and it was kind of a feeding frenzy for the bowls of pretzels and peanuts, carrot sticks etc. The lines for the drinks were usually worse, but it was spring break so it was to be expected. The band was GREAT, and made the happy hour so much better! The rooms were clean, nice little refrigerator and coffee in your room. TWO large screen TV's, internet, etc., There were chairs on your (small) balcony also so you could take a drink up to your room to get away from the crowds and sit out on your balcony to enjoy the view. One unique thing is the pool towels. They are in your room, so you bring them down with you and take them back. They will switch out for clean ones if you want also, and even give you extras. The nice thing about this was that generally, people took their towels with them when they left, so if a pool chair was vacated you would know, vs. a towel laying on a chair for hours, without any knowledge of if the chair was being saved, or the person being in the water etc., The pool is SMALL and crowded. The day we arrived somebody's child soiled the connected whirlpool, and they had to shut the entire pool down while they drained the whirlpool and then cleaned and shocked the entire pool. This took hours. People were complaining about this, I thought they should complain about the parents and appreciate that the hotel wanted to insure it was sanitary for the guests. You saw the same employees working breakfast, bartending, serving at the pool, and they were very friendly and down to earth. Hospitality desk guys are also very nice and helpful. Encountered nice employees everywhere which is so appreciated. I mentioned Roy's earlier, and this is a bonus for this hotel. It is literally connected to the hotel, and one of the best restaurants on the island. Don't be fooled by the seemingly small quiet area you walk by - (we were at first) the place is huge and opens up into a really great restaurant once you get inside. Great place to dine - steps from your room!Would definitely go back to this hotel again.","Saint Paul, Minnesota",56,5.0

We were on the 15 floor so we could see the pool below us which is on the 4th floor. Breakfast was great, more than we had expected. Happy hour was good unless you expect premium hard liquor or wine, the snacks to go along with the happy hour were just so, so but were stopped here before going out to dinner.

This is really a great place to stay. It is conveniently located in Waikiki. We had rent a car and arrived at this hotel pretty late in the evening. The valet service is very convenient, efficient and well organized. The people are there to help you. The check-in staff was also very kind giving us all the explanation needed to enjoy our stay. The welcome was outstanding. We were upgraded and really enjoyed the room. It was very large, well equiped and everything was very clean. The housekeeping was well done every day. Internet access and speed was ok and its use very easy. The weakness of this hotel (not specific to this hotel in the US) regarding the room is the isolation against the noise from outside. This is really an area of improvement to get a better rating. The other point preventing us to rate it as one outstanding place is the breakfast area. The breakfast itself is ok, but due to its location, the birds have an easy access to your table. So, it is not recommended to leave the seat to look for some cafe, otherwise, you may see birds trying to eat the remaining part of the omelet or bread you may have left. Hopefully, they leave when you arrive!! If the hotel can improve this area and improve the phonic isolation, it could be rated as excellent on every aspects.

Stayed in a double room with views overlooking Halekulani.This was not our usual choice of hotels, as we usually prefer to stay at the Outrigger on the Beach or Holiday Inn as it is more central, but we were pleasantly suprised by this hotel. The room was extremely spacious for our family and the in-room facilities were excellent. Beds were spacious and firm which I liked. A small sink and microwave made it easy to re-heat those huge portions you get at the Cheesecake Factory. The cleaning was efficient and friendly (sometime a little too efficient as she would often try to start cleaning at 8am - a little early for us when on holidays!!) Breakfast was an average quality and selection, with things to suit most tastes. We only attended the Managers Reception once. This consisted mainly of pretzels and corn chips with free drinks. Valet and Front Desk were friendly and efficient. Our room was fast tracked even though it was early (10am) and front desk did actually call to advise when the room was ready, unlike some hotels who promise to call and never do. The location was not as far as we originally thought it would be and there were many choices for food around. For fine dining Roy's was around the corner, and for cheap eats the ABC across the road had a good variety of sandwiches and drinks.All in all we really enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again if the price was right. My only complaint was that the pool was really too small for the amount of people that used it and the beach in front of the hotel was really not child friendly as it was full of rocks.

If you want to travel anyway on the island, they can take care of it for you. There is no charge and they are very knowledgeable. We had some great tours thanks to them.

Located in down town Waikiki, five minutes from both the beach and shops, we couldn't of wanted a better location. A short cab ride from the efficient international airport we arrived at the open plan reception area to be greeted with a huge 'Aloha' and an effortless check in.

A small kitchen area with coffee machine, a microwave and a kettle. See some hotels understand the Brits - tea. Our view was over the Grand Lai and pool with a view of the ocean to our left. As it was a warm evening we left unpacking to join the managers evening reception and see family deux. Big hugs and kisses all round. As we had travelled from LA we decided to eat at the pool side. The bar food was acceptable with sufficient choices for all three generations. Our ten day stay was excellent. The rooms were spotless and the maid service very flexible depending on what you were doing that day. The daily cooked breakfast was excellent. As we were a group of seven occasionally it was a little wait for a table. The fresh cooked omelets were amazing and the breakfast selection was multi national. The daily managers reception was a hoot and a good repartie was established with the bar men. The pool was safe and the hot tub HOT. Our overall experience of was faultless.

Even though our assigned room was right next to the elevator, I was pleasantly surprised that none of us were bothered by noise. Not once! The room had a mini fridge and microwave which was handy. There was a safe in the room which was pretty big. I don't think it could accommodate a laptop, but it held our multitude of electronics.The pool area was wonderful. Plenty of loungers, and tables with umbrellas. We spent hours there while the kids would swim. You can order food and drinks and charge them to the room. The free manager's reception was held here as well. Drink lines were short most of the time, and even when they were longer, the wonderful bartending staff was very efficient so they went quickly. There were some basic snacks, like chips and salsa, or goldfish, or carrots/celery and ranch dip. The free daily breakfast was also held on the grand lanai where the pool was. You could choose to eat indoors or outside. There was made-to-order omelets, scrambled eggs, potatoes, rice, fresh fruit, pastries, bagels and toast with a variety of toppings, miso soup, salad, and probably a few things I have forgotten. The valet staff and housekeeping were really outstanding. We wanted to take the kids for short limo ride in one of the stretch limousines we constantly saw driving around Waikiki, but didn't know how to make arrangements. We asked a valet, who said he would handle it for us. He was very helpful and it was a great surprise for the kids. In addition to that special help, the valet staff were also quick to bring the car to us. Yes, the parking fee is $35 per night, but from my research in looking for a hotel, that is pretty standard. Housekeeping was very friendly as well and did a great job taking care of the room. One of the best things about the hotel is the free wifi and no resort fees. The only downside is that the hotel isn't beachfront. It's a five minute walk the lobby to the most direct spot on the beach, at most. We preferred to walk further to the beach in central Waikiki, where the ocean bottom was more sandy and not as rocky. The area surrounding the hotel, called Beach Walk, was wonderful. There were plenty of restaurants and shopping available right outside the door. We really enjoyed our stay at Embassy Suites Beachwalk.",Iowa,52,4.0

We had a one bedroom suite which came with a small kitchen area which included a microwave, small refrigerator, coffee/tea maker and sink. That was nice for keeping cold drinks, and snacks, but was too small for storing groceries for in room dining. Our suite was nicely furnished and was very clean. The housekeeping staff does a great job, and is very friendly, as are the lobby reception staff and bell staff. Everyone was very helpful, and responsive to requests. The hotel is located on a one way street in a very congested area, which makes driving in and out a challenge. The fee for valet parking is $35, which is high even for Waikiki. Only valet parking is available. Like other Embassy Suites, breakfast is included in the room charge. The buffet is pretty standard, eggs, bacon, sausage, but this one also includes miso soup, rice, and kimchi. There is an omelette station, and tropical fruit is available. My only complaint with the breakfast is that there are lots of birds in the seating area. Birds are on tables, chairs-everywhere. I watched one perch on my husband's chair, and do it's ""business"", and that made me wonder about how often the tables and chairs are cleaned and sanitized. Not a very appetizing thought. The hotel was very crowded while we were there, and the staff in the breakfast area seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with clearing the tables, and I didn't see anybody washing tables down. If I stayed there again, I'd bring sanitizing wipes to use on the tables--but maybe that's just me being paranoid. The crowding also made for long waits for elevators, but that's pretty standard for Honolulu. I'd stay there again, as it is a nice facility, and the staff is great.","Washougal, Washington",85,4.0

The Embassy Suites definitely has it's perks. Let me start by saying the floor plan of the rooms gives families some space. The free breakfast in the morning is definitely a plus. The location in terms of being close the eateries, shopping and Waikiki beach are all a plus too! We actually made it all the way to the International Market Place this time with our young son. We usually only get to Beach Walk (where the Embassy Suites is located) and our son is saying ""I'm tired let's go back to the room"" when we walk from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Definitely more food options around the Embassy Suites too! Now for the not so appealing side...if you are used to a resort feel hotel this might not be the right choice for you. The hotel definitely gives you the feeling of being in Waikiki as a city. The hotel halls are narrow, the elevators slow, and probably will be looking at some part of another hotel (even with ocean view). Rooms are slightly on the small side despite being suites. The lobby is not impressive and the pool area has fake grass. The pool is also on the small side and located on the 4th floor. However, if all these things do not matter to you this is a great hotel. We did enjoy our stay here. I mostly loved the location being close to affordable family friendly restaurants, shopping, etc. I would stay here again just for having a living room and the bedroom separated, location of the hotel and the free breakfast in the mornings.

The buffet breakfast was fantastic. My kids loved the omelet bar, there was food for everybody. The birds can be a bit annoying as they will swoop in and steal your food if you aren't watching. It isn't an issue as long as you always leave someone at your table to guard the food. The evening reception was great, free drinks for 2 hours. The band was okay, but sometimes they were way too loud and you had to shout to talk to people. We'd sit as far away as possible and then it wasn't too bad. The snacks were basic but still great for kids and adults alike. The hotel is close to the beach (5 minute walk) the beach is rocky though so not great for swimming, you are better off to walk down to Waikiki beach.

Travel time from airport to hotel is approx. 20 minutes. Located in a clusters of hotels on the relatively new Beach Walk area and literally a 5 min. walk to the beach, the hotel is WELL located. You have Royal Hawaiian mall a few min. walk and Ala Moana mall about a good 20 min. walk, at least 2 ABC stores literally outside the mall and a huge host of restaurants. Having a car in Oahu can be problematic as most hotels charge valet service 20-40$ a night. We wound up just renting a car for the days needed which is a lot simpler since the cost of a rental can be b/w 40-50 bucks anyway. We rented with national and they picked us up and dropped us off at hotel after rental closeby in Discovery Cove. Check in area very nice and relaxing offering drinks and relatively pain free. Got room on 14 floor towards the end of hall facing trump towers with partial ocean view. Upon arrival water on floor and safe did not work which was promptly fixed later that night. Room consisted of small kitchenette area with sink, microwave, coffee maker, fridge. Sleeper sofa, flat screen tv and room had 2 queen sized beds. Bathroom was fair sized with 2 sinks, bathroom and roomy shower tub. Breakfast daily included was buffet, with omelette station, japanese breakfast and good baked goods. Come early to avoid crowds. Managers reception nothing too special, music, nachos, peanuts and mixed drinks and beer. Pool was very crowded with kids. The employees were pretty much hit and miss, some were attentive and others honestly could care less about you especially in the am breakfast. Concierge was very helpful though. Overall if you are not going to spend a lot of time in your room and you are just going to stay in the Waikiki area and on the wakiki beach and you are looking to save some money by eating big breakfasts and drinks on some nights then this is the place for you.",New York,75,3.0

Orginally we were given a room by the elevator, & our request to be moved to a quieter room was quickly arranged. The breakfast each morning was really enjoyable, well set out with a good variety of choices. The omlette station was a big hit, & they also did great fried eggs on request! The managers reception was more disappointing - the music was way too loud to be enjoyable, & the snacks were poor. Drinks however, are complimentary. Our room had a very comfortable king bed, but the sofa bed our 13 year old had to sleep on was very uncomfortable & of a poor standard. We loved the location,its quiet even though just by Beach Walk, only a few minutes walk to the beach, & lovely stroll into the heart of Waikiki. Its also nice & close to the bus depot at the Sheraton ('Aloha Landing') where so many tours pick up & drop off. The staff were always helpful & polite, although we were very disappointed with the activities desk. The girl who ""helped""us couldnt seem to find a 7 seater rental car for us to collect from Waikiki & informed us we would have to pick up & return from HNL airport. We walked over to see Avis at the Sheraton & organised one for the next day. She also talked us out of a waterfall hike with one tour company & advised us to use another more expensive company. We took her advice but were not impressed with the tour or the extra $$ we paid for it. Wondering if she was working on commission? The pool was very, very crowded at all times, with lots of younger children. Not a place you can go for a quiet, relaxing swim. There are several ABC stores close by, very handy!

Because it was spring break, we knew it would cost us a plenty for an""Ocean View"" room (No point rooms availiable)..We were on the 19th floor, end unit which was great because it was very quiet. However, when entering the room I expected to see what we had paid for ""Ocean Front"" room..The Ocean front is from the shutters behind the sofa or on the balcony when it wasn't raining because it was not covered, this room also had a city view. Embassy Suites included the breakfast, which is very good, and the manager's reception in the evening, where they offer complimentary drinks and snacks. The location of the hotel is great. It's not beach front, but we knew that, so if you want to go to the beach, it will cost $50 for an umbrella and two chairs.

Unfortunately, my recent experience at this hotel was just average. Everything was average - our welcome, the staff, the gym, and our room, which was dated, worn, and unfortunately not cleaned very well during our stay. Also, you pay $35/night for parking, which is outrageous, especially when I could not reach the valet at one point to retrieve my car. The pool area is very nice, but not well maintained by the staff. Also, the tile in the pool area becomes very slippery, due to water that accumulates t/o the day, and I saw 2 childen fall on the slick tile, including my own, who slipped and fell into the pool, while walking to get there. Thankfully, she did not seriously injure herself. Perhaps if they swept the area areas around the pool and/or better maintained it, that could help. Also,there were no pool attendants present t/o the day (except in the morning when they cleaned it) and only one server for the entire pool area.Highlights in terms of value and expectations of Embassy Suites included the breakfast, which is very good, and the manager's reception in the evening, where they offer complimentary drinks and snacks.

Each time we went to the front desk, we were greeted and looked after in an efficient, friendly manner. Self-parking at this hotel is not an option, but we have nothing bad to say about the valet service. We never had to wait for our vehicle. All the attendants were friendly, courteous and knowledgable when it came to giving us directions. We stayed in the Hula Tower in both a one bedroom and two bedroom suite. Recommend requesting an odd numbered room in the Hula Tower on a high floor. This will give you a sunset view as well as a view of the pool area. Definitely best rooms in the house. There are 21 floors in this tower, so the higher the better. No issues with the elevators. There are 3, and the wait was never very long. If staff are using the elevators, they always give way to guests. Must mention housekeeper Yuet Chan - never had service like this before <3 If you are tall, you may want to know that the bathtubs are bigger in the one bedroom suites. Two bedroom suite is spacious.We have stayed at other Embassy Suites, and my biggest issue is with the cattle call breakfasts. At this hotel, it isn't so bad. They don't pile the food so high that it looks like a trough. Food is continually replenished and the service area is clean. If you are staying for an extended trip, venturing out to other establishments for breakfast will likely be necessary as there isn't much variety day to day.The Grand Lanai where the pool is, breakfast is served and the manager's reception is held is a very nice area. Well planned. Great bartenders! Friendly and a good sense of humour :) This is definitely a family oriented hotel. Lots of kids in the pool all day long. Such a great location - we'd stay here again!Why did I give a ""very good"" rating on sleep quality and cleanliness? Picky points really, but I was awoken by a phone in a neighbouring room vibrating. Thin walls? Could hear conversations, too. Generally not a problem if you are an early to bed early to rise kind of family. Also in the sleep quality category - don't like the pillows - cheap small standard foam pillows. On the cleanliness side of things, I am the kind of person who wipes out drawers, shelves before I put my things away . . . I really think housekeeping should put more attention to this. Also, if you are going to store luggage on top of an armoire, it would be nice if the suitcase wasn't covered in dust.

And if you look to the left, we could see the ocean just past the Outrigger Reef. Overall a nicely appointed room.

Our room was facing Trump hotel and the Pacific Ocean. We were on a high floor and the elevators were reasonably fast. Complimentary full breakfast daily: bacon, sausage, hashbrowns, made to order omelettes, scrambled eggs, wide assortment of fresh fruit, cereals, bakery, beverage station; 4 different types of juices, coffee, tea, milk, even miso soup and rice. Complimentary evening reception nightly from 5:00 to 7:00pm with live band that was fantastic!!! They were a family of 5 (dad, 3 sons and a daughter). Sang new and older songs for everyone to enjoy. Included 3 different types of hawaiian drinks, wide range of mixed drinks, wine, beer, and the beverage station was open for juices and pop. Snacks accompanied the reception with fresh veggies and dip, chips, pretzels, and pub mix. Complimentary free wi-fi in our room as well as in public areas like the breakfast/reception area. Beach towels provided free of charge for their beautiful outdoor pool with lawn chairs and tables. Towels in your room. Our room had a large lanai with a table and lawn chairs for us to dry our wet and sandy swimwear, and slippers. We had a suite with a separate bedroom and living area with 2 queen beds, refrigerator, sink, coffee maker, and 2 flat screen tv's. A/C worked very well and the staff were courteous and friendly. My only complaint is the person that runs the Activities desk near the check-in counter. He was hawaiian and i think his name was Brian. He works for Hilton and was very pushy in trying to sell me ""time-shares"" to Hilton properties. I made the mistake of signing up with him to see a 2 hour presentation at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I changed my mind the next day and cancelled. I also made the mistake of giving him my real cell number. He called me on my cell shortly thereafter, while I was having lunch with my family and would not listen to any of my reasons I cancelled. He kept going on, asking, ""why..., why...., etc. This call must have lasted at least 30 min, wasting my expensive cell phone minutes. I was becoming very irate, raising my voice, and being very short with him. I had to restrain myself from telling him to f...off!! You're ruining my vacation!! Beware!!! All guests at this hotel...Do not sign up for these presentations (timeshares) unless you really want a Hilton timeshare, because they will not let you off the hook easily if you change your mind unless you give them a false number. Oh, I forgot to mention that they entice you with a $100 American Express credit card if you sign up. It's not worth it if your not committed.","Surrey, BC",10,5.0

The Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk meets all these needs very well. Location is not quite at the ""top"" of Waikiki but near it, so you can enter and exit without having to drive deep into the ""strip"" area further Diamond Head. Valet parking (only option) is a little pricey ($35/day) but not unusually so for Waikiki, but the service is fast and friendly. (But you'll need to factor that into the room rate quoted if you plan to have a car.) Breakfast is good - fruit, yogurt, breads, eggs, bacon/sausage, rice, potatoes, Japanese dishes, kimchee for the Koreans, and a cook-to-order omelet bar. The only negative is the coffee. Choice of either a Nestle's instant-coffee-flavored ""brewed"" coffee, or the weirdly flavored Douwe Egeberts brand (yes, the company famous for pipe tobacco, which might explain the weird flavor. Best brew your own in the room (better coffee packs there) and bring it to breakfast, unless you are from the areas of the country that likes your hot water with a hint of coffee flavor, in which case, enjoy!)Internet wireless is free in the rooms and reasonably fast. The gym was good enough to keep up a minimal workout routine while on your trip. Room was very clean. (Be careful, however, unless you actually need the handicapped-accessible room, to get a regular room, as you can't hang your pants in the closet because of the low bars.)Because the Hawaiian economy is so dependent on tourism, the rates for hotels fluctuate wildly, this hotel included. So, if you can get it under $200/night, this will be a fabulous find. $200-$250 a night, a good deal, but over $250 a night, think about it. It will depend on the season, of course. During tourist season, your business better be really good if you're spending $400/night for a room...I would definitely stay here for under $250/night.","Bellevue, Washington",73,5.0

On the two days that she was off, there was a noticable drop in the service as she would only replace one glass instead of two, forget to leave coffee or beach towels. Nothing serious, just a different level of attention to detail.The hallways seemed to need to be vacuumed and I do not think that happened during our stay.We did need to contact maintenance three time for minor issues (Burned out lightbulb, one tv lost connection,, ect) and all were quickly resolved. We did have one annoying problem on our second last day that should not have happened. We came back from breakfast and could not get into our room. Our key card, and the maid's would flash green then red and would not unlock the door. Maintenance needed to be called and the battery replaced. The card lock had been flashing yellow and then green since we checked in. Apparently the yellow flash was a warning that the battery needed replacing. The maids, or three maintenace personal should have noticed this when they were entering the room. If this had happened the next morning when we were coming up to the room after breakfast to pick up our bags to catch the taxi to the airport, the wait for maintenance would have been a very stresfull time.We enjoyed the included breakfast every morning. There is a wide variety of things to choose from. I do not understand why reviewers claim that there is no variety, as we had no problem over 22 days. Just have pancakes one day, an omlette the next, then french toast the next (all with LOTS of bacon of course). Maybe they are the ones that needed to have pancakes, an omlette, bacon, sausages and whatever they could fit on one large plate every day? There are brand name cereals, oatmeal, fruit, salad, yogert, pastries, toast, hash browns and the list goes on. Staff try and clean the tables as quickly as possible, and are very friendly and will often ask if you need anything and will bring coffee, juice or whatever you ask for. Birds are an issue, but they were present wherever there was an outdoor patio - which means most restaurants and the food courts.We never had a problem getting a lounge chair by the pool, and the pool seemed to be well used by children. The pool also seemed to be at least as big or bigger than those we saw at other hotels. Despite only being 4 floors from the pool level, we never heard any noise intrusion into our room, and hotel secuity closes the pool at 10 PM.We also appreciated the nightly managers cocktail reception. The bartenders did not skimp on the alcohol and the drinks were all free poured (no measuring). Wine, mixed drinks, beer and straight bar shots are all available. After 22 nights we knew the band's playlist as well as they did.We chose this property for the location and the price. The location is surrounded by great places to eat (and a few trading on thier reputation), not to mention shopping, and is a short walk to the beach. As this was our 4th visit to Hawaii, and as we had been to all the other islands, we just wanted to park in one place and relax. The price using an AAA rate and considering the included breakfast and evening drinks was reasonable to us. We looked at other nearby and next door one bedroom suites and the Embassy was far and away the least expensive. We did not want just a hotel room as 22 days in one room may have been a little too much togertherness. Having two tv's was also a big plus.The only downside to this propery is its ""lobby"" and that is using the term loosely. It is more of a parking garage entrance and is totally devoid of any character and is not very welcoming. The first respose getting out of the taxi was ""oh oh, this might have been a mistake"", but once you are checked into your room, all is well. And after that first Kona Longboard on the balcony, everything is even better!","Winnipeg, Canada",30,4.0

The room was dated and the couch and carpet looked soiled. The maid came and made the bed and changed the dirty towels each day but we don't think she ever vaccuumed and on several occassions never removed dirty dishes/glasses or removed garbage. The pillows on the beds were about the same size as you get on an airplane - rediculous. The buffet breakfast was almost identical everyday which after 10 days got really boring. They didn't have enough staff in the eating area so the tables were often not wiped down or you'd have to stand with your food and wait for a table to be cleaned.Our telephone didn't work properly so no one could call our room for our entire stay. People calling would have to leave messages and then we'd have to call them back. We stayed here 2 years ago and it was fantastic but it has really gone downhill.

The location is excellent and safe, as the hotel is on the upscale Beach Walk and across the street from the beach. We were upgraded from a one-bedroom to a two-bedroom suite at check-in and were amazed by the amount of space we had. We had a city view room and actually preferred that to an ocean view room, since the city view has increased opportunities to see rainbows and is beautiful at night. The rooms were clean and nicely but simply decorated, and we slept soundly on the comfortable beds. The free, hot breakfast buffet with made-to-order omelets is an excellent value, especially considering that no kind of free breakfast is offered at most Waikiki hotels. We also enjoyed the daily manager's receptions, which feature carrots and dip and nachos and cheese; free drinks (alcoholic and non); and live entertainment (sometimes). In addition, I proposed to my fiance on Waikiki Beach, and the concierge worked with the staff to give me helpful suggestions (e.g., quiet spots on the beach to propose) and to have champagne, unusually excellent chocolate-covered strawberries, and rose petals awaiting our return the night of -- which was not the night we checked in, so the timing had to be right. The pool is heated and large, although not huge, and the hot tub is just the right temperature.

For us, the stay was excellent. We were 1st time visitors to the Islands and stayed on Oahu and the Big Island for 7 nights. If you don't already know, travelling around in Honolulu can at first seem daunting as many of the roads either don't display signs or change the name of the street you are on. Beachwalk is a short one-way street and the entry to ES is towards the end. You drive into a covered area to drop off your car. Not sure if there was self parking or not as we chose valet. At a seated check-in they popped a couple of passion fruit drinks (non-alcoholic) in front of you....nice touch. We enjoyed their free breakfasts in the morning and their drinks in the evening at poolside. All the staff was amazing and very helpful. Our room was 1530 with an absolutely gorgeous view. It was a corner room with 2 different lanai's (porches for you mainlanders) and 3 different accesses to the lanais. Since I was still on mainland time AND I get up early anyway, I found myself on the lanais staring off into the beauty of Waikiki in the early morning hours. The dining close was good. Roy's is on property (it really doesn't say this, but it was right off our elevator), but we opted on our first night to walk down to Dukes and back to get a feel for our surroundings. There is a really good (and highly rated) ice cream hole in the wall right across the street from the main lobby. (Henry's place) and casual dining all over from sushi to hamburgers. We had absolutely no issues with cleanliness, noise, water pressure or bad service (the essentials in my book). I would definitely come back here again.

We loved being able to see both the pool and the ocean from our floor, and the pool was lovely.The location was great but not at all noisy. It was great to just have shops cafes and other facilities just outside the front door, and the beach was just a short walk down the alleyway away.The breakfasts were fantastic especially the cooked to order omelettes and there was no shortage of anything.The bellhops were great and when our shuttle to the airport did not arrive, were more than happy to make the necessary calls and organised a taxi at the shuttle company's expense.The only downer was the slowness of the liftsWould definitely recommend and stay here again.","Adelaide, Australia",11,4.0

The were also many restaurants and shops in the immediate area as well.Room: Very comfortable beds and the pullout couch in the living room area allowed extra bedding. The bathroom was very spacious but basic and the room temperature was adjustable.Amenities: The best part of this stay was the free breakfast every morning. The breakfast is served buffet style but the breakfast options are vast and includes a omelet station. There is also a managers recepetion in the evening and snacks are served but I only made it once with my friends.I also took advantage of the computer room which was very clean and modern.

The breakfast and manager reception area was excellent. It is on the 4th floor out on the roof. There are palm trees everywhere and a nice pleasant breeze is always blowing. Our rooms were just fine and everything worked and was clean. The only thing that is a king of minor hassle at times is that you have to do valet parking because of where the hotel is.

We did not find breakfast up to the normal embassy suites standard and in the end did not use it - it had an industrial feel given the numbers of people going through. That said, there are plenty of reasonably priced options around the hotel.Service was excellent and all the staff we dealt with very helpful, could not fault them! I particularly liked the call on the cell phone when our room was ready in advance of the 3pm check in, having arrived on an overnight flight early that morning that was very much appreciated.Our kids had disrupted sleep on a couple of nights following some 'energetic nocturnal activity' in the adjacent room on the other side of our apartment.Overall, if you are on a bit of a budget with the family then this hotel is great, its close to the action and the breakfast and managers reception certainly reduce costs, there is no doubt about that.

There were about 4 different cereal options and oatmeal. There was an omelet station. The buffet bar consisted of eggs, sausage, bacon, hashbrowns or pototoes, pancakes or french toast, miso soup, rice and salad. There was also several different yogurt options. There was a bread stations that had bagels, english muffins, bread for toast, muffins and various danishes. There was some items that were just okay, but for the most part the food was good. I do have to say the staff in the breakfast area was AWESOME. Shout out to Cary for all the great tourist tips. There were also several other gentlemen that was super sweet. Okay, I will address the birds, because WHY? It comes up in some reviews. YES, there are birds in the breakfast area. It is open and outside. It is not overwhelming or disgusting.

Honestly this hotel wasn't my first choice especially since its particularly known for being a ""family"" hotel and we were three single ladies. I was concerned about being run over by children but there weren't a lot until it got closer to the weekend. I really wanted to stay in the Sheraton which was right across the street from our hotel and ON the beach. However, the breakfast buffet and NO daily resort fees were definitely the deal breakers and it didn't disappoint. The breakfast buffets in the morning were absolutely on point. We pigged oops I meant ate lovely every morning. From the freshly made omelette's or cereal, fruits it was a nice selection that saved you money daily. The pool looked a little small and we never got a chance to enjoy it because we were too busy living it up on the beach. The hotel didn't have a lot of stores inside but it really didn't need them because everything you needed from clothes, restaurants or the ABC stores and 7/11 were literally steps away. Unfortunately, we missed the managers reception the entire time we were there from enjoying Oahu. We had our share of the water in the lobby filled with fruit and ice which was needed.

Avoid booking a room on the 4th floor of the Hula Tower as this is the main entrance way to the pool and eating area.

Can also walk to Ala Moana if your feeling energetic (20 mins) - nice along the beach. Complimentary breakfast a real bonus. Avoid the 9am rush - earlier is far more relaxed and there is less standing in queues.

Almost all of the reviews I read of this hotel were positive, and as the organizer of a Christmas family reunion, I didn't want to screw up. I wanted an affordable, well located hotel that included kitchenettes since there were three small children who eat a lot. Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk fit the bill. We had a VERY Merry Christmas!You've read about the free breakfast buffet and Manager's Reception that are offered every day. When you're feeding a large group, this is going to save you a lot of money, and the fresh fruit and made-to-order omelettes, etc. were as good as they get!So what can I tell you that would be helpful? To start with, request a quiet room on an upper floor when you make your reservation. You definitely don't want to be on the 4th floor since that is heavily trafficked due to the fact that its the pool floor and breakfast/reception location. We had a corner room (1830) in the Hula Tower. Great ocean views. Two terraces. One bedroom with separate living area. Perfect.What else? Well, if you're planning on feeding small children or yourselves, for that matter, in your room, be aware that the little kitchenette has nothing in it except a coffee maker, small refrigerator and a microwave. You might want to bring paper plates from home or even some flatware and maybe a cutting board. There is an ABC store directly across from the hotel which has everything in it you'll ever need (beer, wine, food, drugs, etc.) and a supermarket a couple of blocks away.This is not a glitzy hotel, but it was perfect for our group.

We also stayed there in December 2009 and had a similarly wonderful experience. Several of the same wonderful breakfast staff were still there, and started our days of with smiles.","Poultney, Vermont",2,5.0

The staff member who checked us in upon our early arrival was on the grumpy side and not overly friendly. I mentioned that my travel agent had put in a request for a high floor in a room away from the lift, and he just told us our room was on level 10 and that was that. Of course we got to our room to find we were directly next to the lift! It was a disappointing start to our trip, and as the hotel was full we were unable to move to another room for our first night. As I didn't want to deal with the same staff member who checked us in, I waited until later in the day when the next lot of staff were on reception and was very lucky to come across an absolutely wonderful girl by the name of Malia. She couldn't have been more helpful and immediately checked the availability of another room for us. Unfortunately there wasn't anything available for our first night, but she did find a room on a higher level and at the far end of the hall for the rest of our stay... in a corner suite. I'm so happy we did because I could hear the lift going up and down all night in our original room! I will definitely be contacting the hotel to sing the praises of Malia as she was so friendly, helpful and remembered us... even getting us a special fruit drink each day (which is only usually offered upon arrival) as my boys loved the juice. Everything was done with a smile and nothing was too much trouble.We ended up staying on the 15th floor of the Hula Tower on the corner suite, which had a long balcony facing one beach and another balcony (off the lounge area) facing another part of the beach. It was a good sized room with plenty of space for all of us, and a much better layout than the room we had originally been put into. It's definitely worth asking for a room on a high level and away from the lift!The hotel itself is lovely with a great pool (especially for kids as it's only 4 feet at the deepest end), fabulous manager's drinks and nibbles from 5.30pm to 7.30pm each night (cocktails, wine, beer and soft drinks), and they even have a band a few nights a week... a father and his 3 sons, who were great! The breakfast was good with a selection of fruit, pastries, sausages, bacon, white rice, miso soup, potatoes... and 2 chefs who will cook eggs any way you like. The concierge were helpful with booking tours etc and the valets were always happy and friendly. I can highly recommend a massage by the pool too!The location was perfect for us with plenty of restaurants and shops nearby, and the beach just across the road. It was also fairly quiet and we were far enough away from the centre of Waikiki so there weren't any crowds. For us having a suite was ideal as our boys slept on the sofa bed and we had our own separate bedroom. Much better than having us all squashed in to one room.We had a tsunami warning while we were there and the staff were very calm and happy to answer our questions and let us know what we needed to do. It was obviously scary for us having never gone through anything like that before, but we were put at ease.We wouldn't hesitate on going back to the Embassy Suites and will be recommending it to friends and family.

We stayed on a specials packaged that also included free trolley rides for 2 days, beach chair rental etc & pizza & softdrink pack.

The friendly staff kept the buffet area stocked and clean as well as promptly took away dirty dishes from tables.

Nearby restaurants include The Yardhouse, Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, Starbucks, PF Changs, and many others. The hotel provides free entertainment on certain nights during happy hour. We really enjoyed the band made up of a dad and his 3 sons. They played a wide selection of great songs, ranging from the 1960's (Beatles) to the 2010's (Gotye, fun, etc.) and everything in between. They even put their own Hawaiian spin on each song. All of the employees were very friendly and made our stay extra nice, especially Jeff at the Bell Desk.

We were located in the Aloha towers room 1101. The room was clean, but the view was plain - not so nice part of town. . But I never expect much with Hilton rewards stays. They placed us next to the elevator (which made noise all night and all day), so nappers, this would not be a good room to stay in. We couldn't open our sliding glass door due to the horrible smells coming from the street level. But as I said, reward rooms usually are the worst locations unless you argue for a better room - which I wasn't in the mood after an 11 day cruise. Breakfast buffet was a great surprise with the addition of Miso soup, sticky rice and kimchi (which I loved!), so it made up for the smelly neighborhood and the noisy elevator. Big warning - never leave you food alone to get your coffee! The local pigeons have learned to quickly attack unattended plates and will walk all over your food looking for choice selections. We watched in horror as a flock of birds attacked one table while the entire family went to get their drinks. Manager special was good with a variety of choices mixed drinks and draft beers. I liked that they listed the available drinks on a sign so you don't have to guess what they can make. Drinks are not cheap along Waikiki, so I'd definitely recommend starting your evening there with the live music (big bonus). The location was very good for the price - two blocks from high society shopping; directly above the Yard House Pub - with over 140 beers on tap; and 1 block from waikiki beach thru a dimly lit narrow walkway (usually staffed by the local workers on their smoke break); 2 blocks from the Hale Koa Luau (highly recommended) and recreational beach for military members and families. It's wonderful that there are no private beaches, so you can plop your towel anywhere!

I had read all of the reviews equally but know that a persons review is based primarily on a persons expectations. Our expectations were high based on Hilton experiences. I'm going to start by addressing some of the negative points others stated. First, lets address the breakfast. The variety of choices was pretty standard. We stayed for a little over a week and had pretty good variety for the time we were there. They do cater to the Asian clientele so there are some not so normal choices (of course an American point of view). As far as the birds are concerned. They are there, they don't bother you and swarm around you. They are there because breakfast is out on the patio. If they bother you just being around then you do have the option of wearing inside. However, the majority of the restaurants that you foot are ""open"" and the birds are there too. We didn't find them to be a bother at all. The rooms were great, no complaints here. We had a city view which we didn't mind. The best ocean view is from outside anyway. We stayed in the Aloha tower on the 16th floor. Our room was next to the elevator and yes you can hear it but the noise did not bother us. The key is to ask for the king rooms that are at the end of the hall instead. As far as proximity to the beach. The distance is not even a block. You can actually walk across the street and cut through the Outrigger Reef hotel and get to the beach in no time! Plus there is an awesome restaurant called the Shorebird there that is great for lunch. Roy's is located right inside of the Embassy. We celebrated our anniversary there and the food from start to finish was phenomenal!!!!!

To name a few, Yardhouse, Halekulani Hotel (house without a key restaurant), Nobu, etc.The free breakfast, free drinks in the evenings, and the overall ambience of the hotel is very nice. If I could afford to stay here, I would stay here instead of the Waikiki Parc.We were actually upgraded to an awesome room with wrap around balconies facing the ocean because of my Hilton status at the time (helpful if you are a frequent flyer, consultant, or something like that).If I were to summarize, location location location.",Dallas,58,4.0

Had a 2 bedroom suite, city view, which was great - all the other hotels, stores etc. were lit up at night and we even had a firework display on the Saturday evening. The suite was very comfortable, great to have two beds in the second bedroom as we have older boys who do NOT want to share beds!!!All the staff were really friendly and couldn't do enough for us. The Managers drinks and snacks evening was very good - free cocktails and soft drinks and a wonderful band playing several times a week (really good musicians actually). Pool area good - lots of loungers available and pool towels provided. Food at pool Bar quite pricey but massive portions, so no need to buy a meal per person. Spa in pool is BOILING!! Couldn't stay there very long, much too hot for us when the weather was really hot anyway. As for the free breakfast, where do I start??? It was fantastic - so much choice - make sure you try the 'design your own omelettes'!! They'll keep you going all day! Didn't try the Fitness Suite but it looked as though there was a good assortment of excercise machines if you felt energetic enough to want to use them. The Business Suite was good, able to check e-mails and accounts and also print off boarding cards for our next flight.

We stayed in a one-bedroom partial ocean view suite in the Aloha Tower on the 7th floor. Our king bed was comfortable and was large enough to accommodate a provided crib for our toddler son. The suite was very clean although they could do a better job of dusting the shutters. The suite included a kitchenette with a sink and mini fridge so if you are looking to do any cooking, this isn't the place for you. The bathroom is accessed through the bedroom. We didn't hear or see too much of our neighbors but since our end room was overlooking the Great Lanai where the manager's reception is held, we could hear the music in the living area. It ended by our early bedtime so it wasn't a problem for us. Valet service was great and they always got us our car quickly and were eager to help with our bags or provide directions.Breakfast was good but not great, with a wide selection of the usual American breakfast items (cereal, toast, pastries, eggs, potatoes, bacon and sausage) and also some Japanese ones, including miso soup and white rice. Breakfast is from 6:30am to 10am and when we ate breakfast around 6:30-7am, the wait at the omelet station ranged from no wait to a couple of minutes.The swimming pool is medium-sized with a kiddie pool and jacuzzi attached and wasn't very busy when we were there. But if you're looking for romance in the Jacuzzi, I'm not sure if this is the place for it since its attached to the pool and there were several kids there during the only evening that we stopped by. Also, we did laundry once and it cost about $5 for one load (detergent, washing machine and drying machine). There were around 4 washing machines and 3 dryers but we didn't haven't to wait for anyone and the machines were really fast. The location was great. It's across the street from Fort DeRussy park beach, which has a wide beach with barely any waves (at least in September) so it was great for swimming with kids. It's one block away from the main drag of Waikiki where many corporate restaurants and stores are located. There's an ABC store, a 7-11, and Ramen Nakamura that are just around the corner. And for those that like the Cheesecake Factory (there was always a long wait so it seems like a lot of people like it), it's about a 10 minute stroll.Great place to stay.","Seattle, Washington",59,4.0

The hotel and staff were excellent. We had a 2 bedroom unit on the 14th floor with a city/partial ocean view and it provided everything we needed for a comfortable vacation with 4 older children. The 2 bedroom suites have 3 TV's, small fridge, microwave and 2 bathrooms. One thing to note, you're staying in a big city so it's going be noisy if you want to sleep with the balcony doors/windows open no matter how high your room is. The hotel is located in a very commercial part of Waikiki, there's lots of amenities and shopping but it's also a very active and busy area.The free breakfast became a treat we looked forward to every morning and should not be missed, kudo's to the nice breakfast staff. The manager's happy hour was also very nice, a great place to cool down from a day at the beach and have some free drinks before heading out to dinner. They serve alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks so all ages are welcome. We read some reviews where people complained about the quality of the drinks offered; Did you think they were going to serve free champagne and Chateau Lafite Rothschild, of course not. You're on a Hawaiian vacation, the tropical drinks, beer and sangria's were perfectly fine. There's lots of ABC stores nearby if you're looking for better spirits and wine.Our flight was delayed so we arrived late in the evening; the check-in staff was excellent and fruit drinks were brought out to us while we checked in. A very nice touch after a long travel day from Canada. We have been to Waikiki about 6 times and while this was the nicest hotel we have stayed in, it was also the most expensive. However, when you factor in the free breakfast, free manager's happy hour, the 2 bedroom suite and other hotel amenities, we found it to be pretty good value. We would stay here again.Nearby restaurants to consider:The Yard House - Very busy but excellent bar type food, great service, go at happy hour for the 1/2 price appetizers and reduced prices on drinks. The happy hour runs pretty late so you can save money by making it an early dinner and order a bunch of appetizers.Kaiwa Waikiki - Very good Japanese food but brutally expensive.Giovanni Pastrami - Would not recommend except for the take out pizza. Their pastrimi/smoked meat sandwiches were mediocre, the service was indifferent and they have the air conditioning temperature set way too low, it was like eating in a walk-in cooler.","Edmonton, Canada",78,5.0

I was very impressed with how clean the rooms were and the staff was so friendly and helpful. It is an added bonus that as a guest you are getting a free breakfast and free alcohol at the manager's reception everyday; and this is nice breakfast buffet that even includes an omlette station. On the weekend they even had a live band at the reception. The location is nice as well, only a short walk to the beach.

Hilton Diamond member staying on points. Requested ocean view room two weeks prior to arrival and was refused but was granted when we checked in. Stayed in room 1432- view towards Trump hotel and out towards Hilton Hawaiian Village and airport. Great views of sunsets and the HHV Friday night fireworks. Staff at the hotel was superb. For example the man who helped us bring in our luggage remembered us by name throughout our trip and always asked my son if he was having a good time. Housekeeping was excellent. Hotel and room seemed to be in good shape overall. Nothing overly fancy, but nice to have the extra space of a suite for such a long stay. Valet was always quick and had our car ready for us before we made it down the elevator. Breakfasts were a notch above normal ES that I have had with a few nice local touches with fresh fruit and a fairly large miso soup/salad station. Lunch and dinner service served at the pool was very well done with a good selection of sandwiches and salads. Poolside bar was well stocked and reasonably priced 7.50 for a piña colada. Managers reception was always busy but they always had two bartenders on staff- and kept the line moving. Location- on the beach walk- kind of hard to find by car as the streets surrounding the hotel are all one way. If you make a mistake you can cut through the Trump parking garage to get back over the ES valet. The beach has two public access paths directly across the street from the hotel. Turn right to get to Ft. Durussy beach a very narrow and rocky beach. Turn left and the path right before the Sheraton hotel takes you out to a walkway that gets you to Waikiki beach. We found that the beach in front of the Royal Hawaiian (pink hotel) had great sand and some fun waves. It was our go-to beach when walking from the hotel. Five minute walk from hotel to this beach. The Beawchwalk retail area was nice- good souvenir shopping, a large ABC store, a Starbucks and quite a few restaurants. Highly recommend the Yard House for good casual food. I would happily stay again at this hotel and would highly recommend it to other families traveling to Honolulu on vacation. ","Milwaukee, Wisconsin",13,5.0

We were on one of the top floors and our corner suite faced the ocean on each side! This certainly wasn't a ""partial ocean view""!!My wife and I were travelling with a toddler and a young child and the spacious suite is perfect for this! The added bedroom allows for the kids to sleep at their normal times, without fear of disturbing them.The added value of the complimentary made to order breakfasts each day also offer value that most of the Embassy Suites competitors at Waikiki cannot match. Good variety of food, including the freshest fruits and customizable made-to-order omlettes! Delicious!I would like to also comment on the staff! FANTASTIC! I also want to ackowlege one of the bell staff. I think his name was Johnnie. On the first day there we settled in and were headed down to the beach with the kids in tow and we forgot to grab our beach towels. He was in our elevator on the way down to the beach and he noticed this fact. He offerred to grab us some, but we decided it wasnt such a big deal (the weather was typically beautiful). He insisted and stopped the elevator on the next floor and ran off to grab 4 towels for us! He was so friendly and wow...talk about service! Who else would even notice that we didnt have beach towels (among all of our gear), muchless who would go thru the trouble of ensuring we had what we needed to have a great time at the beach! Thanks Johnnie!The General Manager was AMAZING in accomodating a special request. He really helped out my family and helped ensure that we have the VERY best experience possible in his hotel! Its obvious why this hotel is so fantastic - it has a great leader!

Everything from the open air lobby, to the large open breakfast area, managers reception is top notch. Granted upon checkin, the front desk agent was not the most welcoming/lacked the aloha spirit, everything else about the hotel made up for it.The rooms are large suites with one or two beds in the guest room and a decent size living room which is awesome for families traveling together or large groups as was mine. Fortunately for us, we got an awesome upgrade to a top floor corner room with a wrap around balcony which boasted a decent view of the ocean.Breakfast was standard ES with a little bit of local flavor thrown into the mix for good measure. The evening managers reception provided plenty of drinks and cocktails to go around as well.Location wise, this property was nothing short of awesome! Personally, as long as I am really close to the beach, and have a decent view of it, I am good to go as I don't really see a need to spend all the extra $$ to be right there on the beach and give up the larger room, breakfast and managers reception. Also, being right on beach walk ave, there are a ton of restaurants right next to and around the hotel.Next time I am in HNL, you can bet I am staying at the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk.","Chicago, Illinois",48,5.0

It was a great fit for our family, since it is across the street from the luxurious Halekulani hotel and beach, and in the heart of the Waikiki Beachwalk shopping and dining area. All of the rooms are suites, and we chose a two bedroom/two bathroom unit that had a kitchenette unit (sink, small refrigerator and microwave), plus a living room with a table, flat screen TV and sleeper sofa. The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable and had flat screen TVs. We enjoyed the spacious units and island decor. Everyone slept well, with no street noise. Our first stay was in a city view room, but our second was upgraded to a partial ocean view at no additional charge. the view was lovely. We didn't use the pool as our kids preferred the beach. There are complimentary yoga classes offered some mornings. Others mentioned the boogie boards that could be borrowed...too bad we didn't know about that. Breakfast buffet is included, which we enjoyed since there are some Japanese options (miso soup, salad, rice with fun mix-in options) plus make your own omelets, delicious fresh tropical fruit, guava juice, and the usual hotel buffet spread. We ate dinner one night at House without a Key, the casual outdoor restaurant at the Halekulani, plus Sunday brunch. The well-regarded Hawaiian fusion restaurant Roy's, is in this hotel, which we will keep in mind for a future visit. Service was excellent, from the quick & easy check-in and complimentary tropical drinks to the bellhops picking up our luggage in our room and storing it while we explored Honolulu on our embarkation and disembarkation days. Parking is $30/day, valet only, but the valets were quick & helpful, and will give you printed turn-by-turn directions to popular attractions. The concierge was friendly & helpful, even though we didn't need him to book any excursions for us. We didn't attend the complimentary manager's reception as we had luau tickets that night. Our son left a nice polo shirt behind on our first stay, but housekeeping brought it back to us when we asked about it during our second stay. The location is excellent for the price. It is a very short walk to the beach, shopping, and fun Beachwalk restaurants. There are many ABC convenience stores nearby for any groceries, beach supplies, or souvenirs that you need. We would stay here again the next time we visit Honolulu.","Austin, Texas",315,5.0

The location was perfect, a 3 minute walk from the beach and only moments from the main shopping street and restaurants. The pool was really nice, and staff were very helpful and efficient regarding any requests that we had. I had read other reviews saying that rooms beside the lift could be quite noisy so, when we were shown to a room right beside the lift, I requested a move. I didn't hear anything while we were there but, just in case, I was hoping that they could accommodate my request. Fortunately this was possible and we were able to move to another king room at the end of the hall. We were told that the king rooms are located either side of the lift on each floor, which is why this is such a comon problem, and then there's another king room at the end of the hall - the latter normally get allocated first. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. Mahalo, Embassy Suites!","Sydney, Australia",4,4.0

We were on the 5th floor which allowed easy access to breakfast and the pool - both of which are on the 4th floor.Breakfast each morning was wonderful and a great perk for my hungry boys. They were able to wake up... run down and eat while allowing mom and dad to sleep in a bit. Awesome.The food was very good and rotated through a few different choices on a daily basis. The made-to-order omelet station was my favorite part. Delicious.As other have said, they do have boogie-boards available to use simply for the asking. On their last day a family who purchased 2 boards offered them to my boys. We used them then donated them to the ES for others to use. The rooms are large and comfortable. Clean and very inviting. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was large and clean. Parking is very easy but it's valet only. The valet's are very quick when it comes to bringing your car to you.The ES is in a perfect location and literally a walk across the street to the beach.

The ES Beachwalk has large, comfortable and clean rooms, obviously super for families as well as couples/individuals that like more 'apartment-like' space. The pool is clean and well kept, with an interesting flooring and always at a good temperature. Happy Hour is well run, generous, as is the breakfast - this property tops traditional mainland ES breakfast offerings with a few Hawaiian / Asian touches. Location is fine, not too far from anything, and just a bit outside of the noisiest parts of Waikiki, so sleep is actually achievable (not so on mid-strip properties I've stayed at)! I've raved about this place on flyertalk and some other forums - as a HHonors Diamond, they've always taken my room requests under consideration, and the front desk and other staff have been helpful regardless of status. The GM (Bob, who has posted replies to reviews on this site) took personal attention to a request a couple stays ago, and that was appreciated. I just finished a letdown of a stay at the Rome Waldorf Cavaleri (supposedly one of the best in the HH family of hotels), and was let down enough that I booked a four-day stay upcoming in October back at the ES Beachwalk just to remind myself of what a fun Honors property is all about!I look forward to another great stay!","Eagle, Idaho",22,5.0

The full breakfast in the morning is worth it! We all started the day well fed, and the variety was impressive. We easily had light lunches with sandwiches or salads we bought at ABC or left overs we stored in the fridge and then had great evening meals out, only having to buy 1 meal a day was a huge saving. The staff were incredibly accommodating, warm and aloha friendly. Lei greeted us and brought us coffee every morning! She was so sweet! The pool was a bit small, but the kids never minded! We found the mornings less busy at the pool but by 2, people had come back from their activities and it got a lot more crowded. But we never had a problem getting loungers. the bar staff were friendly and the nightly managers reception was also great for free drinks and light snacks. We would get a couple of drinks before we went out or dinner. The location was incredible! Close to everything! 5 min walk to Grays Beach which we loved as it was tucked away and not crowded. The restaurants, shopping and ABCs were all within 2 minute walking distances, starbucks was close, what more could you want. We used the valet service and car parking for 3 days while we rented a car and it was convenient and comparable in price to anything else in other major cities. again, the staff from valet, to front desk, to house keeping, pool and food services were all top notch.

I was not disappointed. The all-suite hotel is very good indeed and well suited to families with young children.The location is excellent with immediate access to some great eating and entertainment options in and around Lewers St. The hotel is one block back from the beach and many rooms lack spectacular views that can be found elsewhere.I stayed on Level 15 where there was no street noise. Room 1506 was across from the elevators and no noise there either.Room cleanliness was excellent with the chambermaid (Jenny) doing a first class job. Room amenities were also very good with two LED TVs with about 40 channels available. Sleep quality was excellent as the beds are very comfortable. There is a small fridge, microwave and coffee maker in the room. The WiFi internet access was surprisingly good (and free). The room appeared to have been recently refurbished and all furniture and fittings were in excellent condition.Breakfast is included and is generally of good quality. The cooked-to-order omlettes are excellent. Some of the other options get a little boring during longer stays and the 'orange juice' is pretty awful. Fruit is plentiful and very high quality.The Manager's Drinks session (5:30 - 7:30 every evening) is a really good feature. The Mai Tais taste great and they sure pack a real punch. The included snacks are basic e.g. chips, peanuts Doritos etc. There is live entertainment 4 nights a week and the Hawaiian band is pretty good. The price is right - everything is included in your room rate. The swimming pool is great for young children but not really suitable for adults wanting to relax or do laps. The pool is about 6m x 20m with an adjacent hot spa and small section for infants to paddle around. Water cleanliness was excellent but there is no lifeguard on duty.I found hotel staff to be genuinely friendly and efficient. I was able to get an early check-in although the hotel was near capacity.During peak seasons, this hotel is not cheap and less expensive hotel rooms are easy to find. For me, the value of a separate bedroom, good breakfast, free cocktails and internet access is worth the extra room cost.

The room worked out great for our family of 4. We had requested in advance a high floor room in the Hula Tower. We have Diamond status with Hilton so I assumed this would be no problem. Our course, when we checked on they had us on the 6th floor of the Aloha Tower. They basically said my status with Hilton, which I have maintained for years, didn't mean anything when I book with points. My wife didn;t like this a pushed and after a few minutes we were given a room on the 18th floor of the Hula Tower, 1826 to be exact. The room was right across from the elevator, which worked out great. I read a lot of reviews that suggested getting a high floor on the Hula tower, which is why I asked. I quickly realized the only views in that tower are if you are facing the pool. Our side looked out a condo property, that is taller that the Embassy. If I stood at the railing of my balcony and looked right, I had a partial view of the ocean (see my pictures). This really didn't bother me to be honest. I think the views might be better in the Aloha tower, if you had a higher room. In that tower there are less obstructions and it looked like you would either have a Diamond Head view or partial ocean view. Also, the breakfast area is just as close to the Aloha tower as the Hula tower.The breakfast buffet is the value here. Saves $$$ and was very good. Also, unlike many Embassy Suites, there was not an issue of finding a table, even at primetime. Plenty of room. One tip, sit more in the middle of the room or away from the open areas because of the birds.The happy hour is just so so, but I guess I should complain about free beer. The wine is undrinkable and I didn't try the tropical drinks. The snacks are basically pretzels and chips and salsa.There's a great little sushi place across Beachwalk across from the 7-11. Small place but great sushi. I think its in the Breakers hotel.The beach is ony a block away and there are many rental stands where for $25 you can rent an umbrella and 2 lounge chairs for 4 hours. When you get the beach turn right towards the Hilton and go a couple of stands down where the beach is wider.The pool area is nice and was never crowded, to my amazement. The pool is shallow and full of kids, but its cools you off when you need it. There's a bar by the pool and they have a simple bar food menu.If you rent a car, the parking could cost more than the rental. $30/day for valet.

We were in the Hula Tower, 19th floor, the end room facing Waikiki, #1929, the view was wonderful, although there are two other hotels that are in the front, you can see over the hotels that are @ lower level,,as the ES is not right on the beach. Everything in Waikiki is expensive, and we found that the great breakfast in the morning of made to order omeletts/eggs waffles, toast, fruit a good value. Bob the manager personally welcomed us, which we really appreciated. We recommend booking the island activities through the Expedia desk in the lobby, Noelani was a great resource, and could not have been more professional and helpful with her recommendations and assistance. The best beach deal is renting the two chaise lounges/umbrella right in front of the Beachcomber one block from the hotel for $40.00/day. Get there early by 10:00 to reserve the front row, right on the water, and reserve a spot. Further down the beach they can run $80.00/day. $3.00 Mai- Tais @ the Beachcomber starting @ 3:00! AS A WARNING: Our only bad experience, NOT CONNECTED TO EMBASSY SUITES while in Waikiki, was involving the ""Parrot Dise"" guy down on the beach next to the Outrigger, one block from the ES. He takes pictures of families with his parrots with the beach in the the background. He took our cash,(a bad sign) and did not mail us our pictures, as promised. We called several times after we returned home, and he actually had the nerve to hang up on us twice! Finally, because he rents the space from another hotel, and we asked security to investigate, did he finally mail us the pictures. You would think he had a reputation to maintain, but apparently this is his MO with customers and cash. The pictures were not anything great. Take that, Mr. Parrot!","Mill Valley, California",3,5.0

The bedroom (separated by a solid door – a rarity in one bedroom condos in Waikiki) had a queen bed, tv and access to the lanai. Bed was unbeliveably comfortable!!The lounge area also accessed the lanai and had a sofa bed, though I honestly can’t see how you would fold it out in that size of room – with a coffee table, arm chair and dining table there really wasn’t much room to move around for the three of us, but that was fine because we were always out and about.The bathroom was large and well appointed - and spotless! The whole room was very luxurious compared to other places I’ve stayed at in Waikiki for similar price range.The pool area was brilliant – a large number of lounge chairs so there was always one available, two bars and Astroturf which meant you weren’t walking on hot pavement. The pool was the best – a heated pool with a hot tub and kids pool, it was fantastic for my little one and the best I’ve seen in Waikiki.Morning breakfast provided a great variety and I like that breakfast started pretty early (6am I believe), which for early risers is great. The nightly drinks with the manager were great and my only suggestion would be that they add pina coladas to the offering – their margaritas were sensational and made up for it, though.Waikiki Beach Walk is a great little area very different from the rest of ‘old waikiki’ and while the restaurants and shops were great, I personally liked to walk up to the older part of Waikiki as the beach is a little nicer (less rocks) and it feels less resort-y.Overall, I really liked this hotel – how rare that you can find a family oriented hotel that manages to please the whole family, while adding class and luxury.",Melbourne,75,4.0

This trip was the best by far. The hotel and their staff were outstanding. Special kudos to Victor and Helena. The staff at the breakfast buffet was great. The floor manager went out of his way to accomodate the kids. The omelet chefs worked very hard keeping the lines moving. The only problem was with housekeeping. That was quickly remedied by the housekeeping supervisor. We had a two bedroom suite on the 20th floor corner room. Got to see fireworks and a parade. The breakfast buffet is on on the 4th floor. Go early to avoid waiting on the elevator. You can use the stairs if your floor is nearby. The valet parking was also outstanding, never a wait if you call down ahead of time. The hotel also has beach toys left behind by other guests. Ask the valet attendants, to avoid the expense and telling the kids that the toys have to be left behind. The manager's reception is typical Embassy Suites, but you get plastic cups because it's next to the pool. Would definitely stay here again.","Houston, Texas",19,5.0

Plus the Beach Walk location is home to some terrific restaurants so you really don't even need a car if you stay here. In fact, we prefer this hotel over the Hilton Hawaiian Village due to its location and newness. The friendly staff tries very hard to make you happy.

Overall, I would say this is definitely a hotel for families. If you are looking for romance or are not a big fan of being around kids, this is definitely not the place to stay!This hotel has many positives: spacious room, great breakfast, contemporary(ish) decor (although a little kitschy), decent drinks & food at the pool, free happy hour, good location, quick elevators. We found the bell staff to be exceptionally friendly & helpful. The concierge was also helpful, if not very warm (which was fine). Check in was also easy & quick and they give you a yummy drink when you arrive, which is nice after traveling. There were also things we were not so crazy about at this hotel: the room we were in (2131) had poor ventilation - the bathroom has no a/c vent & when 4 people are showering, it is tough to put on makeup or dry hair in the bathroom because it is soooo warm in there. We had to crank up the a/c in the rest of the room to have any hope of getting cool air to go towards the bathroom. Also, there were odd smells and noises coming through the vents at various times. In addition, the beds have poor support & my husband and I had sore backs each morning; the pool is long but not wide & there are A LOT of young kids in it, so you are constantly getting splashed in the pool and in the hot tub - and while you expect to get splashed in a pool, it is more than one would expect; the part of the beach the hotel is near has a lot of coral near the shore & isn't nice to swim in - you have to walk a ways to get to the ""good"" part of the beach. My main complaint was the housekeeping staff. The room, overall, looked clean. The bedsheets were extremely clean, bright & white, which was great. However, there are little things that they miss - for example, the lights and mirror and ceiling surrounding the vanity in the bathroom in our room were covered in thick dust. There was a hair stuck to the ceiling over the shower that was there for all 8 nights we were there. There were several times when our room wasn't cleaned by 2:30 or 3:00 & on two such occasions, we were faced with the choice of having our room not cleaned that day or taking a shower in order to get ready after time at the beach or pool. One day we were in a time crunch & chose not to have housekeeping come in (they said if we didn't get the room cleaned right away, we couldn't have it cleaned as they would be leaving for the day). The other day, we opted to have the room cleaned since we had sand in the entry to the room & ended up being late to meet someone for dinner because we had to wait for the housekeeper to clean the room. Mind you, we left a tip each day for the housekeepers, but this didn't seem to help much in terms of the time our room got cleaned, nor did it get us the things we asked for - i.e. extra towels, etc. That was kind of frustrating. The worst, though, was the night the housekeeper left 2 ""new"" rolls of toilet paper for us (they are wrapped in a Cottonelle wrapper). I went to put a new roll out & the outer 50% or so of the roll was covered in a brown substance of some sort (coffee? cola? something else???). I threw that roll away since I had no idea what it was, and got the second roll out. It had the same stuff on it. It seemed pretty unsanitary to me, so I called the front desk & they brought us a new roll of tp. The next day, I came back to the room after the housekeeper had been there to find she had apparently taken one of the yucked up rolls of tp out of the garbage, took off the 50% of the roll that was brown & left the remaining 50% of the roll on the counter for us to use (which we did not, we threw it away again). She also gave us 2 more rolls of tp. Much to my shock, the next morning when I went to use one of the 2 ""new"" rolls of tp, I found they both had the same brown substance on them. At that point, I was pretty mad & I brought a roll down to the front desk. I explained how this had occurred 2 days in a row. Not sure what, if anything, they did about it, as we checked out the next morning & never heard anything else about it. When we are paying over $300 per night for a hotel room, I don't think it is asking too much to get some clean toilet paper. Sadly, that was our last impression of this hotel & had us leaving on a negative note. :( Oh, they also overcharged us for a day of valet parking, but we didn't realize this until after checkout - we called from home & they did credit us the $30, which was good. So, if you park here, just double check your bill.","St. Charles, IL",5,3.0

I grew up in Hawaii and my parents still live there, so we went back to surprise my Dad for his 75th birthday. The manager of the Embassy Suites allowed me to go behind the edge of the check-in desk to greet my Dad from there when he came in (a funny surprise to him). This is just one example of the great service and willingness to work with customers. Other examples: we were upgraded (which means to a higher floor with a better view); I asked them to upgrade my parents too, not remembering my mother's crippling fear of heights. Even though the hotel was totally full, the hotel made a lot of effort to find her something on a lower floor and they finally were given a two bedroom suite for the one night they were staying; great bartenders - cheerful and quick; great smiling guys making omelettes in the morning; music and pupus (appetizers) were decent at the manager's reception each night. Not to sound snotty, but while we can afford hotels like the Ritz, we choose to stay at the ES for the space that two rooms provides us, plus the mini fridge and microwave are very handy, the breakfast spread (free) is awesome, the free drinks in the evening are great and free wifi. Just because you CAN pay more doesn't mean you don't want a good deal, right? The beds are comfortable, the lanai was huge with a great view across Waikiki beach... it was perfect. While not completely beachfront, we didn't care because it was a 30 second walk to the beach and we still had a beautiful view.I'd highly recommend staying here.","Charlotte, North Carolina",41,5.0

That was ignored by the hotel manager who went on to overcharge me for the 11th day because he could.

We wanted to get a room more higher up at the Hula Tower because Tripadvisor reviews mentioned that it would be quieter there. However, the only room available in that tower was a two double bed suit on the 8th floor. So we were left with the king size bed suite in the Aloha Tower on the 18th floor by the elevator. It had a nice partial ocean view, and we didn't hear any street noise. However, the reviewers on Tripadvisor were correct to say that the elevator next to the room was very noisy. We called to see if there were other rooms several times the first day. We found out that each floor only has 3 king-size bed suites, and 2 out of those 3 rooms would be next to an elevator. Great... On top of that, that same night the hot water went out (which came back at midnight). I couldn't put up with all these anymore and made another call to front desk. Finally the front desk decided to upgrade us to a 2 king size bedroom suite on the 14th floor. It was a corner room facing the street and Diamond Head. Unfortunately, the corner bedroom with a nice city view was noisy - we could hear the DJ and the band through the night. We ended up sleeping in the other bedroom that was quieter. We could still hear the street noise, but not as bad as the corner bedroom. The connecting wall was kind of thin though. We could hear the baby next door crying every morning (my husband also heard the next door person snoring in the first room we got before).The hotel bedroom on the higher floors don't have wireless internet, only wired. The hotel does provide routers to get Wi-Fi. However, I had trouble connecting my Motorola Razr smartphone to Wi-Fi in the room. I was on their technical support line for 45 minutes trying to solve it. Their contracted technical support team sure didn't know how to fix that. I called them 3 times, and each time they asked me to give them the same info even though I gave them my reference number each time. They would ask me to do the same thing attempting to resolve the issue. After spending too much time on the phone with them, I've decided not to waste my vacation time to call them again. So every day my phone would keeping scanning for connection, remembering the network IP address, but would not connect. But at least after a long while, It would connect my phone to the Wi-Fi. Not sure why.Of course the good part about staying at this hotel is the free breakfast buffet. It really saved us a lot of money. Then on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays there is the manager's reception, which includes free cocktails, snacks, and live music. Don't expect too much about the snacks - they are just chips and trail mix.I do love the decor of the rooms. I also love the Crab Tree and Evelyn bath and body care products.The hotel is right by the shops and restaurants on Beachwalk and just few blocks from Waikiki Beach.

Aside from the usual ES perks which drew us to book here (hot breakfast, managers reception, fridge, microwave, large suite, pool), we were happy with the location and the staff. With the kids in tow, the short walk to both Ft. Derussy beach and Waikiki via Don Ho Ln and the Sheraton property was just right. One day, we did walk down Kalakaua past the Police station to swim at Kuhio beach with a protected wall area for our little one. That was a nice spot to not worry about crashing waves onshore. Check-in was great with the pineapple juice and Gina was very professional and even gave us a good recommendation for Ramen Nakamura down the street. Our room was preassigned, but when we got up there it was right across from the elevator even though my HH profile requests to be away from the elevator. After a long morning of travel, my family convinced me to just let it be. However, there were a couple of nights when I was kept awake by the elevator. I regret not making the request to change rooms so will make it a point to see that our request is seen next time. The concierge desk (esp. Kylie, Noelani and Bobby) was very helpful with excursion tips, beaches as well as our rental car booking. We only used a car on a Sun and Tues so did not keep it overnight and pay the parking fee. The bell desk was also friendly and helpful (esp Dean, Johnny and Keoloni). We brought our own rafts but we also borrowed boogies boards from the hotel. I wish we had known about the boards sooner bc we only got to use them on our last beach day. Overall our stay went well, but the evacuation at 3am could have been handled better. We did not complain bc we were afterall in paradise, but there may have been some guests who did. The mgmt provided an apology letter for the inconvenience but going downstairs and climbing back up 8 flights w/sleeping baby in front carrier was not fun. The alarm and alert came through the rooms to evacuate once so many people followed. But I heard that some guests called down to the front desk and were told it was not needed. If only an announcement was made to disregard the alarm, we would not have brought the baby down and we felt bad for the elderly woman with a cane trying to make her way downstairs. While we evacuated for our safety, I felt it was executed poorly after realizing some guests were told not to evacuate. On our last night, a gas line broke and we did not have hot water until the next morning. A minor inconvenience and one caused by building maintenance vs. staff so we excused it. We might stay here again if I make sure that our room is not near the elevator.",SF Bay area,29,4.0

The breakfast isn't some bagel and coffee bar, but a full set-up to include cooked-to-order egss.

We did so for 2 reasons. The first reason was the reviews on Tripadvisor. The second reason was we wanted to be in the heart of Waikiki and not have to walk or ride to where all the action is.The Embassy Suites is perfectly located. While not right on the beach, it is only a block away with an easily accessible walkway to the beach. The location is perfect for everything we liked to do both during the day and in the evening. We were right near so many restaurants including Roy's which is in the hotel. Enterprise car rental was only a few blocks away and they will pick you up at your hotel and bring you back to the hotel. The shopping was amazing. The beach walk street and the main street is lined with shops. There are shops for everyone from couture to hawaiian made crafts to souvneir shops. Public transportation is also close by if you wish to use it (Waikiki on and off trolleys, buses, etc.)The hotel staff friendliness, kindness and sincerity rates way up there with the hotels we have stayed when we traveled. We have stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels, including the Halekulani in Honolulu. The staff was just as wonderful at the Embassy Suites. Cold juice at a sit-down check-in, personally coming over to you at the breakfast buffet to see if they can carry your tray, get you anything you need at breakfast, etc. etc. We were really bowled over. The reviews on Tripadvisor raved about the staff and boy where they correct.The hotel itself was terrific. Being a suite we had a very spacious room. We asked for an ocean view, high up away from the elevator. That is exactly what we got PLUS they gave us a corner room. You could see the ocean from the balcony in the bedroom and from both balconies in the living room. The room was always clean, the hallways smelled so fresh, and the linens were so soft. The bed was extremely comfortable. Our room was the south west corner of the Hula Tower (Room 1630). Since it was on the west side you could see the sun set from the balcony.The breakfast was quite plentiful and very tasty. Juices, cold cereal, instant oatmeal, eggs pre-pared and made to order at the omelet station, delicious hash brown potatoes, bacon, pancakes, various Asian breakfast items, muffins, donuts, wonderful banana bread, fresh cut up tropical and summer fruits as well as bananas, oranges and apples. You can eat inside or outside. We chose to eat outside where there were umbrellas and lovely flowers. I know some people complain about aggressive birds who try to steal your food. You will be fine if your party takes turns going in for their food and someone remains at the table to keep guard. After all, birds have to eat too. My husband and I love birds and didn't mind them at all. The hotel asks you not to feed them which is hard to do when they come begging, but out of respect for the other guests, it really is best that you do not feed them.We only went to the Manager's reception once because the one time we went we nibbled too much and ruined our appetite for dinner. They had peanuts, chex mix, pretzels, potato chips, tortilla chips, salsa and of course regular and alcoholic beverages. And remember it is included (NO extra charge).The pool was terrific. The temperature was perfect. Cool when you stepped in but not so cold it shocked you. They also have 2 areas with a hot pool and that was great too.The breakfast and manager's reception was included in the hotel price. We found this hotel to be well worth the cost and definitely would stay there again.Thank you, Embassy Suites, for a great stay.","VOORHEES, New Jersey, USA",11,5.0

We decided to use the day to go visit Pearl Harbour, so went to the tours desk and got all the directions and information we needed. On our return we arrived at our room and luggage was following close behind. The room was just lovely with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, lounge/dining area and small kitchen. We had no problems with the room at all it was spotless and plenty room. At this hotel you get a cooked to order breakfast and a buffet with everything you could want to eat each day for free. they have plenty of fruit and snacks to take for later. You can eat at the buffet or take it back to your room. Also they have what they call Managers Reception from 5.30pm to 7.30pm with free drinks and nibbles. Just great and met lots of fellow travellers. We also used the laundry and this was well equipped. This hotel is in a great location near the beach and the pool is awesome right next to bar and eating area. Dennys across the road and Beachwalk shops just downstairs.

(I.E. When you are getting free drinks, don't complain about the snacks.)Staff was wonderful- Russel (Food Ambassador) made us feel at home every morning at breakfast. He grew-up on Oahu and took the time to assist us in planning our daily trips around the island. Very helpful and courteous, indeed.Our room was kept very clean by Sophia the Wonder-Maid and Dennis at the poolside bar makes a mean MaiTai for sure.We were lucky enough to stay on the 6th floor of the Hula tower looking over the pool deck and a partial ocean view facing West (great sunsets).We will definately be back.

The few Waikiki places that had 1B suites - I saw bad reviews on TripAdvisor for nice places, from bad service to bed bugs! I'd only wanted to pay around $200 a night, but no way I'd pay $200 a night and come home with bed bugs! I was actually looking into a Koko Resorts condo (free parking!) but I didn't like that they wanted you to pay upfront - before you even get there. So I ended up at Embassy Suites.The bedroom was a little crowded with 2 Queen beds. Would've felt better with 1 King bed. The furniture was nice. Mini fridge, microwave. 2 cup quick coffee maker or full 10 cup coffee maker. The one thing we loved about this suite - the bathroom had 2 doors, one to the living area, and one to the bedroom - so our kids didn't have to go THROUGH our room to get to the bathroom. The doors were loud, tho. Not completely sound proof - I could hear murmured talking on the bedroom side, a child crying on the living room side. Worried me that our neighbors could hear my husband snoring and our kids' tantrums! The “lanai” was really narrow – just the width of the chair! So you had to squish around/step over the chairs. Our girls kept scooting them around…really noisy. Came in handy for drying out towels, swimsuits and shoes, tho.Nice breakfast every morning. Miso soup! Fresh fruit, salad (for breakfast?), scrambled eggs, potatoes o'brien (with peppers and onions) yummy sausage, bacon, and a rotating carb (pancakes, French toast, biscuits with gravy). Made to order omelets (I never bothered to wait for that, and there was only a handful of things to choose from. Looked more like scrambled skillet than an omelet.) Instant oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, granola, bananas, apples, oranges. DELICIOUS and smooth coffee, milk and several fountain juices (my kids loved the Pineapple/Guava/Mango juice). You eat in the indoor/outdoor lanai. Charming sparrows, pretty little island doves, and only a few pigeons darting around, hoping to get something dropped. I liked the birds - they weren't aggressive, never coming too near or landing on occupied tables. Staff bus your plates away.Check In/Out: Very easy. Staff: All staff very friendly. Location: Walk to anywhere! We walked to the Aloha Tower Market Place (GO TO THEIR INTERNATIONAL FOOD COURT FOR LUNCH! Best value you’ll get in Waikiki!), the Hilton Lagoon, the beach (of course, just walk through the Outrigger), you’re right next to Fort DeRussy, tons of shops and restaurants. About 10 minutes to get on the H1 freeway.Secured floors: you have to have your card key to go to your floor and the common amenities floor.Pool: Smaller than it looks on the site – long and narrow, and it only ranges from 3 feet at the shallow end to 4 feet at the “deep” end. So for adults, you can’t really swim. Perfect for small kids, though. Warm and clean, not too heavily chlorinated. Nice hot tub and kiddie pool. Business Center: I used just to check into our flight – 4 computers, a printer, shredder, basic office supplies. Everything I needed except scissors! Manager’s Reception: Only made it once!. The spread wasn’t impressive – the night we went, just pretzels, Goldfish crackers, chips and salsa type of fare. And while I despise a weak drink – my free Mai Tai was WAY too strong! Could have lit a match and spewed fire! I feel conflicted, complaining about a free, too-strong drink, LOL!My only nit is just the hostage parking situation, which I know is the case for all Waikiki hotels. (No public parking lots to park your car so you HAVE to use their parking at $29/day AND they only have Valet parking so you HAVE to use their service AND you’re expected to tip them every coming and going? Even though you have NO OTHER parking choice? (But people can park there during the day for only $9???) And they do have a shuttle, but – not free! $11 per person. Whatever happened to free airport/hotel shuttle service? Nothing’s Free in Waikiki! So was it nice? Definitely. Nice accommodations, service and staff. Would I stay there again? I’m budget conscious, so…perhaps not. But it was a nice splurge. Aloha!","Denver, Colorado",61,4.0

The hotel and rooms itself seemed new and fresh. It was very clean and all updated. The hotel itself was situated next to the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Plaza so you were in the middle of many chain restaurants and high end shopping. There is a starbucks across the street in case the coffee at the hotel is not your cup of tea. This hotel really took the guess work out of everything. Even when waiting for your tour bus, the valet/bell men were always asking around to make sure everyone knew where they needed to be or if they needed any help. The pool was good sized. I can't speak highly enough of having the option of breakfast every morning being included in the price. We strayed from the hotel once to try to get the Hawaiian Spam and Eggs, and it cost us 35 dollars on that one meal. I could not imagine if we had to do that every morning. The breakfast was not just a continental breakfast. You can get your eggs done any way you needed, they had your breads/donuts/bagels, pancakes, french toast, salad, miso soup, fruit, cold cereals etc. It was well worth it. The Happy Hour was even better. For two hours every night you got your choice of drinks and each night was a different type of snack. Chips and Salsa, Chips and Nacho Cheese, Goldfish, Pretzels etc. Just enough snack to get you through before you make your dinner reservation. I am sure this also saved my husband and I in money. Go for the mai tais. The center of Waikiki beach and the International market is about a 10 minute walk away but across the street there is a pathway that will take you to a quiet part of the beach. Renting chairs there is about 30 dollars for half a day which is a bit steep but being a two minute walk from the hotel it was worth it. You can get cheaper chairs if you walk by the Dukes Bar. We ended up taking a cab from the hotel to Diamond Head. I thought it was too far to walk. By walking you can get to the zoo and most attractions, but Diamond Head is a bit of a hike. Its doable but its a hike to get there before you even hike the crater. Tolietries were Natural Botanicals from Crabtree and Evelyn. That was good to have in case you ran out of something and didn't want to use something cheap. Rooms all have a fridge and microwave. That was useful as well.",Chicago,24,5.0

Also included is the manager's cocktail hour from 5:30 to 7:30pm which serves free beer and wine to Embassy guests only. We stayed here using HHonors points so the only charge on our bill was the $30/day valet parking charge. There is really no place to park in Waikiki so valet parking is a must. There are two public walkways to the beach across the street from the Embassy so beach access is easy. We were told that Waikiki beach is a public beach so you can walk from the Hilton Hawaiian Village along the beach side of all the resorts to Duke's statue in the middle and return by the main boulevard past all the shops back to the Embassy. Allow about 2 hours for the round trip if you want to take your time and stop and take pictures. There is a banyan tree at the Westin surrounded by tables. This is a good place to have lunch.

The rooms are not huge but they are comfortable and well appointed. Clean room, nice linens, two TVs, and air conditioning in both the bedroom and living room. The price for the room, given how very close the hotel is to the beach (literally across the street), was really great (ask for a AAA rate if you have a AAA card). The big plus for us is the wonderful breakfast they provide each morning, and when you factor in the money we saved on breakfast, the price is even better. They also do a happy hour each day at 5:30pm with free drinks and snacks, which we loved! The pool is nice, although I wish it had opened earlier than 9am.

They also offer a manager's reception for a couple hours, offering free drinks and snacks (which we did not go to). The location is close to shopping and just above the Yardhouse Restaurant (which has great food). The pool deck is lovely with great service and fabulous lunch and drink options. We were very impressed for the value of this stay and all they included in it. Loved the fact they have a large laundry facility to do any washing and drying you need...very handy when you are travelling. I have attached photos of our two bedroom suite. We opted not to stay in the lower room with the roll in shower as this worked just fine for our situation. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great stay in Waikiki.

We were booked into a room in the Aloha tower. So many good things to mention about this hotel - from check in to check out, the staff were all so friendly and professional. The buffet breakfast was really organized and tidy and we didn't encounter any issues of them running out of food or having to wait too long to get what we wanted. We were able to bring back some simple items (fruit, bagel etc) for us to our room for later and it wasn't an issue at all. It was good to see their GM walking about clearing tables, talking with guests during breakfast as he sets the tone for the rest of the hotel staff and they were all really friendly and helpful. Only minor bump we had was when our room card malfunctioned and it took about 20 minutes for someone to come up and let us in our room (while we were all wet and cold because we had just come back from the pool), but overall a very pleasant and enjoyable stay.",Canada,11,5.0

The hotel was in a prime location in downtown Waikiki, located steps away from the beach, restaurants, and shopping. Our room had a living room, kitchenette (table/chairs, sink, microwave, mini-fridge), and separate bedroom. There was a small patio with chairs that you could get to from both the livingroom and bedroom doors. We opted to not pay the extra price for an ocean view room but we had a decent view of the city skyline. Rooms were clean (although a little worn), and beds were comfy. Staff was very friendly. We took advantage of the free breakfast each morning, which included made to order omelettes, fruits, bagels, muffins, yogurt, bacon, sausage, cereals, and lots more. The food was good, although the menu stayed the same every day. They also had a a Manager’s Reception each evening which included free drinks, snacks and live music most nights. The snacks were pretty minimal – pretzels, tortilla chips and salsa, hot cheese, fish crackers, potato chips, and nuts -- not all at the same time, just a basic mix of the above each evening. Drinks were a couple kinds of draft beer and assorted mixed drinks. We waited in line for one drink, which we tossed out after a couple sips -- husband didn't like the choice of draft beer and I did not like my mixed drink. From then on we just wandered through on our way to dinner and grabbed a handful of pretzel to eat on our journey, or stayed for a few songs from the band. The hotel had a Roy's restaurant which was pretty pricey (but then, everything in Hawaii was). I think there was another restaurant as well, but there were so many other restaurants within walking distance as well as lots of shopping. Pool was a bit small, but we didn't spend much time there. We booked several excursions during our week stay in Waikiki:- Pearl Harbor, USS Missouri, USS Arizona Memorial, and a drive by of the Punchbowl with Polynesian Adventure Tour. I would recommend this tour and company.- Rainforest hike to view a waterfall with Oahu Nature Tours. I would recommend this tour but NOT if you are also visiting the Island of Hawaii. There are much more spectacular waterfalls there for much lest cost to visit. - Starlight Luau at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I chose this luau because of the complaints about the food at most of the other ones. It was just a short walk from our hotel to the 6th floor rooftop of the Hilton. Food was great and LOTS of it to choose from. The show was entertaining. - 6 hour kayak/snorkeling trip with Two-Good Kayaks. This adventure was by far the most memorable. If you book this trip, be sure to request KEVIN as your guide -- he was fun, very knowledgeable, and safety minded. - Hiked to the top of Diamond Head Crater. This was a free excursion for us. We opted to walk to Diamond Head from our hotel which took us about an hour, uphill most of the way. Not sure I would recommend walking from our hotel -- we were pooped by the time we got to our destination, then we still had to climb to the top of the crater which was about 1.6 miles round trip. It took us another hour to climb to the top and back down. Well worth it though.All in all, a decent hotel, but the area is VERY VERY touristy with lots of shopping, restaurants, and hotels. I would recommend this hotel.","Grand Rapids, Michigan",62,4.0

I love this hotel. We were satifisfied with our visit in 2010 that we selected it again.The staff at this hotel is awesome. We loved all the folks that worked the breakfast area. Always checking to see if we needed anything and that included the manager talking to us as well. They are great for ideas on things to do as well.You can't beat the breakfast at this property. It's by far still the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. The made to order omlette's are so good. They give you many choices to add to your omlette. The only downfall we had this visit was our room location. I was travelling on government orders so I knew I wouldn't get a high view room. I did ask and was able to get the 12th floor in the Hula Tower, but it was next to the elevator. We thought about asking for a room change after the first night but enjoyed our view so much we decided to live with it. Luckily it wasn't too bad, but I also use ear plugs. The 3 elevators are very busy.Even though this hotel is not directly on the beach it is close enough and very close to everything else you need.I'm disappointed I have to come back for work again next month and can't get the government rate during that time so I have to stay elsewhere.","The Villages, Florida",45,5.0

Also to see the island on our own time, we rented a White Mustang Convertible and drove down to the Dole Plantation,with the wind blowing in our hair!!!!

My suite was on the 16th floor with a partial ocean view in the Aloha Tower. Check-in was fast and friendly and the cold fruit juice was welcomed after a very long flight. The view from the balcony encompassed everything - to the left was the ocean, in front was another hotel and the skyline, and to the right were the mountains. I had a one-bedroom suite and the suite was large and clean. The mini kitchen was an asset (fridge, microwave, kettle, sink). Making a cup of tea in the suite after a long day of sightseeing was a great benefit. I had a king size bed and although the bed was softer than I normally would like, it was just what the doctor ordered after long and physical sightseeing days. You could hear the traffic noise in the room with the balcony doors closed (I figured this was because the hotels are so close together that the sound has no where to go but up) but it didn’t prevent me from having a good night’s sleep. The breakfast buffet had lots of choices (cereal, the omelette bar, bacon and eggs, pancakes, yogurt, etc.) The only problem I had with it was that the drinks (coffee, tea, milk, juices) were not in the same area as the food. You had to go to where the seating was to get your drinks. It just didn’t flow well in my opinion. The hotel is in an excellent area with lots of shops (high end and not so high end) and restaurants. The beach is a short walk to the left of the hotel. I was so busy sightseeing that I did not get a chance to spend any time on the beach. I did, however, spend a couple of days poolside. The pool is not Olympic size but big enough to swim and cool down. The food and drinks from the Pakini Bar were excellent and I must give a shout out to Michalena (I hope I spelled her name correctly). She was run off her feet the entire week but always had a smile and spent time talking with the guests. Another shout out goes to Keoni at Bell Service. He was very friendly and assisted me with directions on where to get the various modes of transportation I took during my stay (I did not rent a car). The Manager’s Reception was very nice – the drinks cold and tasty and there were snacks available. The staff at the Embassy Suites were always friendly and willing to assist you when needed and they are indeed Embassy Suites’ best asset.I travelled solo and at no time was safety and security an issue.

I stayed there primarily during my business trip, but had my family with me, so enjoyed some of the more ""vacation-y"" elements of the hotel and surrounding area as well. First, the rooms are great. Clean, spacious, well-equipped. It is great to have the second room when traveling with a family. I felt the advantage of the second room outweighed any of the disadvantages of this hotel, but that isn't going to be case for everyone. Second, the breakfast was great each morning and a big bonus. You could stock up an an extra piece of fruit for a snack later on. Only downside to breakfast was the coffee = abysmal. (Note: There was a Starbucks in the Outrigger Reef at the Beach across the street.) The Manager's reception each day was nice if you wanted a free drink, but the snacks were mediocre at best (nacho chips with salsa or cheese sauce), so never a replacement for dinner.The pool was a decent size (for a roof level pool), but it got very crowded and it wasn't the best place to hang out with young children. My 4 year old was easily overrun by adults tossing around a football and teenagers with water guns. The hotel is less than a block to the beach. You walk out of the hotel, cross the street and walk a path between to beachfront hotels to the beach. The walk was 5 minutes.The beach was less crowded and closer than Waikiki Beach, which was nice, but the walk down the path was unpleasant. It was full of hotel employees on their smoke breaks and the first two days, we saw homeless people drinking alcohol. Hard to explain that to the 4 year old.Primarily, I was in Waikiki for business, so I do want to comment on this hotel with a few things related to business travel. First, the rooms are only wired for internet. I traveled with my iPad and was not able to access my work email. I kind of thought that wireless internet was a given these days. It was only available in the lobby, but the connection was weak, so it was hard to connect. I usually just made use of the business centre. Second, parking is only valet. This is common in Waikiki, but pricely - $30 per day + tips. Keep this in mind. Business travelers are probably better served by staying outside of Waikiki, as traffic is busy getting over the Ala Wai canal.",Vancouver,9,4.0

Not a cheap one either - but worth every penny spent.Embassy Suites always has a free breakfast buffet, and this one was no different. Do not forget the fact that this is a busy property with plenty of guests, so you will see a lot a people for breakfast. It is from 6:30 to 10. The food is good (not cold cereal and toast) and hot. Massive dining area called the Grand Lanai. The staff are on the job and all the tables are cleared fairly quickly when someone walks away.The room itself was great. We had a two room suite, and it was spotless and quite. Hawaii is notorious for having paper thin walls in any of the Honolulu rooms. Our room did not seem to follow this claim. However, we did have a room at the end of the hall, and the master bedroom was basically in the corner. I have no idea if the second bedroom heard anything from the other room next to it. Our room was on the same floor as the Grand Lanai, and actually right beside the entrance to it. But we never heard anyone of the hundreds of people going to breakfast each morning.The pool (on the Grand Lanai) was nice, but you should always remember that any family hotel will have tons of kids in the pool, no matter where you go.This was no exception. The rest of the pool area of the Lanai had lots of sun bathing chairs / seating. Also on the Grand Lanai was a bar (the Pakini Bar), and a Massage service. I used both. Both were excellent. The massage was given by a very talented woman who has been licensed for 15 years, but practicing ./ studying since she was 4. The style was Lomi Lomi, which I have had a hybrid of before, and enjoyed here. The bartender was also attentive, but also left you alone to stay on top of his other work. After a few Long Island's you don't care much anyways. It is an open air bar (as is true of many places in Honolulu) but not many people. Most of the customers are parents sitting around the pool watching the kids splash and play.The house keeping staff was very courteous and would stay away if you were in the room at the time they came by. They would always come back later, and you always had a clean room before 3.Check out was a breeze (as is with all Embassy Suites I have ever been to), and we were on our way after the bell staff picked up our baggage (one more then we arrived with :-) ) and the valet had our car brought around.Was it worth it? Yes. Are there cheaper places to stay? Yes. (We could see them all from the the room's own private Lanai.) Is it on the beach? No. The beach is just a block away.",Seattle,2,5.0

The beach that is close to the hotel is crowded, but you can rent anything from chairs, umbrella and boogie boards from the many huts on the beach.

Certainly a fabulous location and we experienced a high standard of service from the staff when checking in at reception, as well as breakfast and particularly the concierge desk who were 'spot on' with their advice on Pearl Harbour. (ie. to do a tour that included the Battleship Missouri memorial)Managers reception was a great feature (no queues when we were there) and we really enjoyed the variety at breakfast, even my husband with coeliac disease at least had some gluten free options. The birds would normally not have bothered us however my poor husband did get ""pooped on"" during breakfast one morning and the children were certainly kept entertained with the staff firing their water pistols at the birds. A unique breakfast experience for our family indeed.Had requested a high floor away from the elevator or stairwell but ended up on the 6th floor fairly close to the elevator. Fortunately there was not a noise issue for us and we all slept really well.Kids loved the pool area and watching the nearby friday night fireworks.

My wife loves the rosemary roasted potatoes and we all devour the best fresh tropical fruit!It's a great location very close to the beach and close to great shopping and amenities (At the beachwalk development and close to Royal Hawaiian Centre).It's more pricey than a lot of other hotels in the area, but well worth the extra money and great value overall. Beig an All-Suite hotel, the rooms are spacious and great for familes with kids (the whole family doesn't want to go to bed at 8:00 PM).

Since I used Hilton hotel points, with going rate of ~$300 a night, we saved roughly $2000 minus $210 for valet parking fee. If I had to pay $300/night certainly I would've picked different hotel, but for what we had, it was a good stay.1. Location: 3 stars Great and not so great. Great for dinning, Waikiki activities, shopping (if you like). Walking distance to pretty much everything we needed. Safe and good ambience location with Beach Walk stores.Very bad for sleeping at night. For two night I was awaken by noise, talking, and music playing from downstair room. My room was right next to linen room but still could hear neighbor very loudly. Stree noise was at times very loud even at 10th floor. Even my deep sleeping kids were disturbed in the early morning by delivery trucks and bus noise and backing beepings.2. Amemnities: 4 stars. Breakfast was a big plus, saved time and money but similiar menu 7 days in a row was getting tired. We didn't use pool. It looked discent but very small. Lanai is small and narrow. Microwave and small fridge worked good.3. Staff: 5 stars. pretty much everyone working there was great especially bell boys and parking staff. Check in clerk upgraded my room from 2nd floor to 10th with a partial view (you really have to put your neck out over the rail of to see a glimpse of the ocean) after I insisted that I didn't want a noisy room.Conclusion: If you want convenicence of Waikiki, breakfast, and suite (with free hilton points), it should be good stay.

I have stayed here three times in the past three years and just love it. It is the only hotel I will stay at when I am in Honolulu.As everyone mentioned, the hotel is in a wonderful location, very close to the beach, shopping, transportation and everything Waikiki has to offer. It is an all suite hotel, so very suitable for family traveling with young kids. The free breakfast and evening happy hour also helps with the cost when staying in Waikiki.However, the best feature of the hotel is its staff members. I have been to plenty hotels. I have stayed at Ritz, Waldorf... But I never felt being treated so family like in any of the other places. I have contact the hotel concerning my reservation before our arrival; Kay Lee from reservation corresponded with me promptly and took care of all my request. Upon checking in, Rita made us felt so welcome with her smile. At breakfast, Russ walked by and stopped to talking to us every time and made suggestion for things to do. During breakfast on our final day there, Aldrin (I hope I spell his name right) came by and gave my daughter small sacks with candies and color books. She was so happy when she got her gifts... One thing I noticed is that all the same staffs are still there through our three visits, that says something about the hotel. I would highly recommend the hotel, especially to families. The only thing I would wish the hotel would do is to add Wi-Fi. Within our family of three, we have 5 devices to access internet, one connection port is not enough. Plus even the hard connection was down half the time we were there. I guess it tries to get us disconnected from daily chores.","Chicago, Illinois",13,5.0

We stayed in a beautiful up-to-date 2 bedroom suite that had wonderful Hawaiian details (love those hula girl lamps). For a family of four whose kids refuse to sleep on a sofa bed anymore, these 2 bedroom suites are a vacation lifesaver since other hotels will never ""guarantee"" connecting rooms. We had two spacious bedrooms, two bathrooms, attractive bar area with sink, microwave, and fridge, a comfortable living room and three flat panel TVs. Our two balconies over looked the pool area on the forth floor. Unfortunately, our view of the ocean was partially blocked by the obnoxiously over-sized Trump hotel next door. The hotel is literally on top of the Waikiki Beachwalk redevelopment of high quality and high priced restaurants and shops. It is a great place to people watch. I laugh at those tourists who come to Oahu to buy unbelievable overpriced items (that you can buy on the mainland), and then hope that others ogle their expensive purchases wrapped in Gucci or Chanel shopping bags. I have never been the person to spend valuable vacation time that I could be spent at the beach or discovering the rich Hawaiian culture and natural wonders, but instead spend hours shopping for items that aren't even from Hawaii. After much people watching, one curious thing I noticed is that people are slimmer here in Oahu than on the other Hawaiian Islands (and definitely the rest of the U.S.), and the reason -- they're not Americans.Regarding dining, Roy's Asian Fusion restaurant on the ground floor is a must. We also enjoyed the beach front Shorebird Restaurant in the Outrigger Reef Hotel that separates the Embassy Suites from the beach. Duke's was also fun but make reservations; we waited 90 min. and didn't eat until after 10pm. DO NOT go to the Oceanarium at the Pacific Beach Hotel which sells itself as a buffet surrounding a gigantic aquarium. We thought it would be fun for the kids, and it's recommend in several travel guides. We refused to stay at a place where the only patrons appeared to get the buffet free with their hotel stay. The place smelled, the patrons were seated like sardines, and the aquarium looked like a gigantic silo. Speaking of food, one reason the Embassy Suites hotel chain is popular with families is the breakfast that is included. This Embassy Suites breakfast was JUST OKAY; there other hotels have much better breakfast. Go for the cool-to-order omelette station--it's the only tasty food available. Otherwise, the juices were watered down, the bread choice limited and sometimes stale, the pre-made scrambled eggs dried tasted rehydrated, the sausage tasteless, and the fruit selection was boring (mind you, Hawaii is a tropical fruit paradise but not at this hotel). I will say the friendly staff could handle the large number of guests and there were plenty of clean tables to dine at. However, get down to breakfast well before the 10am close because right at 10 am, the staff swiftly closed the glass sliding doors, and you can't go back in to get seconds.Overall, the hotel's service was top notch especially valets/bell hops who handled your baggage or auto with very friendly and quick professional service. If you have a question of what to see and how to get there, go to the valets rather than wait at the concierge desk.Stay at this hotel because it is in close proximately to the best attraction that Oahu has to offer and within walking distance to fine restaurants and the famous Waikiki Beach.","San Mateo, California",36,5.0

We were a little nervous after seeing reviews about the noise and traffic on the 4th floor. Our room was in the corner of the building, away from the elevators and pool. We had lanais on 2 sides, one with a gilmpse of the ocean and the other with a glimpse of the mountains. We enjoyed sitting on the lanais and watching the people walking around outside. Our room was quiet. We didn't hear anything from either the pool or elevators or the traffic outside on the streets. The breakfast was great, especially the cook to order omelets. Our room was clean and everything was in good repair. The sheets, mattresses, pillows and towels were comfortable. The one-bedroom suite was roomy enough for our family of 4. On the first day, housekeeping was a little slow to clean our room. We mentioned this to the housekeeper we saw on our floor and this was remedied. We had no other complaints. There seemed to be plenty of room around the pool and breakfast area. We don't go to Hawaii to hang around the gym or shopping, but in passing these looked adequate. A hotel employee went out of her way to help us with shipping a package home. She offered us a box and some bubble wrap from her office when she saw us waiting by the closed UPS store in the hotel. There was a good selection of restaurants nearby. We especially liked Giovanni Pastrami, practically across the street. They have a variety of great $5 happy hour food options such as personal pizzas, onion rings, nachos, etc. These are very good. 1 to 1 1/2 items per person is more than sufficient to make a meal.

However, our room location was the pits - 2nd floor, next to elevator, delivery side. The breakfast cannot be beat for families. With meals averaging $50+, a free breakfast is a huge help to the budget. Very reasonable serving hours also. My husband was on business and it was also great for him to be able to catch a bite early before heading to work, while the daughter and I could take our time. The hotel is located just across the street from the beach (of course, there is a hotel in the way, but you are welcome to either go through the hotel or there is a public, sidewalk entrance). This hotel is super close to the Hale Koa and HHV. Beach chair rentals fairly reasonable ($15+) and include 2 chairs & an umbrella. Get there early and you can get your pick of prime spots, but even a bit later (9:30-10a) there were still front row spots available.Housekeeping was good. Plenty of towels everyday, including beach towels. A very small complaint is that all of there promo photos show a kukei (sp?) nut necklace (lei) on the bed as though it is a welcome gift. There was none for us. Housekeeping does put a little card on the pillow each night describing a local tradition, which was quite lovely, but again I sort of expected the lei.","Albuquerque, New Mexico",7,4.0

Each time we have visited Oahu, we have stayed in a different place (both independent and chain hotels as well as private vacation rentals).This Embassy Suites is like most of its counterparts throughout the chain in that it offers a clean, efficient hotel suite comprising a living area with a pullout couch, sink with bar fridge area and a separate bedroom. Also, like the rest of the members of this chain, this Embassy Suites offers a full breakfast with a cook to order omelette station.The Pluses:- Very convenient location on the Waikiki Beachwalk area with a wide range of restaurants and other tourist amenities- Exceptional free breakfast! Omelette station offers a wide range of fillings: cheese, sausage, bacon, ham, fresh chopped tomato, green pepper, onion, jalapeno peppers and even lomi-lomi salmon (which I found to be overly salty). Other menu items include a range of breads, pastries, bagels, English muffins and pastries/muffins, packaged cereals/oatmeal, a few Japanese friendly choices (Miso soup, rice with seaweed and basic Japanese pickles & condiments), juices, coffee (somewhat watery and of mediocre quality) and tea (basic selection). Although some of the menu items vary (pancakes one day, french toast the next and biscuits & gravy the day after), the core menu items are consistent. For us, with two kids in tow, the breakfast is convenient and probably saves us $50-$60 daily (compared with an equivalent hot breakfast with tax and tip elsewhere).- Clean and efficient- Decent kids swimming pool (no real deep end so not suitable as a lap pool for adults)The Minuses- Not on the beach and minimal views to speak of (at least from our room).- No Wifi in the room (only single plug-in internet in the living area). Lobby wifi does not offer a wide range and tends to be spotty- Generic Embassy Suites interior design (slightly tropical, but nothing to write home about -- at least no major negative surprises)- Efficient room size, but no sense of expansive space (perhaps we have been spoiled buy some exceptional hotel rooms and vacation rentals in the past).- Minor mistake upon check in (we had confirmed a large king sized bed for my wife and I but the first room we were provided only had a double in the bedroom; the timing for the mistake was poor because we had arrived late at night and it was the equivalent of 2 am in our home city so the last thing we wanted to deal with was a delay in getting our kids to bed; we ended up in the right type of room, but on the second floor of the hotel which resulted in some street noise entering our room).All in all, if you want a hotel close to the heart of Waikiki and are travelling with kids, the Embassy Suites is a reasonable choice (and better than average value if you want to have a hot breakfast daily and are travelling with kids in tow) as long as you are aware of the property's limitations.","West Vancouver, Canada",53,4.0

I have to say it is surprisingly good value. The staff are wonderful, the rooms are good. We stayed here twice during Feb-Mar. 4 days before heading to Maui and then 2 days before heading back to Australia. I do have to say with toddlers I did appreciate having the suite - made life so much easier and better - at least it meant that they could sleep and we could still stay up and watch TV. We originally had two doubles in the Hula Tower as my mother-in-law was also staying with us. A double bed doesn't work for me and my partner - we're both too tall... so I slept on the sofa-bed which is surprisingly comfortable for a sofa-bed. Although the Ocean View was well worth it. Our second stay had us in the Aloha Tower right next to the elevator. We considered asking for another room but decided against it as we were only there for the two nights. We were lucky with that room that we did get a partial ocean view but mostly we got a view of the park and the Trump Tower.The breakfasts I thought were ok. Nothing particularly special although it was one of the few buffet breakfasts we encountered that did have cereal. It would be nice to see a bit more variety though. The staff at breakfast were always very helpful though.We went to the managers reception once and yes well... wine & cocktails in plastic cups? Tortilla chips & salsa? I was again expecting something a little different.The pool area is delightful. Our twin girls had hours of fun there. The hotel is centrally located which is a bonus and the staff really are more than prepared to go out of their way to help with directions and assistance.Overall it was a pleasant experience staying here and I would quite happily return if we're ever in Waikiki again.","Arlington, Virginia",25,4.0

In the morning, when i was looking for a something at the breakfast buffet that my wife had asked for and was leaving without finding it, this very kind employee took a look at my anxious face and asked if he could help. He then went out of his way to make sure i found what i was looking for (some specific yogurt) and walked with me with genuine interest in making sure i was satisfied, just as I would be to a guest at my house. His sense of interest was genuine (you can usually see through the superficial attempts at being nice) and his attitude warmed my heart for the day. The concierges were both fantastic with not just recommendations, but follow through with phone calls to confirm my casual question for fresh brewed kona coffee availability in the area (Honolulu coffee co - it was fantastic).Finally, i have to mention Tony at the valet was beyond amazing. He was helpful to a degree that i would have difficulty putting words to express. When we were in a situation and had to leave our rental car at the airport instead of at the rental office, he remembered our rushed family from earlier in the day and made a special personal trip to make sure it was returned to the rental agency. The fact that we felt we could trust him to do that was already a big deal, but his personal follow through and the continued staying in touch as he completed the process was such a reinforcement of basic principles of helping your fellow human beings in distress that it has inspired our family to make sure we pass it forward by going out of our way to make sure we can help others. In short the staff's attitude was inspirational! and we will definitely stay here when we return to Hawaii again (after this experience, who would not want to go back to such lovely people.). Your hotel has done a great job in encouraging this behaviour - this is not something you can train people to do!! Thank you for the lesson in hospitality...","Albany, New York",2,5.0

Checkin was a breeze, we were exhausted and we were welcomed with fresh juice, an upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite and Dean the bellman! We checked in quite late and the staff was still bright and cheerful. Dean was a bright spot with alot of Aloha spirit, he was really professional and went out of his way to make us feel welcome. Our 2 bedroom suite had 2 queens in one bedroom and a King in the other, as well as a sleeper sofa. No view, but we were not staying for more than just one night. The breakfast was wonderful, maybe not the largest selection, but a decent omelette, and nice fresh fruit. The open air, and view of the pool were nice amenities to have during breakfast. I felt like the value of staying at Embassy was worth it even for a quick stay. We will most definitely stay here again, and I won't hesitate to recommend this to my friends and family.","Anchorage, Alaska",10,5.0

Price wise, it is typical of Waikiki rates. The staff were very helpful and friendly. From the bell boys to the front desk for check in , one is made to feel very welcome. We were upgraded to a 2 B suite (the 1B suite that we booked was not available), the rooms were really spacious, the bedding and linen comfortable. Of course the place is not very new, but it's clean. They have a hot breakfast included in our room rate, which was served on the 4th floor dining room. The place is crowded, but if one goes at the right times (6:30-8:00 or 9:30 after) the lines are not as long. The selections are okay, especially since they have the made to order omelets (which I always prefer). But they do not have hot cereal like oatmeal, and cold cereal selection is limited. The buffet has a variety of selections. The only thing I did not really like is the fact that the breakfast dining area is partially open to the outdoors and there are birds flying around, plus on the colder days, it gets pretty windy and chilly at certain seating areas.The location is great, about a block or 2 from the beach, also close to Aloha Landing (at Sheraton Waikiki), where all the tour buses pickup and drop off. And the evening cocktails (complimentary) is always a plus. Also enjoy the lemon water set out in the lobby, after a long day touring and walking around, it is refreshing to be able to drink something cold. There are lots of shops around the vicinity of the hotel, as well as restaurants within walking distance. It is a great place to stay in Waikiki Beach.","Saint Augustine Beach, Florida",93,5.0

The cold juice that everybody was given while you are checking in is a nice touch. We arrived late from the mainland and everybody was tired. So we ended up ordering room service 8 minutes before they closed for the night. The room service order was delivered promptly and again with a smile. The manager's rececption on Saturday night had a live band playing. I have stayed at many Embassy Suites and that was a first! I forgot to pack a razor, called housekeeping and promptly had one delivered one to my room. The breakfest in the morning is great. My only complaint is that some people feed the birds at breakfest, so the birds have become accustomed to sweeping in for the food on the tables. I wish the management could do something about this. We had a late flight back home and needed to use a hospitality room. They only gave us a half an hour for four people to shower and change. And when that time was up they called the room to remind us time was up. With three females in our group that is not very much time!

The cleaning was always done well and on time,the morning breakfast was more than adequate, the evening managers reception a nice way to relax before heading out for dinner.

The staff was fantastic - again. The lady cleaning our room - Josie - was wonderful. She was always cheerful and pleasant, and the room was spotless every day.The breakfasts were also wonderful. Omelets, fresh fruit, bacon, pancakes. It actually saved us money, in that we didn't need to have lunch. The staff there was great too - always smiling and happy to help you out.I booked the room directly on their website, and asked for a room as high as possible, and overlooking the pool. They were able to accomodate us and even upgraded us to an ocean view room. It was beside the elevators and you could hear them, but they didn't bother us. I guess each night we were tired enough from walking and sightseeing that we fell right to sleep.We also took advantage of the Manager's Reception on a few of the nights we were there when a band was playing.

He lied and said that the hotel was full and could not help us. We found out that the hotel was not near full.

It was by far the nicest place we stayed in Hawaii. My husband booked a 1 bedroom suite with the CAA rate ($215). When we arrived, they gave us an upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite because we were on our honeymoon! That was a great surprise - the bedrooms were huge (each with a king bed and ensuite), and we had 2 lanais and a sitting room, plus an entranceway/mini-kitchen. Our 1 year old baby was along for our honeymoon, so the extra space felt very luxurious!The rooms are spotless. They give Crabtree & Evelyn shampoo, etc. which was a treat. Lots of storage to unpack clothing. A tv in each room - not that we watched much with so much to do in Waikiki.Breakfast - included at the hotel, and it was substantial. They have GREAT made-to-order omelettes, and the very friendly omelette man got our toddler a hard-boiled egg when we asked.Manager's reception - it was fun. We went down the nights the band was playing, and hung out in the pool & hot tub. There was a good, lively atmosphere around the eating/pool/bar area, especially when the band was playing. The band was surprisingly good, and played a good variety of songs.Pool - The pool is the perfect temperature. Refreshing, but not too cold. Apparently, many pools in Hawaii aren't heated so that was a treat. There were lots of kids in the pool in the evening, which made our little one very happy. There is a main pool, a kiddie pool (about 1.5 feet deep?) and a hot tub. All were great.Beach - good location. Short walk to beach a block in front of the hotel, but after the first day we walked a few blocks farther, and swim in front of the Royal Hawaiian (we cut through the hotel grounds). It was WAY better for swimming. Beach in front of the Embassy Suites is ROCKY when you go like 5-10 feet into the water. In front of the Royal Hawaiian it is a nice, sandy bottom, and a bigger beach. But you'd have to be crazy to stay at the Royal Hawaiian, when you can have a huge suite at the Embassy Suites, a free breakfast, and enjoy a 5 minute walk to the exact same beach for 1/2 the price.Only negatives (they matter about 0.1%):1. The coffee in the rooms sucked (but then, what hotel room coffee isn't?). BUT - easy fix. My husband got us the best coffees I've had in my life every morning from the Starbucks across the street on the Beach Walk (lattes with a splash of liquid syrup).2. Also, our key card quit working a few times. The front desk thought it was because of being near cell phone, but neither of us own cell phones, so the reason is a mystery.We'll definitely stay here again when in Waikiki. It's great having a bedroom that is separate from the living room, especially when you have kids.",Regina,12,5.0

We have been to Waikiki several times and like the Beachwalk location for its beach access and proximity to restaurants and shops. We are an active couple in our early 60's and were travelling with a family member in their 80's. We had a two bedroom two bathroom unit on the 18th floor. It was an ideal layout - bedrooms and bathrooms at opposte ends of the unit with a shared living / dining area - offering lots of privacy. Our unit was high enough that we had an unexpected view of Diamond Head and the ""Pink Palace."" The kitchen facilities are very limited, as have been described elsehwere. We had not intended on preparing any meals but had anticipated bringing in some meals. However, there were no dishes or utensiles. At best, the kitchen might be suitable for making some snacks. That was the only disappointment, even knowing about the limited kitchen from other reviews. The included breakfast buffet was very good with a great selection of fresh and prepared food. The manager's reception was also good although with less appealing snacks / appetizers than we have previously had in the Seattle and Nashville Embassy Suites. The Precor equipped gym was excellent with a good selection of of cardio and resistance equipment, all in good working order. The pool was very nice with plenty of lounges.

It was perfectly located in the main area of Waikiki near many shops and restaurants, as well as the beach. What more could you want? On top of that, the room was huge and very clean. It was a bonus to have separate rooms for a bedroom and a living area, which made it feel like a home away from home. It's always great to have a microwave and refrigerator, which I took full advantage of to store drinks and snacks. Having breakfast every day was such a perk since many hotels don't include this for free. However, the quality was only OK and there weren't many choices (I don't eat eggs so couldn't take advantage of the cook-to-order omelets). Again, it was free, so I'm not going to make a big deal about it and I was satisfied every morning. It was also another perk to have the manager's reception every evening that provided free alcoholic drinks and a few snacks. I’ve never heard of anything like this being offered at other hotels. The Embassy Suites staff was friendly and very helpful. The hotel also provided a few nice gifts in which to collect you would have to post a pic. of Hawaii on Facebook or turn in a card to the front desk during the 1st 24 hours. These gifts I noticed could've been bought at the gift shop so it saved some money on gifts that you would've purchased. They also provided equipment (limited) for Internet service in the room, but it wasn't the most effective. However, it wasn’t a big deal, and I loved my stay there and hope to return again one day!","Las Vegas, Nevada",19,5.0

We were greated at the front desk with a lovely cold fruit drink - a nice start. Staff were really friendly and helpful inspite of it being a full house on Pro Bowl weekend. We booked a POV room, however on check in I followed the advice of other ""Tripadvisors"" and asked for a room away from the elevators (quiet). We were upgraded to an ocean front suite on the 14th floor Hula Tower - nice! Suite lives up to my expectations from an Embassy Suite - great bed, nice linens, 2 flat screen TV's.Inspite of it being a full house, managers reception and breakfast was well run. Staff were buzzing around doing their jobs well and with smiles. I must say they have a good customer service program from the housekeeping staff, valet, and serving staff - well done!Pool area is on the 4th floor - nice loungers. The area gets sun from about 10:30am. The palm trees offered some filtered shade as a reprieve from the hot sun.We have stayed in at least 10 different hotels in Waikiki over the years and if you can afford it, treat yourself to the Embassy Suites.Location is at the west end of Waikiki, 1 block from the beach and foot steps to too many good restaurants to mention.

I was extremely disappointed with the treatment I received from a member of the front desk staff by the name of Ms. Malia (first name). I arrived at the property 16 January at approximately 1:20pm. I checked in with Malia at the front desk. She advised me my room was not ready.I asked her what type of room did they have for me. Malia advised it was a city view room. I asked if they had an HHonors Gold upgrade to ocean view available. Malia advised they were selling out the last three weeks and no upgrade was available. I asked could I buy an upgrade to ocean view. She advised they had ocean view available for $70/night. I opted not to buy the upgrade because I should receive it complementary, per my HHonors Gold benefits. So, I waited for my room to be ready for occupancy. Malia provided my room key at 3:07pm. Check-in is at 3:00pm. I went to the room on the 14th floor of the Hula Tower only to find a housekeeper's cart blocking the door and the sound of a vacuum coming from the room. I turned, walked back to the lobby and advised Malia that the room was not available because housekeeping was not finished. Malia called the housekeeping staff and advised me to go back to the room because it was ready. By now, it is 3:20pm. I advised Malia to find me a room that was available for occupancy because I just left the 14th floor and know for sure it is not ready. Malia sarcastically asked me if I wanted to speak to the housekeeping staff. I advised her that it is not my job to speak to housekeeping and I need her to find me a room ready for occupancy. At this point, she consulted the manager. He called housekeeping and they advised the room was not ready. Then, he provided me with an ocean view room that was available for occupancy. I have several problems with the above scenario. Within the same conversation, Malia told me no upgrades available but was willing to sell me one for an extra $70/day. The room not ready for occupancy was not available until after the 3:00pm check-in time. The room provided by the manager was also after the 3:00pm check-in time. In addition, I waited 1.5 hours for my room to be ready and they had the upgrade available but refused to honor my HHonors Gold benefit upon check-in.Malia challenged my first hand knowledge that the room was not available by telling me to turn around and go back to a room not ready for occupancy. To add insult to injury,she sarcastically asked if I wanted to speak to housekeeping which is clearly not my job and inappropriate. This incident affected my entire stay at The Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk. I was flabergasted regarding the lack of customer service notwithstanding that I have Gold status with Hilton. The suite had a tv in each room. One remote control was missing. I called the front desk and they had maintenance to deliver a remote within a reasonable time span. In addition, the housekeeping staff knocked on my door twice disregarding the do not disburb sign. Plus, they called me. The second time they knocked on my door was after the phone call where I advised them that I did not want service that day (17 January). The hotel is in a prominent location. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. However, I will select one of Hilton's numerous competitors for my next visit to Honolulu.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",32,2.0

We really enjoyed all the details placed in the service at this hotel, from the tropical glass of juice welcoming us at check in, to the colorful cards placed on our beds every night giving us cultural information on Hawaii -- great for kids to collect and take home. The staff was always willing to accommodate us in every way. We weren't crazy about the pillows, so when we asked if they had any other pillows they gave us three different options! The manager's reception is a great way to relax and get a free snack and drink if you have been out all day sight-seeing. They had great musicians playing during this time. The pool is right there so kids can get an evening swim while the music plays. The hotel couldn't be more centrally located - a block from the beach and close to many inexpensive restaurants and shopping. You can't get a better value, especially for a family.

Was nice not to have to go somewhere else for breakfast and to relax by the pool in the evenings. The hotel is located within walking distance to the beach and many restaurants/shops.... We rented a car and took it out several times. I would recommend not renting a car for your stay since you pay $30 extra to park and if you only go out a few times, it is worth it just to rent as you go... There are trolleys and lots of buses there to get around. The Concierge desk there was very helpful with our stay there. The only complaint I have is that when we checked out at 5:15 am, the young man who brought our rental did not even bother to help us load our luggage. The only thing he did was stick his hand out for a tip . When we arrived we got lots of help and every time we took our car out, my husband gave a tip.My husband has been a loyal Hilton customer for 24 years and this was one of the reasons why we stayed there since we were celebrating our Birthdays and 40th Anniversary......I hope that our next stay will end on a better note...","Edmond, Oklahoma",2,4.0

It also came highly recommended by a friend of ours, who traveled to Oahu with her two children several months ago.The hotel did not disappoint in any way. First of all, the check in was a wonderful way to start our Hawaiian vacation. We were given an exuberant aloha and alcohol free mixed drinks. The room itself was very clean, and it was cleaned thoroughly for almost every day of our stay. We did skip the cleaning one day when the maid service was so late in coming that we couldn't put off our children's naps any longer. The next day the maid service came much earlier, and did for the rest of the stay.The morning breakfast buffet is incredible. The omelet station offers almost any combination of ingredients a person can desire, including Lomi Salmon. NOTE: Lomi salmon is not the salmon preparation mainlanders are used to. It tastes VERY different, and the chefs will let you try a small sample before you have it used in an omelet. Do take them up on this if you have never tried it before.There was one small moment of crisis during our last breakfast morning when the Passion Orange Guava juice ran out. There were definitely riot conditions present, but the hotel handled the situation quickly and professionally, dispatching someone to put the machine to rights before anyone started to suffer juice withdrawals. It was impressive.The Manager's Reception was a lot of fun for both adults and children. Our younger kids were able to swim and completely tire out before bedtime, while my husband and I could enjoy ourselves with the complimentary drinks. The live band was fun to listen to, playing a Hawaiian take on various popular songs. The highlight was definitely the Hawaiian version of Cee-Lo's Forget You.

Our family of five had plenty of room and we could not fault the hotel. We had been given rooms close to the lifts on both of our stays and were not impacted by ringing lift bells. We had tossed up the idea of an ocean view room but you don't spend enough time in your room to justify the extra.

We immediately asked for a room change and were refused (despite HHonors gold status). We eventually talked to quite a few people at the desk (and the manager) and learned that ""95%"" of the king rooms share walls with the elevators. I finally gave up on sleep at 4AM with all the clunking of the elevator going up and the shaft, the chimes are at least turned off between 11PM and 7AM. So, do not expect a quiet king bedroom. The queen sized room we were moved to faced the Trump tower and we had near constant beeping from their garage (warning pedestrians of cars). For the heart of Waikiki, this isn't awful on the noise front, but it is certainly not quiet.Our experience with staff was that everyone was fantastic, except for the front desk. The desk staff did not seem to feel it necessary to apologize for mistake after mistake (which included having the wrong check out date, us catching it and even double checking with them on the day in question, only to find ourselves locked out that evening). Valets were quick and helpful, bell hops wanted to help every way possible, breakfast staff great, and housekeeping wonderful.There are two towers with approximately 11 suites per floor in each. Elevators require key cards to operate, which is good for security but problematic for efficiency as people hold doors on floors while they look for their keys or when the elevator ends up going the opposite direction the people wanted because they didn't find their key card in time. Aloha tower has two elevators which are small and horribly slow. 5-10 minute waits from the 12th floor were not uncommon. Hula tower has slightly larger elevators (which means fewer delays for people rearranging to fit in) and three elevators for guest use. So, if you have a choice, go for the Hula tower.Rooms were sparkling clean and housekeeping staff really wonderfully friendlyThe breakfast was interesting, the Hawaiian take on the standard Embassy Suite experience. This included some nice additions like being open 3.5 hours instead of the typical 3. Seating is outdoors, so if you have a bird phobia, plan on carrying your tray back to your room. Also, in case of rain, the more limited under cover seating will lead to crowding, however, on most days there was an abundance of seating choice (unlike most Embassy Suites). There is a huge Japanese clientele and so breakfast has a few alterations for them: omlette choices are self serve to select toppings (reduces language issues), miso soup and a salad bar are offered, and you should expect to be joined at your table often despite many wholly unoccupied tables being available. I was not surprised to find rice at a Hawaiian breakfast, however I was surprised that island fruits were rarely on offer during our 10 day stay. Also missing are any whole grain options (muffins, bread, etc.) so a grocery run may be in order if you are attached to any of those items. With a microwave and fridge in the suite, there is flexibility on storing and preparing one's own food. The manager's reception had amazing selection on alcoholic beverages (mai tais, blue hawaiis, red and white sangria, etc) but pathetic options on food (tortillas without salsa and goldfish crackers were the typical offerings. Sometimes pretzels or peanuts were added to those constants. Nothing fresh.).  The hotel is a block to the water, so to get to the beach you need to go through the Outrigger hotel across the street, or along one of the public access walkways to either side of the Outrigger. There is very little sand left in front of the Outrigger, and it gets used for tourist sail boat landings, so it's not a great place to set up for a day on the beach. Fort DeRussy is next door which does have a long wide expanse of sand, however, it is treated as a city park, so there are quite a few homeless people for those to whom such things make a difference. A longer walk takes you to the Hilton Hawaiian Village where there are all the services (bar, restaurants, beach rentals, etc.) that people may expect from a Waikiki vacation.Do check for parades-- this corner of Waikiki will get totally blocked in by parades, and for the long ones, like the Honolulu Festival in early March, you may not be able to get in or get out for many hours.There is wi-fi only in public spaces, so be sure to bring an ethernet compatible device if you want in room internet. Also, there is only one connection per room unless you bring your own splitter (we found one at WalMart on Keeamouku street for $25). Beach towels are something else you may want to purchase yourself-- the hotel provided ones are tiny and they only give one per person. Also tiny are the balconies-- ours was under 2 feet by 8 feet. There was no way to use it for sitting outside. Other rooms had more reasonably proportioned balconies; ask if this is important to you.But, the location puts it in easy walking distance of the Friday fireworks at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, restaurants are plentiful at the doorstep, the pool is wonderfully warm (unusual in Honolulu in my experience) and the staff (other than front desk) is fantastic.

We were not disappointed - if anything we found this a better hotel this time around. The true heart of this Embassy lies with it's people. Every staff member we met offered warm, outstanding service from check in to check out. However we must make special note of Johnny and Keoni on the bell desk as well as Dennis at the Pakini Bar. These guys truly offered outstanding customer service - going that extra mile to assist with any queries. If Hilton runs an ""employee of the month"" program, these guys deserve to win.Our first six nights were spent in a two bedroom suite as for this period we had another friend travelling with us as well as our fourteen year old son. The suite was spacious and wonderfully clean. The king size bed was more comfortable than that at home! Our only gripe was that as it faced out onto Lewers Street and the night clubs next to PF Changs the Friday night was exceptionally noisy. However, this only bothered us on the one occasion. The two bedroom suite was actionally a one bedroom with a connecting door leading through into another bedroom/bathroom. This was ideal as it meant at night we could close a door from both sides and have our own privacy.Our second five nights were spent in a one bedroom suite. All I can say is Room 1209 was the perfect room. We looked out over the pool area with a fantastic ocean view and the room was wonderfully quiet and dark. The housekeeping staff at Embassy do a great job - everything was spotless and their daily services were timed to minimise disruption.The daily breakfast always provided plenty of variety , from fresh fruit, ceral and yoghurt to scrambled eggs, bacon, waffles, pancakes and made to order omelettes. Having the cooked breakfast was a great start to every morning and meant we never had to eat again until early evening. The evening Managers reception also provided great value with free cocktails, beer and wine. However, we did find that, although the band provided excellent entertainment, after being there for more than a few days the repetition of the same sets night after night did become tiring.Once again the proximity of this Embassy to the beach, the extras provided (breakfast, Managers reception), excellent pool and spa area and most importantly wonderful customer service makes this hotel excellent value.

Over the past couple years, these properties have been getting rather old and tired. We booked this Embassy for the location, family advantages mentioned above, and because I stay at Hilton brand properties throughout the year for work (HHonors Points). We were pleasantly surprised to find this is one of the rare NEW Embassy properties with excellent amenities. Pool, buffet, Managers Reception with entertainment, beds, bathroom, location, and views are all outstanding. Mini fridge, sink and microwave are your kitchenette items. The only things to be careful of is the concierge desk and parking. The concierge is run by ""Expedia"" so all of your general questions are opportunities to sell you an ""excusion"" or tour. Parking is $30 per day, but then you need to remember they want a $5 tip each time they retrieve and park your car. One trip per day is now $40. If your just planning on remaining within the Waikiki area with a couple of excursions, most of them will pick up/drop off at your hotel for an extra $20 pp. Nevertheless, we loved this hotel for our family of four, and if we return to Waikiki, we'll definitely stay here again!","Allen, Texas",12,5.0

The personnel at the Bell Stand were so helpful and friendly that we wrote a letter of commendation to the manager. As in all Embassy Suites, the free breakfast is excellent, and the Manager's Reception each evening is fun. It is always nice to have free drinks.

The Embassy Suites catered really well for my young family. The free buffet breakfast was a real standout every morning. Especially the friendly and efficient staff. Yes, other people have complained about the queues out the door and not having enough seating. However, you do have to understand that this is peak season and maybe waking up a little bit earlier might help also! We are a family of 6 and everywhere we go is always a struggle for us to sit. So we make sure we are a bit more organized in getting to certain places. Overall, we loved the food on offer...well most of it and we just appreciated having this free breakfast every morning!The location of the hotel was excellent. It wasn't in the centre of all the action, but very close by. It was just enough to not be caught up in the madness of Waikiki, but very accessible to get to the shops, restaurants, bus etc... The beach is around the corner and there is a pool on location which catered well for both young and old. The 'Manager's Reception' during the evening was fantastic. If you love a free cocktail drink or two this would suit you well. Or if you just like free entertainment and snacks on offer like we did, this too would impress you! The band was really entertaining and played really good music to suit all tastes. A real plus for them!!Our overall stay at Embassy Suites was fantastic! We loved Hawaii and staying here made it more so relaxing and enjoyable. It may not have the full amenities of a 4/5 star hotel which others have complained about.

Don't stay in the rooms close to the pool/breakfast area these would be extremely noisy as breakfast starts early and privacy would be an issue.

Our time at the Embaassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk was amazing.From the valet, to the pool attendants . . . the front desk staff . . . everyone was wonderful.When we checked in the valet took care of everything and directed us to the front desk, where we all (kids included) were given a special Hawaiian drink, and the check-in process was a breeze.We checked in late, but were able to get there before the traditional Embassy Suites evening reception (snacks and drinks) outside by the pool. It was better than any other Embassy Suites I've been too . . . same food and drinks served, but the atmosphere, the music, and the tropical air made it even more memorable.Adding to the fun, was that on Friday nights, the Hilton Resort has a fireworks show. They can be viewed from the ocean side of the roof by the pool area. Very fun bonus for the kids.They also had a Hawaiian band playing each night, with a group of wonderful adult and child dancers who did hula.Then of course there is the always wonderful Embassy breakfast buffet . . . . This Embassy Suites had it down. Food was great, plates cleared from tables quickly, and just being able to eat breakfast outside and enjoy the fresh Hawaiian pinapple, mango, and guava . . . it was close to heaven.The pool was huge and in excellent condition. The pool had depths for all ages, and pool-side eats and beverages available. On top of all of this, for a family of five, the suite size was generous as always, with enough beds for everyone. Beds were confortable and even with the Waikiki location, the night was quite.If there had to be a downside to this Embassy Suites, it would be the location. It is not ""on the beach"" . . . it is across the street from the beach, with another hotel blocking it's view of the beach. It has no private beach access or shore front. It isn't too far from a public access point, and it isn't difficult to make your way between the hotels that are beach front to find a spot, but if you are only going to Waikiki for the beach, there would probably be better hotels for you. I think the Embassy Suites does rent beach equipment/chairs, etc . . . but we opted to just bring our beach towels down.

Breakfast was excellent. All you can eat and we were encouraged to take fruit and yoghurt for later on in the day. The chefs made conversation with you and cooked your breakfast how ever you liked.

Although we were only there for 2 days, we were blown away by the amazingly generous staff. Our flight home was at 11:30pm but we had to check out around lunch time that day. The bellboy, Johnny was a tremendous help. He stored our luggage for us and told us of things we could do to fill in the time. He told us that if we were back by a certain time he would also take us up to the restaurant and we could watch the fireworks too. By the time we came to leave for the airport, he had gotten each of our kids a packet of M&M's and wished us safe travels. Because of Johnny our last day was made truly memorable and we will definitely be back soon. Our rooms were extremely comfortable and spacious. Quite and relaxing too. Location is very convenient - walking distance to the beach and a mall. Good food but we were also able to walk to other places to eat. Overall even though it was a short stay, we would without a doubt stay there again :)",Hamilton,5,5.0

Wow, after spending $5500 for 1 week, I found the daily happy hour to be less then appetizing! Drinks were ok, but actually no to little food during happy hour. That hotel can do better then that and in fact several guests commented that the hotel used to have a great spread during happy hour. I have stayed at many Embassy Suites in the United States and have found the happy hour to be wuite good, what a disappointment! The hotel is conveniently located near shopping and restaurants and very quite at night. I was there to attend a wedding, (not at that hotel) otherwise I would not have gone to Hawaii. I don't think I will stay there in the future as there are other hotels that are less expensive in the same area that are just as good.","Santa Clara, California",3,4.0

We arrived at 7:30PM. Upon arriving to the hotel by taxi from the airport, we noticed that the check in process was done outdoors. What a great way to greet guests. My husband and I were treated to a small glass of juice, I think it was pineapple and grapefruit. Delicious! The check in staff person was cheerful. We felt very welcomed. Our room was on the 18th floor facing Diamond Head. The room was very clean. The bedroom had two double beds along with a pullout couch in the living room. The cleaning staff was friendly and efficient. We enjoyed our two balconies, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. The only downside was road noise while the doors were open. When the doors were closed, only a slight bit of road noise could be noticed, but nothing that would keep us up at night. Breakfast was what we come to expect from any Embassy Suites we have visited-excellent! There was cook to order eggs, plenty of fruit (lots of pineapple), sausage, rice, miso soup, salad, etc. No complaints here. The hotel is within walking distance of the beach, maybe a block or so away. There are several restaurants located around the hotel along with plenty of shopping. We used the trolley and bus systems to get around Waikiki and other locations around the island. A great way to see the island without renting a car.  Speaking of renting a car, we did rent a car for a day from the Dollar Car Rental a mile from the hotel. The Embassy Suites conceirge warned us upon arrival that if we rent a car, do not leave any belongings in the car. We unfortunately did not heed that warning. BEWARE... if you rent a car and stop along Highway 72 for sightseeing, rethink that decision or if you do, do not leave ANYTHING in plain or limited sight. Take it with you when you exit your car. Our car was broken into and items were taken from the car within the five minutes we were 200 feet away from the car. From talking to the police and locals, smash and grabs from cars along this route is routine. Short of that unpleasant experience, we would definitely stay at this hotel again. The staff is excellent, the hotel is beautiful and the location is great for getting around Waikiki.","Edwardsville, Illinois",4,5.0

This was a great use of points. I contacted the hotel ahead of time with a couple of requests and they were honored. We were given a corner room in the Hula Tower on the 5th floor. We loved this location. We had 2 balconies, a view of the ocean and one floor down to the pool, hot tub, breakfast area and happy hour area.We arrived on a Monday around 3pm Checked right in. The beach is just across the street. We enjoyed the location. It is an easy walk down toward the zoo or toward the Hilton Hawaiian Villiage in the other direction. We enjoyed the free happy hour from 5:30-7:30. Bartenders were very friendly. Snacks were mostly just salty munchies. On Tuesday and Thursday night there was a live band that was quite good. On those 2 nights there were a few more options for happy hour snacks but it was still pretty limited. The free drinks were good and you could get pretty much anything you want.The pool was nice, just the right temperature. The hot tub was nice too. Open till 10pm. It was never very crowded while we were there.We were able to get extra towels from the maid to bring with us on our day trip.The room was very comfortable. The bedroom had 2 double beds and the pull out sofa was actually very comfortable to sleep on. We had a small fridge in the room and 2 TV's but I dont think we ever turned them on.the free breakfast was awesome. I don;t know how anyone could complain about this. Lots of variety and everything was good. Eggs cooked to order, pancakes, french toast or waffels,bacon, sausage, plenty of fruit, yogurt, pastries ect. The juice was really good. We gave a couple dollars to the coffee server and he was so appreciative, ditto to the nice lady who cleaned up around the food at happy hour.All of the staff at the hotel were very f.We did not use the valet parking. We rented a car one day from Thrifty about a five minute walk away.There are tons of places nearby to eat. The ABC store is right across the street. We got some lunch one day at the pool. The food was good but fairly pricey as it usually is at a hotel eatery. We had our own drinks at the pool and noone commented on that.Overall, I would revisit here in a heartbeat. It was very clean and the location was awesome. It did not matter that we were not right on the ocean. it is close. Having the 2 rooms for the four of us was great.

The room itself was fine and had a nice big bathroom. The second sink outside the bath was very helpful to us. The room was clean and the staff was uniformly exceptional. The hotel's location was great for us since we weren't looking to hit the beach here. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance.I agree with others here that the breakfast is top-notch. Lots of choices: fresh fruit, bacon/sausage, eggs (incl omelets made to order), several juice choices, cereal, yogurt. Was nice to eat outside in the balmy weather...now if we could just keep the pigeons away!Wish I'd seen the note about self-parking near the Trump. $30/day is pretty steep for parking.I also have an issue with an extra person charge starting at the 3rd person in a suite that has 3 beds (incl sleeper sofa). The whole reason we got a suite was so we could each have our own bed. It seems a bit of a money grab not to allow that. I mean, does it *really* cost $60/day to serve one more breakfast and clean one more set of linens?The hotel also desperately needs wi-fi in the rooms. Granted the description promised only high speed internet but without wi-fi my friend's non-3G tablet was useless except in the common areas.Do pick up one of the coupon books available at the reception desk.

Really good people. Room was kind of a modified suite with one room being very small and had a strange shape. We were disappointed in that and they got us another room that fit our needs (and reservations) better. Still, it was not the Embassy Suites I have been used to seeing after traveling extensively around the USA - the kitchen was a joke! A tiny minifridge with a microwave and a coffee maker? C'mon, that is not a suite or half kitchen in any way. So, that was dissapointing as we planned to buy some groceries and make some snacks and drinks in the room but we just couldn't with this basic hotel room arrangement. Really, you can get a minifridge and microwave in a Holiday Inn Express or Best Western.The room was nicely furnished and very clean, bathroom was very nice as well.But the breakfast was the real deal here. It is very good. Great assortment and lots of hot and cold selections for everybody. Fresh cooked omelettes cooked to your liking with any ingredients you would like and other hot food and fresh fruit, vegetables, etc. Really quite good.Now for location. While it is basically half a block or maybe a block to the beach, this is the worst part of the beach in Waikiki. Can't really go into the beach here unless you plan on swimming out in the deeper water. Guess that is why nobody is in the water at this part of the beach, and there really is no room for sunning here either - quite a walk to either the Hilton beach or back to the main part of Waikiki beach in front of the big Pink hotel (Royal Hawaiian). Rocks everywhere making walking in the water rather treacherous.Overall a very nice hotel but the walk to the real beach is quite deceiving. If you are in it for the comfortable rooms (but not real suite), good service and fabulous breakfast then this is the place for you - but not for the location being close to the beach. I think for the price they charge (even when discounted) there are much better choices where you can even get a half or full kitchen.","Seattle, Washington",35,4.0

Each stay was on an HHonors reward reservation. As an HHonors Gold, I have visited my fair share of Hilton family properties across the USA. Let me explain why I feel this is the best Embassy Suites you'll find:- The service is top notch. Everyone, from the servers at breakfast, to the housekeeping staff, to the folks manning the evening reception, were all extremely friendly. The spirit of aloha is truly alive here. Outrigger runs this hotel under the Embassy Suites brand - so unlike the majority of Hilton properties they actually take customer service seriously :).- The rooms themselves are excellent. I was comped an upgrade to a larger room on my most recent visit this past September after I submitted a request. The 2BR/2 bath suites are spacious and our suite was the perfect size for everyone traveling along - including 3 patio doors opening up to 2 different lanais!- The morning breakfast and evening manager's reception were both excellent (and as mentioned above, the staff manning these events was exceptional). I guess if I had to find something to ""complain"" about, it'd be that I wish there would be hot food at the evening reception. But honestly, I was fine with the chips, goldfish, and pretzels to accompany my complimentary mai tai's and blue hawaiians! The breakfast is vastly superior to most Embassy Suties breakfasts you'll find, and blows away the standard Hampton breakfast. You'll find a rotating starch (pancakes, french toast, etc) in addition to the standard eggs, pineapple & other assorted fruit, sausage, bacon, omelettes, and full compliment of pastries and cereal. POG juice is available as well.- Everything is very well maintained - saw several people painting railings and they had contractors replacing the carpet in the common areas of each floor. Granted, the hotel is relatively new (2007), but it's good to know that they are serious about upkeep.- The location is right in the heart of Waikiki. Other than maybe the main Outrigger hotel, or the Sheraton, you will not find a better location. The mall is right across Lewers St, allowing you to gawk at the people dropping thousands of dollars on coach bags and rolex watches. Tons of dining options within walking distance... though the best restaurant on Waikiki (IMO), Roy's, is located in the Beachwalk complex right next to the Hula Tower's elevators. And since you are in Waikiki, you will see at least 3 different ABC stores from any exit to the hotel!- My only real complaint is the parking, which is $30/day, valet only. Expensive, even for Waikiki standards. The upside is that rentals at HNL are dirt cheap ($8/day on hotwire for mine), so the overall price isn't obscene. And yeah, you will want a car, because any trip to Oahu isn't complete without at least a day or two visiting Kailua Beach Park or the north shore beaches!To sum it up, you can't go wrong selecting this hotel for your vacation. I would not hesitate to give it my highest recommendation.","Woodinville, Washington",38,5.0

Well this location is about a half block (if even that) off of the beach, but it has a free buffet breakfast in the morning with the freshest pineapple every morning and also a wide variety of breakfast items. Oh did I say that was included.... also they have a free happy hour every day with beer and mai-tai’s along with some minor food. The room I have had both times here has looked over the beach area and also onto the pool area. Some of the sunsets I have had have been spectacular and have made the experience even better! Also located on the property to compliment the hotel is Roy’s restaurant that has great food to complete your day. And if you want more casual then you can walk down the street to one of many location places. However, my favorite is Duke’s that has a wonderful bar that is just feet away from the ocean and a view of Diamond Head. Just as a sticker shock issue, parking at this hotel and others in the Waikiki area is not cheap. Here it is now $30 a day valet, but it is as many in and out as you want. If you don’t plan on driving around the island then just get a shuttle or taxi to the hotel! ALOHA….. and enjoy!!","Pueblo, Colorado",25,5.0

My in-laws stayed at Outrigger Reef which was also literally across the street from Embassy. Location wise everything worked out fabulously for us.My mom has to watch her diet and eats frequent small meals so having a fridge and microwave was extremely important. The sitting room was nice so when my bro stayed up late to watch tv/ surf web, he was not disturbing my parents. My parents were happy with the free breakfast and manager's reception.

View from the balcony was awesome, we could see a lot of water. Asking for a high floor will get you great views, it looked like the lower floors may have their views blocked by other hotels. The breakfast was very good, they had food fit for eastern and western tastes (Omelets / Miso Soup, and lots more). Seating for the breakfast is all outdoors, and most of it is covered. The free happy hour (5:30 - 7:30) was also pretty good. Unlimited free drinks, not including the tip jars for the bartenders, and snack food.

Was allowed to check out the room on the Aloha tower which was great, 20th floor facing Diamond Head and Waikiki beach. Chose the original room. Baggage was brought to our room. The entire staff was very friendly. Free breakfast buffets every morning were what you would expect at an Embassy, good but not incredible. The highlight is the made to order omelettes which were incredible. The manager's reception was great for adults as they served great drinks that were not watered down. The snacks were pretzels, peanuts, carrots and celery with ranch, and chips with either salsa or cheese dip.

There was also a separate area with sink, fridge and microwave but you need to take your own cups, plates, cutlery, etc. The views were not great but that's because the suites are located a block back from the sea but that did mean that the lovely beach was only a 5 minute stroll away. The location was great at night as, being part of the Beach Walk complex, the suites had everything you need 'on the doorstep' such as a good choice of restaurants, shops and bars (we like the Yard House with its huge variety of ales and other beverages!). Reception staff were friendly and accommodating and we were lucky to receive one of the suites ready on arrival at 07.30 after our overnight flight from Nevada. The complimentary breakfast at the Embassy Suites was very much appreciated and really good - omelettes were made to order and very delicious - since returning from there, I now eat my omelettes with jalapenos in! Other items were plentiful and substantial. The Manager's Cocktail Party each evening was amazing, drinks were full strength and plentiful. The nightly entertainment was ok but we were a little disappointed that we did not see tradtional hula dancers there but we saw a good free hula show along the seafront about 25 minutes walk from the Embassy Suites. The pool at the Embassy Suites is on the small side but this was not a problem to us considering the wonderful ocean just a short stroll away ideal for snorkelling and viewing an array of tropical fish. The nearest beach was picturesque even though a little narrow especially at high tide but if you turn right and walk 5 minutes in the opposite direction of Diamond Head, the beach becomes wider and the beach bars sell food and drinks cheaper than those nearer Waikiki centre. Our favourite beach bar was 'Barefoot Bar' with cocktails for around $7 and chicken and chips around $5, not forgetting the mega ice creams for around $2. Had lots of excellent food and drink in Waikiki but the place with the most amazing evening atmosphere for us was the Shore Bird Restaurant on the beach just across the road and down the path from the Embassy Suites. There you can sit listening to the waves lapping on the shore whilst enjoying good food and drink, watching the changing colours on Waikiki Beach as the sun sets and Diamond Head becomes a mere silhouette in the night - amazing place - we hope to be back very soon. People were welcoming and friendly, had some great days out - Pearl Harbour, Big Island by air, climbed Diamond Head (fantastic views - will do that again!), Honolulu Zoo (always wanted to see a Komodo Dragon), Waterpark, Submarine experience, Catamaran Evening cruise.

I have never felt the need to post our review of the property, but upon reading a few recent semi-negative comments, I feel I must post our review.We have stayed at this property 5 times over the past 4 years (beginning 2008) and we are anxiously awaiting our next visit. :) We have researched other properties in Waikiki, just to see what they have to offer. Obviously, after 5 visits, we have ultimately decided that Embassy Waikiki was the best choice for us :) This hotel is so awesome and we have so many friends that work at the Embassy. This hotel is very loyal to their staff, and we are greatful for that. I don't even know where to begin to tell you how wonderful Embassy Waikiki is, and I probably will not do it the justice it deserves in my review. I guess I will spend a few minutes disputing some of the negative comments We think the Lobby is great: Granted, it is not your ""traditional Grand Hotel Lobby"". It is a small lobby, and yes, there are cars coming & going for drop off/pick up. But, we find this type of lobby comforting. This lobby does not have your typical ""tourist"" coming through walking around and/or shopping. There is no need for people to walk through our lobby, all the stores and restaraunts are immediately outside the lobby. We have walked through many hotel lobbies in Waikiki and we find it comforting to know that the only people walking through the lobby of our hotel are guests of the hotel. The elevators are not that slow....come on give me a break. We always stay on the 21st floor. If slow elevators were a problem, we would not choose the 21st floor. Besides, your on vacation, your not suppose to be in a rush....spend some time chatting with your elevator buddies...it's fun. :) ...it's the ALOHA spirit, it makes people smile and makes everyone happy :) Rooms are awesome, very spacious. Housekeeping staff is wonderful , very attentive, and very friendly. :)Breakfast is fun. Yes, there are birds. If you choose to eat outside, of course there are gong to be birds. The birds are great...watching the birds makes breakfast a fun way to start the morning. We thoroughly enjoy watching the birds in the morning :)Pool area and Pakini Bar are awesome. You can get shade and sun at the pool area...which is great if your husband prefers the shade and you prefer the sun :) Pakini Bar has a very nice view and an awesome tradewind breeze. You can also find alot of good conversation there, if you choose to.Managers Reception is great :) Keola, George, Dennis, & Lacey make you feel like you are at home with friends and family. They are awesome and we look forward to seeing them again :) There is a family band that plays two times a week during the Managers Reception. They play ""old type rock music"". They are a GREAT band, and their musical skills are VERY impressive. There is also a fantastic dance show. I think it is 1 night a week. That is also a really good time. The little kids that perform are so much fun to watch. :) These little kids are SO proud of their performance. It's great to see :)Location of the hotel is awesome. You can walk to shops, restaraunts, bars, various beaches, the zoo, the aquarium. If you want to do further sight seeing take the bus or do a tour bus.We have never experienced excessive noise in our room. Granted, if you are an extremely light sleeper, like me, you may have difficulty sleeping and every single noise you hear may wake you. But overall, that stuff happens at home also. I have never found ""night noise"" to be a major problem while staying at Embassy Waikiki. And who cares if it does happen....aren't we in Hawaii to Hang Loose and Chill out ?????.....)We LOVE Oahu and we love the EMBASSY SUITES and their STAFF. If you choose to stay with them, we hope you find the ALOHA SPIRIT while you are there :) Mahalo for reading my longgggggg review :)","Newport, Rhode Island",8,5.0

The staff here have been phenomenally nice and helpful. The best part are the rooms. This is by far the cleanest hotel room I have ever had in many years of travel. The bathroom was immaculate, the furnishings all in excellent condition and the bed was devine. Had one of the best Embassy Suites breakfasts here - a chef making omelets who was entertaining and knew how to cook one without overcooking it. The location is right across the street from Waikiki Beach and multiple restaurants within this short block including Ruth's Chris, P.F. Chiangs, Subway, Roys, Cheeseburgers, Giovanni's and Hard Rock Cafe (to just name a few).I'm so very happy I chose this hotel and I would highly recommend it. (There were some complaints here about it being smaller than most Embassy Suites and I suppose it may be a bit smaller but you're in Hawaii. How much time are you really in the room?

It is expensive to eat out in Hawaii. The hotel food is excellent! From the buffet breakfast to the poolside menu.

Being a Hhonors member does not really get you any special consideration. I am a gold member and if I was upgraded, it was not stated so I am not sure. What I am sure about is my request for a higher floor was honored. Our room in the Aloha tower on the 16th. floor had a nice view over the city and a tiny view of the ocean if you made a hard left look from the balcony. No real complaints with the exception of proximity to the elevator. My request to be away from the elevator was not honored. The room was right next to the elevators. They are noisy at night when the staff uses the service elevator in the very early a.m. It does wake you up if you are a normal to light sleeper. We could have requested to be moved but did not as we were already settled in. Just be aware that if given a room adjacent to the elevators to ask to be moved if you are a light sleeper before you settle in the room. This Embassy Suites is managed not by Hilton, but by Outrigger management group. Perhaps that is why there is no fanfare for Hhonors members. Being a Gold member gets you very little to zero in the way of perks. As I said. Usually I am given a pretty good room upgrade when breakfast is included or at the Hilton's we get a free breakfast. Maybe being on the 16th floor with a good city view is an upgrade, I am not sure. Being right next to the elevator is not.I emailed the reservations desk twice to ask that I be on a higher floor and not near the elevator. I even offered to pay for the difference for the best view and upgrade if available but I never got a response back. The breakfast and breakfast staff were great. They really do perform. The omlette chef is very busy and deserves special recognition. He will make your eggs or omlette to order. The people who walk around bussing tables and filling coffe cups are very friendly and do a great job. The managers reception is nothing special. A very limited drink menu with low shelp liquor and bud and michelob as beer choices. I was disappointed they didn't have hawaiin beer as there are many and one choice of local beer would be nice.The wine was not drinkable and tasted like screw cap variety. The guys who work the bar expect you to tip them and just do their job. They don't put out the positive vibe that most the other staff do. This was mediocre at best, but then most of the Embassy receptions are. The pool is small but works. There are lots of lounge chairs but very few in any kind of shade for that option. The location can't be beat. Being between Lewer's and Beachwalk make it convinient to many shops, restaurants and the ABC stores. It's a short walk to the beach. It just seems to me that things have changed since I was last in Waikiki two years ago. There seemed to be a larger contingent of homeless types from the Mainland lurking around the beach area between the Outrigger Reef and Fort DeRussy. They use thepublic bathrooms as their primary bathroom for bathing, etc and take up a lot of the shaded seating daily. Don't expect toilet paper in those bathrooms or paper towels to dry with after washing your hands. This seemed to be the area where they hang out as opposed to the beach area in front of the Royal Hawaiian or the Sheraton. The city authorities seem to tolerate them much like San Franciso does theirs.All in all I love Waikiki and if I had to pay for the room, the Embassy would still be a very good value.",calif,79,4.0

It is not on the beach but access is not hard either (just a quick walk out to access point or through the Outrigger). We walked around in the area and felt comfortable at all times. The ABC stores are everywhere to buy your missed items or bottled water or souvenirs so no issues on that. If you care for Hard Rock or Dennys, both are a quick walk nearby. Very cute Italian restaurant, Aaroncino (bit pricey) also close.Now to the hotel itself. The suite style rooms are comfortable to spread out in and we had the mini fridge which helped too. There have to be very few rooms that have any noteworthy views due to the angle of the hotel. We actually used points for our stay and got rewarded with the view of a parking lot rooftop and some ugly buildings (think it was the Hula Tower). We insisted that at the number of points for our stay that we had used (earned by loyalty to the Hilton brand) that we be moved at least to the main tower - the Aloha Tower. We had another mediocre view of the front side and tall buildings but a couple of palm trees to at least lessen the disappointment. So suffice it to say we didn't go out on patio for much. Also, there was a lot of street noise that did travel up but to be expected in such a bustling area. It did not interfere with sleeping. We liked that the bathroom had 2 entries - one through hallway of suite and one through the bedroom (made it easier to circle in and out getting ready). The manager's reception had chips/dip, hummus/bread, pretzels, goldfish crackers, chex mix, chips/salsa. We also enjoyed non-alcoholic mai-tais, soft drinks. There was also live musical entertainment with a hula dance to get you in the Hawaiian spirit, but it was every other night. Breakfast buffet was busy every morning but great for us - choice of just about every morning meal type option. Very clean food service area relative to other hotels we've stayed at and you have your choice to eat enclosed or out in the open portion of the terrace.Overall, we think the service was standard ES, maybe a bit less. There is a $30 per night parking charge for forced valet parking so count the tips each and every time you need your car brought around. The elevators were a bit slow with some waits required, not really a big deal but annoying when carrying beach items.Bottom line, nice enough and ""economical"" relative to the other area choices for a family of four to stay at, but beware you get no special consideration for HH points usage or status. If we return to Waikiki, we'd choose to be more center of action around the Hyatt or Westin since we think those properties also seemed nicer.",Mid-atlantic State,10,4.0

The breakfast buffet had standard Embassy Suites items (omelet bar, pastries, etc.) as well as some Asian choices, including miso, rice, pickled vegetables, and salad. The pineapple and papaya were ripe and delicious. We enjoyed Mai Tais and Blue Hawaiis at the nightly cocktail hour, and took advantage of Happy Hour food specials at nearby restaurants like Yard House, PF Changs, and Wolfgang's. The hotel is right next to a mall and there were lots of choices for dining and shopping. A military museum is across the street and a short walk away, with beach access directly behind it.

I must say, my recent vacation fell a little short of my expectations overall. I was overly shocked when we were placed on the second floor next to the busiest street ever!! Especially after I called numerous times to ensure we would not get stuck with a low floor due to our late plane arrival. All of my efforts to call ahead and pre-plan did not matter a bit. The cigarette smoke that floated up to our 2nd floor room was endless, so we could not leave your balcony door opened to experience the sights and sounds peacefully. After the first night of noisy torture I decided to put my anger aside and try to enjoy our highly anticipated and very costly vacation that I spent months planning. Having the property feed my family every morning and supply my husband and I with endless nightly cocktails sort of took the disappointment away. The overall nightly environment of the properties location was also a plus. I suppose if you stay in the Waikiki area you should expect noise and congestion. My lesson learned is that a vacation is what you make it, and if you spend your time complaining about the small stuff you miss out on the lifelong memories. As I begin planning our Hawaiian vacation for next year, unfortunately the Embassy Suites will not be on my list of possible properties. Which is very diappointing for me because I have been a loyal customer for years?P.S. Room assignments seem to be a luck of the draw. Maybe the front desk staff should make an effort to read the request that customers take the time to submit before assigning rooms. Maybe that would prevent them from losing loyal customers. The breakfast buffet staff were the shining stars of this property. They actually made an effort to give a good vacation experience. Mahalo","Seattle, Washington",8,3.0

You can drive right by this place and easily miss it. The property seemed dated and the room furnishings were plain at best. Nothing terrible, but definitely NOT anywhere near a ""resort"" property. Views were trashy since the area around the hotel in dumpy. Long walk to the beach to fight the masses there. We had a 2 room suite that was NOT worth anywhere near the money. Checked out of this depressing place after one night and went to the Kahala Resort which was absolutely amazing. Cost a few $$ more but worth every penny. First class resort with gorgeous uncrowded beaches.

Customer service was good, but inaccurate. We had to get our keys made three times before we had a full set that worked.Room was fine, but I was cheap and got the ""city view"". Turns out we were only one floor up from the street. We had to turn the a/c fan on high just to drown out the evening street noise, and all of the truck deliveries at 6 a.m. still woke us up.Cars are all parked by valet for $30 a night extra. No choice, and can't access your car yourself.On the plus side, the breakfast is excellent, and they actually have an open bar manager's special in the early evening. Hotel is one block from the beach, with a beachfront park just a half-block over.So that food doesn't have to cost you an arm and a leg, there's a convenience store right across the street, and a shopping mall and food court down the block.If we go back to Oahu, we won't be staying in Waikiki at all.

We have two young children, so we needed a place that was a suite, and as I was booking a bit late, all the oceanfront sites were gone (or were $800+/night!). For about $350/night we got a ""partial ocean view"" suite that was 100% ocean view out of the main window. The suite was small, granted, but it was two separate rooms. The staff immediately brought up a travel crib and my older child slept on the pull out in the main room. I liked that the bathroom was off the bedroom, rather than the sitting room, so we could use the bathroom at night and not wake the kids. There was terrace access from both rooms - terrace is TEENY, and not for those who are afraid of heights, but we could see ocean, the city lights, and the hills behind us from ours.Best thing I think was the full breakfast every morning - and I mean FULL. Omelet bar, yogurt bar, hot food, cold food, whatever you could think of. And they clearly cater to an Asian/Japanese clientele as well with miso soup and rice available in the buffet. We really enjoyed that the breakfast started at 6:30 which was key for my early risers. The manager's reception in the evening was worthwhile, with free drinks and generally live music of some type - my children liked the hula dancing exhibition. The pool was nicer than expected - felt more ""secluded"" than a rooftop pool generally does - although quite cold given that it does not get alot of direct sunlight. Has a nice shallow section that is perfect for non-swimmers.It's about 2 blocks from the beach and was an easy walk with two toddlers (I was a little concerned about that as the reviews had that it was anywhere from 1-5 blocks). Within walking distance of Duke's and several other fun restaurants, as well as shopping right outside your door, if that's your interest.The staff was so pleasant and helpful with only one mildly annoying exception. I would also echo others' comments about the elevators - they are SLOW during peak hours (mid-morning and early evening).I was really happy with our stay and would stay here again.","Arlington, Virginia",2,4.0

Although the location is good for a non-ocean front property, it is very disappointing. The rooms are suites, but they fell claustrophobic. The ceilings are low and the layouts are copped up. The decor is quite dated. The WiFi for the room is something you have to rent and setup yourself...really? The TVs are tiny. Not that I need a TV in Hawaii, but the screen on my laptop is bigger. The bathroom is small and motel like. I normally enjoy foregoing the air conditioning in Hawaii to enjoy the plentiful trade breezes, but the orientation of the hotel and nestled among other taller buildings hampers this small 'green' luxury. The pool is a generous size with good views on the 4th floor, but it is neither quiet nor relaxing. This hotel definitely caters to the crowd, so anyone looking for a sanctuary in Waikiki should look elsewhere. The parking is valet only with a large loading/unloading area which is nice...though location on one-way side street can be a little tricky especially considering there is only one way in for a hotel bounded by three streets. The lobby area is okay, but could use some presence and better flow as the main entry/circulation point to a large hotel. Last gripe...the elevators are very slow. Believe it or not, but each tower of 21+ floors is serviced by only two. An additional third elevator is service only. Not to leave this review on a totally negative note, there is a free drink given at check-in, free cocktails during the manager reception every evening on the pool level, and a hot breakfast with the room rate...yes, eggs! Of the Hilton properties in Waikiki, I would rate this above the one Kuhio, but below the Doubletree and Hilton Hawaiian Village.","San Francisco, California",5,1.0

We found the staff quite hospitable and couldn't wait to help with the little touches (extra towels and coffee) that help make a long stay with kids more enjoyable. We remembered several of them at the front desk, bell desk and pool, so that was nice and comforting.The highlights for us included: incredible breakfast, spacious suite, wonderful managers reception, a clean and everything in great condition gym, easy walk to the beach, surrounded by ABC convenience stores and an all-around relaxing atmosphere. A few tips we learned from our second stay:- VIP Car Rental (literally across the street from the lobby) has cars for $50/day - just walk-up, no reservation needed, opens at 7A. However, the cars have 100-150K miles! they are old, so expect to trade convenience and value for a junker. (Who cares for one day trip to Hanauma Bay. - There is a Coco Cover (large convenience store) about 10 minute walk (N on Lewers, turn R on Kalakaua, opposite side of the street) with a huge assortment of prepared foods and a salad bar (much larger and fresher assortment than the ABC stores) so you can save on a dinner or two buying them here.- If you've departing on a red-eye and don't want to miss the beach on your last (forget a late check-out, occupancy is to high) consider spending a little more to reserve your room one extra night. This way you can spend the day at the beach, return whenever, shower and pack at your leisure then cab to the airport 10:30P, etc. A much better solution then ""checking your bags at 11A"" and wondering what to do the next 12 hours.Finally, the highest compliment I can give the property is that my family plans to return for a third stay, next summer.",Tucson,42,5.0

Everything went smoothly which was nice after our long flight. The bellhop was very helpful and showed us around the room. We were in The Hula tower on the 8th floor facing Lewers St. We could see the water in the distance on the right. The sitting area was spacious for our family of four. Our 8 and 6year old enjoyed watching tv in that area. A small dining set was where my husband set up his laptop. No wi-fi, but high speed wired connection in room. It was reliable in the room, especially after calling the 1-800 number to set-up. There was no clear instructions on how to do it. Getting a connection in the breakfast area was touch and go on some days. We didn't mind the cafeteria style buffet breakfast. Loved the made to order egg station. I felt it was an added value considering the restaurant prices in Waikiki. We had very good maid service. Once time weren't given enough pool towels. This was quickly remedied by calling maid service and within a matter of minutes voila towels. There is no pool towel service and you are responsible for your own towels. It was easy enough to take towels to the pool and bring back to the room. They were promptly changed the next day. The pool was nice but small sized. It suited the need of our kids. There was a toodler area and a hot tub. On the first day one of the staff gave the kids an inflatable innertube and a foam board to use in the pool. We rented a car for two days and did end up valet parking it for $30 bucks for one night. There is a nice gift shop in the hotel and an ABC shop just across the street. Also an Expedia expert desk who helped us with some directions . They can also book tours for any island. The hotel was just minutes walk to Waikiki beach and the International Market. We enjoyed the nightly Manager's Reception. Right at 5 pm there was a line up for drinks but that quickly cleared. Snacks were ok. Loved the band who played a few times a week. They sang all sorts of music; retro 70 and 80's music, Hawaiian and even had a little hula performance. The best part of the room was the kitchenette. We would find that the mini fridge and microwave was great for leftovers from the sometimes huge restaurant meals that the kids or ourselves found difficult to finish. Also there were days when we were tired from the days activities and just got take out to eat in the room. Overall Embassy Suites was a great place for our family needs. The two queen beds were fine, the room was great for relaxing after a long day of sightseeing or enjoying the beaches. The pool proved to be a great for our young kids. The breakfast was filling.

Mostly had a view of the Trump hotel next door, and overlooked the Embassy Suites pool/patio area. Not sure I'd upgrade if I stayed there again... wasn't really worth it.The 2 small balconies were pretty small. Would have been nice to have had just one long one versus two short ones. But on the PRO side, they were still nice to sit out on day and night.Beach in front of Outrigger (closest beach access) was tiny. And crowded. Nice view of Diamondhead, but this alone might be reason enough not to stay here, unless you are willing to walk much further down the beach to find a less-crowded spot. We visited many popular beaches while in HI (Lanikai, Pipeline, Hale Koa) and this was by far the least enjoyable.Pool was VERY crowded most of the day. Morning just after opening was about the only good time to go.

Right across the street from hotels that are on the beach - very close to beach. There are shops and restaurants all around the Embassy Suites. One day, we saw a hula show right outside the hotel - it was lovely. Yes it is in a busy area and even though we were on the top floor (great view), I could still hear the buses and trucks outside. This was not too bothersome at night as the activity slows down. Anyway, this kind of noise does not bother some people. For early morning, if you are a late sleeper and if bringing a loud masking sound device such as a small turbo fan or sound machine, and wearing earplugs works for you, then stay here. With those two items, I was able to sleep well. Beds were very comfortable. Lobby is open air and shares space with the drive up. So, cars, taxis, and vans drive in and out all day. Tour buses pull up in the street right along the side. The lobby space is nice but would not be a place to just sit and relax and look at a view. Check in was quick and they give you a glass of tropical fruit drink to enjoy during the process. They also keep cold, fruit-infused, water available in the lobby. There is a person manning an activites desk to help you book activities and also to give general information about the area. Breakfast was nice each morning in an open air space with many birds flying/hopping around and trying to pick up crumbs. No waffles, but they serve pancakes every other day. They also offer omelets and fried or scrambled eggs every day. Happy hour is good if you drink alcohol but the snacks were things such as pretzels, goldfish, potato chips with onion dip. Not much to talk about there. Pool is nice but a little small, crowded and not what you would call a ""resort pool."" Hot tub but was good but crowded like the pool. Laundry facility was nice to be able to use and only a tad pricey. The Hula tower is closer to the beach and has the best views. The ground flood of this tower, where the elevators stop, is open to the public (not closed in) but you have to have a card key to get off at any floor so that provides security. Right around the corner from these elevators is a Coco Cove convenience store which we frequented for such things as milk, snacks, etc. Very handy. All in all, we would stay here again and really enjoyed the beautiful view and excellent location.","Dallas, TX",9,4.0

We sourced this hotel as we wanted suites/apt style accomodation so we had the space without having to book three rooms so we bookd a one bedroom suite and a two bedroom suite. On arrival we all received a lovely refreshing fruit punch drink. The checkin process was efficient. Even though checkin time wasn't until 3pm, both of our suites were made available straight away (12noon) which was great after our overnight flight in. The happy hour /managers reception each day was great. Compliementary drinks including spirits and snacks was always a great way to get together after a busy day shopping or relaxing day on the beach or by the pool before heading out to dinner. Some nights they had entertainment to which was enjoyable and added to the atmosphere. Lots of good shopping and restaurants close by, and not too far to main street shopping. Beach was only a short walk one block. Every was very handy including the shuttle bus landing at the Sheraton to pick up tour buses. The buffet style breakfast each day was great - lots to choose from, including fresh made omelettes to order. Beds were very comfy. Only down side was that my husbands and my room was right next to the lifts so it was noisy until about 11pm with lift traffic, and then again in the mornings from about 7am so it was hard to sleep in if you wanted to.","Melbourne, Australia",16,4.0

The rooms were clean, always well kept, and big enough for everyone to stay and still feel comfortable. Everyone had more than enough room to go move around. It came with complimentary breakfast and a manager's reception. The breakfast had a very diverse menu and even an omlette station. the fruits were always fresh, and the meats, eggs, and other breakfast items were very delicious. the manager's reception was just as good. Lots of variety in the snack department, and plenty of drink for everyone.

Lots of restaurants for all budgets, lots of shops on Beachwalk and more shopping malls within easy walking distance. If you want great seafood, go to Roys on site - expensive but food is absolutely wonderful (try the special pineapple martini for a kick). For steaks, go to Ruths Chris on site. Only problem we had was they put us in a handicap accessible room on first night with full-size beds across from elevators, not the queen -size beds away from elevators that I reserved/requested months before our visit. Moved us on second day to room with queen size beds (but still across hall from elevators) - fine from then on. Also, parking is valet only at $30/day. Understandable in crowded city location. Just think about NOT renting car for entire stay. Everything you need is right by hotel and you could rent car for one day to do the tourist stuff if you don't want to take cabs or buses (Arizona Memorial and Battleship Missouri are must sees). Valets and porters are uniformly friendly and attentive - reflects well on hotel. We ate at the daily breakfast - excellent. We didn't use pool or attend the manager's later afternoon get-together, but it looked okay in passing (long lines for the free drinks, though).

It is good to see a familiar face.This year we stayed on the 5th floor right next to the elevator and it was nerve wrecking hearing the ""ding"" every time the elevator was called , every time it reached its destination, and every time it was on level 4 which is the floor you get off to go to breakfast, swim and managers reception. The best floor is 4th floor but not next to the elevator. You hear the actual mechanics of the elevator going up and down. The location can not be beat.

We're not used to 5 star treatment like a Conrad or a Ritz Carlton or something, but this Embassy Suites has great people and facilities and felt like a 5 star to us.Positives-Clean (met my wife's standards)-Our room had ocean view on between Outrigger Reef Hotel and Trump Hotel. Beautiful-Accepted Hilton hhonors points-Free breakfast with 3 1/2 hour window to eat. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, miso soup, rice, cereal, breads, cook to order omelettes, fruit, etc. I don't know how anyone could complain about this. It does get busy between 9-10am but we ate early.-Nightly snack reception. Long line for alcohol, but snacks and soft drinks fast and easy with decent entertainment some nights-Every person we interacted with was courteous and polite. This doesn't happen without good management and being a decent place to work.-Check in was sit down and have a glass of pineapple juice. Set the relaxed mood from the beginning-Concierge service found us a rental car a few blocks away when nothing was available online. We didn't need a car for most of the days, but went to the north shore a couple of days. Decided last second. Also Hertz across the street at Outrigger Reef hotel but rental desk closes really early and late dropoff is only available for their guests-Valet parking team hustles to get your car-Cab from airport about $35, most things were in walking distance so we only rented a car a couple of days-Reasonable oceanside lunch at the Shorebird across the street in the Outrigger Reef hotel. Beachwalk shopping on Lewer st. behind the hotel has many food options. -Ocean and Beach across the street has public access through Fort DeRussy park and is great. Not as busy as Kuhio beach like you see as waikiki beach on TV, but you can walk down the beach if you prefer packed beaches.-On hhonors points, it was a great deal for 3-4 years of saving up points. Even at full price for a family of four the huge morning breakfast and evening snack offset some of the cost.-Overall, the people here helped made it our best vacation everVery minor negatives-Weak wireless internet in room, service kept dropping or blocking access (better downstairs on 4th floor reception lanai). The also had a business center with a printer I used to print our return boarding passes, but had to wait quite a while on teens checking facebook (not hotel's fault) and the computers are very slow-Parking is $30 per day which seemed kind of high to me, but it is Hawaii I guess (contributed to us not having a car all the time, but we didn't really need one)This was close enough to the busy places, but far enough away to seem quieter.

The welcoming reception staff offered fruit juices upon arrival which was very welcome after a long overnight flight. We did not have to wait to get into our room even though it was earlier that check-in time. The wonderful Greg who unloaded our bags from the airport shuttle, waited while we booked in and then took us and our bags to our room, delivering each bag to its preferred location. He was a refreshing change from the norm and a delight. The service in this hotel is beyond all expectations, from the friendly bar staff to the housekeeping. The rooms are well maintained and the hotel clean and well appointed. It is located in the best area too with terrific shops just downstairs which rival the huge shopping complex nearby. The beach is just a short stroll away and this is good because it is far too crowded around the hotels there. It was a great hotel for families and the consierge desk was very helpful too with trips and activities. I cannot fault this hotel but if I had to pick one thing, I would suggest they consider having a kids club.

Originally we worked with AAA for a place to stay and they indicated that all hotels for our family would require two bedrooms since I had three young children. However since they are ages 11, 8 and 4, I had a hard time believing this and so I started calling hotels on my own and the Embassy Suites said that I could book a one bedroom that had two queen beds with a pull out sofa which would accomodate our needs and would immediately save $1,000-$1,500 vesus what the travel agent was telling us, so it became a no brainer to do the work myself and book the Embassy suites.In comparing hotels to book with one bedroom sutes, I knowingly booked this hotel with the $30 per day parking rate because I knew that on a total cost basis it was still a better comparative rate with those with free parking. I believe that across the street there was a local car rental place so if you want you can probably rent a car when needed. But if you plan on staying only in the Waikiki beach walk area, then you don't need a car and the main areas of shopping and the beach are all within walkable distance or you can easily take a cab or trolley. We were able to get a room on the 11th floor with an ocean view and it looks like each room has a balcony, which my children enjoyed eating snacks on while relaxing. The internet is free if you bring a computer as we did, but nonetheless they have a business center with internet access which is open 24 hours a day, and printing capabilities that is included for guests so this is terrific for those that don't want to carry a computer. The exercise room has several machines and free weights so anybody can get a good work out in this facility, and the laundry room is a great added convenience. Since we were there for one week, when we used it on Friday is wasn't a problem getting a washing machine but it was more busier during the week. The only downside that I saw was that the sleeper sofa isn't as comfortable as a bed, but with the three children I have slept in many sofa sleepers on vacations and it is no worse than most.The housekeeping was excellent as they cleaned out room well and provided us with plenty of towels. The breakfasts are a great time saver and added value, and the they try to vary the menu somewhat between pancakes, french toast, biscuits and gravy, etc. each day in addition to the standard eggs, bacon, sausage, fruits,etc. that they have every day too. In addition, for the daily evening reception the snacks are just items like goldfish, chips and crackers, and it is always since to get drinks for only a tip, but on a few nights during the week they provided musical entertainment during the reception and the folks that we watched were quite entertaining.Plus the service of the folks we met at the front desk, employees in the eating areas and walking through the halls were all very friendly and helpful. Overall I have stayed at many hotels during my life which has included some quite fancy ones, but for family value this has been the best place that we have stayed at and the Embassy Suites in Waikiki deserves a great rating, and so whenever we go back to Waikiki this will be the place that we will want to stay at.","Dublin, California",7,5.0

The breakfast is excellent with many choices, including a cooked-to-order omelet guy who will also happily cook eggs in any style if you don't want the omelet. For the size of the hotel, we never had to wait long for the breakfast line or happy hour line in the evening. I was happy that the bartenders poured a true drink and did not try to skimp on the alcohol. Everyone at the hotel had a smile on their face and were happy to serve. We opted to not have our room cleaned each day and the maid was still happy to give us extra towels or anything else we needed. As for our room, we had a 1-bedroom suite with a huge balcony that was nice to use in the evening while enjoying a drink and the views. We also took advantage of the fridge and were happy to see that it actually kept our drinks cold! We've been to many hotels where they don't work, so having one that works is always positive. The pool and hot tub were also very nice. Location is wonderful - short walk to a few beaches and many restaurants and shops. No matter what side of the hotel you are on, there is likely an ABC Store within 30 yards.

I don't know of a better compliment for a hotel than that. It's so nice knowing you don't have to worry about anything!","Orizaba, Mexico",14,5.0

My travelling party consisted of two adults and a toddler and there was plenty of room for the three of us and our luggage. We received excellent service upon arriving at the Embassy. We hired a vehicle and as soon as we arrived, the porters assisted us with our luggage and directed us to the check in counter. Our room was not available at the time and our luggage was stored until the room became available, which was after 3pm. Valet parking is very efficient and the valets extremely courteous and helpful. Parking costs $30 a day.The room itself was spacious enough for two adults and a toddler. We received an excellent room on the tenth floor which offered views of the pool and Waikiki beach. The room was dark and quiet in the evening. The floor plan consists of a separate bedroom, which we had two queen sized beds and was spacious enough for us to store our luggage. The bathroom was also spacious, providing enough room for two adults to move around. The living area consisted of a sofa, TV, small table with four chairs as well as a small refrigerator, microwave and small sink. Free wifi is also available and was mostly reliable.The location of the Embassy is perfect to all amenities and a short walk to Waikiki beach. It is also well located to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre which is approximately 20-25 minutes brisk walk or you can catch the bus along Kalia Road. Complimentary breakfast is a hot and cold buffet and provides a variety of choices including eggs to order including omelettes, miso soup and a variety of yoghurts and danishes. The assistants are extremely helpful and often will walk around topping up coffee etc. In the evening a ‘Managers Drinks’ is held from 5:30 – 7:30 pm where free drinks and snacks are available including cocktails and spirits. We certainly believe we got value for our money when we stayed and the Embassy Suites and if we are to return to Honolulu, we would definitely return to the Embassy.",Australia,85,5.0

Our suite was a living room and bedroom and was beautifully furnished and immaculate. Each room had a flat screen TV and there was a game console. There was free wireless internet in our room and we also had occasion to use the business centre, which was very well equipped. which was. We live in Canada and we had complimentary long distance phone calls home (up to 30 minutes....not sure if this is each day or each stay). The bathroom amenities are from Crabtree and Evelyn - nice touch there. A tiny kitchenette has a small fridge and microwave and coffee maker with excellent coffee - not the standard swill! The housekeeping staff were pleasant and gracious and kind. They actually cared if you were happy with your room. The bed was king-size and probably one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Our room had a small lanai - not spacious, but outfitted with comfortable chairs and small tables and we have a partial view of the ocean on one side and the city/mountains on the other. Our room, on the 14th floor, was in an excellent location as we experienced no street noise at night or early in the morning.Each morning the complimentary breakfast was served on the 4th floor - near the pool, and offered just about anything you could desire for breakfast and it was fresh and delicious and the choices were numerous and the staff so accommodating. It was also open from 7-10 a.m.; so good for early risers and those who like to sleep in. In the evening there is also a manager's reception that offers music (on some nights); complimentary snacks and drinks. Very pleasant. The pool/hot tub area is surrounded by beautiful palm trees and there is a bar where you can order food/drink and the area is kept spotless. One thing I noticed is that many people came down to swim without towels thinking they would get them near the pool as you do in many hotels. But this hotel has the pool towels on a bottom shelf in the bathroom and there is a note in the room info book that if you do not return the towels to the room, you will be charged for each towel missing. We saw many towels left at the pool and wondered if these guests did not realize they would be charged for these towels and if they received an unexpected charge on their account. There is an activities desk and we found the staff most helpful and very interested in helping you get the excursions you wanted and gave excellent advice on different transportation options. Their knowledge was invaluable. The hotel is very close to the beach. There is a small walk-way just across the street from the hotel (we had to ask where it was - it isn't obvious at first) that will take you right to the beach in three minutes. The hotel is located on the Beach Walk area of Waikiki where there are great shops and restaurants and the whole area has a fun and vibrant feeling to it. It also felt safe, which was important to me as a woman travelling with a young granddaughter.","Victoria, Canada",17,5.0

We have stayed at the embassy several times in different locations. Some better than others. From the moment we arrived from the bellman to the valet parkers, housekeeping staff and the servers at the breakfast buffett every person were wonderful to us. . We felt very catered to and the hotel itself is very nice clean and felt upscale. We loved that it is on one of the main streets. A very short walk to the beach and every room has a balcony to look and sit out on. We took walks every morning while it was still dark as the time change for us is three hrs behind and we felt very safe and enjoyed our morning walks. Location is excellent for taxis, city bus and shuttles everywhere for two dollars one way. About three blocks from the international marketplace and the walk is very close. There are alot of restaurants close by, yard house, dennys, pf changs , Ruth's cris is there as well, And Roy's is in the hotel.

It was a bit annoying, but as we’d not paid for the extra day we had half expected that to happen. The staff took our luggage and stored it for us, so we could go off and explore the local area. They also gave us a key card in case we wanted to access the pool area during that time. When we eventually checked in we went to our 2 room suite, with 2 balconies, on the 18th floor, with partial ocean views. Mostly though, it looked over the apartments opposite us and the rooftops of surrounding buildings. The bedroom had 2 queen beds, plenty of spare pillows, lots of space to unpack and hang our clothes and a TV. The other room had another TV, dining table (where the PC internet access point was) , couch (which folded out to a bed if you needed it) and an arm chair. In the entrance area was a sink, small bench, small fridge, coffee machine, microwave oven and ice bucket. The coffee, tea, sugar, long life milk and disposable cups were replenished daily. (There were no plates or cutlery in the room for our use though which I thought a bit odd) The bathroom had a shower over a small bath, a toilet and a vanity plus the usual toiletries which were provided daily. There were also plenty of bath and pool towels stored in here. Breakfast in the mornings was always busy and sometimes there was a wait for food to be refilled or the plates to be replenished. Only once did we struggle to find a table to sit at. It was the usual cooked fare plus an omelette/egg station. There were also breads and bakery items, cereals, fresh fruits, juices and coffee & tea. Some of the food even changed daily. The evening drinks and snacks were usually quite busy too. We only ventured there twice as were usually still out and about at that time. On one of the occasions we met a gentleman who worked there (I’m thinking from memory, he was the manager of the area?) and he sat with us a while and gave us a wealth of information on things to see & do plus places to eat. He even went off and got us bus routes and timetable printouts. His help was much appreciated . Location wise, it was perfect. When we booked via the net, I was worried it was going to be too far away from the main strip of Waikiki, but once there we realised everything is close and within walking distance. On Lewers Street, which is where the entrance to the tower our suite was in, there were lots of places to eat, plus a Subway and best of all a large ABC store where you could pick up most bits and pieces you might need during your stay (eg: food, toiletries, drinks, souvenirs, etc…) And, the beach was pretty much just across the road and either thru the Outrigger Hotel or down a little pathway next to that. Also, if you exit via the main entrance on Beachwalk Street, there is a cheap car hire place just opposite, which we used and found good value. If you want to save the $30.00 per night to park in the hotel, you can use the post office car park in the next street, by Fort DeRussy Park for $5.00. We enjoyed our stay at the Embassy Suites, and would love to return someday soon.","Perth, Australia",122,4.0

Cleanliness standards were very good and the beds are comfortable. The curtains are very effective in black-out mode. The air-con is good. The free internet access is okay but there is no wifi in the rooms.A big factor in selecting this hotel was the complimentary breakfast and the evening cocktail reception. The breakfast is more than adequate but not very exciting after a few days. There are some good healthy options and the fruit was excellent. The made-to-order omelettes were fine.The evening manager's reception was pretty good too. The standard of wine and cocktails was very good indeed. The snacks are just chips, pretzels and salsa. Often there is free entertainment too. The regular Hawaiian band is pretty damn good and there is also some traditional dancing.The hotel pool is very good - especially for smaller kids. Cleanliness was excellent. There was no problem with overcrowding while I was there.On the down side, the room service menu is very limited and the one meal we ordered was very ordinary. However, the hotel is located immediately above some excellent restaurants - so you don't have to walk far to get a quality meal.I've been to about 5 reasonably priced hotels in the Waikiki area and this is the one I will come back to.","Sydney, Australia",59,5.0

I considered almost every other hotel in the area and chose ES because of the location and the extras they provide. I am sure there were other hotels in the area that were fancier and that were directly on the beach, but there was basically nothing wrong with our stay. The beds were comfortable, it was nice to have the separate living space with mini-fridge and microwave, and it was very convenient to have breakfast there. The breakfast was actually really good and they had a few different things each day for those that like to switch it up. We were in the tower that was closest to the beach and lucked out getting an ocean view on the 5th floor-it was amazing-we could see the ocean from our couch! We printed a few things while we were there and it was very easy to use their business center. The free internet worked when we were plugged in, but we were unable to get the wi-fi in our room. As for the location, the beach is a 5 minute walk and all of the shopping and restaurants are literally steps outside your door! The only issue we had was that they didn't come clean our room on our second to last day and we were gone for quite some time that morning/afternoon. We called down and were brought up more towels within 5-10 minutes.

Embassy came through in spades.The only complaint was the check-in area which is shared with the drive-in garage. Noisy, exhaust odor, and since we sit four feet across the desk from the person who checks you in, the environment makes hearing difficult...and there is a PC screen between you and the hotel staff person.

However on the downside - we arrived after a long haul flight to quite possibly the rudest front desk person I have ever come across. She could not have been more unhelpful, and we did not get to check in until 3pm. I would advise anyone travelling a long distance to book a room for an extra night, as despite assurances via email and phone calls earlier we were not able to get an earlier check-in. This would have been understandable if even once, the staff member had expressed a hint of apology or kindness! Also, we thought we had booked an ocean view room, and it was not. Apparently there is no link between bookings and front desk as they would not/could not help us out at all and said it was our fault (we suspect the hotels booking site had a problem as when we booked we assumed we were getting Ocean View as the room was more expensive that a Partial Ocean View).","Auckland, New Zealand",17,4.0

We loved our stay and I would give it five stars on everything except for two serious points - the conceierge and front desk fell short.First, the negatives. The front desk had one person who was less than friendly. She must be the same one as in other reviews because everyone else was great. The second issue with the desk - one day after shopping, my husband and son, loaded down with bags, got back to the room to find his key wasn't working (I was returning our rental car and wasn't there for this). A housekeeper called down to the desk and they said they were sending someone up. My husband waited 15 minutes and no one came so he had to troop with our 2.5 year old and tons of bags back down to get new keys. No apology, no explanation of why no one ever showed up. It would have been fine if they had told him he had to come down, but not just not show up was a pain.Finally, the concierge - OMG - USELESS unless you are buying one of the tours they want to sell you and prepare to be hard-sold for stuff that might not be what you want. But need to find a local kid-friendly restaurant, a certain store, or anything not in their Expeida training (the conceirge is owned by Expedia) and they are utterly useless. Utterly. If you have a hotel in a tourist destination, you really need a concerige that can do more than sell tours to Pearl Harbor and luaus. Now - the good.First - the room - 1428 Hula Tower. FANTASTIC! Excellent partial beach view from the lanais. Plenty of space for a messy family of three. My husband noticed the truck noise in the morning but I slept through it completely and I never sleep through it. Also - we ended up loving the two queen bed setup as our son wanted to sleep with one of us from about 1am on and it was nice to be able to trade that off. Note that the hotel does not have pack n plays but they had cribs that my 36"" tall 30 lb toddler fit in fine. And the room was SPOTLESS every day despite the pounds of sand we dragged in from the beach every day. Friendly and lovely housekeeping -they were amazing. A couple of tips - the bell staff has a closet full of boogie boards, floats, chairs, buckets and shovels, and all sorts of other free beach gear. They just ask you give it back or pass it on. All free. And if you want wireless in your room, you can ask for a router that plugs in on the dining table in the room - you can keep it the entire stay and it's free and gets a good signal. Oh, and room service was FAST and the burgers were really good as were the salads. However, the hotel was only 85% full when we were there so it might be slower when the hotel is more full. We however did order at various times of day and always got great service from them. Second - the manager's reception. OMG - the drinks. Yummy and stroooong. Get the Hawaiian Punch if you want to go Island. The Mai Tais are also awesome. Oh, and you can easily take drinks up to the room. I would go down and get our drinks while my husband put our son down for the night, then we'd sip them out on the lanai.Third - the location - WONDERFUL!!! Seriously, closer to the beach than some of the towers at Hilton Hawaiian Village. As for walking through the alleyway - can't figure out why anyone would do that. Simply go through the Outrigger. It's what the bell guys told us to do and it was perfect. Also - when you get to that beach, rent chairs and Umbrellas from Steve at the rental stand there. 1/2 the price of the umbrellas anywhere else. He is AWESOME! He gave us beach toys and a boogie board. He's the nicest guy and actually is the person who we ended up using as our advice person on where to go.Yes, the beach does have rocks, but swim shoes take care of that, and it's lovely. It just got voted the third best beach in the entire U.S. And the restaurants right there are good too. As for non-beach stuff - you can walk to anything you'd want to. It's right by the serious shopping, HHV is just up the beach, Dukes is the other way up the beach, there are good restaurants in the building, what more could you want? We loved it. Our son wanted to stay up late every night to go see the fire (torches) on the main streets at night, and we loved all the free music events all around the area. Overall - we will visit again, without a doubt. We had a wonderful stay and with the exception of the minor desk and conceierge glitches, we loved it.","El Cerrito, California",16,5.0

We were not disappointed. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly bell staff and escorted to the front desk where Jay greeted us with cold drinks and quickly checked us in. We were booked in a city view room on the 10th floor. After spending a brief period of time in the room, we decided to see if an upgrade was available with ocean views (this room offered no views) and called the front desk. Jay highly recommended an oceanview room on the 20th floor in the adjacent tower. The $50 a night upgrade we spent for this room was the best money spent on our trip- what a difference this room made! The living area was much larger and there were 2 separate sliding doors leading to the balcony (one looked directly at the ocean, the other was of the ocean and city views), as well as a 3rd door to the city/ocean view balcony from the bedroom. Rooms were clean and comfortable with flat screens in both the living room and bedroom (no DVD player). The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. The wet bar featured a small fridge, microwave, sink and coffee maker. A very pleasant surprise was our housekeeper, Yuet, who was phenomenal. Every day in the hall she greeted us by name and she was so friendly and accommodating- always asking if we needed anything and giving us plenty of towels for the beach and extra coffee when she noticed that we drank all that she put in the room. However, on the days she had off, housekeeping was much different as our room was still not cleaned by late afternoon and it was mediocre at best on those days (coffee wasn't replaced, floors were not vacuumed, seemed like making beds and putting towels in were the only thing done those days). Yuet was a big part of making our stay more comfortable and we left her a nice tip at the end of our stay to show our appreciation. We were concerned about the distance to the beach from the hotel but this was not a problem at all - the beach is directly across the street and a very quick and easy walk. Breakfast service was very efficient with the large crowds, and the buffet offered a large selection of fresh fruit, traditional American style breakfast items as well as a few Japanese items (miso soup and rice). It was very well staffed and tables were cleared quickly. The manager's reception was also done quite well - the bartenders (Dennis was a favorite) were very friendly and poured strong drinks. The bar is directly next to the pool so kids can swim close by during the reception and there are plenty of tables and chairs surrounding this area so it never felt crowded. I do not recommend the room service. The food was not good and pizza arrived badly burned one night (our front desk friend Jay promptly removed the charge). However, there are plenty of nice restaurants located in the hotel (Ruth's Chris, Roy's) and others very close by, so if you're staying in for the night it's worth a quick run over to a nearby restaurant for carry out. The best are the tiny Japanese restaurants within a block of the hotel which were so small the front desk staff didn't even know about them- wondeful, authentic food if you're looking for something off the beaten path and out of the crowded, commercialized restaurant world of Waikiki. The international market is a fun culinary scene too (about a 10 minute walk from the hotel). This is definitely a family hotel, so if you do not wish to be amongst a pile of kids in the pool, this may not be the hotel for you, but if you are traveling with young children who have fun making new friends it is a great option. The staff is friendly, the hotel is clean and comfortable, and is a great value for this type of property- we were very pleased with our stay and would definitely recommend it.","Jackson Hole, Wyoming",44,5.0

If your traveling for your honeymoon or romantic 1 on 1 vacation it wouldn't be for you. First off I stay at Hilton brand hotels on average over 60 times a year so with that said I would def stay this embassy is cleaner then most. The rooms are fresh and new feeling still and the location was they main sell, besides being able to cash out my Hilton honors points for all 7 nights! The 5 of us in my party stayed in the hula tower 2bedroom suite on the 15th floor. It wasn't called an ocean view but you can still see the ocean over roof tops from the balcony. The beach is a 2 min 1 block walk away and def wasn't disappointed with that. As all embassy suites offer free breakfast and happy hour drinks, it did save us alot of money.The pool is small and so is the sun deck. If your looking for a place with a huge pool try the Hilton village. If I was traveling alone or with one person I would opt to stay at the Hilton, But at the same time you got to love how easy it is to able to walk right out of the hotel and be in front of the ABC store for your everyday needs, & a block from EVERYTHING else! 30 bucks a day to valet! 210 a week! I spent 218 total for my rental car so the fact I paid just as much to park it was a complete rip off! But what are u gonna do its WaikikiBottom line Great place for families, and overall good value.

Having spent 17 nights on a cruise ship travelling from Sydney to Honolulu, it was great having the space of a suite. We had lovely views of Waikiki, from our ocean view room on the 18th floor of the Hula Tower with two balconies.On arrival at about 9.00 am, we were told our room would not be ready until 3.00 pm but as we were only staying for two nights, we had planned to get out and about anyway so this wasn't an issue, The receptionist staff were friendly and helpful :). We were given a key to get to the pool deck on arrival because the room wasn't ready, and we were even invited to have some breakfast (we had already eaten on the ship but it was a nice welcoming gesture).The suite was great - the bed and sofa bed were very comfortable, lovely balconies, two tvs etc. Having come off a cruise ship without guest laundry facilities, I really appreciated the 24 hour guest laundry. We didn't really have a chance to get the free breakfast because we were out early both mornings (tour to Pearl Harbour and leaving for the airport) and it would have been good to have breakfast open from 6.15 rather than 6.30 am, but this is not a big issue.We loved the manager's reception and the great entertainment - as we had limited time, it was nice to soak up a bit of Hawaiin culture right in our hotel!

Our room (we had a suite) - two rooms joined by a common lounging area with small kitchen - was perfect for the four of us travelling together - and had great balconies as well. The breakfast was terrific and the Manager';s Reception of an afternoon from 5-30 to 7.30 with free drinks (anything!!) and nibbles was great.For the purposes of this visit I could not fault this hotel EXCEPT for the very ordinary gymnasium that they have.

We arrived that day to have our car doors opened for us with smiles all around. When we came to check in at 11am we didn't expect the room to be ready, but, viola it was! A great bonus was while checking in, all 4 of us got given a Hawaiian fruit cocktail (Non alcoholic! ;) ) Very speedy check in!Before we arrived we had requested an ocean view room (which we got :D ) it was amazing, huge lounge, average embassy suites bedroom, and huge bathroom. It's much brighter than most Embassy suites as this one has two towers (Aloha Tower and Hula Tower) not an atrium. Breakfast was great, cooked to order Omelettes, Pancakes (only on select days), A few Japanese dishes, and bacon and egg ect. Very nice, you could sit underneath a roof or sit outside in the nice warm fresh air, but it does get a little windy so don't loose any napkins! The hotel is a 3-5 minute walk to the beach, and is located right on Waikiki beach walk which has a lot of shops (which I will explain in more detail at the end of the review)The pool area is very nice, quite quiet in the morning but it gets very very busy during the evening! The hot tub at the pool is very nice but very hot!I thoroughly recommend staying at this hotel as it has everything you want while staying in Hawaii! :DWaikiki beach walk:Very very nice shops, I recommend going to an ABC store as these stores sell great Souvenirs, towels, swimsuits, sun cream, food ect.

We didn't have a car (rented one for a day only) and our bill on checkout was $0.I always smile when people write (great free breakfast and great free drinks at reception), since all Embassy Suites have these.We requested an upgraded room PRIOR to arrival (quiet, with a view of ocean) and stayed in 1030, a corner suite with a view of the ocean (between the other buildings). The room was high enough that noise from the street and pool area was muted, although you can't escape the trash pickup that happens daily in the street below (but in the bedroom, which is a side entrance in this room, we heard little). Room was clean and maid service was excellent. Breakfast was similar to other Embassy Suites (including the #1 in the world in LaVista, NE that I've stayed in). Manager's reception was a notch above, mostly in the food served and the entertainment provided. I was told by another guest (and signage confirmed this), that the reception's food used to be in the breakfast area and was more elaborate. Most nights included multiple choices including fresh vegetables, chips and salsa, and more. Only complaint for breakfast and reception was irregular bussing of tables, and sometimes they weren't wiped down (Embassy Suites doesn't provide an area for you to bus your own table). Location is great, right in the Beachwalk area. Convenient also to buses. We walked the 2.7 miles to Diamond Head the first morning in the pre-dawn, arriving at sunrise. What a great experience.

We arrived at 7am due to the overnight flight, and unfortunately were not able to get our room until about 1.30pm - I don't think there was much the reception staff could do as the hotel was quite full, but I also wouldn't say he went out of his way to be friendly and helpful, and energy levels were certainly lacking. He also told us he couldn't let us up to the pool floor (travelling with a tired infant, we just wanted to grab some loungers in the shade and rest for a couple of hours) until 10am as the pool didn't open until then - complete rubbish as we were in the pool area by 8am most mornings!Anyhow, once in the room, the stay was nice. Decor is a little dated as with a lot of Waikiki hotels, but room had all amenities and was generally very clean. The pool area is great, especially if you have kids, as is the hot spa tub. Food & beverage service is excellent too.This hotel has three big plus points :1. It is all-suites, which anyone with a baby/toddler will know is an essential!2. Location - you are near everything, close to the beach, main shops, trolley stops, best restaurants/bars and generally nothing is far away3. Complimentary breakfast and manager's drinks : breakfast on the whole is good and the staff are great. Again, if you have kids this is ideal. The manager's drinks is a nice touch; good selection of cocktails, beer, wine etc from 5-7pm, all complimentary. The bar-people are great, and don't expect to have just a dash of alcohol in the cocktails! They also have local bands on 2 or 3 nights and the atmosphere is great.I'd definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers, and we would return ourselves.

I was disappointed to find other guests staying in standard rooms getting their keys much earlier than us but as we had upgraded to an ocean view room we had to wait & wait.

The room itself was clean and reasonably well-appointed. At the Embassy Suites we stayed at on this vacation (including this one) we discovered something that actually results in less sleeping arrangement flexibility than desireable when traveling with teenagers -- the rooms with two beds have two DOUBLE beds (not Queen beds) and the Embassy Suites that we stayed at including this one did not have roll-away beds as an option....so two doubles, and a wirey sofa bed.

Only this top unit has the wrap around, lower rooms have 2 seperate balconies. Avoid rooms ending in 21 or 32 as the elevators run directly threw these rooms which makes the rooms noisy and also much smaller.

Made to order omlettes, fresh fruit (apples, oranges, bananas, pineapple, papaya, canteloupe, watermelon) bacon, eggs, rice, soup, yogurt, mini muffins, bagels (with cream cheese), doughnuts, toast, cereal (4 choices), pancakes with syrup, tropical juices, milk (regular and chocolate), and sodas.Enormously large bathroomEvery suite has a full bedroom (we traveled with kids so it was nice to have two rooms, both with TV's, when the kids needed quiet time)Both the main room and the bedroom have walk out lanai's with two chairs each.Good sized pool with large hot tub and shallow pool for small children (see con area for comment on this)Large area with plenty of lounge chairs next to the poolVery friendly, helpful staff (bellhops went out of their way to accomodate us more than once)Maid service was excellent - she left us extra soap and shampoo - enough to get us through the week without having to call and ask for more.Airconditioning worked perfectly (some hotels are either too hot or too cold)Nightly Hawaiian entertainment (Manager's Evening) - every night you can come to the 4th floor for Hawaiian music and dancing, snacks (carrot sticks, broccoli, cauliflower, fishy crackers, chips and salsa, chex mix - every night is different) and you can get a complimentary drink from the bar.Free High Speed InternetHotel is adjacent to the Waikiki Beach Walk Shopping Center (www.waikikibeachwalk.com)which includes restaurants and stores like Ruth's Chris Steak House, Roy's Waikiki, Subway, Red Mango, Quicksilver, Sunshine Swimwear, and Wyland Galleries. When you check into the hotel you get a voucher that can be redeemed for coupons at the shopping center. It is worth picking up the coupon book.Short walk to the main Waikiki shopping strip and the International MarketplaceConsNOT ON THE BEACH (beach is about one and a half blocks from hotel - easily accessible, but it's not ON the beach)Parking at the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beachwalk will cost you around thirty dollarsShallow kiddie pool is directly next to the deeper five foot end of the pool instead of the three foot end - a small child can EASILY climb over the edge of shallow pool side and fall into deep water (dumb design)No Disney channel - only NickelodeonOur room faced another hotel - the view was not great, though I think the upper floors on the other side of the hotel faced the ocean and might have partial viewsThe traffic from outside was a bit loud, but not too bad when the sliding glass doors on the patios were closed.","Seattle, Washington",14,5.0

Four of those days were spent at the Embassy Suites Beachwalk and our stay here was one of the most comfortable and pleasant stays we have ever had at any hotel. The entire staff, from the check-in clerk to the bellmen and valet parking attendants went out of their way to ensure that we were comfortable and getting everything we needed to make our visit pleasurable. One of the bellmen in particular, Dean, was so kind and courteous to not only us, but our granddaughter as well. The complimentary breakfast was very excellent and we enjoyed the manager's reception each evening which also included entertainment.

The hotel is located just a block off of the beach, and our room had a good view of the ocean. Each room is a suite, ours was a one bedroom with 2 queen beds in the bedroom, and a sofabed in the living room. The beds and pillows were great. Got good sleeps every night we were there. There is a fee for partking, if you have a car. But the valet staff are fantastic. Very quick to get you car, and always pleasant and happy to serve.The breakfasts are included at the Embassy, and they were great. Made-to-order omlettes (or fried eggs), bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, fresh fruits - everything you might want in a breakfast. We found the breakfast saved us money - with a good breakfast, we didn't really need much for lunch, and just ate a good dinner later on.The Beachwalk area is a really nice area too. Not as busy or loud as the other hotels around the International Marketplace or other ones along Kalakaua Blvd. Nice shops, and good restaurants.I would highly recommend this hotel, and will probably stay there again if we go back to Oahu.","Saskatoon, Canada",6,5.0

Waikiki tends to be noisy, but the windows here do a good job of keeping the noise out. The complementary breakfast and manager's reception are typical of Embassy Suites but the attitude of the employees makes this place special. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, and Roy's and Ruth Chris Steak House are on property. Both were fabulous. The pool area is large enough to accommodate the number of guests and is not too windy. Entertainment is provided by the pool in the evening.

This hotel blew the other way out of the water! Although the front of house staff weren't entirely warm & friendly, you were greeted with a seat & a drink which was nice. We booked a 1 bedroom through Expedia, it was a nonrefundable rate but was advertised as ocean or city view. However on arrival we discovered the ocean view cost a lot more & they would only offer us city view at that rate. After some badgering on our part they offered us a discounted upgrade rate to an ocean view which we took. We were told the room was full ocean view, but on entering you could only see a small part of the ocean if you went out on the balcony & turned your head. We called the desk immediately & were advised that's the best they had, a full ocean view would be available as of the next day. So we agreed to spend the night in that room & move the next day. On calling downstairs the next day they told us the other room wasn't ready yet, we'd have to check out & waste some time until that room was ready. So we got the bellboy to collect our luggage & take it downstairs to store, but when we went to check out they advised the other room was ready. Lack of communication & fairly poor service on their part, but we got to our room finally. The rooms are very clean and a decent size. The full ocean view was slightly bigger and had 2 balconies (corner room) with a beautiful ocean view from the 20th floor. Very worth the upgrade! Free internet via cable in the room, and free wireless on the pool deck. Free safe (which we didn't use), and free local calls and first half hour free to calls anywhere in the USA. Great value I thought considering none of these things are provided free in many other accommodations that cost more!There was a very substantial buffet breakfast every morning on the gorgeous pool deck, and a managers reception every night with free drinks (alcoholic included) & some entertainment. Very good value, and a beautiful setting. Pool was too cold considering it was meant to be heated, the ocean water was warmer! Location was great, located just on beautiful Lewers St (a big change from the streets around the Waikiki Sunset!) with lots of nice restaurants nearby. Beach across the road via a walkway, however apart from being a pretty beach it was not really for swimming. A couple of steps into the water and you encountered hundreds of sharp rocks which cut your feet, so unless you were planning to swim the whole time you were better off just sunbaking on the beach. Definitely not for little kids!Approached the activities desk once (supposed to be an Expedia local expert?) wasn't overly friendly or helpful...didn't seem to know much and didn't offer much help. Needless to say didn't approach him again, just found our own things in the abundance of catalogues around the streets.Overall a great stay, would definitely come here again!","Melbourne, Australia",6,5.0

I finally brought a friend of mine from the East Coast to the Embassy Suites and he's still talking about our trip. As the other reviewers have stated this hotel definitely offers the best value for your dollar with the free amenities alone. That would be the cooked-to-order breakfast, 2 hours of complimentary drinks at the manager's reception (which we definitely took advantage of) and the high speed internet. For a weeks' vacation you're talking huge savings right there, and the employees were more than happy to offer advice and suggestions when needed. I must thank one of the valets Greg for holding on to a personal item I had misplaced in the lobby and remembered me a day later when he saw me. That kind of service can't be ignored when dealing with hundreds of guests. I loved the microwave and refrigerator and the seperate living room area for added space. And if you wanna see the ocean, I suggest staying in the Aloha Tower like we did, you will get a better view than the Hula Tower IMO.

Several times each day we were asked if they could be of help. The breakfast and manager's reception were particularly nice when we had our entire family with us. We would have a excellent made to order breakfast, leave for sightseeing and then return in time for cocktails and snacks. We would then visit one of the excellent restaurants within walking distance of our room.

Arriving after a long flight from Australia at 6.00am we were extremely tired and regretting that we hadn't booked a room from the night before so we could shower and go straight to bed. It was still dark when we arrived at the hotel, but we could see enough that we were impressed by the lovely open air foyer and felt immediately like we had arrived for a holiday. Being greeted by the reception staff with a tropical fruit juice was a lovely gesture and we were offered a room that we could check in to immediately. However, as this room was on a lower floor we asked if we could pay for a day room just so we could shower and change and wait till a room was available on a higher floor. We felt the $100 we paid for this was great value as far cheaper than paying for an extra night's accomodation. After showers, we headed down to the beach - a two minute walk down a beach access alleyway, then ate at the Dennys across the road from the Embassy before returning to the hotel. On our return at 10.30am our room on a higher floor was ready and we headed up to the 14th floor of the Aloha Tower. The room was perfect for our needs, two queen sized beds (extremely comfortable) in the bedroom and a queen sofa bed in the lounge. However the highlight was walking out onto our balcony and being able to see the sea - something we hadn't been expecting.The location of the Embassy was perfect, so close to the sea, excellent restaurants and shopping. The cooked breakfast daily was excellent value. A wide variety of foods and juices - everything very fresh and well presented. Yes there was a problem with the birds in the outdoor area, but the staff did a wonderful job of shooing these away and keeping the whole area clean and tiday. We made the most of the Managers evening reception - very strong drinks - all free and a good selection of nibbles.We will definitley return to the Embassy - this was a great family destination.","Auckland, New Zealand",69,5.0

We are both disabled veterans. Dan is a lung patient with respiratory problems. The hotel employees knew about my husband's disabilities before we arrived and claimed if we had a problem with this hotel we would be moved to another hotel. This was not the case as Dan continued to get sick from the lobby which is still designed like an underground parking lot with running exhaust from cars. Smoke alarms were going off and on all day. Also fumes from construction filled the upper floors and pool area. We could not open our room's windows or sit on the balcony because of the disel fumes. We were denied access to the management as we had asked for the manager, to change hotels, every day. Our travelers rights were violated. The front desk personnel and concierges refused to help us get a manager or directions. We have a set, limited income and could not afford another hotel. The last night when it was too late to change hotels, an assistant manager talked to us. By this time we had to drop out of activities due to the hotel environment making Dan ill. What I liked best was leaving this hotel. Dan has since put in a civil rights violation claim and I have witten to their corporate office and guest assistance for reimbusement for monetary losses on activities. So far, I received an email stating that everything would be resolved in three days. Resolution never happend. If you are traveling with kids, older people or disabled people, do NOT stay at this hotel.

We booked a 1 bedroom king suite with an ocean view. We had a very good corner room on the 9th floor that gave us views of the ocean from every window. We had 2 balconies, 1 not only had an ocean view but also overlooked the pool area. The bedroom and bathroom were both a good size. The bedroom did not have a closet but an armoire for hanging clothes, dressers with good amount of space and a flat screen HD TV. The entry way had a small kitchen area with a microwave, small fridge, coffe machine and sink. The living room area had a desk for your laptop with hard wired free internet, a couch and a dresser with a Flat screen HD TV on it. Not huge if there are more than 2 people but plenty of space for 2. The location was great with the only thing better being right on the beach if you want to pay alot more money. There was beach access less than a block away. We are not people who like to spend a lot of time on the beach so having a great ocean view was more important than being right on the beach. Easy walking distance to lots of shopping and dining places.  The hotel provides good breakfast options that are included in the room price as well as a free cocktail reception for 2 hours in the evening. The snacks at the cocktail reception are pretty basic but give you something to nibble on while you have a drink or 2. A good variety of drink choices at the reception. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly. We had some mixed success with the internet. At times it would go in an out while we were trying to use it but at other times it worked well and was fairly fast.

He needed a walk-in shower so we switched to an accessible room. Whoever designed this knew what they were doing. The room was near the elevators and around the corner from the 4th floor pool and hospitality area, so convenient for swimming, breakfast and evening drinks (complimentary). At breakfast and drink time, there was some noise from kids (and parents) running and yelling in the hallway, but it was not frequent (and could not be heard in the bedroom). The pool and hot tub were very nice, but the pool was in shade (which might be good in the summer, but not so good in winter).The service was great. On arrival we were greeted with a glass of juice, and the bellmen who helped us were very friendly (and patient with my husband's pace). I'm normally not a fan of valet parking, but they were very quick to bring the car each time we needed it. Also, there is a nearby stop for the trolley that runs to Ala Moana shopping center. The business center was well-equipped, which made it easy to print boarding passes. An added bonus, Roy's Restaurant is on the premises; it is great.

What a let down in a state known for its fresh fruit. They have a nice large pool, which was a must for our family, but it wasn't heated. You would think not a big deal in Hawaii but, while in the shadows of the other buildings or at night it was too cold for most of the adults and even some kids. For us pool time is family time and dad just couldn't handle the cold pool. He was in the hot tub, with almost all the adults, while we played in the pool.

I'm a Hilton HHonors Diamond, so they upgraded me to an ocean view room. Cool, I thought. But since most Embassy Suites rooms are fairly identical, I wouldnt have pressed for an upgrade anyway. If you arent familiar with the Embassy Suites concept, all rooms here have two room suites, with a bedroom and living room with sofa bed. flat screen Tv's in each room, and a microwave, refrigerator, sink sort of ""kitchenette"".The Embassy Suites Waikiki has two bedroom suites also.Anyway, we've stayed here before, back in 2008, so we knew what to expect. We got room 1809 in the Aloha tower, which is on the right side of the hallway facing the ocean. I wouldnt recommend any ""09"" rooms on any floor. This side of the hallway contains the stairwell. Not only does it make the room smaller, but we could hear the stairwell door slamming as people entered the stairs. Where they were going from the 18th floor, I dont know. Being at the SW corner of the building, it had an extended balcony, which you could enter from the living area or the bedroom, although it is very narrow. I'm 5 foot 11 inches, and when I sat down, my knees were at the railing. this side also directly faces the Trump International, which blocks any real view of DeRussy park. The ""Ocean view"" is past the breakfast pavilion and pool floor below, the other tower, and past the Outrigger on the Beach. YOu could see it from the balcony or from two windows behind the couch. Since there isnt any seating on the other side of the room, you cant enjoy the view sitting down.There should be better views on the other side of the hallway. So if you are looking for real ocean views, remember, this hotel is not directly on the beach. However, the room was still very nice. OK King size bed, clock radio with mp3 hookup. Very understated Hawaiian themed furnishings. Decent sized bathroom, however our previous room without an oceanview had a bigger bathroom with entrances from the living and bedrooms. This hotel has full breakfast daily plus an evening managers reception. Breakfast was good. there is an omelet station with many toppings to choose from, pancakes, french toast, fresh fruit, pastries, breakfast meats, and also a few international dishes such as tofu, miso soup and fried rice. There is also coffee, tea juices and soda. From 5-7pm, there is a ""manager's reception"" with light hors dourves. There is supposed to be entertainment, but there wasnt on the one night we went, Sunday. Our previous visit, there was entertainment every night. All said, I would recommend this hotel for it's proximity to Waikiki beach, the Waikiki strip and the Waikiki beach walk, which is right downstairs. There are restaurants ranging from the Hard Rock to Ruth's Chris and Subway, and ABC (Hawaiian convenience store), PF Chang's, Senor Frogs (with live music), galleries, stores etc.","Suwanee, Georgia",21,4.0

The complimentary breakfast is outstanding, John makes the best omelet with a continous smile as he prepares the food. You can't have a an empty cup of coffee or glass of OJ around Aldrin because he's always there filling it up with his great sense of humor (and removing your used plates, too). Our house keeper, Lleulynn ""Lynn"" (7th floor Hula Tower) on this trip was so friendly and accomodating to our requests she seemed like family. She always went out of her way with a warm smile to assure we were comfortable in our suite . Since I was here on business I needed a very quiet room and for the second trip in a row we were given choices by Victor to make sure we were absolutely satisfied. He believes in speedy customer service with a smile. He even kept us updated on room change status by calling my cell so we would not have to wait til we got back to the hotel.

I traveled alone with my wife once (Nov 2010) and the other 3 times ( March) with my kids (12 & 14).I am a Hilton Honors Diamond Member and have stayed all 32 nights on points. I travel a lot and love to stay at the Embassy Suites Brand. This hotel is the best of the ES. To the check-in from Kalae and Jaymar ,to the awesome bartender, Dennis, you won't be disappointed. I used the gym everyday and it's a nice one. 4 treadmills and free weights up to 50 lbs. The hotel is almost 4 years old now. I have stayed in the one bedroom and the two bedroom suites and they are both gorgeous. Someone who posted a comment said that the furniture is dated? How, when the furniture isn't even that old? Rooms are so clean and everything looks new. The breakfast here is twice as big as the normal ES breakfast. The managers reception every evening is a great deal as well. Unlimited free drinks for 2 hours, and I mean, unlimited. Someone complained about not having better food??? Who cares, you get free drinks. What's that worth per person or a family? Awesome hula dancing will keep you entertained. Again, the entire staff at this hotel is super nice.  The Yardhouse underneath is excellent and so is Roy's and the Ruth Chris Steakhouse. Not sure why someone would complain about spending $5-$6 to wash and dry a load of clothes? Most hotels don't even offer washer and dryers. What would it cost to have all your clothes dry cleaned? Pack light and you can use the washer and dryers. I used them everytime. There is also a nice business center next to the room where the washer and dryers are located. Free internet in the room was very beneficial. Although I didn't pay for a night during my 4 stays, I would say that it's worth $250-$275+ tax, especially for a family. I went to the ABC store across the street and bought bread and lunch meats and other snacks and kept them in the mini fridge. They were so nice that they brought me an extra mini fridge when I asked for one. You can eat lunch in the room and save a lot of money. Subway is also next door. Waikiki is very reasonably priced compared to the outer islands. I NEVER rent a car. You don't need one in Waikiki. When I do need one for a day or two, I walk a few blocks to the Hyatt and rent a car there. If you want to drive around the island just rent a car for a couple days. You can walk everywhere in waikiki. I've been a dozen times and have never rented a car at the airport. The location is not beachfront but only a block away from the beach. I have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and it's on the beach, but not in the prime location like the ES. I guarantee you, the ES is in the best location in Waikiki. Hilton Hawaiian's prices for food and drinks are twice the cost of the ES. Sure, there are like 16 restaurants at the Hilton, but the hotel is not of the same caliber of the ES. I don' like the location of the Hilton Hawaiian.I love the Embassy Suites Waikiki and its people and will be back for years to come.You can't go wrong with this property.","Portland, Oregon",5,5.0

Although we rented a car public transportation and tours are readily available.We enjoyed lunch in China Town, our trip to Dole Plantation, our tour to Pearl Harbor, our dinner cruise, dining at Ruth Chris steakhouse, and Tanaka of Toyko. Regarding Tanaka of Toyko, we were not familiar with the Changing of the King's Guard in King's Village so we were a little surprise when we exited the Japanese restaurant and saw the guards marching through the shopping area. The performance was so impressive that we walked back the following night. We then learned that the full team drill, which takes place at 6:15, is only performed 3 or 4 nights weekly.

The cleaning and breakfast staff are the only bright spots.,"East Peoria, Illinois",2,1.0

IMHO, this blows the Hilton out of the proverbial water. Sure the Hilton has fireworks and is on the beach and is a larger property w/flamingos and penguins, but it is also older and farther from the main strip in Waikiki. If you've stayed in Waikiki before, the Embassy might suit you better. They offer free cooked-to-order breakfasts, free happy hour (I discovered gin & tonics on this trip, as well as the fact that I find Mai Tais disgusting), free in-room internet and the all-suite factor is a big plus for our family since we have 2 little kids. You can still walk to the beach and see the fireworks, but it's closer to a lot of the stuff going on in Waikiki. It's also right on Beachwalk, with lots of touristy stores and restaurants which would be the equivalent of the facilities Hilton has in its resort onsite. I also liked the fact that everything is newer (although I believe Hilton has been updating for the last several years--I've heard the lagoon has a really cool pool now). Basically, they're both great properties, but this one has the edge in my book. Now you can decide for yourself.","los angeles, ca",3,5.0

The breakfast was really good and there's a great restaurant called the Yard House is basically inside the building. The workout room was very nice for a hotel, especially since there are two TVs plus individual units on the cardio machines. Unfortunately the place had some downside:Yes, there are birds at Breakfast and they’re really bad if its rained. There is outside and inside seating at breakfast, so they’re scattered enough of most days, until it rained and everyone was concentrated under the covered area.The self service laundry charges were absurb. I’ve never seen a small washing machine cost $2.50, then $2.25 for a 36 minute dryer, which we had to pay twice on to actually dry our clothes. We paid $15 for two loads of laundry, which is more than double compared to anything else we've ever paid. The manager’s reception is nice, but it lacked any hot appetizers. At $225+/night in the offseason, is it really too much to ask?The pool is very small, which we knew about, but didn't expect there to be no employees enforcing the rules. There were unattended children running and screaming along the sides of the pool, making it impossible for anyone else to get in and enjoy themselves. The soundproofing seemed poor for a newer hotel. I was on a very high floor and could hear both outside noise, and the couple in the room next to us both fighting and “making up”.Overall it was an okay trip, but I guess I had higher expectations for a brand new Embassy in a prime location such as Waikiki.","Charleston, South Carolina",98,3.0

We were upgraded to a partial ocean view on the top floor overlooking the pool. I wish we had come here first and then continued on to Maui since Waikiki is very much hustling and bustling like any other city. I knew that when I booked, but didn't account for how I would feel at the end of the trip. We booked Embassy Suites because of the free breakfast and managers reception. They did not disappoint. There is a microwave and mini-fridge in the room for quick meals and reheats, but for the most part you will want to head out to try the restaurants. We made good use of the free internet access while lounging by the pool on our last afternoon in paradise. I recommend renting a car for a day or two for North Shore and other side trips. The $25 daily fee is steep, and they tried to charge us for 2 days since we had it parked in their garage overnight. We argued that we took the car out of the garage before 8am that morning, and $50 was ridiculous for the few hours it was on the property. They kindly removed the second charge. I thought that was nice of them, as I was sure we were stuck with it. We also got an elevator key for our last day after check out. This allowed us to visit the pool and enjoy the music one last time. Overall, great place to stay.","San Antonio, Texas",0,5.0

Dallas, Los Angeles, Tucson, Houston, and I could go on. With 3 children, the free breakfast and for my husband and I, the free afternoon drinks have always been a deal breaker. Making the cost of the suite seem like a bargain. This Embassy Suites was no different. We got a beautiful room, I saw the mountains from one bedroom window & the beach from both balconies. I called housekeeping after coming back from the beach the first day to ask why my room hadn't been cleaned and they had someone up in a matter of minutes. I had to apologize later to housekeeping because I found out they HAD COME BY and my daughter told them her mom was asleep and to come back later. Poor communication on our part. The only complaint I have is qwith the front desk staff and the manager. First, we called before we left tosee if we could get a room with a view. The young man answering the phone definitely did not have the ""Aloha Spirit"" nor was he : Hanging Loose"". He was rude and hung up on my husband when he asked his name. The last night of our trip, August 21, we had to evacuate the building, we were on the 18th floor. Alarms went off and we headed down the emergency stairs. I ended up helping a lady get her handicap dad down all those flights of stairs. The whole time we saw no one from the hotel or anyone giving any instructions. We get out to the street, still no sign of any hotel staff, and we stayed for about an hour until we noticed other guest going back in the building. Did not know why we had been evacuated and still are not clear almost a month later. Some of the breakfast staff told us it was because someone smoked in the stairwell and set of the alarms. The front desk was plaesant enough but not people oriented. To add to the humor, I complained to the corporate office and got a really nice email from the manager. ""They are working on the incident that happened that night."" What ?? What good does that do me now. Regarding getting hung up on, ""If I was calling from a cell phone, I may have dropped the call."" For some reason that pissed me off more than anything. Oh yeah, he offered me one night free at the hotel the next time I am visiting. I found that funny !! I live in Arizona so it isn't like I am going to stop by next week.

Pastries, bagels & cream cheese, bread for toast, scrambled eggs in buffet, fruit, salad, miso soup and rice, french toast, pancakes hot syrup and biscuits and gravy, cereal, pineapple crisp, can't go wrong there. One trick was to put the pancakes or french toast through the toaster again to freshen it up. Pops and juices with different teas and coffee also availalble. Grab your fruit here for snacking the rest of the day you will not regret having something healthy handy. Birds in the eating area are annoying but you're outdoors, hard to avoid this I guess. Never had to wait in line for long. Grab your free paper and head over to the pool area after, very relaxing. Brought breakfast back to our room a few times and learned the maid will not take away these items you must put them outside your door. Maid service could have been better I put an empty bag of chips on the floor and they were still there when I came back? I even placed a housekeeping tip out each day. Was asked if I wanted the bed made up today???? By the way the beds were a bit hard and we all had trouble sleeping. Head to the lawn chairs in the afternoon good for a nap. Manager's reception drinks were good didn't have to wait, took back to room before heading out for dinner. Nibblies were bits and bites and chips. Kids had mocktails or pop. My kids brought down large refillable glasses for their pop so they could have some later too, same at breakfast time. Pool was very good,warm and fair sized could get some excersize. Never a problem to find a lawn chair or a shady spot. Massage offered also $20 for 15 min. Didn't try. Beach across the street. Great view Hula tower prefered. Looked at HHV fireworks fridays and Trump tower and pool room 731 great spotand view. Could watch teens at the pool and see line for drinks and breakfast here. Could hear the elevator even though we were not next to it. Service here was great, valets were attentive and friendly. Used hospitality suite because of late flight out and they held our luggage while we shopped that day and Johnny brought all our stuff over to that room with a scale so we could properly pack.

Everyone liked this hotel! The staff at check-in was very friendly and offered us these great drinks. Sadly, the drinks contained no alcohol (after spending 12+ hours flying to Hawaii, you really just need something to take the edge off!). Even without the booze, the drinks were excellent! We were all upgraded to 2 bedroom suites, which was wonderful! The bellmen were lots of fun and very friendly. Once we were settled at check-in, we went to our rooms and the bags arrived shortly after. The rooms were quite nice. The living space was a little small for 4 people, 4 suitcases, and 4 carry-ons, but we managed by putting all the suitcases in the bedroom with the king sized bed. One thing I find with almost all hotels - lack of drawer space to put personal items away. Clearly a 2 bedroom suite is meant for more than 2 people, yet there were only a few small drawers in each room! Since we were only staying for 2 nights, we lived out of 1 suitcase packed just for that purpose. All mattress were very comfortable and no one had back pains in the morning. We were in a 2-bedroom suite in the Aloha Tower. These were nice, except the view was not so great! The balcony (and I use that term loosely) was very narrow. There were 3 chairs and 1 little table on the balcony, but you really couldn't move around outside because it was VERY narrow. We were on the third floor and had a wonderful view inside the rather dumpy apartment building next door. Don't forget that you're in the city, so the buildings are going to be close! Across the street from our room was the Trump building, which was better to look at.The bathrooms were very nice. Lots of counter space by the sinks. Showers operated normally (meaning that the water actually went down the drain so you weren't standing in a few inches of water while showering - gross). The hotel shampoo, conditioner and soap were of better quality and smelled very pleasant.The hotel backs up the the Beach Walk, which had tons of shops & restaurants. It's a little difficult to find because you walk down a hallway and end up at the Beach Walk. The hallway isn't really marked, so you have to ask around for a way to get out there. The pool was pretty nice. One thing to remember - there are no pool towels outside! The pool towels are kept in the bathroom of your room. I couldn't find the towels at first and had to have my 13-year-old niece explain where to find them! So before calling downstairs looking for towels, search the bathroom! The pool itself was very nice, although not that large. And, it's located on the 4th floor! The view from the pool area is really pretty. It was kept very clean and there weren't too many crazy people/kids running around. Another thing to note - the hot tub was HOT. I saw many parents with infants in the 100-degree plus hot tub! Please warn younger children ahead of time that heat like that isn't safe for young children (especially babies - what were those people thinking?).We were able to get the free happy hour and free breakfast with out stay. Be aware that both of these things get very busy very quickly, so get there early! The night that we did the happy hour, the bar line was VERY long! They only let you go 1 at a time up to the bar and you cannot stack drinks, so if you plan to drink alot, get your drink and get back in line for the next round. The same is true for the breakfast - if you want to hit the buffet and eat, arrive shortly after it opens or it's super crowded and there will be almost no place to sit!The only negative we had here was that the fire alarm went off during the night one night and it didn't alert the entire building. We had family on the 8th floor who never heard the initial alarm, but did hear the all clear sound. When they inquired at the front desk later that day, they were told that some floors are louder than others! I believe that's something management should be looking at, right?Other than that, the place is great. Close to dining, shops and a short walk over to the beach!

The staff are courteous & plentiful....I can honestly say that I have not one negative thing to say about our stay here. The pool is not olympic size but very adequate considering you are a stones throw from waikiki beach. The rooms are clean, bright & well decorated. A bit heavier in the pocket compared to other ""national branded hotels"" however, I must stress this, the added value of valet parking with in & out priviledges, comp breakfast, cocktail reception, location, service & quality is definately worth the added expense.

The rooms are a good size (one had a King bed and the other 2 Queens), the furnishings are good and the hotel generally very well kept. Our room was sold as a partial ocean view and that's what we got although the view was better than I expected. Our room overlooked the pool. We had a coffee maker, sink, fridge and microwave.The facilities of the hotel include a pool which is great. It is a really good temperature with a very warm spa. There are two very good areas in the pool for kids. The entire pool is very kid friendly with ample seating which is very clean and there is plenty of sun on the pool area for most of the day.Included is also a Manager's Reception on a few days a week ( we didn't use it but looks to include drinks) and a free breakfast which was great.The location of the hotel is wonderful. It is right in the centre of the beach walk shopping area. There are plenty of great restaurants around and right across the road from the Outrigger Reef and Shore Bird restaurant! The beach is a block away and the bus stop for the Bus to Ala Moana Centre is a block away.Tonight we have just found out that our flight home has been delayed 14 hours. We needed to extend our stay for a day because our flight now doesn't leave till 11pm tomorrow night! We went down to the registration desk to book a 1 bedroom suite (the smallest room here) for the extra night and Tali gave us our present room for the extra night so we didn't have to move!I cannot recommend this place highly enough. The rooms are comfortable, the beds are comfortable and the staff have gone out of their way to accommodate our requests.","Cairns, Australia",7,5.0

We had a great experience and would return to this property.We were in a one bedroom one bath unit which was quite small compared to other Embassy Suites we've stayed in. For a longer stay the small space could have been a problem, but it worked for only three nights. Interestingly, we were told (very politely) upon check in that the max occupancy for the room is four people, but they'd let it slide this time. Just thought that was odd considering we've stayed in Miami, New York City, San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Irvine, CA in one bedroom units and have never been told that. One of the kids did sleep on the floor as the pull out couch is pretty small.While this property isn't beachfront, it is only one block from the beach - maybe a three minute walk at most. There are tons of places to eat within easy walking distance as well as two ABC stores on the same block for sunscreen, snacks, souvenirs, etc...Free breakfast is plentiful with lots of choices. Lots of crowds and hungry birds too, but nothing that seriously bothered me. A few tips: you can see the Friday night fireworks (courtesy of the Hilton) from the pool area. Just be sure to be on time as they start on time and last only 5 - 10 mins. Also, the line for the bar and complimentary drinks nightly looks intimidating, but moves quickly. Bartenders were very generous with the alcohol and very friendly. Be sure to take the elevator to the top floor and go out on the tiny balcony area for a beautiful view of the ocean and Waikiki. Last, if this is your first time to Waikiki, please don't expect a tranquil, peaceful paradise. Waikiki is a big city with tall buildings, honking horns, yelling people, etc.. The area around the hotel is no exception. Overall, this property was clean, well maintained, a good value, a good location and run by a friendly staff. It's not a resort hotel or one for those looking for pampering or oceanfront location, but otherwise I think most everyone would be pleased with it.","Highlands Ranch, Colorado",247,5.0

I have read many other reviews on this site nit picking some little things, but I would strongly suggest this to travelers for all purposes. Upon arrival we were promptly greeted with a cold glass of fresh juice and many alohas. They allowed us to check in early with no questions asked and check in took a very short amount of time. The concierge was very helpful in suggesting places to dine as well, I believe Kari was her name, was even helpful in suggesting things to do in Maui as we continued our honeymoon there. The rooms were very clean and had more than enough room for the two of us. There were no closets as mentioned before but there was a desk that you could set a suitcase on as well as floor room to utilize. Our view was decent and was of the city skyline. We were located next to the elevator but it didn't pose a problem for us as we were on the 18th floor and not many people were staying above us. If you were to get a room ending in 01 on a lower level I would suggest requesting another room away from the elevator.They offer complimentary breakfast in the morning and drinks in the evening. The breakfast is fantastic and offers many options. They had a build your own omelette station that they prepare for you, pancakes, French toast, cereal, fresh fruits, potatoes, yogurt, bacon, sausage, pasteries…the list goes on and on. The seating is outside both covered and uncovered so there are birds that hang around in hopes of landing some food but aren’t too troublesome. The manager’s reception in the evening offers a wide selection of beer, liquor and the tropical drinks you would expect to find in Hawaii. They also had chips and salsa available as well as live entertainment that was very enjoyable and personable. The pool area is located on the 4th floor where the free breakfast and drinks are served and is keep immaculate. The pool in and of itself is nothing special but more than enough to accommodate the many guests. We went down to the pool early one morning and found the staff scrubbing the sides of the pool. They take great care of the grounds.We dined at The Yardhouse several times over the course of our stay because they had an AWESOME happy hour that started at 2 and included half price drinks, appetizers and pizzas. The selection is huge and the atmosphere is excellent. It was one of the first places mentioned by others when we asked for suggestions on where to eat and we totally understand why. The hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to anything you want to do in Waikiki such as the International Marketplace, the beach, many different higher scale shops, restaurants, etc. I have read in other reviews complaints on it not being higher class or not being right on the beach and I don’t understand why. The rooms were more than enough for the two of us and we really didn’t even take full advantage of all the things that it offered to us because we were too busy out enjoying what the island had to offer. The beach was within a hop, skip and a jump. We have no regrets in choosing the Embassy and would do so again in a heartbeat. We took the money we saved on breakfast every morning and pre dinner drinks in the evening, and put it towards extra activities and tours and we suggest you do the same!","Des Moines, Iowa",2,5.0

We were traveling on reward points and were booked in a room overlooking a parking lot and viewing the city. Granted I was a non-rev, but I expected more.That being said, the hotel is nice and the staff is very friendly (outside of one staff member). It is a block off the beach and is a short walk to the public access area. As stated in earlier reviews, the valet service is excellent and we didn't have to wait long for our car at all. They were also excellent at helping us find our way.The breakfast was good and the only time I was offered Miso soup and an omelet. Since it is outside, the birds are a small issue, but weren't a nuisance and the manager's reception is a nice experience and does add value especially if you are traveling with your family.

They offer several great choices. There are several restaurant choices in the area. Roy’s Restaurant downstairs offers a nice lunch. The Cons – Room is not right on the beach but it’s just a block away. Our room was right next to the elevator which was very noisy. Kitchen is not equipped with cookware, dishes, bowls and utensils.

We travelled with our 3 teenagers and had a two bedroom suite that allowed each child there own queen size bed, and with three TVs in the suite there was never any disagreements about what show to watch. The breakfast was huge with my hungry boys being more than satisfied. The cleaning staff, bell boys , valet parking all were so friendly and helpful and at times when we offered a tip it was not taken as they were more than happy to help. The location was perfect as you only had to cross the road down a path to be at the beach and we could see the ocean from our balcony. Was very central to pick up trolleys to the Ala Moana shopping centre and right behind Trump tower where you get the bus to the outlet shopping. We were very sad to check out of our home away from home , dont hesitate to stay here especially as the breakfast was included in the price which would have cost us a lot more and they had a wonderful happy hour with free drinks every night for two hours by the pool.

Spacious rooms and accommodations.- Fantastic staff. Friendly staff from the front desk clerks, to the valets, to the housekeepers, to the breakfast cooks, servers, and bartenders and they all at seem very good at their jobs as well.- Spacious rooms and bathrooms. Basic suite has sleeper sofa and ""work desk"" in addition to sink/mini-fridge/counter.- Great Embassy Suites breakfast and reception. Breakfast is very good with lots of fresh fruit, variety, and Hawaiian/Asian touches as well. Drinks are reception are VERY strong...watch out, kiddies.- Located on Beach Walk, near numerous restaurants, bars, and upscale shops.Negatives:- Only outdoor (covered) seating for breakfast, although you can take it to your room (trays offered). Staff has to fight off birds for you to eat in peace.- Parking is expensive, although not at all out of line for the area - no self-park option, that I'm aware of.- Beds are not overly comfortable and rooms do not have a built-in closet, so space can be a bit limited in the various furniture.- Potential for less than exciting views of other hotels.- Hotel is not right on the beach (access is a short walk through Outrigger - equivalent of maybe two or three blocks).Since I have a lot of negatives, you may be wondering why this is a five-star hotel. Because they're all nitpicks (but I wanted to be complete). I've never been to a hotel where I was more pleased with the overall experience - everyone smiles at you and learns your name, and it means a lot.

This is only a block from the ocean, but it's more like being in the middle of a big city (which it is) than a beach location. This is a new Embassy Suites, but not a new hotel ... evidently, it's run by the Outrigger company (a Hawaii based hotel operator), and they took two of their older (adjacent) Outrigger hotel buildings and combined them into one Embassy Suites property (they gutted the buildings and combined 2 of the old small hotel rooms into 1 larger suite ... still a bit small for an Embassy Suites hotel, but reasonably sized for Waikiki.Our room was behind the elevators (even though my HHonors profile specifies otherwise) but it was 4th of July weekend and very crowded ... unless you like big crowds, stay away from Waikiki on the 4th of July.

I traveled with my parents and my teen brother, so we decided to take a cab from the airport and it was around 50 dollars. We stayed there for a little more than a week.Upon our arrival, we were received by a really helpful bellboy who took our bags directly to our room (two towers make up the hotel), and also explained us most of the amenities that the hotel has (from the pool, the complimentary breakfast, the manager's reception and drinks policy, the fitness and business center locations) as well as the nearby interesting things that we could find.On the other hand, the person who checked us in wasn't as nice as the bellboy, since it took him some time (about 15-30 minutes) to find our reservation, but during our wait we were offered some pineapple drinks.The room was completely decorated in a Hawaiian style, and I loved it! The couch, the lamps, the mirrors and even the carpet had Hawaiian motifs like pineapples, waves and palm trees! It was roomy, enough for 4 people, beds were comfy and so were the pillows. Our room had two 'lanai' where we had a nice view to other hotels and to the adjacent shopping mall. The bathroom was extremely clean and we were glad to be provided with beach towels. However, we usually had to ask for an extra towel since the cleaning lady would always leave only 3.About the location, it’s in a great place since you only have to walk for about a block to get to the beach, and also a block to get to Kalakaua Avenue where all the fashion stores are located, as well as the Waikkiki Shopping Plaza and the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. However, if you feel like going elsewhere to shop, the bus stop was also near. For example, we had to walk about 2 blocks to grab a bus to the Ala Moana Center or you could just go to the back of the hotel, in order to face Lewers St. to catch the trolley that would take you directly there.This hotel has other nice features, like the Manager's reception where you can have some drinks (juices, margaritas, blue Hawaii, etc), snacks (chips, cookies) and there were also musical shows. The one I loved the most was on Saturday evening: it was a dancing show with hula and other Polynesian styles.Something worth noting is the fact that there were also other free entertainment shows going on at the adjacent malls, from live music to lei making classes.Other feature is the complimentary breakfast, nothing really special about it, other than the fact that you should not leave for food unattended while getting something else because the eating area is ""guarded"" by little hungry birds that are waiting to steal your meals. The business center was a little small, with a couple computers but still quite prepared with printers, fax, etc. However, there was free (wired) complimentary internet is the room. Also, the pool needs a little improvement, it was kind of small for such a big hotel, and it had really high amounts of chlorine.On the other hand, the fitness center was, in my opinion, great. It had the right amount of training equipment and it was always clean. Also, the laundry center, there were lots of washing and drying stations, as well as a soap vending machine and a coin dispenser.In a few words...I recommend this hotel mainly because it was nicely located, nearby lots of stores, there was free entertainment, the rooms and installations were clean, and the staff was friendly.The only things I disliked, the fact that in order to use the elevator, you always had to have your room key, otherwise, it just wouldn't work. Also, the 4th floor, where the breakfast and pool areas are located, well, basically anyone could have access to them since they were connected to the adjacent mall.","Monterrey, Mexico",3,5.0

So when we saw all the rave reviews for this Embassy Suites, we jumped on it and booked our 5 day stay there. It was a bit more than we wanted to pay, but we figured with the free breakfast buffet, it was worth the extra money. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our stay. The staff was very nice, accommodating, and friendly. One porter, in particular, (his name is Johnny) was very nice and even lent us a bunch of beach gear (chairs, beach toys for our daughter, boogie board). He also gave us a lot of great tips on tours, including our self-guided tour of USS Arizona Memorial/Mighty Mo/USS Bowfin. (Hint: There is a shuttle bus that stops by the hotel that can drop you off at Pearl Harbor for $14 RT, rather than taking the prohibitively expensive guided tours.)As for the rooms themselves, they were good-sized and had plenty of amenities. The beds were very comfortable and our cleaning crew was prompt and did a good job (this is a tall order since we have a very active toddler who likes to scatter stuff). Oh, and their toiletries were actually quite nice. I’m a shampoo and conditioner snob; and even I liked the Embassy’s offerings.The breakfast buffet was a good deal- plenty of selection and tasty. In fact, we never had to eat lunch because we were still so stuffed from breakfast.My husband very much enjoyed the Manager’s Happy Hour from 5:30-7:30. The drinks were strong and there was a wide selection to choose from. On a few nights, they even had live dance entertainment.If I were to give any critiques of the Embassy Suites Honolulu, I would say that it does get loud in the evening/night due to its location right in the middle of the hustle-bustle. So we couldn’t leave our windows open at night. I would also recommend maybe upgrading their windows to a more sound-proof variety, as we could really hear the sirens go off from fire/police trucks at night.Also, they should implement some sort of bird control around the food pavilion. The huge pigeons & sparrows were running/flying amok whenever someone would leave their unfinished plate behind; or if there were some crumbs on the floor.Overall, though, we highly recommend this place and would stay here again.",SunnySoCAL,77,4.0

We stayed for 8 nights at this very nice hotel, our rooms were very clean and comfortable, especially the beds. The hotel has two separate towers, we stayed in room 1123 which was on the 11th floor in the ""Hula"" tower, this tower overlooks the pool deck on the fourth floor, and has ocean glimpses. The room had two separate bedrooms, each with it's own bathroom and flat screen Television, the main lounge area had a sofa couch and single lounge chair, and another flat screen Television. It had a small kitchenette, a fridge, microwave and sink, but it didn't have any crockery or utensils at all, we had to take a spoon from the breakfast area. The balcony had a nice view of the pool deck and water views. The pool deck is where they serve breakfast and in the evening drinks from the bar. The buffet breakfast which is included in the nightly rate was fantastic, everything you could want, and a great omlette bar, where you selected the ingredients and the chef cooked it for you. In the evening between the hours of 5.30pm and 7.30pm they had free drinks from the bar, yes thats right free drinks for two hours, cocktails, beer, wine, spirits, as much as you wanted, with a friendly reminder to be responsible about it. The hotel is in a good spot, a short 5 minute stroll to the beach, it's away from the busy part of Waikiki, very family friendly and quiet. I thought the hotel was great, but it wasn't the cheapest, so I expected it to be nice. The reception upon check in wasn't all that friendly, but the rest of the staff were great, in particular the bar staff.","Melbourne, Australia",56,4.0

I was attending a college graduation of a relative and turned my stay into a vacation as well. I was going to be on Oahu for 12 days. I had booked my room many months in advance with the AAA rate, which was very reasonable when compared to other hotels that I had looked into. Upon check-in, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they upgraded my 1 bedroom city view room to an ocean view room on the 20th floor (2032) right next to the elevators. While I was aware of some previous negative reviews that complained about the noise of the elevator, it did not bother me. One - I have a slight hearing disability and two, I'm a sound sleeper. I actually liked that I was next to the elevator to quickly get to and leave my room. Having free breakfast every morning was great! Didn't have to worry about leaving the hotel to find a place to eat. Overall staff was wonderful. Location was great! Close to the mall, walking distance to the International Marketplace and lots of restaurants to choose from. Valet parking was pricey at $25/day but it was a necessary expense. Some other folks said that a car is not necessary, but I found it preferable to explore the island at my own leisure on certain days. I did do some excursions where pick-up or transportation is provided to Waikiki area, but still preferred to get around the island on my own. I recommend visiting the Polynesian Cultural Center - pay for 1 day with pick-up service and you can return there within 3 days on your own to visit PCC and explore some more. I also recommend visiting Kualoa Ranch, where I did both the 2 hour horseback tour and 2 hour mountain biking tour. The views of the mountains and valley at Kualoa Ranch are magnificent. There's a post office 1 block away. This was a big plus because I bought too much stuff and it was cheaper for me to ship stuff back home than risk being overweight with my luggage. USPS has large flat rate boxes that cost about $15/box.","Jersey City, New Jersey",7,5.0

The whole operation runs very smoothly and we were very comfortable the whole time. Check-in is handled while seated. Each receptionist acts as an advisor as well, pointing out facilities and explaining operations. I was very impressed with their level of competence and patience.We had an ocean view unit with king bed, with views of Fort de Russy on one side and the ocean on another. Although the unit was very clean and bright, it is a bit smaller than in other ES's. Since the bathroom opens from the master bedroom, anyone sleeping in the sitting area would have to walk through the master bedroom to use the facilities. This would be OK for families with small children, but not for older members. With just the two of us, however, the arrangement was perfect. The room attendant was very efficient and acted like a French concierge, always watching carefully to see who came and went. I appreciated this sense of security.Happy hour is extremely well organized and the bartenders are skillful in pouring and mixing drinks quickly. There is even a sign board featuring available spirits and drinks. Three nights a week entertainment is featured. But it is at breakfast where I found exceptional service. With a dozen employers overseeing operations, tables are quickly cleaned. In fact, there is a sense of team spirit in the works here. I suspect workers are quite pleased with their jobs. Yes, some of the dishes might be greasy at times but there is plenty of fresh fruit, which is usually replenished within minutes. Roy's is an institution and provides great variety. There is even a four-course vegan menu with 3 oz. wine pairings for $49 ($35 wihout). For an informal lunch by the beach, head on over to the Outrigger across the way and have their mahi-mahi plate lunch at the Shore Bird. $15. But for a special treat, sneak over to the Halekulani and snag a table at the House Without A Key for extra special mai-tais, prepared with very high quality rum and fresh mix--not overly sweet. Then order a fresh grouper for $23 plus $5 for side dishes. (Request Ian--he is that good.)If you have not seen the whole island of Oahu, E Noa offers a Circle Island tour that includes lots of stops and plenty of time to take pictures or even short walks.

Having grown up and still have a lot of family in Hawaii, I’m fairly picky about Hawaii hotels since we have alternatives. That said, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. We found the hotel to be very convenient with a helpful staff, nice rooms, most of the amenities you could want and all for a reasonable price.The hotel is located one block from the public beach at the Eastern end of Waikiki. I think it is a little quieter than the Diamond Head end but with very easy access to the beach. Rooms are fairly generously sized. We had two queen beds with a dresser, wardrobe and flat screen tv in one room. The other room had a sofa, chair, coffee table, work table with wired high speed internet, a dresser/tv stand, flat screen tv, a few chairs. There was also a wet bar area with a small refrigerator and typical bathroom. Overall furnishings were tropical resort themed, e.g. pineapple designs on the couch but tasteful and not overly garish. Everything was very new and well maintained. There was a loose hinge on one dresser door which the hotel staff quickly fixed after we informed them. The hotel seemed fairly small actually which made it more intimate.We found the hotel to be very clean and comfortable. The breakfast was included which made it very convenient and easily made for the difference in price compared to other hotels. The staff was helpful always; housekeeping always left thank you notes for tips, food service staff went out of their way to be helpful and bell desk staff was fast and friendly. The location of the hotel itself was convenient as well, but getting in and out might be slightly confusing for some people since the entrance and exit are on a one way street leading to nowhere precisely. We did not make use of the usual vacation items, e.g. pool, guest services, kid’s activities, so I can’t really speak to them.The major drawback was that the hotel was valet parking only. At $25 a day, the rate was high but either comparable or lower than other hotels in the area. We always got our car quickly and there was never and issue of the lot being full. Room service, of course, was expensive and mediocre at best. We ordered room service a few times and the best part of the meal was the fresh fruit.I would stay there again and would highly recommend the Embassy Suites Waikiki to anyone but especially families with children",St. Paul,192,5.0

The happy hour drink line was always swift. The happy hour entertainment was good and the breakfasts were always very good. Easily would pay $10 to $12 per person elsewhere in Waikiki for the type of breakfast buffet provided. The staff was always very friendly and exhibited the ""Aloha spirit"" unforced. One of the managers in the breakfast area (Russell) spent several minutes with us in the AM giving us great North Shore tips with a map when we told him that was our plan for the day. Modest but well earned tips for the friendly and hard working cleaning ladies resulted in plentiful beach towels as needed.The only drawback; the beach is about a 1 block walk. Not so bad but that part of the beach is not the best. We would always walk down the beach (toward Diamondhead) a couple more blocks to be in front of the Royal Hawaiian beach area. Better waves, better beach area, Duke's nearby for beverages and/or lunch. Not a big deal considering that we did a lot more on the island besides hanging on Waikiki beach.Tip: talk to the bellman about checking out beach stuff (chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards, etc).

The staff is friendly and the location is excellent for walking to shopping, restaurants and beach. The rooms are much smaller than your standard Embassy Suites. I'm an Hhonors member and my profile requests rooms AWAY from the elevators, so of course they ""upgraded"" us to room 1121, right next to the elevator. Since we we're only staying the one night, I decided it wasn't worth asking to be moved, but the elevator did make a small room even smaller. But we we're only actually in our room long enough to sleep and shower. They are very generous with the alcohol in the drinks at reception. Our flight home in the morning was at 8 AM and the breakfast didn't open until 6:30, but we went down at 5:45 and they put together a couple boxed for us with fruit, yogurt and danishes and turned on the beverage machines so we could have something really quick on our way to the airport, we we're very thankful for that.

They could fit a second one on the rooftop somewhere either for adults of smaller children, Grumpy adults do not like kids splashing them so it really was taken over by the kids. The pool side massage 20 minutes for 20 dollars was nice. And yes, there Mai Tais and Lava flows were a good value and tastey!Terribly slow elevators that made you wait forever (Aloha Tower). Our 2 bedroom suite on the 17th floor had a peek of diamond head and overlooked the beachwalk area. although the location was convenient, the noise from the street was not very relaxing.

You are close to all that you will need -- PF Changs is across the street, a starbucks for in the morning, and the cheapest board rental that we found on the island (15$ per hour for a paddleboard -- really cheap). Then we went to the managers reception and had a great maitai and Margarita -- and they did not spare the tequila or rum. I am a frequent traveler and Hilton Honors member, thus have witnessed a ton of 'manager's receptions.' This was by far THE best in terms of the drinks. The food, however, wass non-existent -- chips and goldfish. The drinks, however, made it all worthwhile. After dinner at a terrific best PF Chang's (across the street), it was time for bed. Waking up early courtesy of jet lag, we started at the Starbucks, then watched the dawn over the beach and the waves -- only one block away -- so nice. Met the family for a terrific breakfast -- everything was great. I might suggest more local fruit and fruit juices, but other than that, the omelettes were the best I have had in a long time. They extended our stay for an hour gratis and then held our bags so we could tour before getting on our cruise ship. When I return to Hawaii, I will definitelys stay at this hotel.

Our most FAVORITE thing about this hotel was the fabulous full breakfast that was served each day, buffet style. I have never eaten so many different omelette combinations in my life!The one and only thing we were somewhat disappointed in was the food served during the manager's reception each day. Based on photos and videos we had seen prior to our stay there, we envisioned heavy hors d'ouvres ... instead, each day the food was either peanuts and chips/salsa, or chex mix and chips/salsa. I will say, however, that the free drinks more than made up for the snacks!!Even though this hotel is not situated ON the beach, we were less than a block away from the beach -- it was easily accessible.

It was an excellent hotel for the purpose and we will absolutely stay here again the next time we return to Waikiki.Our reason for selecting this hotel was our desire to have 2 separate sleeping rooms, as we have 2 young children including an infant who cries a lot at night. We didn't want the other child to wake up throughout the night, and the room served this purpose admirably.We were in Room 721 overlooking the pool/courtyard area and with a limited view of the ocean. The room has 2 separate lanais each big enough to hold a couple of chairs; 2 flat-screen TVs; a wet bar with a fridge, microwave, and sink. The inside room is the bedroom with a king bed, while the main room contains a sitting area, a small dinette set, the wet bar, and the bathroom. We were next to the elevator, and could indeed hear the elevator in the evenings and at night. This could be a problem for very light sleepers, but for us it worked wonderfully as the screaming infant was less likely to bother the next-door neighbors (sorry upstairs and downstairs!). A pair of earplugs, for light sleepers, would have been more than enough to deal with this minor issue.The room is in excellent condition. Spotlessly clean, very fresh/new-looking, with granite surfaces on wet bar and in bathroom. Provided are big comfortable beach towels, comfortable if not super-soft bath towels, and the usual toiletries.Service: valet parking only, generally very speedy with the only drawbacks being 1. no call-downs permitted and 2. spendy at $25 per day, though that is comparable to all Waikiki hotels. We requested nothing special from the hotel regarding services, but I did ask the concierge/activities desk once for a running route suggestion and he gave me several good ideas.Breakfast: Embassy Suites provides a full complimentary breakfast with the room, and it did not disappoint. It includes seasonal, local fruit (alas, papaya only one day, but pineapple every day, also variously watermelon, canteloupe, honeydew), eggs, french toast, pancakes, meats, oatmeal, cold cereal, baked items, miso soup, rice/nori for those wanting a Japanese-style breakfast, and absolutely scrumptious made-to-order hot omelettes (available egg-whites only if you prefer) including fresh vegetables such as spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, etc). Local Lions coffee and fresh island-style (passion-guava) juices rounded out the offerings. Very satisfying way tot start the day.Reception: every evening there are free drinks (beer, wine, mixed tropical drinks, well drinks) and chips/crackers at the pool. We enjoyed it although we are not big drinkers. I suppose if you wanted to you could get liquored up for free before hitting the town! It's a very nice, relaxed, inviting atmosphere.Pool: It's in very good condition and nicely landscaped. There is an elliptical hot tub measuring perhaps 20x10 feet and was nice as we had very cool weather during our stay. The pool does not get a lot of sun during the day due to nearby buildings but that is not unusual for Waikiki.Beach: literally a 5 minute walk across Kalia street. While not technically beachfront, the hotel's location is 'just about' and not far enough away from the beach to even mention it. Great location on a quiet side street off Kalakaua - close to the action, but the noise won't bother you.There is a free business center with free internet, fax, and printing; a free fitness center in excellent condition with free weight dumbbells to 50 pounds and several treadmills; and free internet in the room.All in all, considering the 2 rooms, included breakfast, free internet, fitness center, business center, evening reception, and location, this was an excellent stay and a good value.

The room with two queens had a door to the hallway making it easy to come and go without disturbing anyone in the other rooms.We really enjoyed eating breakfast there each morning, and also enjoyed the evening receptions.

Also hotel was booked up (95%) and could not change rooms. Regardless the room itself was very spacious and clean though. If you stay here get a room at least on the 7th floor or above, most rooms can't see the ocean, ""Rear Window"" effect for many rooms due to bigger and higher hotels and condos that surround this property that all have balconies (lanais) that are looking straight into your room. Breakfast buffet, although a lot of food is worse then most Stateside Embassy Suites I've stayed at, in my opinion. Lots of fresh pineapple, but after that its a dismal choice of scrambled eggs or cooked to order omelets, all very ho-hum. The hotel is surrounded by an amazing array of restaurants and stores, if you come to Waikiki to shop and eat then this is your destination. The beach is at least a 2 block walk, but the beach here at Waikiki is nice, not too crowded. Parking is very efficient, but costly at $25 and valet only which adds up if you tip the hard working valets.

The beaches are close by too; it is literally a 2-3 minute walk to Fort Derussy Beach Park (just across the street), or about 5 minutes to the heart of Waikiki beach (just east of the hotel...Waikiki beach is really so much nicer, and certainly better for swimming than the beach at Fort Derussy Beach Park, but on the other hand, if you're just looking to get some sun, Fort Derussy Beach Park isn't nearly as busy). And it's only a 2 minute walk to Kalakaua Avenue if you need a shopping fix.This hotel is also excellent value. When you consider the morning buffet breakfast with made-to-order omelet bar is included, and the complimentary drinks at the nightly manager's reception, it is really hard to beat the bang for your buck you get here relative to the other hotels in Waikiki. Like most other Embassy Suites, the rooms are very spacious (every room also has 2 balconies (one off the living room and one off the bedroom), the beds are comfortable, everything in the room was in good working order, and kept very clean. In fact, the entire property including the outdoor pool area on the fourth floor ""Grand Lanai"" is kept exceedingly clean. The only disappointment this trip was there were some slight cutbacks since our visit last year. Namely, the take-away coffee cups available in the mornings have shrunk to about half the size they were last year, and the hula dancers performing at the nightly manager's reception now only perform 2 nights per week instead of nightly. When I asked about the coffee cups and hula dancers, I was told it was ""due to the recession, sir"". But that's really just being nitpicky and is no reason for not staying here.

Two balconies, very comfy king/good sheets, nice sized bathroom, two flat screens, free (but slow) wireless, decent in room coffee, fridge, microwave. The complimentary breakfast was much better than we expected (we liked that they change a few of the items daily).

The bartender's at the evening reception were personable, and poured a great drink. The Manager was on-site, and always pleasant to talk to. The breakfast included in the rate is top notch including American and Japanese items. The location is great. Yes, this property is not on the beach... it is across the street from it. The beach is literally a 3 minute walk from the lobby of the hotel. Restaurants, both chain and local eateries, along with excellent shopping are literally at your door step. I had a great Thanksgiving dinner at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse that is connected to the hotel, that the concierge arranged with a smile. The Valets in the car park are some of the nicest guys on the island, and are always ready with directions. So fast, the car was up before you could even sit down. Can't say enough nice things about this hotel.","St. Petersburg, Florida",37,5.0

I didn't know whether I could expect the same experience at the Embassy suites in Hawaii, but I wasn't disappointed.When we arrived we were unexpectedly upgraded from a 1 Bedroom King (w/o an ocean view) to a 1 Bedroom King with an ocean view. It happened to be on the top floor (21st floor) and had a wrap around balcony with great views of the ocean and mountains. In the attached photos you'll see the Reef OutRigger (and their pool area). Also, you can see the path on the left of the OutRigger that leads to the beach, or if you dislike the path (I read one reviewer who complained about this path) you can just as easily cut through the pool area of the OutRigger.Our unit was a little smaller than most, because a portion of it was cut off by the emergency stairway, but we didn't complain as we had a great view with the wrap around balcony. Our unit had two flat panel lcd TV's and two separate air conditioning units - one for the bedroom and one for the sitting room. The air conditioners were on separate thermostats and both were very quiet. The King mattress was really comfortable and my wife loved the sheets and pillows.The unit came with a micro, mini fridge, safe, and wet bar. The in room coffee was very good as was the maid service. Every morning between 6:30 AM and10:00 AM we had a complimentary breakfast where we had an amazing choice of items such as: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, muffins, cold cereals, salad, fruits (pineapple, melons, cantaloupe, apples, oranges..), miso soup, rice, seaweed wraps, seawood seasoning (for the rice), juices (apple, orange, grapefruit). Plus, you could order your own fried eggs to your liking, and/or have an omellete with your own added ingredients (mushrooms, onions, bacon bits, vegetables, etc.). There were also pancakes, French toast, and other foods that I never did try and some that I couldn't identify.In the evenings there was a Manager's reception between from 5:30 to 7:30 PM that included free alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The bar included wines, beers, and some cocktails (Mai Tais, Manhattan, Tequila Sunrise, Whiskey, etc.)On our last day our evening flight was at 9:30 PM, so we thought we would be stuck for hours with not much to do but (window) shop, but the hotel kept our luggage in their storage room and gave us access to their complimentary room (first come first serve) to shower and change clothes. So, after our 11:00 AM check out, I went to Hanauma Bay for some snorkeling and came back in the late afternoon for a shower and change of clothes before catching our flight back home.This is a great location for shopping, restaurants and night life. Attached to our Hotel is the Yardhouse and for a fancier restaurant, Roys'. Just around the corner is Senior Frog's, theCheesecake Factory, high quality Japanese and Chinese restaurants etc. Also, just aound the corner is some amazing shopping, if you can afford shopping in the high end shops. There's also some cheaper shopping in the same area, so there's shopping for every budget. And, as I found out an ABC store on every block.",vancouver,4,5.0

It did! Most of the other reviewers are quite accurate in describing the pros of this 3 year old hotel, but it was even a step higher, and better than I expected. Room had partial ocean view, comfortable beds, and a separate room with hideaway & another TV. Yeah.It was a treat to have a great breakfast, with eggs/omelets prepared to order. Every morning they would have bacon/sausage/eggs/pancakes/miso soup/rice/fruit, etc...but each morning they tried to have at least one something different....portuguese sausage, bread pudding, or papaya halves for a little variety. Appreciated the TV set-up for Sunday mornings important Football game at breakfast!The 2 hour 'happy hour' with snacks was such a Plus! No pre-mixed drinks, bartenders hand mixed each Mai-Tai, Blue Hawaiian, Hawaiian Punch, Margaritas, etc, with wine and/or beer available. Never were we cut off, nor did the drinks lose liquor as the night rolled on. Thanks guys! Make sure you have a few $$ for their great service. Friday night there are city fireworks about 7p? Saturday night was Hawaiian entertainment. Only problem with this sweet happy hour, you weren't really hungry for dinner. Suggest crossing Lewers and getting a pizza to take back to the room. Lewers Steet/Beachwalk Shopping had several levels of shopping/window licking...and a hopping crowd the whole few blocks.Another good near-by restaurant to get a reasonable meal was 'Eggs & Things' on Sarasota...a enjoyable walk. Go for the Calamari Steak or the Ahi Tuna at Dinner (see my Tripadvisor Review).Dukes @ the Outrigger is another hopping place, day or night. And their meal prices aren't too expensive.We rented an Advantage car for $13/day, but parking is a beast. Parked near the Banyan way across Waikiki for $10/day...and Pop took the bus ($1/senior citizen rate) back to our end of the beach and walked to the Embassy. Save $15/day...so we could spend it somewhere else. Granddarlin enjoyed their pool and with such beautiful surroundings, I was reluctant to make us retreat indoors. Access to the beach, was to cross Kalia Street to the narrow access between hotels. The Shorebird Restaurant is at the beach end of the access. The Outrigger Catamaran Sailing/Snorkeling guys set up their chairs/umbrella and (Jason or Rabbit) will explain their sailings. We booked the 10a Turtle Snorkel & Sail 2-1/2 hrs(M-W-F) for $42/$47. Not far off-shore is a 'turtle cleaning' station where sea turtles come, to have fish clean them. Catamaran & Equipment was good. Offered $1 soft drinks or $3/$5 Onolicious adult beverage. Saw many sea turtles, and even some came to water's top to say hello to us. Also saw whale blows, and sailed into several pods of spinner dolphins. Awesome for kiddos & adults alike.Snorkeled at Turtle Bay, Hanauma Bay, and swam at beautiful Kailua Beach....Beautiful.","Arlington, Texas",84,5.0

It's what I expect and a bit more from an Embassy Suites and I was very satisfied with my stay.Location: It's located towards the western edge of Waikiki just as you begin to enter the heart of Waikiki. You're conveniently located to all that you'd want to visit in Waikiki (stores, restaurants, beach, etc) without being directly in the middle of the hustle and bustle. There is public beach access directly across the street and it's not a long walk to Kuhio Beach Park and Kapiloani Park. You could even walk to Diamond Head if you were so inclined. And for Waikiki the Embassy Suites has relatively easy access to the H1 and Nimitz Hwy to get you out of Waikiki.Rooms: The rooms are standard Embassy Suite style one and two bedroom suites that are large and comfortable. The room has a fridge and microwave and HBO comes free on the TV for those that care about that sort of thing.Amenities: The breakfast is a complementary buffet with an omelet station, french toast, pancakes, bacon, sausage, variety of fruit, home fries, rice, miso soup, pastries, and toast/bagels. There is also a managers reception each evening with free drinks (beer, wine, cocktails) and snacks (nuts and chips). The gym there is pretty nice as far as hotel gyms go. There are treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, dumbbells up to 50lbs, and a universal cable gym.The free Internet is not as fast as some hotels I've stayed in but not as slow either. It's adequate for checking email and general web surfing. Just don't expect to download music and movies at a fast clip.Be aware that as with most hotels in Waikiki it is valet only parking. It is $25 per day for hotel guests.","Arlington, Virginia",51,5.0

Overall, we would say it was a very typical Embassy Suites, so we knew what we would get. Upon check in, we found that we would get a room with 2 queen beds instead of the king bed that had been requested and verified over 5 months earlier. Not a big deal, but mildly disappointing. The room was very comfortable, but since we had just spent 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt in Kauai, our standards were probably set a little too high. The bath tub was the smallest tub I had ever seen---not a problem for a shower-type person, but it really seemed out of place for such a nice hotel. The breakfast and the cocktail hour were very nice and helped with the expenses! Location-it is not on the beach. Close to some great shopping and restaurants, but if you want a beach vacation, you may not be happy with the location. The biggest disappointment with the E.S., though, was the concierge. Every time (at least 4 times) we approached the concierge, they always made an excuse of why they couldn't help, and referred us to the bell captain. Luckily, the bell captain was helpful. It seems that the concierge closes fairly early, and if it is close to their end time, they were not willing to help. We talked with another couple staying there who was clearly given wrong information by the ooncierge---they were told the trolley did not go to Diamond Head. We knew that was wrong because we had just purchased a trolley ticket and visited the site. Why would they purposely give wrong information? The only thing we could think of was that they prefer tours that they might get a commission on. Enough, though! Overall the Embassy Suites did a fine job and we were very satisfied with our stay. It's hard to be disappointed for long when you're staying on a beautiful island with great people and lovely weather. We had a trip of a lifetime, and were happy to be in paradise for awhile!

I decided to book the Embassy instead of the Hilton because I thought we'd save money with the free breakfast and drinks, and the location seemed better. Boy was that a mistake! We coudn't even see the ocean from our room or the pool area--and the city noise was deafening. I felt like I was in NY City instead of Hawaii! The rooms were typical Embassy Suites, which are nice if one is skiing in Tahoe, but very dark for a tropical location. The walk to the beach was a nightmare with 2 kids and all our gear. The public path is stinky, narrow, and crowded--and the beach area there has a lot of coral. You need to walk another 15 minutes to get to the good part of Waikiki beach. By the second day we all had blisters and were miserable from the walk. The next morning the conceriege said we could all buy a day pass at the Sheraton's pool (which had water slides so the kids were jumping for joy). After walking all the way there, the Sheraton said the pool is for registered guests only! My heart broke at the look of disappointment on my kids faces! On day 4, I was sitting by the pool trying to talk on the phone, and the garbage trucks were so loud I couldn't hear a thing. I couldn't take it anymore! So I called the Hilton and we transfered to that hotel. What a difference! The pool, the Lagoon, the grounds, the room...it was beautiful!

We usually visit Maui but decided to visit Oahu this time. We are Hilton Honors members and we wanted to use our Hilton points, so we decided on the Embassy Suites. It did not disappoint. We were greeted by the friendly valet staff when we pulled in to the very cool open air atrium. Even though we were using our Hilton points they upgraded our room upon request at no extra charge, Our room was very clean and comfortable. I thought it was going to be a problem with the room being located next to the elevator, but it didn't bother us a bit. The view was mostly of the city and would have been a spectacular view if the Trump Tower was not there. We really enjoyed a full breakfast every morning and the manager's reception. This is one of the reasons we choose Embassy Suites whenever possible. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge. The hotel is conveniently located next to restaurants, shopping and the beach. One con is the price of parkingwas a little high @ $25 a day. We will stay there on our next trip!!","Granite Bay, California",6,4.0

My husband did need to work for a couple of days so I was on my own with my 2 kids under 5 and the hotel and location made it all easy. We could walk to a lot of shops and restaurants (2 good ones at the bottom of the hotel-Roys and Yardhouse).Pros: spacious room, huge breakfast with absolutely everything every morning (we filled up sippy cups w. milk, grabbed extra yogurt and fruit for the day too), pool only went to 4 feet, and had a special 1 1/2 ft. deep section that was perfect for my little one. We could order lunch poolside. There is a small fridge and microwave. The hotel had a great hula show and a band on the weekend during ""manager's hour"". When I decided I wanted to rent a double stroller, the hotel set us up with that. the hotel can also set up babysitting (don't know for how much). So it was very family friendly. We were high enough up on an end unit so we had a great view. Rolling crib was easy to move my son in and out of the main bedroom without waking him. A/C was mostly loud enough to drown out noise in the other room. I slept on the pull out couch a few nights and it was fine as well. All the service personnel were friendly and anytime we needed something in the room, they were at our door in minutes.Cons: Parking was $25 a day, but it was kind of the same everywhere. The beach was a long block away down a narrow path and once we got there, there wasn't much of it (water was nice there though) with great views of Diamondhead. All the concierges weren't so great- they sent us to a great free hula class but it was serious and really for adults only, when asking for a local place to get a quick bite to eat, they recommended only fast food chains. There is no restaurant in the hotel so the only place to get food after the morning buffet closes is at the pool bar (good menu though). Beach rentals seemed cheapest by the Outrigger Reef condos if you walked along the beach a bit to the north.We were very happy there and would stay there again, it is right in the heart of great shopping and you can take the bus fairly easily, although we rented a car and saw all of the island.","napa, ca",3,4.0

I was not disappointed. When we arrived, I asked the person checking us in at the front desk if we could get a room with a great view since this was our first time to Hawaii. We paid for a city view, but they were able to upgrade us to an ocean view room on the 20th floor of the Hula Tower. Amazing views.The breakfast each morning was huge with lots of variety and allowed us to either skip or have a very light lunch. Eggs, yogurt, sausages, bacon, omelets, pancakes, french toast, bagels, muffins, cereal and fruit. The manager's reception was also a nice bonus. We would wander down and grab a few drinks before heading out to dinner. Helped to save on the bar bill at the restaurant.The rooms were spacious, clean and well designed. We loved having the two rooms (with the door that closed between them) in case one of us got up earlier than the other. We didn't park a car overnight, mostly due to the $25 charge, but rented a car for 2 separate days and the activity desk was very helpful booking that for us. Between walking and the bus, we were never far from any activity.All in all, we were very happy with our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Hawaii. Great spot. Great staff.

It was a great time! When our taxi pulled up, there was someone there to see if we needed help with our bags. Check-in was fast and our room was ready even though we got there before 3pm. They had upgraded us to an ocean view in the Hula Tower. We were on the 14th floor and really enjoyed spending evenings sitting out on the balcony and soaking it all up! Our suite was comfortable, roomy and CLEAN. Same can be said about the bathroom too! The breakfast buffet was excellent! Scrambled eggs, potatoes, fruit, french toast, pancakes, rice, breads and pastries and the omelet station - just to name some things. The Kona coffee is delish as well as the guava juice. The evening manager's reception was a great way to start the evening. A good choice of beer, wine and tropical drinks to choose from, and the snacks were decent too. We enjoyed using the pool and hot tub, and the pool bar was nice to have right there. (if Lewis is bartending - he is great! A local that can tell you lots of great advice for the island). The beach is just a short walk away, and we set up in front of the beach by the Hale Koa/Ft Derussy area. There is a stand to rent kayaks, surf boards, etc - but we rented 2 loungers and an umbrella. A little pricy at $40 - but it's for the whole day, and if you plan on staying out all day - definitely worth it to have an umbrella to escape from the hot sun now and then. The whole Waikiki Beach Walk area is new and nice and there's lots to choose from to eat or shop. There is an ABC store across from the Embassy Suites, & also a Coco Cove located on property for drinks, snack, souvenirs, etc. (Definitely utilize that mini-kitchen and fridge to save $$$). If you go down Lewers St - hit Moose McGillycuddys for Happy Hour (4-7pm). Great drinks for just a short walk away. I could go on and on. Can't say enough about this place! All of the staff are helpful and super friendly. A great Aloha Spirit here!! We spent the remaining 4 nights on North Shore - which is a nice balance from busy Waikiki. We waited until we checked out of Embassy Suites to go rent our car. Not worth it to have a car in Waikiki. I believe the ES charges $25/day to park. And why bother - you can walk everywhere. The ES is great to arrange an airport shuttle to take you to the rental places. Just call down to the front desk and they will get it done for you. Also - there are a couple of concierges that walk around at breakfast if you want them to arrange fun things like luaus, dinner cruises, etc. We did some parasailing through their help. Highly recommend it!! We plan to make a trip to Oahu every year... and we will definitely be coming back to stay here! ALOHA!!","Overland Park, Kansas",3,5.0

Plenty of other standard hot breakfast items as well as the cereal and juices you would expect. We were on the 17’Th floor with an ocean view room that we could lay in bed and look out across the sea. Standing on the balcony we were able to see both the mountains and the ocean. The staff was very helpful and attentive to our requests. The manager’s reception in the evening was a great way to either start of the night or to relax after a long day. The drink selection was excellent and the ambiance of the pool area at night was amazing.

We were very pleased last year and were hoping for another great experience.My husband works in Honolulu on business each fall and last year he decided to give this new hotel a go. He was pleased enough that he came back again this year to stay. I traveled out with our youngest child and spent 9 nights at the Embassy Suites visiting with him. Once again, we were very pleased.The suite was a traditional 2 Queen 1 bedroom suite with pool views and partial ocean views from the 7th floor of the Aloha Tower.The breakfast is still fantastic. I love how they let you put your selected omelet toppings in a bowl and then hand then to the chef. Both omelet stations were open each morning and there were two sides each serving the same selection. Along with the traditional American breakfast offerings there were Japanese selections too.The dining area is well staffed with people ready to clean your table or assist you as needed. Concierge staff would also walk around and assist you with any directions or tours you might be interested in booking. My son and I were able to book a tour to Sea Park with the hotel's concierge and it was pleasurable to be able to do this easily while enjoying our breakfast.We also had a chance to meet Chef Glenn who sent cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, and milk to our room later on that afternoon! What a lovely treat! Thank you Chef Glenn and hotel staff! The construction on the Trump tower is near completion so the noise near the pool area was so much better this year. The staff keeps the pool area very clean and it is a nice place to relax but please don't miss the beach! The walk to to the beach will take you about 5 minutes and it is well worth your time. Towels are available at the pool on the 4th floor.Our room was serviced by two very nice ladies during our stay. They were kind enough to clean our room first thing in the morning so that we could come back and eat our lunch in there before heading to the beach and pool for the afternoon. The room was kept very clean and we were told that if we weren't happy, to please let them know. There were two things that were very different from last year. The Manager's Reception really cut back on the snack selections. Throughout our stay they either served chips without salsa, peanuts, goldfish crackers, spicy potato chips, or a Chex mix. They rotated between 2 of these offerings each night. The other thing that was different is that there is no longer a bed turn down service each evening. I'm sure that the economy has something do with these cuts but we did miss both the greater selection at the evening reception and the turn down service. Perhaps when the economy improves, they will be returned.The location is still excellent. Many more restaurants and shops have opened up along the Walk downstairs from the hotel. You can shop at high end designers such as Burberry, Prada, Coach, or Juicy Couture. Along with those high end shops, you will find local art galleries, jewelry shops, ABC discount stores, and even a Macy's Department Store. You can dine at The Cheesecake Factory, Cheeseburger in Paradise, Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville, PF Changs, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Roy's, Duke's - you name it. These and many more are all within walking distance of the hotel.Our biggest complaint this year - the internet connection in our room was VERY SLOW. It was just as slow in the business center. It was so slow that I could not print out boarding passes for our plane ride home. I tried to do this in both our room and in the business center. It has been very frustrating from my husband when he needs to log on for work and the speed is like the old dial up connection we all started with years ago.",N.J.,69,5.0

From check in to check out this hotel and mainly the hotel staff impressed us at every turn. We had a two bedroom suite on the 5th floor that was shared by 4 women. The room was lovely with nice furniture, carpet and paint. The bathrooms were updated and spotless. Comfortable beds and a quiet (by Waikiki standards) location. The best thing about our entire stay was the fantastic staff. One of the bellmen, Jeff, was so great! Whenever he saw us he would ask what we were up to or even notice if only one or two of us were together instead of the whole group! Apparently the limousines in Waikiki charge the same as taxis and Jeff made sure we had a limo whenever possible. Kudos Jeff!The breakfast buffet was a great treat especially on those early mornings when we had meetings. Again, the staff was awesome! Happy hour was the only thing I would improve on. The drinks were good and the bartenders very friendly but something more substantial than chips and salsa and goldfish crackers would have been nice.Pool area was nice (4th floor) and really clean as was every other part of the hotel.

This time it was just two nights with the remainder of our vacation at a resort. If you are looking for a resort type of vacation this may not be your place. No beach, no fancy servers to wait on you hand and foot but it sure is a lot of fun.We received the same dry reception as last time when we checked in. (Maybe that's something that they could work on) Our room was ready on time with an upgrade. Housekeeping is wonderful. These were the cleanest rooms on our trip. Friday night managers reception was a bit of a dissapointment. I rembered lively guests and entertainment but all we found with our drinks were chips (no dips) and a subdued atmosphere. The bartenders were the same as on our last trip, very personable. We were alerted to the fact that offseason entertainment is only three nights a week so at least we had something to look forward to on Saturday. The entertainment did not disappoint. This is a fun place and almost everyone gets involved. Hawaiian music and dancers along with a little comedy. (Or was the comedy just the drinks?)There is no onsite restaurant but they serve great lunch type meals at the pool. Breakfast is better than the chain breakfast places with a buffet style and made to order egg dishes. Dining is right downstairs on the boardwalk. Upscale restaurants right aside fun pub type eateries.The beach is a short walk with everything that you could want available. (Chairs, umbrellas, surf boards, shark tours?) So, if you want a quiet resort type vacation you might want to check out another place. If you're looking for fun, food, and a great bunch of people, the beachwalk area is perfect and Embassy is the best of the lot.If you're looking for a fast internet connection, well, maybe you shouldn't be on vacation.",sunny socal,38,5.0

Without a doubt, this was the best hotel experience I've had in the many visits we've made, and that includes a stint at the Halekulani.From the minute you arrive at the valet stand, the staff is super-friendly. They smile, greet you, and seem happy with their jobs. Check-in was quick but unrushed (yes, it can be both!), and I was completely satisfied with both rooms we had. Our first room was a 1-bedroom with a partial ocean, but primarily city view in the Aloha Tower, and the second was a 2-bedroom suite on the 21st floor in the Aloha Tower. Rooms were clean and well-appointed, and this is the first hotel I've ever stayed in where I was actually able to use the provided conditioner and have it work on my hair.The morning breakfast had every possible food option under the sun, and I was a big fan of the miso soup and rice. I had an omelet one morning, and the young woman doing the prep was delightful and friendly. The evening Manager's Reception served up some potent mai tais and margaritas, and was also staffed by friendly folks. The pool area was spectacular, not necessarily in size...but in quality. It boasted saline chlorination, and a super-soft liner that felt downright bouncy. The hotel's location right on the newly renovated Beachwalk area is perfect...close to dining, shopping, and the beach. We were so pleased with our stay, that we plan on going back next year and staying the entire week. When I'm on vacation, I want to be around happy people...and I don't think we encountered a single staff member at the ES who didn't smile and at least say hello, if he or she didn't actually strike up a full conversation.Of note...both visits were made with HHonors points. I always wonder if somehow service will lack because you technically aren't paying for the visit. In this case, the answer was no. Bravo, Embassy Suites!","Allen, TX",92,5.0

A lot of the staff make you feel as if you are part of their family and the management of this hotel should be very proud of the way their customers are treated.

Only 1 chair could be seated on the balcony to enjoy the ocean and it was located on the very corner of the balcony. .Had I known that, I would have just reserved an inside siute.

We have stayed at many Embassy Suites and this is the best breakfast that we have been to. The evening reception was also a nice amenity that this hotel offers. The pool area is small compared to other resort hotels, but it was fine for us. The walk to the beach was a bit of a challenge with the kids. Also, make sure that you have water slippers if you are going to the beach. The sand felt like sharp rocks. The hotel is centrally located to many shops and restaurants, although it is quite a walk to the other side of Waikiki. There are plenty of great places to eat in that area.

If you absolutely need the extra space and have a big family to feed in the mornings, the value can't be beat.We reserved a king bed room away from elevators, of course they didn't have any king beds available when we checked in, and nothing away from the elevators. So, our first night was in a room that wasn't affected as much by the elevators as the service entrance below - trucks in and out (backing out...beep...beep...beep) from about 5am on. We had to check out at 11am, store our luggage and then come back later to check in to the king bed room away from the elevator that we reserved in the first place. They upgraded us to a partial ocean view room, so this was a plus. However a huge pain and waste of our vacation time to have to move around with our 10 month old who needed his naptime.

We also discovered that one of my children's carry-on luggage was left behind at the rental car counter. The bell staff immediately called the rental agency to place the luggage in the rental agency's office for us to pick up later. Much appreciated for his effort.Since we arrived at around 2pm, the room was not yet ready and the staff apologized. Since the kids were hungry, we asked for suggestion and were directed to a Burger in Paradise near by (which was so-so). We returned shortly after 3 and checked into our room.Our room was a 1-bedroom with 2 beds on the 15th floor with a city-view facing Fort Derussey. The room was very clean and the bathroom was spacious. We were right across the street of the Trump Tower, which is in the final phases of construction but did not bother us. The city-view was pretty at day or night-time.Our kids liked the grand lanai which has the pool area and the breakfast area. There was the big pool (3-4ft deep), a baby pool connected to the big pool (1ft deep) and a jacussi. Beach towels can be signed out freely and we took them to the beach. One tip, rinse off the sand in the pool area showers before trekking to your room. We made our entry area and bathroom super sandy one day and, fortunately, the cleaning staff was awesome and made everything spotless the next day.The breakfast has lots of standard hot foods (bacon, pancakes), cold foods (pineapple, watermelon, papaya), baked goods with toaster, and an omelet station. We usually just ordered a couple of eggs over-easy. Hotel staff would come over to clean the table and chat with the patrons. They often mistaken us for Japanese (which consisted about half the patrons) which we weren't. They were quite fluent in Japanese from what I saw. They give the kids a bag of candy each morning and ,upon knowing that it was our last day, gave each of us a shell lei as well.There are a lot of things to eat nearby with a lot of shopping. There are many ABC Stores near by which is good for getting snacks, drinking water, bamboo mat and toys for the beach. The beach is about 5-10min walk away via either side of the Outrigger Reef but the sand is pretty rough there. We either go to Waikiki (15min walk) or walk 5mins farther towards Hilton Hawaiian Village where the sand is nicer.There was so much to do that we had never turned on our two TVs. The valet parking was a little steep but the service was fast. Business center was great with free printing (for check-ins, etc). Coin-op laundry. 24hr fitness center. All in all, we had a wonderful, wonderful stay. The only minor drawback was that the hotel was not next to the beach, which is only an issue if you have young children.

I had read some earlier reviews about rude staff, and noise from construction next door, but I encountered neither. We stayed in the Aloha Tower on the 9th floor, and did not hear any noise from the Trump building going up next door, but we were on the side of the building away from the construction. The breakfast was also very good, especially considering the number of guests they had to serve each morning.

The rooms were beautiful, clean and very comfortable. The air conditioning was great - seperate controls in the bedroom and living room. Bathrooms are very comfortable and roomy. We coordinated some events through the hotel. Please see Cindy Meyers during breakfast - she is an event coordinator that is second to none. She not only gave us excellent advice, but gave us a detailed map of places to see and things to do. Her advice was right on the mark. They even provided us with a limo to go to dinner !!!

The Good:The staff- contrary to what some other reviews say, they were very welcoming and accomidating. by the way- there is a review on here that says that the cleaning crew comes late in the afternoon, this is completely false. The cleaning crew came to our room and clened our room everyday at 10am diligently.The location- waikiki beach and the international marketplace are only 2 blocks away along with various high end shops and food. Right in front of the hotel is also a beach. I wouldnt go so far as to say that it is private, but there are certainly less people that go there than waikiki. The View- there was a reviewer on here that complained about the fact that oceanview is on the higher levels, if you were call in your reservation, they will tell you this, not to mention, if you look at where this hotel is located, you can tell that there is a large hotel right in front of it, so it is obvious that the lower levels, you are not going to see anything. My family and I stayed in an oceanview hotel, and believe me, the view IS WORTH IT!The Check- In Area- I just love the fact that it is outsideThe Lawn Area- they hold a luau there i believe with a very nice native singer. Even without that, the area itself is beautiful with the fountainThe Torches- Hawaii! although they are all over waikiki, they are just beautiful and really give an authentic hawaiian feel. The Bad:Elevators- trying to work the elevater can be tricky, but there was a reviewer that said that the people that check you in do not explain how to work it, this is completely false. There are other reviewers that do not seem to understand that the reason why the elevaters are the way that they are is FOR YOUR SECURITY! The hotel, as others have stated, is very open to the public, so the elvaters is to give the people a little security!The Breakfast- I wouldnt say that it is terrible, just ok. the area in which yuo eat is outside so there are birds around all of the time so do not leave your food alone for too long because they will get to it!Happy hour- do not go for the appitizers, theyre horrible.

Many shops and restuarants outside the door. The Beach is just across the street. The Hotel has two Towers the Aloha and Hula Towers.

Moved to the Hula tower for our next six nights. Had a high room on the 16th floor with a nice view of the ocean. Suite had two Balconies, enjoyed our time drinking our morning coffee and watching the surfers, each day.The Breakfast is wonderful, many items to choose from. The evening Managers Reception was also fantastic.

My sister and her husband traveled with us and stayed in a room across the hall. One of the main reasons for selecting this hotel was the full breakfast buffet, and it more than lived up to our expectations. Food was good and plentiful. We usually consumed enough to sustain us until the early evening manager's reception (even the 2 teenagers), so that saved us a considerable amount of money. The housekeeping and pool staff, bellmen, and breakfast crew couldn't have been nicer, friendlier or more accommodating. The hotel lobby /reception staff, on the other hand, were not impressive. The hotel had issues with their computer system during our stay -- couldn't print room keys when we were checking in, so that delayed our ability to get in our room. Then on 2 separate mornings we were awoken before 7 am with fire alarms, only to discover it was another system problem. While greatly relieved the hotel wasn't really on fire, it was not thrilling to be awoken in that manner and at that early hour. While housekeeping and other staff we encountered during the day couldn't apologize enough for the problems (which obviously were well beyond their scope of responsibility), the lobby staff NEVER apologized or did anything to compensate for the inconveniences.Hotel is in a great location - and will be even better once the noice connected to the construction of Trump Towers across the street is completed.

The parking is valet-only for $25 per day. This may seem like a lot, but we found it wonderful to have the car available whenever we wanted it and the valet service was very speedy. The guys handling the cars would always ask if we needed directions or maps and were happy to answer questions. Check-in was easy and we were welcomed with a juice drink and quickly given our room keys. We were in a one bedrrom suite with a pull out sofa in the living room. We had a small fridge, microwave and sink.which was fine for what we needed. We had a small balcony off the living area and another off the bedroom. The bathroom was very large with double sinks and granite counters. Housekeeping provided plenty of fresh towels and toiletries each day. We did not find ""noise"" to be an issue...and we are quite picky! There was a hula show/band down on the lawn each afternoon/evening - but they were done by 7-730pm. We enjoyed having the music and entertainment right there and available each evening. Breakfasts were great for a family on the go. There were plenty of options including made-to-order omlettes, breakfast meats, juices, fresh fruit, breads & pasteries, cereal and yogurt. There is a huge eating area and we never had to wait for a clear table. Manager's party in the evening was nice, too. We would have a drink before heading out to dinner. Each night, there was live music and a hula dancer. This was a nice touch and added to the vacation feel of the property.The location is in the heart of the Beach Walk and includes lots of restaurants, shops and the always handy ABC Store. Within a 10 minute walk, you have unlimited choices in food and shopping. We found everything we needed for evening entertainment and meals without having to drvie anywhere.

Of course they booked tours for you but several times we just got suggestions which were helpful. The wait staff was equally helpful - Joy especially was super nice. The managers reception in the afternoon was very popular although we just listened to the music from our poolside balcony most afternoons. Loved all the Tiki torches and the waterfall! The staff was very meticulous about keeping the pool area and lanai clean and presentable - it was always beautiful and the housekeeping staff was very polite and did a great job as well. The only possible downside was the having to walk down to the beach - I liked the soft sand in front of the Royal Hawaiian vs the rocky beach in front of the Outrigger across the street.

The staff were exceptional, offering to help carry hot drinks, provide detailed map and travel information, etc. Reception was welcoming and relaxed. Our 1 bedroom suite was fine, the kitchenette with sink, refri, and microwave were handy. The best thing about staying here is that life is so easy and comfortable. Down to the 4th floor for a full breakfast buffet, and for the 5:30 Manager's reception with free drinks and snacks and live music and dance. One block from the beach. The neighborhood has been recently remodeled and we had fantastic live Hawaiian music and hula dancing there each night in the plaza. Parking was pricey, but what a luxury to have your car ready in 2-3 mins to head out to explore the island at will. There is a new very tall hotel highrise going up across the street from the entrance but it looks like most of the external work is now done as of mid-July. There was construction noise on the street level during the weekday, but we were never in the hotel then anyway. Fun tips: get to the north shore for a day, the beaches are incredible and uncrowded, eat lunch at a shrimp truck there, Giovanni's was to die for, it was recommended to us by Gary who works on the 4th (eating and pool) floor. Go to Hanuama Bay for snorkeling especially for kids, but get up there early its about a 20 min drive on H1 and the parking lot is usually full and closed off by 8:30 AM. You can rent snorkels, masks and flippers on the beach.",,10,5.0

We were here for one solid month, as per a work relocation, and it was a very wise choice. Everything about the hotel was excellent, with one--actually two, but I got around one--issue. The issue at hand was fairly minor, so I would highly recommend this hotel.Pros: The breakfast is outstanding, even compared to other Embassy Suites. Not only does it have the traditional omelet station, but it has a two-sided buffet line with everything you can imagine, plus a daily specialty item. Every day they have fresh fruit selections (pineapple, different melons, papaya), miso soup, all b'fast meats, eggs, potatoes, pancakes, waffles, etc. There's really nothing you're missing, whether you're from the US, Japan, or anywhere. The juice selections run the gamut, to include the popular Guava blend juice, which is excellent. Okay enough about the b'fast. You also get the manager's reception, which has hors d'ouvres and free drinks (some like to partake...and partake and partake, which is a problem, but nothing worth complaining about). There's also free music nightly. The rooms are typical Embassy Suites--spacious and comfortable. You get a microwave, fridge, and sink. The bathrooms are big and very nice. And unlike most area hotels, EVERYTHING is included, like internet access and phone calls. There's an in-room safe and most rooms are ocean- or partial-ocean view. The balconies are small, but you can sit out on them and enjoy the views. All-around service is great and we were treated very well by everyone. The location is extremely convenient to the beach, restaurants, the rest of Waikiki, and downtown. You lack for nothing. The rooms are clean and the chocolates provided for the turn-down service are quite tasty. Cons: I don't just blindly issue rating points. You have to earn it with me. And this would easily make 5 points on the TripAdvisor scale save for two things. First is the valet-only parking. It's $25/day, not including tip, which is typical for Waikiki, but still outrageous. If you're only staying for a few days, or you didn't rent a car, it's a non-issue. But still, it's excessive. This is the issue I was able to avoid. As a DoD employee, I parked at the Hale Koa lot, right next door, for $3/day (w/unlimited in-and-out privileges). Cha-ching! The only other con I couldn't avoid was this--the hotel is one of the loudest, internally, I've ever experienced. I will never fault a hotel for the outside noise (rarely if ever their fault). But in this hotel, you can hear almost everything in the adjacent rooms. Up and down or outside, no problem. But as stated we were here for a month and we could EASILY hear every little thing on either side of us. The walls are not only thin, but they seem to actually CARRY noise. Couples arguing, kids screaming (or talking loudly), radios, etc. were all heard quite clearly. I would still strongly recommend this hotel to others, but that was one big problem. Not enough to ruin the trip at all, but still an issue that needs addressing. But to sum up, if this hotel is an option in your price range, go for it. Very nice!","State College, Pennsylvania",58,4.0

Also the front desk staff was very friendly. We were very pleased to be here after checking out after one night at the Hilton Waikiki, which we didn’t like at all. It was in the morning but they did their outmost best to give us a room. So, we had to wait only half hour and shortly after 11:00 a.m. we could go to our suite. We also received two welcome CD’s with Hawaiian music. In the lobby is a tour desk for tips and trips, a friendly lady arranged a luau at Germaine’s for us that evening. We had tickets booked online ourselves for the Polynesian Culture Center the next day inclusive of transport with sightseeing on the way out, everything to be highly recommended. This is not an Embassy with an atrium; there are two buildings with the pool and restaurant on the 4th floor. Not all the suites have the same size; we had a small suite on one of the top floors with no balcony (most rooms are more spacious and have balconies), close to elevator. The living room is small with good quality furniture and a wet bar with fridge and microwave. The bedroom is also small but the King bed was excellent. The bathroom is spacious and clean; there are many soft towels. The details made this a very pleasant stay, the welcome letter and the sweets in a basket (I am a Diamond HHonors member and don’t know whether these gifts were for my status or that everyone else will receive the same). When we returned in the afternoon of our first day they had put a bathrobe in the suite. Every evening our bed was made up for the night with a fresh flower and sweets on a pillow. Housekeeping is excellent. There was such a sweet and friendly (older) woman who made up our room every day. Every time we saw her when we left our room, she greeted, wished us a nice day and asked if everything was okay.On the 3rd floor is a business center with 4 computers for free Internet and printers. On the 4th floor is the pool area with many sun beds. There is a bar with friendly staff and they have a menu with reasonable prices. The restaurant is on the 4th floor as well. The breakfast is outstanding for an Embassy with many fresh fruits, yoghurts, rolls, bagels, cereals etc. There are two cooks to make omelets, very special that you can pick your own ingredients (lots of choices!), put them in a cup and hand it over. Everything was very clean and well maintained.The happy hour is also in this area. All drinks including wine, beer and cocktails are free. There is always live entertainment when we were there 2 singers and a lady that danced the hula. We had a late flight and spent the last afternoon at the pool. There is no separate bathroom with shower in the restroom area, but fortunately there was a hospitality suite available to refresh before our flight. We had a wonderful time at this Embassy and the hotel saved our trip to Oahu after the awful stay in the Hilton Waikiki, we were very happy that we changed hotels.",Netherlands,415,5.0

We didn't rent a car to save money and the location was just great. Just outside the hotel was access to central Waikiki. Let me start with the free stuff in this hotel: free cooked-to-order breakfast every morning; free manager's reception with light snacks and freeflow cocktails for 2 hours each evening; free hi-speed internet; free printing in business center; free 1st 30 minutes of each local and domestic (within U.S.) call; free fitness center. For the breakfast, they also had one or two special items each day like kimchee fried rice and warm apple cobbler. The pancakes and optional coconut and apple toppings were so good. What's different about the omelet station at this Embassy is they let you choose your own omelet ingredients in a bowl from a small buffet station; then you hand your bowl to the cooks who make your omelets. The location is perfect: Roy's and the Yard House are on the 1st floor, just downstairs. Within 5 minutes walk, you have access to what seems like a hundred shops, restaurants, and eateries. The staff are so friendly from housekeeping to the assistant general manager who often greeted us at the reception each evening. The property was extremely clean and well maintained. We had a room on the 7th floor, but I do have to sympathize with others who have stayed on the 4th floor since that is a ""common floor"" with access to resort amenities like the pool and breakfast area so it can be a bit noisy. Anyway, if we go back to Waikiki, we will definitely stay here again. We have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and this place beats the Hilton by far for space, comfort, and value!","San Jose, CA",22,5.0

It's difficult to give this hotel an overall rating because some aspects were excellent while others were poor.First the good: the bell and valet service are outstanding. I usually don't valet my car and was upset that valet is the only option here, but the service was fast even when busy and the drivers were courteous. Bell service was also prompt and polite, even during check-in and check-out times. A half hour before check out time (11 AM), we called for luggage assistance and someone was at our room within 5 minutes. Another great perk at this hotel is the complementary offerings. The breakfast is wonderful. Made to order omelets, pancakes, fruit, fried potatoes, rice, scrambled eggs, cereal, pastries, plus a few other options that rotated daily such as biscuits and gravy, spam and fried rice, french toast, and poached eggs. Included is a drink fountain station with standard soft drinks, juices (including passion-orange-guava), and Kona coffee. Each evening they offer a manager's reception that includes crackers, chips, and veggies as well as free drinks. The location is either good or bad, depending on your point of view. I'm not a fan of Waikiki because its too crowded and miserable to drive through. However if you're looking to stay in the heart of Waikiki, this is a great option. Plenty of shopping and restaurants right outside the hotel and the beach is right across the street. Be aware that there is a lot of construction going on around this hotel. A building is being built right next door and its closed off Beachwalk St to only one way (and sometimes closed completely while construction equipment moves through). That makes both driving and walking a bit more difficult in the area.Now for some of the not so good. The room is technically a suite with a separate bedroom and living area/kitchenette. However the rooms are incredibly small. We had two large duffle bags and two small suitcases and there wasn't enough room to put them out. In fact, more than one suitcase would be difficult to fit. There is no closet, however you are given an armoire with hangers. The kitchenette includes a fridge, microwave, and sink. There is also a large balcony that spans both rooms, although our view was of the new building next door even though we were on the top floor. The bathroom, however, is very large and nicely finished. And the rooms are also very quiet. I couldn't hear the noise on the street or the people in the hallways.Wired internet access is supposed to be included with the room, but ours didn't work. I called LodgeNet, the service provider, and they were unable to help. They said they'd have the next level tech call me back for further assistance, but they didn't call back for 24 hours and then it was an hour before we were checking out. There is also a business center with internet and printing, a kiosk to print airline boarding passes, and free wireless access on the lanai level and lobby.The front desk staff was not nearly as helpful as the rest of the service at the hotel. I called ahead to see if I could check in an hour early and was told they couldn't guarantee anything but I could ""try and see"". Well I knew I could try and see, but I was calling to see if it would be worth the trip into Waikiki. Upon check in, the person helping me didn't even remember to ask for my Hilton Honors certificate (I using points for my stay). When I called them to inform them of my problems with the internet service, I barely got a response. A few other notes: while I didn't use the pool, I did see it while eating breakfast and it looked clean and nice. Plenty of chairs around for sun tanning. For anyone who has visited the Dole Plantation near the North Shore and has had a Dole Whip (pineapple soft serve ice cream), the convenience store in the hotel called the Coco Cove also serves them. To my knowledge, this is the only place outside of the Plantation where they are served.Overall I liked this hotel. The small room size and issues with the internet and front desk didn't outweigh all the positives the hotel has to offer. And if you're looking to burn some Hilton points but don't want the craziness of the Hilton Hawaiian Village, this is a very good option in Waikiki.","Schaumburg, IL",112,4.0

The rooms are modern and clean and the separate living/sleeping area was very handy with two active kids in tow. The kids also loved the pool, spending many happy hours alternating between the spa and kids pool. The beach in front of the hotel wasn't great - a bit too narrow and rocky but a short walk to Waikiki Beach proper will find you on a better stretch of sand.Breakfasts were generous and filling. The omelette bar was great and the evening reception was a nice touch. There are also many good restaurants nearby catering to all sorts of budgets on the Beach Walk. I have to put in a good word for Roy's, on the ground floor of the hotel, which unfortunately, we only discovered on our last day. While they only offered a limited tapa's style menu at lunchtime when we went, it was sensational - how I wish we had gone there for dinner!Concierge were polite and helpful and both the activities desk and reception always happy to assist with directions and information about public transport.There are free Hawaiian cultural activities in the gift shop on the 2nd floor every afternoon (hula dancing, Hawaiian language, ukulele), I think it is called Mana Hawaii which is both lots of fun and informative.

All email queries were answered promptly prior to out arrival and at check in staff ensured we could get our room early after our morning flight arrival.

My teenagers had the twin beds in the bedroom(and their own tv) and I took the sofabed so I could get up earlier without disturbing anyone and it was surprisingly comfortable. It would have been great to have a teatowel or papertowel in the kitchen area. Breakfast was plentiful, not gourmet type food but sufficient and we enjoyed the hospitality of the manager's reception a few times. I could always get on a computer at the business centre if I needed to. Location wise it is hard to beat. So close to the beach and the shopping action but not too frantic and noisy.

However my daughter got bug bite from Crib on the 1st night. other than that it was great. So we went back.This time we requested 2 queen beds so that we do not have to use sofa bed every night for my 4 year old son. When we got to the room there were 2 beds but it was not queen size. So we called front desk and they said it is 2 full size bed. I noticed bathroom door was different and it was sliding door. I asked front desk clerk if this was ADA room which is for wheel chair guest. Then he said YES and he did not realize that it was ADA room when he checked us in. Which I doubt it. We were tired so we kept room. Actually this ADA room felt more spacious than the room we stayed last time. Location of the fridge and microwave is different from standard room. My daughter did not get bug bite from crib this time!! Same as last time we enjoyed breakfast/ cocktails/ pool/ jacuzzi. The valet staff was excellent!! However Valet staff is outside contracter.

We reserved it 6 months prior for $175 per night with a King size bed. We ended up with a Queen size bed and was told no Kings were available. The room was so small, not the usual large two bedroom suites that you think Embassy Suites is known for. We were on the 9th floor and the view was nice except for half of it was taken up by the new 20 story building under construction next door. The noise of the pounding pile driver lasted throughout the day on all three days. I realize that's the chances you take and construction noise is sometimes unavoidable. The pool was small and nothing special. The breakfast buffet was decent but just didn't feel like the other Embassy Suites for some reason. Don't be fooled by the 'Beach Walk' in the title. The only walk to the beach from the hotel went down a narrow concrete walkway with an up close and personal view and smell of the Shorebird Restaurant garbage dumpster. The walkway is filthy and several of the local drunks stagger through it day and night. When you walk out any of the entrances/exits, you end up having to fight off the same tour vendors hounding you until they're out of shouting distance of you.

The hotel is rated as a 3 star but there isn't a restaurant in the hotel, the reception desk is in the parking garage...really, it's next to parked cars!The rooms are very small for suites and overpriced. Little to no view from the surrounding buildings. Only the rooms on the end of on tower has a view to the ocean if your on a higher floor.There is a security issue as other people have stated with the 4rth floor. Anyone can access the 4rth floor and come in the hotel with the escalators from the street on the back side of the hotel. No security is checking if people are staying in the hotel. The floor is also where the pool/breakfast areas are. We watched many people come into the pool area from the escalators that did not appear to be staying in the hotel.Breakfast is a standard breakfast. Nothing to really get excited about...just filler food with really no seasoning. Spam fried rice was interesting to say the least.The Managers Special in the evening is a plus but be carefull when tipping. I gave ""Two Buck Chuck"" a $20 to break so I could tip him and he had only given my back $17. I didn't notice unitl I had already tipped him $2 that round...so he got a $5 tip. The amount of the money isn't important, but just be aware if this type of shadyness.The other reviews are correct with the room walls being paper thin. Don't expect to get your ""freak on"" and the people next door not hear you. You can hear what people are saying in the next room.We finally had enough of the hotel and went to the Hyatt. The Hyatt gave us a much cheaper rate, had better ammenities and customer service was very classy.Embassy Suites needs to put thier workers through customer service or etiquette classes on how to treat and speak to customers. For example: Say please and thank you, we're sorry for your inconvenience, how may I help you and smile. NOT what do you want?

We finally had enough waiting and walked up and asked what was the hold up and they said ""Oh, your room is ready"". So I asked when they were going to tell us that because they knew we had been sitting right in front of them for 1.5 hours. Of course we got attitude and a lame excuse of we didn't know you we here (We were really sitting 20 feet right in front of them). So...we finally get our room keys and like the other reviews stated, they didn't explain the room key in the elevator to get to your floor. Once we get to our room we notice the room was not what we confirmed on the reservation. We booked a king bed because I'm a very tall person and the room had what looked like a regular size bed. So...I called and they moved us to another room on the 4th floor (Note not once an appology for the trouble nor did they offer to move our bags).4TH FLOOR BEWARE!!! The other reviews were correct that anyone on the streets can use the escalator from the street to enter your area. We also went to other floors from the 4th floor stairs (The Hotel is not secure) Additionally, the 4th floor is where the pool and breakfast areas are...so it's really noisy...LISTEN TO ME! REALLY NOISY!!!ROOM - The rooms are pretty small. It appears this hotel was converted to suites. The walls are paper thin. We had someone next to us with a screaming baby for 3 days. You can actually have a conversation through the walls.POOL - As other reviews states, there is no where to get away from rowdy kids. They're in the hot tub and all over the pool...what are the parents doing? Watch your kids people!!! It also appears that some local people are coming to the pool with kids.STAFF - The bell guys are on the spot! Nothing but good things to say about them. RECEPTION - smile, say your sorry when you need to and stop acting like you work in beverly hills.FOOD - Breakfast is a most a C- Example: Saturday is supposed to be grilled salmon, however when I looked it was baked mush. I asked the staff where is the grilled salmon and they originally said we only have baked. Later a female staff member came up to me and said the chef told her to tell me it was grilled. I then said I think I know grilled versus baked/steamed and she then said ""I know grilled has grill marks on it"". SO WHY LIE ABOUT IT PEOPLE!!! It only pisses the customer off more than you already have.HOUSEKEEPING - Slow slow sloooooow!!! 4pm average for room to be cleaned. No wonder people aren't getting checked in on time.ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! AT first you will be excited to be in Hawaii, but with the substandard service, pretty soon the pinapple will not be so sweet.OVERALL - The spouse and booked a week of rest and relaxation which turned out to be FRUSTRATION.",Texas,7,1.0

We liked it so much we just booked another 7 night stay for February 2010.For comparison's sake, I can tell you we also stayed 4 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in 2007, and in our opinion the Embassy Suites Beachwalk is head and shoulders above the HHV when you consider value, location, customer service, and even atmosphere. The HHV is way off the beaten path, and while it has direct beach access, you are really no closer than the 1 block walk from the ES to the beach. HHV is quite a long walk from the heart of Waikiki, whereas the ES is a short 5-10 minutes to the heart of things.Also, Valet Parking access in and out of the ES is MUCH quicker than walking to the self-park lot at HHV.

Nice large room. Great pool area. Helpful friendly staff. When we moved into the room, the bellman asked how long we were staying--when we said four days, he said that we would probably get construction noise in that tower on that side starting at 7 AM on Monday. So--the next day we switched to the other tower on the street side (away from pool)--and guess what, heard the trash trucks at 435 AM. Pool can arrange umbrella and two chairs in front of the Outrigger Reef for $20.94 for all day.The breakfast was the great Embassy Suite buffet that you would probably pay $15 or more person at any other hotel. The happy hour was good too. ON Saturday night there was salad and pizza but the rest of the nights just fresh vegetables, chips, crackers, etc., and a special dip (changed each night.) There was also entertainment each night. I know on the restaurant section House without a Key at the near by Halekalani (sp?) is highly rated--mostly for the evening entertainment. Meals and drinks are a bit pricy and the entertainment is about the same as at the Embassy--so save money and listen here.Lots of restaurants nearby along with plenty of shopping including 3 ABC stores within one block.

I think there was something going on at all times of the night. The pool and bars were fantastic and it was a great luau feel with the fire torches burning at night. Happy hour was excellent and they even had entertainment every night to go with the drinks. Bartenders did not skimp and the asst. general manager was even out there making sure everyone was happy. Beer, wine, and liquor drinks were all available. Definitely do not stay here if you were expecting to be right on the beach, you are about 2 or 3 blocks away. Trump towers are going up next door, so expect some noise. Breakfast was kind of slow in the mornings, but I was here for business and most for pleasure.

On arrival we found the environment to be very friendly, facilities close to shops and beach. Roys' restaurant at the hotel is one of the best in Hawaii, and House Without a key is one of the best cafe/bars to catch a sunset - is just across the road. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. 3.

I am now addicted to omelettes with jalapenos and I can say that after filling up on the fresh fruit, omelettes, eggs, bacon, pastries, cereal every morning we NEVER needed lunch or even a snack our whole visit. The Manager's Reception in the evening was great and it included cocktails and spirits etc... whatever you wanted and believe me they were not watered down... they were strong and good! These were served with corn chips, carrot sticks, broccoli, dips etc which were a nice little starter to your evening before you headed out.The staff were all wonderful, friendly, helpful and went out of their way to help. Our housekeeper, in particular, (can't remember her name) was so lovely and always kept us provided with fresh fluffy towels, shower caps, shampoos etc. Nothing was ever too much trouble and she always had our room done by the time we had finished breakfast.

The breakfasts were outstanding with mountains of all you could eat food along with custom made omelet’s of your own desire. In the evening’s free booze and snacks at the manager’s reception along with live Hawaiian music. We stayed in the Aloha tower and had zero noise issues. Valet parking was a breeze and the guys were happy and running off to get your car which always arrived quickly. We had free internet access and they also allow you to print over the WAN to the reception printer for free. We could not fault this and felt the value was awesome. We cannot wait to return and are telling all our friends about this great hotel. The Yardhouse Pub directly downstairs & a 15 yard walk through a “tunnel” in the Beachwalk complex is a blast, 130+ draft beers and good food (The Spicy Thai Pizza is great)","Richmond, Texas",62,5.0

Used Enterprise for $30/day only 10 min walk to get car - very easy, cheap and friendly - FYI Found free street parking 7P-6A on next street over (in Feb) - Walk to beach is strait 1 (short block) but understand, that beach is VERY narrow (25-50 ft) and very rocky/coral... you can sun and dig, but not good for much in the water. We walked 10 minutes (easy on pavement) North to Hilton Lagoon which kids loved, then other days 10 mins South (hard walk on beach and cement) to Sheraton beach which was a bit crowded, but easy 50-100 ft of beach and shallow enough to go out 1,000 ft and the water is only up to your knees.

We stayed just 2 nights in Oahu then went on to Maui and Kauai. The Embassy Suites in Oahu was right in the middle of the city life plus right next to Waikiki Beach. We had reserved a one bedroom non-ocean view and they were out to gave us a 2-bedroom. 2-bedrooms are perfect for families. Suites are spacious and very clean although the hotel didn't look like it was built as recently as it says. The breakfast buffet is great! Everything from custom omelettes, to eggs, bacon, sausage , bagels and pastries. It starts at 6:30 so you can eat and get on with your day. The manager's reception is a nice touch too with free drinks and snacks. We didn't use the pool as we had rented a car and just toured the island for the full day we had there. We drove to see Pearl Harbor. They take you out on a boat to see the memorial and the Arizona. We drove around the southeast part of the island stopped at Nuuanu Park which was a beautiful view but incredibly windy. Stopped at Hanauma Bay and checked out the view. Supposed to be good snorkeling but everyone is stepping all over the reef so not sure how good the snorkeling actually is. We also drove up to the North shore but we didn't think it was all that impressive. The southeast drive has so many picturesque lookouts. We drove back to Waikiki (there is NO where to park so you basically have to fork over the $25/day valet) watched the sun set on the beach, walked around all the shops and you'll see so many Coach stores it's quite silly then had dinner at the Yard Restaurant where they have every beer imaginable on tap. It's a very loud but fun environment. Had the ahi crunchy salad which was pretty good but very spicey. And tried the pomegranate mojito which was quite yummy. It was a nice short visit in Oahu and then off to see Maui and Kauai. Oahu is a big city and didn't really feel like what our vision of Hawaii would be. We flew into Honolulu and our main reason was to see Pearl Harbor. I would choose the Embassy Suites again as it's great to have breakfast included and we like having a suite.",New England,5,5.0

We chose this place as we were a party of six and needed the extra room. This is a newer hotel with great amenities. The breakfast is great - saves you having to spend so much on food. Also saves the hassle of deciding where to eat first thing in the morning. At the manager's recption they have free cocktails and minimal snacks. Nice entertainment., too. There is a store downstairs that sells everything. Laudry facilites, fitness room and business center too.The location is just across the street from the beach. Easy ,quick access. Rooms are nicely decorated and fairly spacious but lack enough closet space and waste baskets.There are no eating utensils though , just glasses and mugs.This place is just about ideal except for the noise and the construction of the Trump tower. Try to get on a higher floor in either tower but facing the Diamond Head way.If you face the other way, you will be faced with the construction and it is noisy during the day. Unfortunately the constuction site looms over the pool area and the view is obstructed. I don't know how long the construction will continue - looks to be done soon.We were in the Hula Tower on the other side facing way from constuction. I was relieved until I found out we were on a lower floor. I had put in a request for higher floor but was told none was available. Our view consisted of an ABC store. Very noisy! I was awakened every night by people hollering and carrying on outside. Every morning around 5:30 I was awakened by delivery trucks etc. This was the worst issue to deal with but it certainly didn't ruin my vacation. The reality is Waikiki is a busy, noisy place. You realy don't spend much time in your room and hey - you're in Hawaii! It is beautiful!Bottom line - I would stay again with six. If we were only two I would stay in a hotel right on the beach with ocean view.","Winnipeg, Canada",42,4.0

It is perfect for traveling with small children giving you some extra space when you need to put kids down to bed early. Small micro, Fridge and sink (plus coffee maker) were adequate. Hotel is older, but they have done a good job of keeping in modern.Beach access is pretty simple (five minute walk) and the pool was fine. Could be a bit better. Bar located at the pool was a bonus (but the 6 dollar bud light a bit extreme). Evening managers reception was great with beer/wind/hard booze. Throw your tip down before they pour and you are bound to have a stronger drink!We really stayed here because of the fantastic morning breakfast provided by all Embassy's. This did not disappoint. You name it, you can have it for breakfast. great food and easy to get in and out.Constructions makes getting in and out of Valet a bit of a challenge, but the we were not bothered at all by construction noise. it was not a big deal.weather its a one night stop over or a week in Waikiki this would be an outstanding property to stay at.

This saved us on buying drinks at dinner - again, a big savings. Gym is nice, but internet connection in the biz center is slow.Downside is the location - it's close enough to the beach, but the Trump hotel that is being built KILLS most views.(I had asked if construction was still going on and they said ""no, just to the interior, so there's no noise"" -- NOT true - contruction was still noisy except on the weekend) You feel a little 'sandwiched' in.

The 2nd time we stayed in the Hula Tower (20th floor) which gives you great ocean view. We had a 2 bedroom suite which was large with good bathrooms. The beds were comfortable and daily housekeeping service excellent. One point to note is that the airconditioning is noisy & goes on & off during the night as the temperature fluctuates. This can be annoying. The pool area is fine not huge so could be challenging if the hotel was full. The breakfast here is over rated. Eat in the hotel to save money or otherwise there are heaps of places nearby. The biiget plus for the property is the location. It is right amongst the newest shopping area (Beachwalk) and is 75m to the beach. You can walk to Ala Moana in 15 minutes. We visited with our 3 teenage sons and felt very safe and happy there.

When we arrived in our rental car, the valet greeted us and directed us to registration. The registration staff greeted us with complimentary champagne and fruit drinks for our 2 teenagers. They upgraded us to a corner unit with ocean view after we asked for a king bed in our 1 bedroom suite. We were located on the 7th floor in the Hula tower and overlooked the pool on the 4th floor. We also had a view of the Trump Tower construction; however, it was never bothersome during our stay. The room was absolutely perfect. I had read about the complementary nightly manager’s reception and thought it would be something we would only do if we happened to be around. We missed it the first night we were there. The second night we decided to attend and were so completely impressed by the complementary snacks, cocktails, and entertainment that we made it a point to attend most every night during our stay. We especially enjoyed George the bartender’s winning smile (and delicious drinks). We also already knew about the complementary breakfast and planned to take advantage. What we didn’t realize was how incredibly awesome it would be. They provide a huge variety of hot foods … scrambled eggs, sausage links, omelets, pancakes, french toast, muffins, pastries, toast, etc., etc. Plus, plenty of fresh fruit and yogurt. I gained 5 pounds during our stay … it was that good.We didn’t mind the $25 price tag for valet since it was so convenient to pull up and hop out. We took our car out every day during our stay, sometimes a couple of times per day – the valet always asked us if we needed directions somewhere. Remember, you get free breakfast every morning and free drinks/entertainment/snacks for 2 hours every night. Valet fees were a wash as far as we were concerned.I never asked our housekeeper’s name, but she was a lovely person, and I enjoyed our brief conversations in the hall. She also did a great job of cleaning up after our family and always left us an abundance of clean towels – she knew we had 2 teenagers.Did I forget to mention the hotel sits on a street (Lewers) that has shopping and restaurants within a couple of steps and is only a block away from the beach? Convenience! We felt perfectly safe letting our teenagers run down to the shops and the beach. More shopping and restaurants were located just a couple of blocks away – easy walking distance.We were so impressed with our stay.

This was our third trip to Waikiki/Oahu (having stayed at Outrigger on the Beach and an Ohana hotel previously), but this time we had two children (a 3 year old and a 16 month old) in tow.We used HiltonHonors points for the room, which was located in the Aloha Tower on the 12th floor. It was the second room back from the side facing the ocean, so the view from the bedroom lanai was fabulous. I'd definitely recommend the Aloha Tower over the Hula Tower, which is set further back from the ocean. The staff, throughout our entire stay, were consistently polite and friendly. Dean, a bellhop, was such a great help with everything and made a point of saying hello to us and our girls every time we saw him. The staff in the breakfast area were fantastic as well, especially Russ. The room was very clean, and well-kept, and the maid service was fantastic. (Of course we tip daily, but I can't imagine it would have been different if we hadn't.) The beds were very comfortable, as was the crib for our baby. The refrigerator/sink set-up was the same as any Embassy Suites, but the refrigerator was remarkably clean and cold, which was very appreciated given our necessary storage of milk for the baby.We utilized the fitness room daily, and were very impressed with it, especially in comparison with other hotels we've stayed at. We're members of LifeTime Fitness (a very nice gym) and Embassy's fitness room had the same caliber of workout equipment--Precor ellipticals (3) and Precor treadmills (4) and one Precor recumbent bike, all of which had individual TV screens. While the room is relatively small, there are plenty of free weights--both dumbbells and barbells--and stability and balance balls. The hotel also provides headphones with disposable earcovers which is a nice touch. Very impressive facility!The breakfast buffet each morning was absolutely fantastic. Lots of fresh island fruit, and an ever-changing menu of proteins and breakfast items. The omelette and ready-to-order chefs were pros (please remember to tip them; so many people didn't) and I devoured my delicious egg white omelettes each morning. Having easy access to fresh juice/coffee/milk was so nice, especially given the prices in Waikiki. ($9.50 for a gallon of milk the week we were there!) The dining area was always kept very clean, as was the pool area. That hasn't always been true of every place we've stayed, so we appreciated that extra attention to detail in these areas. The pool was pretty chilly, especially for our children, but that kept it nice and uncrowded. The walk to the beach is very easy, so we spent most of our vacation there.  We didn't frequent the manager's reception every night, as we're not big drinkers. But the few nights we did, we enjoyed the live music and hula dancer. The snacks weren't worth forgoing dinner for, but as ""freebies"" they were fine. We loved having a Coconut Cove store located in the hotel itself as it sells Dole Whip, saving a trip out to the plantation. Only $2.50 for a huge cup of it, and it's dairy-free which is a huge bonus for those who have allergies. There are two ABC Stores within a stone's throw of the hotel itself, of course, and the Waikiki BeachWalk restaurants are very good, especially the Yardhouse (great kids' meals!) and Cheeseburger in Waikiki. For those with small children (under age 5), there's a great little playground with lots of shade, in the park between the Hale Koa and the Hilton Hawaiian Village, just behind the beach area. Our only two (minor) complaints were the pushiness of the pool concierge who kept trying to sell us on over-priced tours and transportation. Since we've been to Waikiki a few times previously, we knew she was pushing certain companies over others, which wasn't to our benefit financially. We actually received better advice from the buspeople in the breakfast area. The second complaint was the ugliness of the Trump Tower next door. The building is a monstrosity, towering over every other building in Waikiki, and seems so unnecessary. But the construction noise didn't bother us at all, as it seemed to be only on the uppermost floors. This isn't the fault of Embassy Suites, but it does detract from its otherwise great location.","Phoenix, Arizona",61,5.0

It was very well kept and managed. They have good security including card-managed floor access, which unfortunately did not always work and I sometimes had to ride to several different floors before getting to my own. They also very carefully check your car for damage before accepting it into valet parking, and make you sign indicating all pre-existing damage, no matter how small -- tiny bumps, dents, and scratches included. Understandable but off-putting, I guess they have had a lot of guests who try to cheat them on that. Music on the mall below would be loud from about 5pm to 7pm each night. That's all the bad though.The room was very nice, a real suite and nicely decorated. Great view of Diamond Head from the 17th floor, though no sunset from my tower. The maid service was very good and attentive - if you left early for the day they would try to clean your room right away so you could use it in the early afternoon.The business center has several PCs you could use for looking up local attractions on the internet. The evening reception includes very tasty snacks and drinks, and live Hawaiian entertainment which changes each night. Perfect for anyone to attend, including families. Surprisingly well done.The morning breakfast is pretty good and has a large selection, though they undercook their bacon (what a shame!). The made-to-order omelets were excellent. They also offer things like miso soup and edamame to cater to their Japanese guests, though it was a fun change of pace for adventurous folks from other places too, like me.I would stay here again without hesitation, though I would probably request a room away from the Waikiki Beachwalk mall, so that I would not be disturbed by the music in the evenings.","Los Angeles, California",144,5.0

Our room on the 17th floor over-looked the Beachwalk area and had a view of Diamond Head, so the room did have a very nice view. However...at night it was very noisy, especially when we wanted to sleep. We thought the loud music was coming from the Rum Fire (a new nightclub at the Royal Hawaiian shopping center), but we were informed the loud music was coming from the Yard House, a restaurant located below the Aloha Tower.

We were fine with the average decor and offerings because we went outside the hotel a lot, for dinner, breakfast extras, etc. We like more the contemporary setting and loved the Mona Surfrider to hang out- great not having to pay to stay there- and also Halekulani and Waikiki Parc-where Nobu is located- one of the best meals we had in town. We were able to do these extras without the stress of paying too much at a hotel per night, so in that sense, Embassy was fine. It was clean, the construction wasn't the best backdrop at the pool, and sort of banal. Good rates though and good for families.",new york,3,3.0

Our suite was in the Hula Tower (1523) and was extremely spacious, especially for 4 adults. We had 2 seperate bedrooms, 1 king and 2 queens each with their own ensuite bathroom. The living area was comfortable with a sofa lounge (this also folded out for a bed if required), sofa chair, dining table & chairs. We had 2 balconies, one larger off the master bedroom & living area and another off the 2nd bedroomEach room had a plasma/LCD TV (3 total), in room internet access is free which we found great. There were 2 safes and 2 fridges which is handy when there are 4 adults.The room had a small kitchenette area which also had a microwave & plenty of pantry/drawer space to food etc.The overall presentation of our suite was immaculate. The rooms were nicely decorated in modern Hawaiian decor and our room was cleaned thoroughly each day (thank-you Purie).Breakfast was included in the rate and there was plenty to choose from each day (toasts, bagels, muffins, bacon, sausages, hashbrowns, steamed rice, fresh fruits, cereals, yoghurt, made to order eggs, juices, coffee/tea). We found this a great start to the morning as we then just snacked at lunch or sometimes didnt eat lunch & just had dinner in the evening. They also have a free Manager's Reception for guests every evening in the same area with nightly entertainment, nibbles & drinks/cocktails.The pool area is spread out & spacious and offered plenty of deck chairs available (perhaps because we were there at less crowded time of year). The pool is lovely to swim in and has a soft padded flooring (does not hurt your feet). The spa is also lovely and hot !!We were in a fantastic location, right on Beachwalk and easy walk to shops & restaurants nearby. It was also handy short walk (5 mins) to TheBus stop on Saratoga/Kalia.The Trump Tower being built next door is almost complete in height on the outside (they were laying concrete for floor 34) and to be honest the construction that was going on really did not bother us at all (we sat in the mornings & late afternoons & watched them build). They were putting in balcony rails and some lower levels were being painted inside so perhaps the inside fit-out will not be as noisy as the outside contruction has been for some reviews I have read in the past.Overall, we loved the Embassy Suites and I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone.","Toowoomba, Australia",68,5.0

We had two adults and two kids in our room. It wasn't a big deal because we were always busy and spent very little time in our room! We got our room for $230./night, the location was great! Some people complained about the walkway to the beach, I just went through the two hotels in front of us with no problems. I also used their showers to get the sand off! If you can't pull that off you're a rookie!! Parking does stink at $25 per day but if you can't afford that maybe you shouldn't be vacationing in Hawaii! I also really enjoyed the Beach Walk right below the hotel, ABC store was right across the street! By the way we stayed in the Hula tower on the 10th floor.

It was a wonderful stay and the perfect location for our family. The hotel was lovely and conveniently located between the beach and the Royal Hawaiian Mall. Breakfast was excellent, especially eating in the open air cafe. We never waited long for anything and the staff was very friendly. Housekeeping was wonderful and our suite worked out great for us: me, hubby and 2 girls ages 6 and 10. Most days we did sightseeing but were back to the hotel by around 5pm. The manager's special was nice - there is live entertainment and hula every night. The appetizers aren't anything special: veggies/dip, chips/dip, chips/salsa and open bar. However, it was very relaxing for us to head down there, enjoy the music, some snacks and the kids would swim until bedtime. It worked well for us to hang out and just order some food at the hotel by the pool. A nice way to end each day. You can walk to many locations or easily catch the bus. Two negative comments: the room was advertised to have a king bed but it only had a queen. Also, be wary of the concierge.

We chose the partial ocean view, which was great because we had views of the city, the mountains, and the ocean depending on which direction we looked. The suite was spacious and very comfortable for 4 people. We didn't hear any noise coming from the other room or from any other suite. The bed was extremely comfortable and no matter how tired/sore we were from the day before, we woke up every morning feeling rested and renewed. Very clean. Reasonably priced and well worth it!THE BREAKFAST WAS AWESOME and was complimentary!! It filled us up for the whole day until dinnertime. Included: Fresh fruit, pancakes, sausage, eggs, hashbrown potatoes, bacon, french toast, made to order DELICIOUS omelets, bagels, muffins, cereal, yogurt. We ate breakfast at the Shore Bird at the Outrigger Reef one morning, and while the view was good the food did not even compare and cost $25.LOCATION!! Perfect. Shopping and dining at the new Waikiki Beachwalk was actually connected to the hotel. The beach access was a block away and took us 5 min to walk there. The beach area in this location is less populated and you can rent everything you need right there and pretty much have your own private beach.STAFF: Friendly, helpful, provided us a wheelchair rental for grandma, kept the rooms clean and only came when we weren't there.

My sisters and I vacationed in Waikiki from October 21 through October 29th and had wonderful service from all the Embassy Suites staff. This was my 3rd trip to Oahu, one sister's 2nd trip and the other sister's 1st trip and all of us agreed that we have never experienced better accommodations and service. When we asked for 5 towels in our room, within minutes they were provided as well as five hand towels. Our check-in (took 15 minutes at most) was seamless and the friendly, helpful staff were wonderful. One example of the excellent customer service provided was the friendly, helpful Activities coordinators (especially, Cyndi, Heidi, and Christina). They were available during breakfast and their approach was friendly and helpful without being invasive. Conversation began by asking if we were having a good time and what our planned activities were for the day. They, then, offered any help with suggestions, experiences, and offers to make registrations. We accepted their offer to make our reservations for Star of Honolulu and Polynesion Cultural Center (twi-light dinner and show). In both cases, we had great reservations (7th row for the PCC show and front table for the Star of Honolulu show). We couldn't have been happier with our stay. With 3 women sharing a room, the spaciousness of the suite was awesome and fit us perfectly. Large bathroom, two lanais, queen size beds (very comfortable), and huge rooms (both living/dining room and bedroom) made our stay an absolute joy. We will never choose any other hotel again now that we know how it feels to be pampered. There other amenities provided such as free use of the business center to check email or print boarding passes, free phone calls, and unbelieveable breakfast choices were perfect to suit all our needs. We also had an unusual request to weigh our suitcases for our return trip, and the bellhop service came through for us by providing a scale and weighing our suitcases prior to check-out.

We had the enjoyment of staying at the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk for four days. This was our 4th visit to Oahu. The 1st three were a combination of work and pleasure. Work for me and pleasure for the family. This time it was all pleasure just me and my sweety.We had read all the reviews on the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk subsequent to flying to Hawaii. Previously, we had stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort and the Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach Resort and Spa. Both were excellent hotels but our stay at the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk exceeded our expectations. We flew to Hawaii from Orlando, Florida via Atlanta. An extremely long flight, 11 hours plus, with very uncomfortable seats on an older Delta 767. We intentionally planned this stay as a way to adjust to the time change and an opportunity to revisit the island of Oahu prior to our first cruise around the islands on the Pride of America. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the entire staff at the Embassy Suites as though we were family. Everything we inquired about the hotel was factual. The employees were great, very helpful and exceedingly accommodating providing nearly flawless service.We booked a one bedroom suite which was extremely spacious (including the bath room). Although it was located next to the Trump tower, it was very quiet although our ocean view was a 20 story building. The ‘living’ room had a flat screen television, as did the bedroom. The FREE breakfast was outstanding and consists of omelets’, breakfast potatoes, several assorted pastries, yogurt, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, French toast, cereal, etc., and a very large selection with plenty of fresh fruit, an extra added value. The food was always plentiful and hot. Everyone was very polite; guests were patient and waited in line to get their food. Most hotel beds are satisfactory but we slept like angels on the beds at the Embassy, very comfortable bedding and pillows. The location is within walking distance of great shopping, great food and the beach, less than a block away.Our room was located on the 4th floor, the Hula tower, and great access to the pool, complimentary breakfast and manager’s reception area. We enjoyed the nightly manager’s cocktail party which included cocktail meatballs, eggrolls, fresh broccoli and cauliflower, and fried zucchini. The reception also included great live entertainment, even hula dancers. (Awesome!) The room came with a fridge, a room safe, a microwave and a miniature kitchen sink. There was also complimentary coffee and a package of microwave popcorn. We also received a complimentary newspaper delivered to our door each morning, although I did not have too much time to read it. You will have to get accustomed to using a valid keycard to operate up any of the hotel's elevators except when traveling to the Lobby. (Great safety feature) The free internet was an enormous bonus, great way to keep up with your e-mails! Super turndown services every night and great maid service.Parking was expensive at $25 a night, (unlimited in and out privileges) but their exceptional valet attendant service and not having to find a parking spot made this a moot point. Valet and hotel staff was abundant, courteous and quite valuable with directions and information. We rented a car (Thrifty) and were able to explore the entire island at our pleasure and time table. The Concierge, Dean, was fantastic! We inquired where we could rent snorkeling equipment and he took us to a back room and supplied everything we needed, at no cost. He even recommended how to get to Hannama Bay and when (time-wise) to avoid any problems.The hotel’s location is ideal. We were able to go everywhere we desired and had planned on foot or by car. And if you are looking for great restaurants (food) they are easily within walking distance although a bit expensive. We had dinner our last night at the Outrigger Reef on the Beach located between the beach and the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk. Excellent food, service and a great price! In addition, for you shopping fanatics you will be in paradise! Finally, we were just a 2-3 minute walk from the beach which was very convenient.I would most definitely recommend the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk to everyone I know, and in fact, we will be coming back to stay here again, with our entire family (grandchildren included), in the near future! Would I recommend this hotel to my best friend?Definitely!! Overall, a remarkable hotel. We received very good value for the money and will definitely go back to this hotel.I recommend this hotel for:Young singles, An amazing honeymoon, A romantic getaway, People with disabilities, Older travelers, Great pool scene, Families with young children, Families with teenagers, Tourists – just about anyone!I selected this hotel as a top choice for:Location, Beach, Sun, Outdoor Adventure, Great food, Cultural, Shopping, Museums and great value for money.Disliked:We really hated to leave but our anniversary/honeymoon cruise awaited us.",Orlando,4,5.0

They serve hamburgers, chicken fingers, nacho's for the kids etc. for a price. But, the bartenders make strong drinks. Well worth the ""free"" price. Throw a dollar or two in the tip jar and your set.. Breakfast buffet had everything you would want. Omlettes, French Toast, Pancakes, Cereal etc.The beach near the hotel (across a small side street) and down a short path is small and doesn't have many waves to bodysurf.

We stayed in a two bedroom, two bathroom suite, with a partial oceanview. The room was extremely large in size, and it was great to have an extra bathroom for us four girls to get ready in! There were two sliding glass doors that went out to one large balcony, and from the balcony we could see Waikik beach. I must tell you that even though we did not pay extra for an ocean view, the staff at the hotel placed us in this room anyhow. I am not sure if it is common practice or if these rooms were not previously sold, but I thought it was nice that they upgraded us for free, as most hotels dont care and stick you in the room you reserved no matter what! The hotel was in a great location, we could walk to the beach, tons of restaurants, great shopping at the Beachwalk and Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, and the International Marketplace. I read many reviews about other hotels before we booked, but this seemed like a great value when you include the free breakfast and the managers reception, and it delivered big time! Alot of other reviews complained about the food at breakfast, but I felt that there was always a great selection and plenty of food to go around. I never once felt like we were a herd of animals being pushed through the doors, as others have previously wrote. There were two different sides of the buffet room, so it was rarely cluttered with people, and every day there were different items to choose from, including yogurt, toast, bagels, fresh fruit, pastries, bacon, sausage, ham, spam and eggs, rice, potatoes, apple crisp, cereal, and of course, made to order omelets! The food was great, and they also had water, orange juice, guava juice, pineapple juice, apple juice, soft drinks, and coffee available for drinks! There was so many items to choose from, I never got tired of eating the breakfast, and the food tasted great!

For the most part, the hotel delivered on these expectations. I would like to highlight a few things that stood out beyond what you'll read in the other excellent reviews on this site.**THE GOOD**SPACEThe rooms/suites are very spacious and practical. This is the best feature about this hotel.CHECK-INFriendly staff at check-in with mini mocktails and a free Hawaiian CD.VALET PARKINGAlthought a little steep at $25/day, they were very friendly and efficient.LOCATIONThe hotel is surrounded by a number of excellent restaurants including Roy's and a fantastic little Italian place called Arancini. Tons of shops are also within walking distance.**THE BAD**THIN WALLSThe rooms have really thin walls and you can easily hear conversations in adjacent rooms. If you have noisy neighbors and you're a light sleeper, you might have sleep issues. HOTEL POOL BARThe Pakini bar at the pool closed at 5pm on most days we were there, which was fairly disappointing considering the excellent location and ambience at nighttime.BREAKFASTThe buffet breakfast had a cafeteria feel to it with a large open area with tables. Food was fairly basic and the selection was quite limited. For instance, there were no real options for different bread types (just bagels or toast - no rye, wholewheat, multi-grain, etc.) or cereals (no muesli) and there were no boiled eggs (hard or soft) or sandwich meats/cheeses. Having recently been to stay at a similar level of hotel in Helsinki (Finland) this was the area that really stood out as a disappointment at the Embassy Suites. The one good thing was that they had some Japanese breakfast options. OVERALL FEELThe hotel didn't have a luxurious feel to it. Doors, furniture, fittings, the shower-in-shallow-tub did have a slight mid-range hotel feel to it. Maybe I expect too much but I was hoping for a bit more of a luxury experience at this hotel. For this reason, I would not recommend this hotel to honeymooners or others who want a really special experience in Honolulu.","Carlsbad, California",7,4.0

We had requested a partical ocean view room and was delighted with the room we received. Our corner suite had views directly over the pool/breakfast area and out to the sea. Being a corner suite meant we had a extra set of windows along one wall offering this great view. We loved having a seperate bedroom with 2 comfortable queen beds and a seperate living area with a very comfortable sofa bed. The breakfasts are adequate and alway replenished quickly, if I was to be very fussy I would have liked a white tablecloth on the table rather than eat off a tray! The managers reception is nightly offering an open bar from 5.30 - 7.30pm which included cocktails, spirits, wine, beer and soda, they also provide entertainment and snacks. Embassy Suites has ideal location, shops and great restaurants on the ground floor. We ate at Ruth Chris Steak House and The Yard House both meals were great and only steps to your hotel lobby. The beach is only a short walk across the road. Our room was very quite but over the weekend The Yard house at the bottom of the hotel becomes a nightclub at 10pm so we did hear some music from that but not enough to bother us. I would definately stay there again and recommend to friends and family.",New Zealand,32,4.0

I would say everything was pretty much perfect except our ""partial ocean view"" was basically of the new Trump Tower. I suppose I should take my wrath out on Trump more than Embassy Suites. Also, by requesting a king bed in one of the two bedrooms I think I doomed my party to such a view. Requesting two queens in each room might have prevented our plight. The description of partial ocean view was actually quite accurate. If you stood away from the sliding doors about 15 feet and looked out, all you saw was the ugly grey, frame work of the Trump Tower. However, if you were on the balcony or even on the couch closer to the doors (and closed the curtains two-thirds) all you would see was the ocean and the sail boats. If you look at enough pictures you will realize this hotel is not exactly on the beach. But there is a view of the ocean between the corridors of the hotels in front and that view is pretty spectacular in itself. I hate to keep bringing up the Trump Tower but I can only imagine how wonderful a view there must have been just a year prior - because behind the Trump Tower is a government facility (meaning no high rises) which is more of a park, and behind that is just coastline and ocean. By the way, the Trump Tower construction is up to about 20 floors and I believe by the time it is done it will be over 40 floors.Enough about the view and the Trump Tower. Just go in with the expectation that there might be a bit of construction Monday through Friday and it does basically overlook the pool.Speaking of the pool, it met our needs. I can see how it might be small during the summer time when it is full of kids, but I was able to do some simple lap swimming every morning when it opened at 9am. And it has a nice shallow section for small kids. So the pool was just right.The breakfast was fine. True, it is the same food every morning but what do people expect? I find it to be a nice time saver having a breakfast buffet downstairs, not to mention it is a lot cheaper than eating out. They have a nice omlette station and a good selection of fresh fruit. And of course they have the usual selection of pastries, potatoes and bacon/sausage.The parking is a pain at $25/night. Most tourists need a car in Honolulu to get out of the city but if you are only there to see Waikiki, maybe consider shuttling in direct from the airport. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance, not to mention all the shops too. Getting to the beach required a short trek (maybe 5 minutes) from the ground floor to the public beach access outlet. The nearby beach is basically at the very end of what most know as Waikiki Beach. It was convenient for me to take my toddler. All we needed was a pile of sand and some ocean water. But I think the main beach scene was a bit farther away. Getting back to the hotel, the ammenites were satisfactory. The fitness room was open 24 hours. It seemed clean with a decent selection of a few treadmills and free weights. Most of the equipment had TV screens and there were some other screens in the corner of the rooms. It was stocked with towels, a water cooler and disposable earphone covers for the TVs. Don't expect anything huge. It was small but served its purpose.The rooms were quite well furnished. Everything seemed quite modern. The microwave and refrigerator in the room are Embassy Suite trademarks that I basically expect when I travel now. The in-room safes are large enough for a laptop and the free in-room internet connection seemed fast enough for work purposes.Housekeeping was a bit slow as some reviewers have previously mentioned. Being on the upper floors did seem to slow down the staff getting to the rooms. But they did a fine job once they got there.I would normally have given a 5 star review but that Trump Tower is so annoying. It almost would have been better to request a ""city view"" and just stared at the hotels on the other side. But it is always nice to be able to see the water, even if you have to close one of your eyes when looking out the windows just to get an unobstructed view! Other than that, this Embassy Suites was just fine!","Pasadena, California",27,4.0

Like many other reviewers, the only inconvenience we experianced was the noise from all the construction going on next door, but was really not that bothersome at all. The beach was literally across the street and shops and restaurants are abundant in the surrounding area. The ""beach walk"" is especially pretty at night, as the streets are lined with lit tiki torches.

We were there from September 19th through the 23rd. I really hated to leave. I have stayed at many Embassy Suites and I must say, this is the best one I have ever stayed at. We asked when we checked in if there were any ocean view rooms available and we happened to get the last one. We were on the 16th floor in room 1630. The view was spectacular. We had stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village our first three days of a two week visit and we had a perfect view of the Rainbow Tower. Since it was Friday we had a terrific view of the fireworks that Hawaiin Village shoots off every Friday evening. One of the reasons we stayed at Embassy Suites is the breakfast. Since everything is so expensive there it was nice to have a full breakfast in the mornings and not have to pay a lot for it. But the main thing I was impressed with here was the service. I thought I was staying in a five star hotel. The staff was always very friendly and we even had evening turndown service. Every evening my wife and I would return to the room and there would be some kind of chocolate macadamia nut treat and flower on our pillow. The convenience of the microwave and refrigerator was great. Did I say the view was spectacular? We had a balcony on two sides of our room, One was long which covered the living room and bedroom and the other was on the ocean side of the living room. Yes, there is a Trump Tower going in right next door but it did not block our view and we didn't hear much noise from the construction. The Embassy Suites has a pool on the 4th floor which was very nice. On the same floor is the eating area for breakfast and the Manager's reception. The Embassy Suites has owned this property for almost two years so everything is new and inviting. The room motif was Hawaiian and very comfortable. Access to the shopping areas along Waikiki beach was close and easy to get to. I loved it here and didn't want to leave. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone.

We are fans of the Embassy, and it is not the first time we have stayed at one of there properties. The room was comfortable and clean, the fridge is nice to have. The hot breakfast buffet and managers evening reception are the added bonus for us. Wakiki is very expensive, and having the buffet in the morining to start your day was wonderful, and the reception in the evening to have a cocktail and snack before heading out to dinner was also wonderful. Reception snack changed daily, so that was nice and there is also nightly entertainment. Reception bartenders very friendly. The beach is one block up and there is a paved path between the Outriggar and another hotel but it is narrow and lined with rat traps (this is not maintained by Embassy) and smells like trash. When walking to the beach come out of the hotel near the front desk and turn left, cross the street and turn right there is another path to the beach that is very nice. Most of the staff was very nice, some of the front desk staff could have been more friendly and the staff member preparing the omletts was downright rude. Donald Trump has to be the biggest you know, and he is building a 20 something story hotel next door, they were on floor 22 when we were there, so the construction noise can be a bit annoying when at the pool. However, remember this is a big city and it is noisy regardless. Our view was of his building, but I did not mind, I found it quite interesting, and we could see the rest of the city also. One of the best things is you can take the escalator down from the pool/reception area on the 4th floor and you are smack dab in the beach walk area of shops and resturants, very cool.","Detroit, Michigan",4,5.0

The rooms were nice and new, plenty of room for four.We had a bedroom with two queens and a pull-out couch in the living room. More than adequate drawer space for all of our clothes. A table with three (where was the fourth?) chairs and a little wet bar/fridge area. We were in an end room so we had wrap-around windows, it was very light and bright. We hadn't reserved an ocean view so it was a nice surprise to have one.We were in the Aloha tower on the 15th floor, at that height and with only about 10 rooms per floor, it was very quiet. There is construction going on right across the street but we were not disturbed by it. There was a lanai the length of our two rooms but it was very shallow, I was not comfortable out there.They had a nice buffet breakfast every morning. The food was kept fresh and hot. I had a problem with the printer in the business center and the assistant manager came and took care of it within minutes. The pool was nice and very clean with some sunny and shaded areas around it. The beach is less than a block away.The down side is that the place is built on a postage stamp. There is no real lobby to speak of, the reception area and concierge are off to the side of the valet parking area. So it doesn't have a homey, stay a while, atmosphere. And the elevators are TOO small, simply not enough elevator capacity. More than once there was a line for the elevator. Valet parking is $25 a night! Almost the most expensive in Waikiki, as per the prices I saw in a newspaper article while we were there. DO NOT stay on the 4th floor - that is the pool/breakfast level.Overall we were pleased with our stay. The price was what drew me in, quite reasonable for a two-room suite compared to many single-room hotel rooms, and we were not disappointed.

Pros:Felt like a very new (or very recently renovated) building, compared to the other hotels in Waikiki. Sit down at registration (and pineapple juice as a welcome apertif) is friendlier than the traditional hotel approach of belly-up-to-the-front-desk.The room comes with a fridge, a room safe (didn't appear to be big enough to hold a 15"" laptop), a microwave and a miniature kitchen sink. There was also complimentary coffee and a package of microwave popcorn. The fitness room was nicely equipped with a lot of Precor equipment: 4 cross trainer machines, a bike, treadmills, a Nautilus type machine, dumbells from 2 to 50 pounds, Bosu, and exercise balls and weight balls. Each of the Precor machines had built in TVs, so if you bring headphones (or not -- there are ones you can borrow on a shelf along the wall) you could watch the same cable TV channels that you'd see in your room. They did a nightly turndown service, very thoughtful.Separate lanais (balconies) for both the ""living"" room and the bedroom.You need a valid keycard in order to get up any of the hotel's elevators.Free phone calls up to 30 minutes in length for local and mainland. If only all hotels did this...Good & Bad:Free Internet via Ethernet! This is a very welcome amenity. Caveats, if you tend to run programs that generate a lot of connections (e.g. Skype, or even accessing web pages that have a number of frames within one window), you might bump into the hotel's overwhelmingly severe restrictions on their internet connection. I frequently saw ""your service has been slowed down"" or ""your service has been suspended"" web pages instead of the web pages I attempted to open). On the last day of my stay, I chose the ""static IP address"" option instead of the ""standard IP"" when logging into the hotel's internet provider and my network problems appeared to go away, so this may be a solution you can try if you have the same problems that I had.Free Breakfast for all! Free evening Manager's Reception for all! I do not believe the rate you pay actually makes any difference, and that every guest will be able to do both the breakfast & reception (not a single employee at the dining area was checking any key cards or the green slips of paper they handed to me when I checked in). The dining area on the Hula tower's fourth floor terrace is where you'll find your breakfast treats. The breakfast options did not seem to change from day to day, but they did provide Hawaiian music entertainment on stage for a couple of the receptions and breakfasts I made it to. Breakfast runs from 6:30 a.m. and ends a few minutes before 10 a.m. (contrary to the anything the hotel published, which typically state ""10:30 a.m."").Cons:If you're driving, you will pay big time to park ($25 per day for valet service). Take a taxi or bus if you don't have a need to drive outside of Honolulu (you can probably rent a car from a local agency for cheaper than the airport, if you just wanted to drive for a couple days of your stay).Construction next door to the Hula tower can be a little loud during the day (they are at the point where they are blowing air horns when the cranes are doing any heavy lifting or dropping stuff down to the ground level). The Trump Tower also spoils the ""partial ocean view"" of at least the back half of the side of the Hula tower that faces the new building. I asked for a late checkout and the latest I was able to get was noon (normal checkout time is 11 a.m.). As soon as the clock hit noon, my keycards deactivated. When I asked the front desk about this (as I had left a box in my room while loading up my car), they said all keycards automatically expire at noon on checkout day. So I kind of doubt you can get any late checkout beyond noon, no matter what your Hilton Honors status is (I'm currently Gold). Judging from the number of times the maid attempted to barge into the room the morning I was to check out, the hotel sure seemed to be eager to get rid of me.Would I stay here again? Yesss... as long as the rate stays competitive with other hotels. The free breakfast and other amenities gives this hotel an edge over the other Waikiki hotels I've stayed at.","San Francisco, California",627,4.0

One reviewer said that breakfast was a bit like Disneyland and yes, it was quite crowded and hectic, but the staff cleared the tables quickly and there was always a ton of food. They also changed things around, e.g. sometimes waffles, other times french toast.

Our stay on Oahu was brief, followed by a more leisurely visit to Kauai, but our experience was perfect. The room was spacious, clean, and furnished very nicely with appropriate island/beach decor. We stayed in a suite, which is perfect for a family consisting of night owls and early birds! We were on the 16th floor of the Hula tower and had a decent view of the ocean. While not on the beach, the property is across the street from it and within walking distance of restaurants and shops. I barely noticed construction at the new Trump property and do not think it would detract from anyone's visit, to be honest. Staff at the Embassy Suites was top notch: genuinely friendly without being condescending and responsive. The activities director (an Australian gentleman) gave us some great suggestions for discovering the rest of the island and directed us to the perfect North Shore beach to hang out with sea turtles! The (complimentary) Evening Manager's Reception offers drinks, snacks, and entertainment (music and hula) and the breakfast buffet is impressive. Both help set this hotel apart, especially with the high prices in Waikiki Beach.

I had requested a quiet room with a view, and we were thrilled to get a corner room on the 18th floor looking toward both the beach and the mountains. Every day I would wake up early, go to the Business Center, check emails, make phone calls, print documents, and send faxes; the facility for business necessities was good and well-kept. After taking care of any business needs, I would go to the Fitness Center located right next door and do my daily work out consisting of a treadmill, stairmaster, yoga ball, and weights. Many days it was quite full of people, but no one seemed to be waiting for the use of any equipment for very long.I would meet my pre-teen and teenage children for the great breakfast located between the Hula and Aloha Towers; made to order omelettes, a good selection of fruit, and specific local foods like miso soup and portugese sausage were available every day. The best part of staying at this hotel was its proximity to restaurants and stores. I would let my kids venture to the Roxy store and down Waikiki during the day, and I would meet my childhood girlfriends at Roy's or the Yard House at night. It was a wonderful hotel to stay in for the length of time I stayed. The only complaint I had was that guests had a $25/day mandatory valet charge and that at times it would take a while to get my car.

We never had any problems with the elevators and we had the tower away from the construction and never heard any noise. We never used the pool, so I cannot comment on the noise factor there. We were on an upper floor and never experienced any street noise or other tennants noise. My wife is a very light sleeper and she had no problems. We had a one bedroom and it worked well with the four of us. The breakfasts each morning were a wonderful way to start our morning. Nice that it opened very early in AM. After a very busy day, it was nice at the evening reception to sit with a drink and some veges and chips before dinner. Walk to the beach was quick and heart of Waikiki Beach was only 10-15 min away.

The complimentary fresh cooked breakfast was wonderful every morning (the omelette station is a must), the pool was beautiful with a bar of yummy island cocktails, and the overall appearance of the hotel was lovely. The hotel is a very short walk from Waikiki Beach, and in the middle of a promenade of quality shopping, touristy shopping, and restaurants. Think Rodeo Drive, but with lit island torches. And the staff was very helpful and knowledgable of the area--they were able to make recommendations and get us transportation to wherever we needed to go, for a reasonable few dollars. The only downside was the construction of the Trump tower next door, which provided a little noise, and a not so lovely visual from the pool, and some rooms.

There was a small refrigerator, coffee maker, and a microwave. The included breakfast was outstanding, probably the best one I have ever seen. There is everything you could possibly want to eat in the morning. Made to order omelette's, fresh fruit, breakfast potatoes, several assorted pastries, breakfast meats, etc. You can even sit outside in the sun which makes for a great start to the day.The staff was extremely helpful in every way.

For 2 hours, you could get free cocktails and snacks in the same area breakfast was served! (Right by the pool)This hotel is not located right on the beach, however it was a short walk across the street and did not seem to bother anyone in our large group. The location was wonderful.

I'd rate it an 8 on a 10 scale. Vacation got off to a shaky start as we arrived at 11 am local time, but couldn't check in until 3. Our vacation package (Pleasant Hawaiian) included a welcome cocktail, but staff informed us that this was discontinued due to construction on the adjacent Trump Tower. Apparently, something about dust filters, which we felt was a lame excuse as no offer of exchange or compromise was made. We were also led to believe from our travel agent of a partial ocean view room, but this wasn't the case. Similar to other guest reviews, we were informed that we could upgrade for another $75 per night. We declined and accepted the 2 bedroom suite assigned to us in the Aloha tower. (The better ocean views appear to be in the Hula tower). The daily morning breakfast was fine for most of us and resulted in considerable savings in the meal expense category as this is included with your room rate. It was also a crack up watching the birds flying into the open air dining area to nibble on the guests' meals while they were at the beverage counter. (Hint: Best to get your drinks before finding a table). The nightly Managers Reception...eh...I only went one of the nights. The drinks are free and STRONG, but I'm not a big drinker. You should be able to get a good buzz if that's what you're looking for. They also have Hawaiian singers and dancers for your enjoyment, but only broccoli tips, celery, and greasy potato chips to nibble. Upon check in, you are issued a paper meal ticket, and we were strongly cautioned not to lose it, as they wouldn't be replaced. Funny thing is, the whole week we were there, nobody ever checked it. We also had issues with the construction noise from the aforementioned Trump Towers. You'll likely hear frequent BOOMS! during the days and especially around the pool area which isn't sheltered from the ongoing construction . The hotel manager (Dan?) arranged for those in our party to walk over and enjoy the pool amenities of the nearby Reef Hotel. This made those in our party happy. There are only two elevator shafts per tower, and sometimes this can be an issue even though the elevators seem to be high tech. Keep your key cards handy at all times. You'll need them to get to any of the floors going up or down, except for the lobby. This is likely in place to prevent freeloaders from entering the buffet or pool areas on the 4th floor. Soft drink machines are on alternate floors only. The 24 hr gym is small and stuffy, but has high end cardio machines with tv's attached. They also have a 24 hr laundry room that came in handy. The have reliable wireless internet in the lobby and on the 4th floor, but we had a devil of a time with the in-room ethernet. Advertised as 50x fast, but was often times slower than dial-up when we could connect at all. When we called about this, we were given the usual ""server issue"" response. One of the days we asked the concierge to help us with renting a minivan. They tried two companies that they ""partner"" with but then sent us off to another hotel when we asked about Hertz. Episode illustrated to us that the concept of ""Spirit of Aloha"" gets a little fuzzier to define when a dollar isn't to be made or had. All in all, it's hard to have a bad vacation in Hawaii. This was about my 10th time to Oahu. Many of the locals will tell you to go to the other islands to get the real taste of Hawaii, and I think I'll take their advice next time.Cheers & Aloha!","Vallejo, CA",13,4.0

Yes there is construction going on as the new Trump Tower is being built next door but it never bothered me. I have kids and am used to switching off to loud noise.

I stayed here just last week and was here for 6 days. I came with my girlfriend and chose this because it was one of the most highly rated here that was available. This is my experience while checking in...I got there and (because I'd read about the construction and also warned not to get a room next to elevators) I requested a room away from both. I was told that the only rooms with King beds was next to the elevator. I was also told that there were none with Kings away from contruction. I was given the option to pay an additional $50 per night to get a room with 2 beds on a high floor away from elevators and Trump construction. I was extremely annoyed because I felt like I was the victim of the old 'bait an switch'. It was terrible way to start a vacation. Nevertheless, i paid it because I'd rather pay more for peace than ruin my entire vacation. Once I got to the room , it had a wonderful view and the decor, etc. was nice.This is the list of pros and cons based on my experience there...Pros:Location (right in the edge of Waikiki and you can get to just about anything on the beach from here)Newness (the room was updated and modern)Staff (friendly and courteous)Business Center (Internet access..whoo hoo!)Breakfast (the breakfast buffet is probably the most memorable thing about the hotel)Managers Reception (can't go wrong with free drinks. the snacks were not that good but it WAS free)Cons:Pool (always crowded with wayyy too many kids. Can you consider an adults-only hour or two a day?? One day, a young girl threw up in the )Location (the front of the hotel is on the Trump construction side and it's a pretty small narrow street. Some tour buses are not allowed down this street because they don't fit.)Fitness room (This was small and while they DID have quite a few treadmills, it's inadequate for weighlifters)Final thoughts: If you're looking for a hotel with lots of 'stuff' then this is the wrong place for you. The Hilton Waikiki Village has shops on th epremises and a private lake, etc. It seems to be more adult friendly. I've heard that they nickel and dime you to death and it's older and tackier. If the hotel for you is one that's clean, and provides a good home base so that you can explore the island. I'd recommend the Embassy Suites.",Washington DC,52,4.0

I paid $249/night AAA rate and I didn't feel overcharged at all.A couple things to note:1) If you select a room with a king-size bed you will be next to the elevators and they will annoy you all night long. We moved to a room with two double beds and while not our first choice it was much quieter and we were happy.2) The construction noise is very real and very annoying. However, our second room was in the Aloha tower on the side away from the construction and noise was a non-issue after that. If you have a room on the side where the construction is happening it will probably bother you. Something to consider.You will not, however, be able to escape the noise while at the pool. If you wait until 3pm to visit the pool you will avoid the noise.3) I was unaware of the free breakfast when I booked the hotel and was very pleasantly surprised. The food was good and there was plenty to choose from. This is NOT the cheesy continental breakfast most US hotels offer. They also have a Manager's Reception each evening with free drinks and snacks.4) Valet parking is mandatory and costs $25/day before tips. We were able to rent a car for the day for $38 and returned it that night. That might be a better solution if you're a cheapskate like me.Overall the staff was friendly and helpful. Suite setup is great and bathroom is quite large.Location is great with plenty of shops & restaurants nearby and the beach is a 5 minute walk.The ABC Store (2 right outside the hotel) will have everything you'll need at reasonable prices.

Trump is building a tower next door, I asked for a room on the opposite side of the construction and the front desk agent insisted it was. I asked a few times during the check in. When I got to the room I think it was as close to the construction as I could have gotten. When I went back to the fron desk, they said they had no more rooms. After 30 minutes and calling Hilton Honor's Diamond desk they finally gave me a room with two double beds in the other tower. They wouldn't give me an upgrade to a king bed, eventhough I'm a Diamond member with Hilton. The pool during the day is also loud because of the construction.The Good:Although I had a bad experience while checking in, the good well out weighed the bad. The service was great aside from the front desk. I met Mark, Assistant General Manager, the first night there and he remembered my name the entire trip, eleven days.

What an incredible site! We came across Embassy Suites and crossed our fingers and booked it. Everything we read about the hotel was true. The staff were wonderful, so helpful and accommodating. The night before we left we had to send an important package back to Australia and they really went way beyond the call of duty to get it home for us. Even after we left there were problems with the courier and the staff took care of it. I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough.The rooms were beautiful, the food was fantastic, the pool was awesome, as was the staff. My husband had an ear ache and the guy behind the tour desk actually took David around the corner to the doctors!! We love Waikiki and this hotel will always be our home away from home.

I read this online, but it did NOT sink in: Hello: Read my lips: HUGE CONSTRUCTION SITE NEXT DOOR......!!! Within your whole visual realm. It was Ugly. This was ALL that we saw when we went onto our balcony and all we heard come Monday morning! We went to the pool and heard jack hammering!!!! Do NOT stay here if you want peace and quiet.

I laid down to take a nap as soon as I got there and all I could hear was the elevator going up and down and the dinging. I called down and asked to change rooms and they said no problem. We got a new room but were still facing the construction. The also did not offer to move our luggage. The issues I had with the hotel were the erratic elevators and the noise at the pool. The pool had a group of teens in it unsupervised and they were loud and horseing around. No one from the hotel would stop this even though they saw what was going on.

The thing that always got me was all the extra stuff I had to pay for.. As a loyal Hilton Family guest, when I saw this new Embassy Suites I jumped on the opportunity to stay here, and this is the perfect place to stay. It is in the Hilton Family, and you get more then a room! The room was more then a room, it was a suites, as are all the rooms. Not your typical Embassy Suite type room, but still nice.. The suite had a small counter top with a snick, microwave, and mini -frig, a nice sized sitting with with balcony, the bedroom was also a nice size. Both the bedroom and sitting room had a flat panel TV. The bathroom was what I would call basic, nothing special. A good size and clean. Here is the best part, all the free stuff. There was a nightly managers reception around the pool area, with a limited open bar, more then beer on tap, you can get all types of mixed drinks. There was also a very nice hot food buffet. The breakfast was also very nice, with a large layout.. All this is in your room rate.. but wait there is more.. FREE Internet, and PHONE calls.. You get like 100 min free phone calls anywhere in the USA. Parking was the only extra free $25.00 per day, they only offer in-and-out valet parking. It was a nice service, but I do not like to tip someone every time I want my car.. As a Hilton Diamond member I really did not notice any thing special from all the other guest. The staff was nice, but you are just a number to them. I think you get this at any big resort area hotel. I would stay here over and over.. You get a nice bang for your buck..

My husband and I are diamond members so we were upgraded to a very nice corner suite. The view from our balcony was nice. This will most likely not last for long since Trump is building a mega resort across the street. The accomodations in the room are decent however the beds are very uncomfortable. The housekeeping team at this hotel was horrible and made our stay less than great. Each and every day of our six night stay we had issues with them. They left dirty towels in our room one day, dirty glasses for several days, and on numerous occasions we had to call housekeeping to get toiletries that were meant to be left in the room. When we called to complain we were given the runaround. In fact when we asked to speak to the GM we were told that they did not know where he was and had no way to contact him.

It is a nice hotel with a friendly courteous, staff, good location, and the free amenities are a huge bonus.The Construction Issue:The noise wasn't too bad, it was noticeable but not overpowering during breakfast, and they stopped around the same time the reception began. We were in the Hula Tower and did not hear any of it from our room, even with the lanai doors open. Overall, it was noticeable but not distracting or too much of a nuisance. If you are sensitive to noise, then I would suggest staying at a different hotel.Value:The free breakfast is a great value, and it's probably save a couple 40-50 bucks a day, and even more if you are bringing a family. It was not too crowded and there was plenty of food. French Toast, Waffles, Pancakes, Eggs, Cereal, Oatmeal, Omelettes made to order, Bacon, Sausage, Fresh Fruit, Yogurt, Bread (White and Wheat), Bagels, Baked Goods, Coffee, Milk, Juice, and soda were all readily available. The food is fresh, and of decent quality. It's what you would find in a normal restaurant, not crappy cafeteria/dorm food.The manager's reception had snacks such as peanuts, chips, salsa, egg rolls, crab potstickers, cocktail sausages, salad, and other small snacks. They had well drinks, and the beer was Bud Light and Michelob Amber Bock.Staff/Service:One of our main complaints was the concierge service. They were unable to get us a rental car in Waikiki when we simply looked online and booked it ourselves through Budget. They were helpful in calling cabs and giving us shuttle information. I say book the activities on your own, but use them to get you taxis, shuttles, and other basic info. We had one housekeeper who wasn't very good, but another who was very nice and friendly, and waited till we left the room to start cleaning. Overall the staff was friendly, and accommodating, but again, book the activities yourself.Location/Facilities:The hotel is perfectly located. Its about a 1-2 minute walk to the beach, and there is plenty of shopping and restaurants all on the same block and within the area. The little Coco Cove convenience store is nice and a good way to pick up water, drinks, snacks, or other things that you don't want to walk very far to get. They also have Dole Pineapple Whip! The pool and spa area is nice, and was not very crowded. The bar is a little expensive but if you want to have a drink and relax by the pool its a nice convenience. The workout room was well equipped, but it was a bit too stuffy and hot, they definitely need more ventilation and fans. There is also free water in the workout room so if you have a refillable bottle you can just go in there and fill it up if you don't want to pay for water. The business center was very convenient, and the free printing is extremely helpful. Overall, I liked the decor, and the building was new, clean, and nice. Parking is expensive, $25 a day, so I suggest looking for parking elsewhere.I'd recommend this hotel, the free breakfast is a really nice touch and can save you a ton of money especially if you are bringing kids.","Walnut Creek, CA",3,4.0

The courtesy breakfast was hit with the kids, offering pancakes, french toast, potatoes, omlets, scambled eggs, sausage, bacon, and breads every day. The kids loved the pool, which was very clean, with a little shallow area just right for our young ones. The hotel has a coin laundry facility, which after talking around, I found was rare for Waikiki.Our main disappointment with the hotel was the lackluster housekeeping. Several days there was still a lot of sand on the bathroom floor after ""cleaning"".

We have stayed at other hotels in Waikiki, yet this one was the best yet. It is very new and clean. We stayed in the Hula tower on the 18th floor. The suite had two rooms and a small dining table. It also had a partial ocean view and two balconies. I was most concerned with the noise issues. We brought earplugs and never used them. Yes, the noise starts at about 5:30am but, hey it is the city and all the hotels have the same noise issues. Even on the 18th floor we could hear the traffic, but that is what you get at the majority of hotels here. This hotel is literally one block off the beach near the north end of Waikiki a few blocks from the Hilton Hawaiian village. The beach here is clean and uncrowded. Perfect. For A hotel not being on the beach, this was the next best thing,The breakfast and live music in the am was awesome. It reminded me of a cruise ship type breakfast because of the huge variety of food. Cooked to order,too. Evenings also had a drink and small finger food reception every night. The people that worked here, worked hard to keep the place clean and tidy. The chef prepared a special plate of strawberries for my son . He came out and met my son and it was quite something. Thank you Glenn. The people were great. The location is close to many great restaurants and the International Market for shopping. It was a great hotel choice.

We loved the area we were in - lots of great shopping, good restaurants and just a short walk to the beach. A previous review mentioned that the guests at the breakfast buffet were pushy and rude, but we didn't experience that at all. I found that everyone was very polite and people were patient and waited in line to get their food with no problems. The staff at the hotel were friendly and always helpful.

Originally, we were booked to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, but were able to add a night to our vacation but not to our reservation. Hilton let me know that they had availability at Embassy Suites. Having stayed at the Suites in Maui, and having such a positive experience, I thought that this would be a great alternative and booked the reservation, letting them know that my room would need to accomodate 5 people. (3 children, two adults, which did not seem to be a problem with the person taking the reservation --although he did inform me there was a fire code in Honolulu which allowed only four people in a room.) I also booked a suite for my parents and requested that the rooms be adjoining or close to each other. My last request was that if possible I would like a late checkout as our flight did not leave until 5pm. I prepaid the reservation and all seemed good.In terms of location, the hotel was a good choice--actuallly better than the Hilton Hawaiian Village since it was closer to the shops and other action of Waikiki. A negative to the location is that there is alot of construction going on across the street at Trump's new building and also at the Outrigger across the street. Construction starts early (although not a problem for us as my children are early risers) Also, the construction had more of an impact for us staying in the Aloha tower, which directly overlooks Trump's building, so much of the view is scaffoling and cranes.Another negative was with our checkin experience. Upon checkin, the woman informed me that I had too many people booked in my room, which was against fire code and that she would ""let me go this time"". I informed her that Hilton had directly taken my reservation and that I had been forthcoming with the number of guests which they accepted and took my prepayment in full for. She still insisted she was ""doing me a favor"" and was quite rude and condescending. The interaction was embarssing to me as other people checking in heard the exchange. It was quite an unfriendly way to be greeted and left a bad taste in my mouth from the start. Next, she informed me that there was no way that my request for adjoining rooms could be honored. She could not even offer me rooms in the same tower. When I requested to speak to a manager, he informed me that although I had requested the adjoining rooms, I had not indicated that I was traveling with others--which left me slightly confused because whey else would I have requested adjoining and and prepaid two rooms if I was not ""traveling with the people--and quite honestly, what is the difference in requesting an adjoining room and indicating you are traveling with someone?The next negative was our room. We were taken to room 110 in the Aloha tower. In this room, there were no lanais, so the room felt like a closet as our only view was the Trump construction through a small window--no lanais or fullbig windows to open up the room.On a positive, my parents were in room 729 in the Hula tower. Their room had an ocean view, 2 lanai's--really nice. In general, rooms were clean, spacious and rather up to date decor--contrary to another Outrigger property we had stayed at in Waikiki on another visit. The manager's reception was ok-- Food offerings included cocktail meatballs, eggrolls, sliced sub type sandwiches, fresh broccoli and cauliflower, goldfish and on another night, fried zucchini. Not a bad selection for an appetizer to hold you over until dinner. Each reception included entertainment. Breakfast had many offerings. Eggs, breakfast meats, made to order omlettes, pancakes, fresh fruit, etc. There was definitely something for everyone. The pool is on the 4th floor. It is a nice pool and has a great toddler section. Only problem, it is kind of breezy on the fourth floor (wind seems to really move between the buildings. Also, pool is right alongside Trump property under construction.Other amenities offered were free wireless internet access, complimentary first 30 minutes on each long distance call, free printing, good selection of television channels. Regarding houskeeping, although we were on the 1st floor, they did not get to our room until after 3:30, when were coming back from being at the beach all day. We had to ask them to give us 20 minutes to clean up and then leave our room again so it could be cleaned. I should also note that our last request, a late check out, was also not honored. I called the evening before checkout and they told me I could call in the am and they would let me know if they wold honor it. So I called 7am the next day, and they said no, but when my family was ready to shower/dress for the airport, it might be possible to utilize a hospitality room if one was available. When I asked if I could reserve one, they said no--it was first come first serve, however, 1pm was usually not a problem. At 1, I went to the front desk to make my request (mind you we had checked out of 110 at 11 am). At first the woman told me they did not give out hopitality rooms between 1 and 3. I told her this was a contradiction to what I had been told. She hesitated a while, went in the back and gave me a key to room 101. When I took my boys upstairs to change, it turns out that this room was in the middle of being cleaned--sheets ripped off the bed, dirty towels on the floor etc. I'm not sure what a hospitality room should offer, but at minimum I would think clean towels. Interestingly enough, I am not sure why I could not keep my room until 1:30 as housekeeping had obviously hardly started cleaning this floor. One thing to note: I had a conversation with another woman who had a family of five staying there. When I asked her what Type of room she had, she said a one room suite like my own. I asked here if she was given a hard time. She said no--she had booked through the Waikiki suites directly and they said they would let her put her family in there, although it was against code, this one time. Our last negative experience: We inadvertently left our ipod on the desk in the suite when we checked out (very careless on our part). We realized this upon checkin at the airport. We immediately called the hotel and asked them to please double check our room. Interestingly enough the ipod never turned up.","Hockessin, Delaware",38,2.0

We were impressed to see that the rock planters and waterfall in this area were scrubbed down with brushes several times a week. Everywhere on this property was clean and well maintained. Embassy Suites is just off the beach, close to Fort DeRussy. Restaurants and shopping are plentiful in this area. Several restaurants close by offer discounts to Embassy Suite guests. Some of our favourite restaurants were the Yardhouse, an italian restaurant across the street (can't remember the name) and Senor Frogs. I would recommend this property to anyone. We paid around $300.00 per night and it was worth every penny. When we go back to Waikiki, there is no doubt in my mind that we will stay there again!!LinetteSherwood Park, Alberta","Sherwood Park, Alberta",8,5.0

We chose this hotel based on previous reviews and we actually split our vacation between 2 different properties - the HHV and here.Nothing really new or different to provide on the perks for this location: The rooms are big and the location is central - it's easy to get everywhere. Front desk and bell staff are friendly, location is excellent with lot's of restaurants, coffee and shopping nearby. All the staff at breakfast and the evening reception were wonderful, drinks were strong. They have singers and entertainment, which help to drown out construction noise during the breakfast and evening reception.However, many of the other items that other posters have listed as positives just didn't thrill me. I found it difficult to relax. Here's what I didn't like:1. Contruction noise is non-stop from both the Trump Tower and the Outrigger Reef. It's really distracting during meals and at the pool. The constant view of the construction site was also a negative.2. Behavior of guests at breakfast was absolutely zoo-ish. Think of a high school cafeteria or the early bird special at Country Buffet. Loud, crowded and pushy. The food, however, was good, nice variety of items. The evening reception was more civilized but the food wasn't as good.3. The pool was a decent size for waikiki but it was crowded with wild, unsupervised kids. No one seemed to be monitoring rough behavior while the parents drank at happy hour.4. Houskeeping never made it to our room on the 4th floor until after 4pm each day. It always seemed to coincide with us returning from the beachI know many guests have found this hotel to be wonderful for the amenities offered and it wasn't a bad stay for us. I guess I was just expecting something a little more peaceful. I will return to Waikiki but I probably won't come back here.","Highlands Ranch, Colorado",90,3.0

Good place to crash upon escape from a Midwestern winter and to get ready for a week of R & R. We even managed to arrive just in time for the manager's reception that continues until a respectable 7:30 PM with complimentary live entertainment, wonderful hors d'oeuvres, and first class beverages available. Plenty to tide us over from a day of travel until the morning.We did reserve early (6 months in advance) and paid the premium price to guarantee an oceanfront room. But it surely was quite nice to be able to sit on one balcony of our room and watch the ocean or sit on the other and watch the Trump construction that other reviewers have mentioned.Compared to many other Embassy Suites they have a very efficient breakfast setting with plenty of capacity -- and even live breakfast entertainment on one of the days we were there. No waiting and really nice inside or outside seating options. (If outside, don't leave your plate unattended to get a coffee or juice -- the birds who live in the neighboring palm trees come for breakfast too!)Keep in mind that Waikiki is an ""urban resort"". It's sort of as if Midtown Manhattan had been relocated into the middle of the Pacific. If you want to get out of city, you need to choose a different setting (we spent the rest of our time in Kauai.) However, if Waikiki is your destination, this property is located almost exactly at mid point of the hotel row and a really easy walk from any of shops, restaurants or markets. Even Cheeseburger in Paradise is, in our opinion, an easy stroll and well worth it. The nightly street performers are just a few blocks away, but so is the widest and best sand beach on the strip. One general hint. We've found that simply taking a cab to or from the airport is by far the most convenient route to the beach hotels and, for two of us, not all that expensive comparatively speaking. Also, given what you're going to spend for your vacation anyway, it's not much of an additional investment over the hotel buses. In fact, on the way back to the airport, the bellman put us in a stretch limo whose driver was glad to charge us only the standard cab fare (about $35 at present.)  In summary, we've stayed at several places on Waikiki. This may not be our favorite but it certainly is a great place that we would highly recommend. Families would probably find it to be a dynamite setting for location and value both. As grandparents, we enjoyed just watching and listening to the numerous families who happened to be there at the same time we were.

I'd have to say that I have an overall favorable impression of the hotel after our stay.Everyone on staff was pretty friendly and polite. Our room was clean and comfortable. We didn't have a beach view, but our room overlooked the pool area, and we had very quick access to the pool which was convenient for the kids.The breakfasts win the show in my eyes. Having full breakfasts (it's a buffet and you you can order omlette's or eggs) was big for our kids who woke up every morning pretty famished. The manager's cocktail reception is nice in that you have an opportunity to enjoy some drinks and light snacks prior to going out to dinner each evening.Location wise was OK. It's just a couple blocks to the beach which can be a long walk for our kids after a long day at the beach, but not too overhwelming. You do have immediate access to the main strip on Waikiki so you can access all of the shopping & dining very quickly.Overall a very enjoyable stay - one hotel I would visit again. It didn't completely ""wow"" me to get 5-stars, but was the perfect fit for our family vacation.One note - the consierge area that booked all of the activities were friendly, but not all that helpful.

We have stayed at other hotels on the island before (Hilton Hawaiian Village, Ihilani, Turtle Bay and Double Tree hotel) but Embassy was by far THE BEST. We thoroughly enjoyed the full breakfast buffet every morning! Since we knew there was a mini refrigerator and micro, we brought deli meats and breads, left over pizza, fruits and drinks and packed it up for lunch and spent the afternoons at the beach right across the street. It was nice to also come back to relax by the pool, only to get MORE pupus and drinks at the manager's cocktail hour. The breakfast, our snacks and manager's cocktail hour held us over for the whole day. We didn't eat at a single restaurant our entire stay, except for going downstairs every night to get a coffee and some Beard Papa's cream puffs or Mondo Gelato (with buy 1 get one free coupons we got from the hotel) to relax and people watch. We took advantage of the many free nightly music groups at the hotel, or spent our odd hours reading the complimentary newspaper delivered to our door each morning. The hotel was extremely clean and the wait staff at the open lanai eating areas were very efficient and friendly.

It was right in the middle of everything. Just a short walk to the beach, many restraunts, shopping and people watching. We had to upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite because the fire code in Hawaii won't allow 5 people in a 1 bedroom suite, which didn't make a lot of sense but the manager made it good. We were right on the beachwalk and the activity below was fun to watch. We even had a peek a boo view, if you stuck your head off the balcony really really far.I was irritated about the valet parking fee, but in the end enjoyed not having to find a parking spot when we were coming back from a long day, and having that feature made us feel rich because we would not pay for that if it was an option. The valet attendants were great as was the reception staff. I would stay here again for sure. I would recommend the yardhouse and the holokai grill for dinner. The yardhouse has a ton of beers on tap, and a small happy hour, not many foods on the happy hour menu. the Hula grill above Dukes has a great happy hour.Something else that we did to cut costs is that Wal-Mart is very close to the hotel, we went and got those rolled mats for the beach, they were 1.39 a piece there, and we got water and munchies for the hotel room. We also bought a compact cooler, we really could have used an umbrella and I wish I had thought about it while we were at wal-mart.

The only drawback was the noise from Trump Tower going up on our side of the building, yet that construction starts around 7 – 8am.

There was construction going on across the street and they gave us a room on the opposite side so the noise wouldn't bother us, and we didn't even have to ask for it. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the breakfast buffet was great. Hospitality hour bartenders were awesome, although the appetizers weren't so hot. Didn't really matter, when rating the whole experience! The hotel, while not right on the beach, is located on a street with lots of boutiques and restaurants, in a park-like atmosphere. Once we saw the beach scene on Waikiki, we didn't want to go to the beach anyways - it's sure not Maui, that is for SURE. The pool area was very nice, except for the construction zone overlooking it, across the street. Didn't bother us at all. We hardly noticed. Free internet service in-room and in the lobby. As a matter of fact, I am writing this review in the lobby while we wait for our airport shuttle - that's how impressed I am.On our last day on Oahu, our flight did not leave until 8:00pm. We requested a late check-out (1:00 pm), but were told it was not available for that room. However, they offered an alternative - to switch rooms that morning, and we could have that room until 1:00. We switched rooms, and left for our early morning Pearl Harbor tour, which was arranged by the Embassy Suites very competent bell staff. When 1:00 arrived, we checked out, checked our luggage, and were given a special key to the swimming pool floor so we could use the pool and services for the afternoon, including beach towels. Not only that, when it came time to get ready to leave for the airport, they let us use a hospitality suite for 1/2 hour to shower and change clothes, free of charge. We have never been offered this extra service before and we are very grateful to have had the opportunity to rinse off the chlorine and suntan lotion before going to the airport.Although Waikiki Beach is not our style, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Embassy Suites and were extremely impressed with the level of service we received. We would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a visit to this part of Oahu.",Northern California,16,5.0

Our room, 421, was perfect. The decor was 100% Hawaiian complete with the hula lamp. We thought the bedside CD player was a nice touch although the complimentary CD wasn't worth bringing home, There was ample storage for our 2 suitbags and 2 suitcases and no noise problems whatsoever with the Trump hotel being built right beside the Embassy Suites. Both our patios opened up to the pool area and this location was great for sunning, breakfast and the nightly Managers reception. Be aware, if this hotel is being chosen for relaxing in the sun, the sun didn't hit the pool area until 9:40 at the time of year we were here. The only negative to the room location was the food carts rolling across the pool deck area early in the morning but, since we were awake anyway, it really wasn't an issue. The location of the hotel itself was perfect; beautiful shops and lots of restaurants within steps and only a short stroll to Waikiki Beach. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the nightly Managers reception had nachos and cheese or chili each night as well as the usual snacks like nuts, chips, pretzels. The nightly entertainment was very enjoyable and the talent excellent. They also had a group playing poolside one night and they were great. The complimentary internet is a nice touch. The valet parking was $25 but well worth it for convenience and the staff were so friendly and efficient. We had lunch at the pool bar and the food was excellent; grilled mahi mahi sandwich with wasabi aioli and macaroni salad, and cajan chicken breast sandwich with a delicious pineapple-mango chutney with hot, tasty french fries. The meal included 2 small frozen non-alcoholic smoothies - $23.98. We had a lovely meal at Yardhouse which is right downstairs but were disappointed with Giovanni Pastrami.

It was an eye opener - especially the photos... frankly after reading the review for my first two choices I changed my mind! Then a travel agent mentioned the Embassy and I started doing some research.Well I'd definitely give it 4 out of 5 stars. I was looking for some place that would have one or two bedrooms, as I was travelling with 3 older teen age children (1 boy, 2 girls and myself - which made sleeping arrangements a bit challenging). One think I can't understand is when booking the accomodations we could n't get a guarantee on bedding layout, nor would they give us a guarantee on having a 'lanai'? Whats with that - we got both........but the uncertainty was a bit unsettling.At any rate lobby was impressive, open air concept.......but stifling hot because theres no airconditioning! plus taxi and valet parking in the open lobbying area made it a little noisy and stuffy.However they did serve cocktails to all of us while we were waiting - which was a nice touch - and a cd with hawaiin music and info on the Embassy Suites was a gift upon check in.One thing that was interesting was that when we originally booked out 1 bedroom suite, we were told there were no 2 bedroom suites available. Had there been, it would have been more but it would have been manageable. However when we checked in - they said there were 2 bedroom suites but they were 150/night more with no view? Oh well.The rooms themselves were clean and tidy - actually I was impressed with how clean it was. We were on the top floor (20th) had a lanai!.......but man we were so high - it was major vertigo overlooking the balcony onto 'Beachwalk'.....views were great.......oceanview - but not oceanfront..........eachhotel decides how to describe their views so be specific when you make a request.The rooms were small, and that was disappointing (4 grown people)........there was one queen hide-a-bed couch in the livingroom, 1 sofa chair, a kitchen table with 4 chairs, a microwave, small bar sink and small refridgerator. There were no utensils, corkscrews, waterbottles or mini bar...The bedroom had 2 queen beds, one night table, on desk, one chest of drawers and one single wardrobe.There was no place to put suitcases - wouldn't fit under bed, and clothes? yikes very tight squeeze.But there were cd players, 2 tv's and very nice design, bedding, lots of pillows - but we had to ask for extra blankets, and it was great having a mini kitchen - although in the end really all we used was the mini fridge........Also great toiletries, had to ask for more towels every day (3 towel sets for 4 people????) and on average you'd have 2 showers a day, morning, and after beach?Beach was about 2 blocks away....not bad...but if I had a choice I'd pick a beachfront location next time. Having had both, its definitiely a preference........Concierge was mediocre...misdirection for busing etc.Advice? Take a cab just about anywhere if there are more then 3 of you! Its cheaper.......Also limo costs as much as a cab so make the request!Absolutely the best deal is their free buffet made to order breakfast......its amazing and inclusive in the room cost (the breakfast would probably be a minimum of $15-20 per person anywhere else?Also in the evenings they have a managers special from 5-7 - cocktails are free then - super! but the appetizers were, veggies, dip and nachos???? hmmm.All in all great, decent service (calling front desk and having someone answer could take 15 minutes.......but when they did answer they were helpful.This may sound critical.........it is particular, and overall I was happy with the experience......its just we notice what 'isn't' faster then we do what 'is'.........Super clean, immaculate, halls, rooms, bathrooms, close or rather on the Beachwalk, so shops, Starbucks.......everything relatively close.

I realized too late that the hotel is located in the most traffic congested and noisy area of Waikiki (most of Waikiki is congested and noisy). The Embassy Suites are twin towers about a block inland from Waikiki Beach and next to beautiful Fort DeRussy Beach Park. It's just a short stroll to the beach, so no big deal. There are alot of new shops and restaurants in the revitalized Beach Walk area.The rooms are well appointed, cozy, and the service is attentive. There is a small pool on the 4th floor plaza that seemed to be filled with screaming kids and teenagers most of the time. The breakfast area is like a brightly lit, noisy, high school cafeteria with little charm. The two pool bars were also overlit with bright flourescent lighting and very uninviting. You WILL stand in line for your breakfast, your drinks, your snacks, and the elevators. If it rains, you will get wet trying to get to the cafeteria for breakfast from either tower. Everyone at the pool gets to watch and hear the new Trump Tower construction team work loudly until 2009. We also had a close up view of the construction from every window and balcony of our room, and the workers could watch us in return.Parking was an overpriced $25USD day plus tips for speedy valet service. Don't forget anything in your car, like a cell phone, as it is a hassle to retrieve later.The poorly designed open air front desk area must have been designed by the same design team who put bright flourescent lighting in the bar/pool/dining areas on the 4th floor. The sweaty staff and guests also can smell car exhaust through the humid lobby. Lobby needs to be glass enclosed and air conditioned for a quiet, relaxing environment. For a more peaceful stay, I would recommend the nearby Halekulani, Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort, Ilikai, or the Hawaii Prince Hotel on Ala Moana Blvd. You will not feel like you are on a kid-filled Disney Cruise at these properties.","Seattle, Washington",64,4.0

Walk across the street and between the Outrigger hotel buildings to get to the beach, which is now just a narrow strip of sand. In fact, the waves were hitting the sea walls on much of the beach. We rode from the airport on a shuttle bus, and were immediately greeted by cheerful and helpful staff. No matter what we asked about at the activities desk, they were able to help us determine what to do and how to get there. Our suite was very nice, with the expected very comfortable bedding and pillows, plus they had nice plasma TVs. Since I had already been on the road a week, we took advantage of probably the nicest hotel guest laundry room we've ever used. The evening reception and complimentary breakfasts were very nice, and the 4th floor rooftop lanai was very relaxing, although it was quite breezy one evening when a storm blew through. You can save a bunch of money by taking advantage of these complimentary foods rather than paying the expensive Hawaii prices elsewhere. There are many great places to eat nearby, but you might try either Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, or some great seafood at Roy's - both are in the Embassy Suites buildings.

Stay away from the Wyndham pitch to come visit their hotel for a $100. It is a time share talk! Take the Grand Island tour on Thursday, your driver Greg with ""Roberts Tour"" is the best!

It was great for us since we could put our daughter in a separate room for her naps and her 8 pm bedtime. The location was great, right in the middle of the new Beachwalk area, and across the street from the beach. It is a fairly new hotel. We stayed in two different rooms and they were both great. The view was great, although once Trump's building is done, the view will be almost entirely blocked. The pool was great, especially for kids. The breakfast was convenient and good, the happy hour was fun and free. The happy hour offered basic drinks, including tropical ones, a few snacks like cut veggies, chips, salsa, etc, and they had live music and sometimes even hula dancers. Free internet in the rooms and around the hotel was great for my hubby since he was working also. Great convenience store near the elevators and of course the prerequisite ABC store right across the street make it easy to get whatever you need. I felt it was a good value for the money and we were very pleased with the hotel. I would stay there again.","Walnut Creek, California",47,5.0

We traveled with our 15 m.o. child and our friends traveled with their 10 m.o.. All-in-all this was the best hotel experience that we have had in Waikiki, where we travel annually to visit friends and family. The location is great for easy access to restaurants and shopping. And even though the Trump CondoHotel is underconstruction across the street, the construction noises never disturbed our stay on either the 4th or 9th floors.Check-in was relaxed and efficient, our rooms were in good condition with comfortable beds and plenty of room for the three of us. It was great to have the living room available for the crib and the separate bedroom for me and my wife. It is important to note that this hotel has at least two room configurations, with the bathroom accessed either from the living room or from the bedroom. You should request whichever is appropriate for your purposes upon check-in. We elected for the bath off the bedroom so that our toddler could sleep undisturbed in the living room.Breakfast was the typical Embassy Suites selection with cooked-to-order omelets and other standards. The distinction here is that they also offer Miso soup, salad and a few other Hawaiian and Japanese items like Haupia yogurt and Portugese sausage that are a nice and tasty complement to a standard American breakfast.Valet parking seemed a bit expensive at $25/day but the service was tremendous as we never waited more than a minute or two for our car. Valet and Bell Staff were plentiful, polite and quite helpful with directions and information. Also there seemed to be staff everywhere, (this is good thing) always cleaning or otherwise busy. The hotel is new and it will continue to look and feel new if the staff remain as attentive to cleaning and maintenance as they were during our stay.My only complaint, about our two stays is that upon checking in on Saturday the hotel did not have a crib available, even though we had called and requested one several weeks before our trip.. The hotel did arrange to borrow a crib from a nearby hotel , but we had to wait for an hour or so for it. Our toddler was not too happy about this after flying all day. This was not a problem on our second stay the following week.We stayed in both towers and on the 4th and 9th floors during our two stays. Depending on your interest, you may want to request a room overlooking the pool in order to listen to the nightly music from your balcony. We found the 4th floor to be particularly nice as it is the level of the breakfast and nightly cocktail hour,. After our son went to sleep in the evenings, we were able to sit out on the patio (with the baby monitor) and enjoy the music and conversation with friends, knowing that we could be back in the room in just a few seconds if he needed anything.This is a great hotel for families , but was not overrun with children. There was also an interesting mix of retirees, college kids and foreign tourists. We plan to stay here again next year.","Lakeland, FL",15,5.0

The Embassy Suites ranks right up there as one of our favorites. We had a corner unit with two balconies looking straight out to the ocean. The corner units definitely have more space-try to get one if you can. The rooms are very comfortable and clean, also surprisingly quiet. The free breakfast every morning was a treat- we love the fresh omelette station with many varieties of fillings that you get to pick out yourself and put in a bowl - also delicious fruit and mixed green salad. One morning they had a Hawaiian singer serenading us while we ate! The Happy Hour was enjoyable too. Mai-tais were pretty good, also try the Blue Hawaiian. There were different entertainers every night for Happy Hour including awesome hula dancers with ""island music."" The pool area was nice sized and there was a great hot tub we liked usingas well. The Embassy Suites is in a perfect location. We loved being able to walk through all of the great shops along the Beachwalk and enjoyed eating at several of the restaurants adjacent to the hotel-including Roy's, theYardhouse, and the Hono Kai Grill. All of the staff that we encountered at the hotel were friendly and bent over backwards with any request. We truly think that anyone would be happy here!

This property is nice, well appointed, and well presented. There is nothing that would keep me from returning. However, there are some issues that will cause some consternation among the more discerning travelers. Valet: they said their radio was ""stolen"", thus, they had to yell across the cavernous lobby (unsuccessfully, I might add) for the bellman to come to our car and retrieve the luggage. Ultimately, I fetched the bellman myself, rather than endure more of the above. Bell staff: Friendly, polite, but evidently overworked. After the bellman was located, and had loaded our luggage on the cart, he parked it in the lobby and walked away. (I already had our key and room assignment by this time). This came as a shock to me, and I started to pull the cart myself to the elevator (I did not wish to have our belongings unattended in a busy lobby). The bellman realized this and bolted out from behind the bell desk. From there, it worked as advertised. Check-in: I asked a smiling clerk if there was an HHonors check-in window. She said yes, I asked where it was and she said ""yes"" again. It was only after a three-peat of this that I realized that she had not understood a word I had said. It is exceptional that this hotel has made accommodations for its foreign visitors, and hired Japanese speakers. However, this being the United States, I was dismayed to find that the agent did not ALSO speak English. What are the chances that I could go to Japan (or ANY other country in the world) and find a clerk that was only English speaking, and did not speak the native tongue of the country in question? Pool: Very pleasant. Nice rubber bottom keeps slippage to a minimum, and is comfortable on the feet. The kiddy pool is very nice and clean feeling. It would be helpful if there was some staff to keep the (much) older children out of the toddler (1 1/2 ft) pool. Rooms: Outstanding. I only rue that the view will be decimated by the Trump Hotel now under construction. Elevators: Slow, but not unacceptably so for a 21 story edifice. The card readers are somewhat temperamental, and often take multiple swipes to be able to access the guest room floors. Breakfast and happy hour: Typical Embassy Suites fare, presented in a nice outdoor patio seating area. (No ES Atrium here). There are some noteworthy positive points as well: Complimentary internet access, a local paper delivered to your room alongside the USA Today, ample seating in the living area. The CD is also a very nice touch. If this property keeps up the unique amenities once it has established itself among Waikiki's time honored properties, it will continue to shine.

Great spot and centrally located. Nice rooms, though the Aloha tower is nicer than the Hula tower.... closer to the ocean view. The beachwalk is great with some nice new shops and some fun places to eat. The rooms are big and the pool area is quite nice (for those complaining about the size of this pool, this is a huge pool compared to other hnl pools- traditionally they are much, much smaller). The staff was quite nice and all were very helpful. Roy's was a great place for drinks and snacks and of course being across from the Halekulani is a treat. (do not miss the coconut cake!) A few quirks: 1) this is a huge family hotel. You gotta love kids and not be bothered by them running amok. One afternoon there were 40 plus kids in the pool..... (yes, I counted) 2) breakfast is great, but unfortunately there are quite a few vultures (aka guests) there so be ready to fight for the food. People think nothing of taking 25 slices of papaya for themselves.... or taking as much as they can carry away after eating their breakfast. kinda gross. I know its expensive to have a family stay in hnl, but come on now.... it was a bit extreme. I can imagine that ES will have to crack down on this eventually..... 3) There is a ton of construction going on around the hotel, so if you are sensitive to that, beware. It did not bother me, but we spent most of the day away from the hotel.4) The hotel parking staff warned us to beware of the HPD that hang out at the stop sign behind the Trump construction, this is the only way to drive away from the ES. Come to a full and complete stop at that stop sign..... they come out on foot from behind the construction and pull you over if you do not do this, even though the construction makes it very difficult to see.

I had read every review prior to going and felt like I knew what to expect.Arrival: We were greeted in the open air lobby by very friendly staff; thanks Jaymar. We didn't smell any fumes at any time that we were in the lobby area. We were given juice and champagne cocktails to enjoy while we checked in. Our room wasn't ready yet, so they gave us a ""changing room"" on the first floor. The room was beautiful but smaller than the one we resevered, as I found out later.POOL: The pool was large in size and it was nice to have the wading pool attached. We didn't hear any noise from Trump even though construction was going on most days we were there.ROOM: We were on the top floor with a corner suite and it was fantastic. We had the view between the two adjacent hotels but could see the beach and the ocaen. Every morning we got up and went out on the lanai and watched the surfers and just enjoyed the weather; BEAUTIFUL. We were also able to see the fireworks that occur every Friday night at the Hilton; what a treat for our family. The room was plenty big, the beds were very comfortable, and the bath big enough for two people to get ready at the same time. There is an inroom safe as well. BREAKFAST: Every morning there is a buffet but you can't get soda out of the machine. There was always someone there playing some sort of Hawaiian music which created a really relaxing atmosphere. In additon to the usual breakfast foods at Embassy they also offered fresh fruit and rice and linguica. I had read that some people were wondering what the crowds would be like if the hotel was full; the hotel was at 95% and there was never a problem getting a seat at breakfast or in the evening.EVENING RECEPTION: Every night from 5:30 to 7:30; the snacks could improve as they were always the same and after 8 days it got kind of boring. They were chips and salsa, goldfish, some sort of lemon pepper potato chips, and chex mix. The drinks are free but on some nights you could only get one at a time; so if you needed one for your significant other you had to wait in line again. There was always music and a hula dancer except for the night they had a local duet that was having a CD release party which was quite fun for our children.ACTIVITIES: Of note, the two activities desks located within the hotel, one is where you would expect the concierge to be, is a commissioned sales desk. They are trying to sell you any package they can; buyer beware. They sold us a luau at Paradise Cove which was terrrible and I will review under that heading. We did try and make reservations for next year during our stay but were told we had to wait until at least July; not sure why and no one could explain why we had to wait.The Beachwalk area is beautiful and very impressive at night with the torches at street level lit and all aglow. If you want to eat at the Yardhouse get there early or plan to wait a while; it is very busy.SHOPPING: We walked all around inlcuding going to the International Maket Place, Hilo Hattties, and the Ala Moana mall. There is also a street maket every Thursday night (maybe Friday)iwithin walking distance which was fun.The International Market Place is like going to another country. I found it to an experience I don't need to do again. It was quite overwhelming for our children, as well as, if you didn't want to buy what they had for sale they took exception to it. It was a feeling of, if you don't buy it, don't touch it. I did find that most souveniers you could get at the International Market Place, you could get right across the street from Embassy at the ABC store.The Ala Moana mall was quite impressive with all the high end stores you would want. At the mall they have some really good chain restaurants to eat at that weren't any more expensive than they are on the mainland.We took the ""free"" shuttle to Hilo Hatties as most of the magazines with discount coupons in them have a three and four page color ad for this place listing it as the place to shop. If your kids would enoy the Trolley ride then go; if not then don't bother, it was a huge waste of time. They tell you that if you get off at the mall to go shopping that they will take you back into Waikiki; don't believe them. We stood there for 20 mintues waiting for the Trolley only to have it go zipping by us at 40 mph and not even slow down. We wound up paying to take the city bus back. Enjoy!!!!!",flynhigh,28,5.0

First it is highly priced comparable to others in the area and the rooms are small! They are suites if you can call them that ( more like one room cut into half)! The pool area is a joke and you can not see the ocean because of the high rises around you (to include directly in front of you, behind you, beside you, etc). Let me explain why the pool area is a joke! It is a pool that is onlyl three foot deep and at the deepest end which is 3 and half foot is a kiddie pool. So if you want to get away from kids because you do not have any forget about it because in the deepest part connected to the pool is the kiddie pool. The pool is also warm, not just warm as in warm but as in bath water warm. They do have a Pakini bar but thought was not put into this business decision either.

Was sorely dissapointed and will not stay here again! The name is misleading as well as it in not on a beach walk but on a busy street that you must cross and walk a while before you get to the beach. The Service people who checked us in was rude, and they would like for you to sit down while checking in to make it more personal, however, you are herded like cattle to hurry up and move out of the seats quick. No one explains that you must use a key card to get in the elevator to go to your floor. And if you are on the 4th floor and someone from the 24th floor gets their key card in before you do then you miss your floor and you are riding to the 25th floor and back down to pick up passengers as you ride to your floor.

Our room was sparkling clean and the entire decor just brings out a refreshing feeling. If you have seen other hotel rooms at Waikiki, you will appreciate tons for Embassy's nice job on creating this gorgeous rooms. Needless to say the space was just so spacious than I could imagine. My room was on the 8th floor, but surprisingly I got a nice partial ocean view out of my lanai. Super! Pool was clean and free of chemical smell. The Pakini Bar by the pool is filled with friendly employees and good drinks. In the evening you must not forget to visit the manager's reception because they have nice entertainment, free chips/salsa, and most importantly- free alcohol. There are also a lot of nice retail shops and restaurants on property that you must check it out. I visited Malibu Shirts to look for some surf shorts, and they have got some great stuff there with very friendly staff. Mondo Gelato has the meanest ice cream...gotta have some next time when I am there. How can I stay at Embassy Suites without mentioning their breakfast! The buffet was filled with everything you can ask for. I had a plate full of fruit(small amount), Portuguese sausage, omelet, french toast, and ...so much. Of course we stopped before we reach heart burn levels and checked out of the hotel soon after breakfast.

There's always a lot to be said when a hotel is almost brand new so that aspect certainly weighs in heavily. Friendly service upon check-in and very nice bellstaff. We were upgraded to a corner ocean view room. Our room had 2 lanais so we could see the city, pool, and harbor on one side and the ocean on the other. Rooms are spacious and include flat panel TVs, great beds, and attractive furnishings. The one drawback of this hotel, as nearly everyone else mentions, is the Trump Tower going up next door. It is going to take over almost all of the great views from the Embassy Suites. Currently, they're laying the foundation which resulted in a lot of construction noise. This was especially distracting when lounging by the pool as the pool is almost on top of the construction site. The pool area is great though- lots of lounge chairs and the pool itself was larger than most others in the Waikiki area. The manager's reception was great- free cocktails and a terrific Hawaiian band with a hula dancer. Great access to the new Beachwalk area with plenty of great shopping and numerous restaurants. I'd be happy to stay here in the future, but I'm concerned that the views will be non-existent once The Donald gets his development completed next door.",WI,87,4.0

This property was new and nice. A little noisey during business hours on the west side due to the Trump Towers Construction and drilling of the foundation but we didnt spend much time during the day in the room. The service was great and very helpful as to the local hot spots. The pool guy Jason was very good at getting you to the ""good"" beaches and local spots for food and fun. Thanks Jason. He has some good reccomendations for the North Shore in Haleiwa, such as the Grass Skirt Grill (Big plate of fish, rice, and salad for $11.00) Matsumoto Shaved Ice, and all the surf shops were very cool and friendly. The Shark Cove Grill located in a trailer near Sunset Beach was very good despite the looks of the trailer. Good food!!For a rental car check the internet rather than purchase at the hotel. We saved almost $30 a day by checking the internet at the hotel. Parking is $25 a day but you have no choice in Wakiki. The parking guys were great. The Yard House Rest is just below the hotel and great food, fun, and the bar is happening. We were refered to a sushi Rest at the Hyatt in Honolulu named Musashi. (Located inside the the Hyatt building 3rd floor)GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE AND VERY RESPONABLE!! I would go back again if in town. It was not busy on our Friday night dinner...The Ocean Bird Rest is about 100 yards from the E.S. and good nightly music and drinks. Have a seat on the beach and have a drink and watch and listen the waves. NICE way to impress your sig other. Check out the Swap Meet at the stadium on Wed's.

We had a nice oceanview even if it was a couple of blocks away. The room was well laid out except for the bathroom. It is a single sink area which made it difficult for 2 to get ready in the morning.

The free breakfast was better than I expected, not as good as the $25 breakfast buffet at the Hilton but close enough. The business center was useful for printing boarding passes, also free internet access in the rooms. The area is noisy from construction, it will be much noiser when the Trump starts building. The beach was one block away, but it was quite rocky in the closest access point. The scenery of the grounds is lacking or nonexistent. Overall, I would stay here again.

There isn't much of a lobby..it's quite small...you aregreeted by a friendly staff who offer fresh juice while you getchecked in. Valet parking is $25/day...there are no other options.The last night we were there we had to wait almost 20 minutesfor the valet guy to retrieve our car because too many cars werecoming into their driveway at the same time people were tryingto get their cars to leave the hotel. It was a monumental trafficmess of 3 lanes of cars in that lobby area. I'm guessing whenthe hotel is full, it will be a BIG problem.The newer Aloha tower opened..we stayed in the Hula tower.Free internet access is available on the 3rd floor of theAloha tower.We stayed on the 19th floor...with a slight view of the ocean...when you peek out on the lanai. We didn't hearmuch noise from the street level..however, you certainlycan hear people chatting in nearby rooms eitherabove, below, or next door to you.The best rooms were at the end of the floor...rooms 1929 and1930 as they had lanai's that face the ocean.As mentioned in the prior reviews, the room was smallerthan other Embassy Suites rooms that I've stayed in..nocloset...had an armoire.. The rooms were kept clean, andtowels were changed daily...the housekeeping staff werefriendly.I felt the bedroom (2 Q beds) was alittle cramped. Both rooms had flat screen TV's. The living room had a sofa bed..anda table with 4 chairs. Entry into the room you would viewa bar area that had a mini sink, microwave oven, andmini refrigerator.Each room receives a freebie daily newspaper.The free buffet breakfast was basically standard fare ofscrambled eggs, bacon, fresh fruit, sausages, bagels,toast, cereal, cooked to ordered omelette....coffee, juice,milk, etc. At times, we had a singer entertain us..otherwise,it was a wide screen TV.The mgr's reception at 5:30 PM - 7:30 PM.. offered sodas, wine, drinks...nomixed drinks available (ie..no mai tai's, pina coladas..as theydidn't have a blender available). The snacks consistedof chips, salsa, and a Pepperidge Farm snack mix..that's it...nothing excited. I went to one reception..and a great trioof Hawaiian singers were entertaining us. You need toshow your room key to order drinks.The breakfast and mgr's reception was held on the 4thfloor area near the pool. The pool is small with lots ofchaise chairs. I think if you wouldn't appreciate alot of noise...it probably wouldbe a good idea to stay above the 10th floor or higher...Parts of of side lobby area was still under construction..painting...etc. Most of the Beachwalk shops were open...there is anescalor access from the street to the 4th floor of the hotel.You must use your key to use the elevator and to gainentrance to your roomThe hotel was very close to the shopping areas...onKalakua...lots of shopping centers. The Royal HawaiianShopping center is being revamped..and only part of itis open..the end that is closest to Beachwalk...by ourhotel.Beachwalk is a ONE way narrow street coming off ofKalakua.Overall, I think it was nice staying in a new hotel..roomswere slightly smaller than I would have liked, but they wereclean and close to the Waikiki shopping areas andbeaches. Pricewise, it's on par with other major hotelsin the area.Something to think about:.. when this hotel is FULLY booked, howwill they deal with having enough tables/seats for all theguests during breakfast, mgr's reception, and dealing withalot of cars coming in & out of the valet parking area/lobby...noise will be a major concern when Trump starts buildinghis condo/hotel next door.","SJ, CA",6,4.0

Having read the negative reports earlier, I was concerned and called the front desk prior to our arrival. I explained I was concerned about the noise reports.The very nice hotel clerk acknowledged there is a lot of construction in the area and that there had been complaints about the noise. She also acknowledged they had had some problems with the key cards for the elevators. I asked if there was any way we could be assigned a room on an upper lever that had minimal noise. She said she'd see what she could do. To my delight, upon arrival we learned we'd been upgraded and had a beautiful corner room on the 11th floor with a good view of the beach from both rooms, and 3 lanais (2 from living area and 1 from bedroom area). We were able to sit outside on a lanai one evening and watch the firework display along the beach. We had absolutely no problems with excessive noise, although I can understand that guests who are assigned to rooms on the lower floors may have different experiences. Although the Trump Tower will block some of the views and no doubt will create additional noise during construction, currently there is nothing happening in that area... just a big hole in the ground.Check-in was fast and efficient and included being treated to fresh juice while seated at front desk across from hotel staff. Valet parking is expensive ($25 daily) but this is typical for hotels in major cities and destination points. Auto drive-in IS adjacent to the check-in lobby but we detected no gas smell as previously reported by another rev iewer. Concierge/Activities desk is nearby and is staffed until 8 p.m. Personnel there were very helpful in booking tours and providing excellent suggestions and directional information.The full breakfast, including made-to order omelets, was good and included live entertainment. Seating area was nice but very busy. Staff were busily clearing tables for the next guests. Manager's reception located in same area, also with live music and entertainment. Liked the openness of this space... it's on the 4th floor away from hustle and bustle of street activities and is adjacent to the attractive pool area. Some people have commented about the pool being small. Looking down from our 11th floor suite, I could see other hotel pools in the area, none of which were as large as that of the Embassy Suites.Elevators are accessed by one's room key to provide extra security for hotel guests. Occasionally, there were minor problems but nothing of great concern... just insert the room key, pull it out and see if the green light comes on to indicate the key is accepted. If not, insert it again... similar to what sometimes needs to be done to access the door to one's room. Personally, I appreciate the extra security.Housekeeping staff were excellent, efficient and friendly. In fact, ALL staff were incredibly friendly.Suite size was not overly small as someone reported... it's about the same size as most Embassy Suites... although there WAS a lot of furniture in the room. True, there are no built in closets... Embassy Suites uses an armoire instead. The 2 LCD tv's were quite nice. Furnishings were attractive and comfortable... lots of pillows. The daily newspaper was delivered to the room in an attractive cloth bag... not a typical plastic bag. We didn't eat at the new restaurant... Yard House... it was way too noisy to suit us. But a variety of restaurants are within walking distance and just a few blocks away is street lined with upscale shopping. No one had mentioned the Denny's Restaurant that is nearby...it's open 24 hrs. Nice to find an inexpensive eating place in expensive Waikiki. Also, there are several ABC Stores nearby where one can purchase snacks, sandwiches, soda, clothing, drugstore items, gifts... just about anything one might need... actually there are 26 ABC stores in Honolulu so they are very hard to miss.If you sign up for a tour for which hotel pickup is provided, you will need to walk about 1/2 block to the Sheraton Hotel shuttle lobby. This is a centralized pickup point for all hotels in the area; I wish more cities had centralized pickup points so as to minimize the amount of time one spends on the bus going from hotel to hotel before beginning the actual tour.My recommendation is to call the hotel and ask for an upper level room... they will probably accommodate if possible.Sometimes just going into a situation knowing the potential problems aids one in dealing with them.We would definitely return to this hotel.","San Antonio, TX",262,5.0

Beachwalk February 18 - 23. I was anticipating a lot of construction in the area - it turned out to be very little. The Trump Tower is just a hole in the ground with nothing happening. There was some street work going on, nothing inconvenient, but loud at times. I was in the Aloha Tower on the 15th floor facing east. When out on my lanai, I could see the ocean in the distance and the Beach Walk development below. About 1/3 of the stores were open and the Yardhouse restaurant had just opened. I ate there one night - wouldn't go back - the food was good but the bar area was so loud. Probably a good place for people in their 20's and 30's who want to party. I'm 55, don't drink, and like to be able to hold a conversation without yelling.Back to the hotel: the a.m. breakfast was one of the nicest I've had at E.S. There was entertainment every morning in the eating area. The 'happy 2 hours' in the late afternoon always had some pleasant local entertainment and the drinks were fine. The chips and salsa snacks were sadly lacking.The suite had a nice bathroom and housekeeping left me extra goodies daily. I also tipped them $3/day. I had a lanai off the living room and another off the bedroom. Everything was very clean. I might have been the 1st to stay in the room.The walk to the beach was brief - a short 1 1/2 blocks away. I didn't us the pool (small) much, but the pool area was lovely with lounges, tables and chairs. Always enough for everyone.The staff bent over backwards to be helpful and everyone I passed always smiled and said hello. I'd stay there again knowing the shops in the area will be open by the time I return.

This was our fourth trip to Honolulu. The previous three times my family and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency. After much long debate of trying to choose a different hotel to stay at during our 2-night visit to Honolulu, we chose the Embassy Suites due to the fact that this hotel was brand new, an all-suite hotel that included a free breakfast and manager’s reception. We took the Roberts airport shuttle to the hotel, which was unable to let us off at the Embassy Suites because of the construction. Therefore, we were dropped off at the Outrigger Reef on the Beach, which is across the street from the Embassy Suites. However, it was difficult to walk to the hotel with all of our luggage in a construction zone. The lobby is drive through. However, when getting dropped off by a shuttle bus it is somewhat inconvenient. When checking in we were given a cup of orange-pineapple juice, which was a very nice touch. There are two towers, but only one is open as the second is still undergoing construction. I felt that this hotel was a somewhat further away than across the street from the beach. There are a quite a few hotels in front of the Embassy Suites blocking the view of the beach. The second tower that is not open yet seems as it is even farther away. The room was very much standard of most Embassy Suites, consisting of a kitchen sink and microwave, living area with pull-out sofa and a LCD television, and a bedroom with a second LCD television. The suite we stayed in was on the end of the hotel. Therefore, we had a larger lanai, one in the living room and a second one in the bedroom. The breakfast was excellent. There were a numerous choices that included hot and cold items. The manager’s reception included a band that played Hawaiian music with dancers. The only negative about the free drinks and snacks was when getting drinks from the bar the glasses had water stains on them and my mom found pieces of hair in her potato chips.There was a business center with three computers and a fitness center that are located within the second tower that is not open yet. There is a wading pool within the swimming pool, which was standard size. I did enjoy the hot tub as it was rather large.The friendliness of the staff was mediocre. I did think that everybody at the pool and maids were very nice. However, I did believe that the front desk workers and managers were completely unhelpful. Returning home our flight did not leave until 10:15p.m. Therefore, I inquired about the latest we could check out. I was told the absolutely latest my family and I could check-out was 1:00p.m., which is 2-hours after check-out time because they needed the room as the hotel was completely full. The hotel offered us a courtesy room to clean-up in before heading to the airport. However, the condition was that we only had 10-minutes per person to use the room because other guests would need to also use the room, which is not much time for 3-people. I was very disappointed by this and asked to speak to a manager, who was completely rude and unhelpful. Thus, the only other option was to keep the room until at the latest 9:00p.m. for half of the room rate, this ended up being $139.00 extra. When I checked-out I asked the customer service agent how full the hotel was and she said they had plenty of rooms, without letting her know I was told earlier that the hotel was full. I questioned to her as to why I was told the hotel was full and that is when she claimed the hotel was actually full. Therefore, my family and I will again be visiting Honolulu in August of 2007 and have already decided that we will NOT be staying at the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk, but rather the Hyatt.",Minnesota/Wisconsin,91,3.0

The suite was located in the Hula Tower (Aloha Tower not scheduled to open until later in Feb. according to the Front Desk staff). The suite’s master bedroom with king bed was roomy as was the bathroom. The living room was on the smaller side compared to other Embassy Suites properties we’ve stayed in. The table could only fit 3 chairs around it as the space for the 4th chair was taken up by a pillar. Therefore only 3 people could sit at the table at one time. No big deal if you don’t plan to eat in your room (there is no room service) or if your kids don’t mind eating at the coffee table.Our 9th floor suite faced east (towards Diamond Head) and had a view of the hotel property across Lewers Street. Yes, it was a bit noisy in the early morning hours (from 5:30 a.m.) due to garbage trucks, tour buses, motorcycles, etc. The sheer density of Waikiki means that sound travels upwards. Noise will be a potential problem no matter where you stay in Waikiki. The other side of the Hula Tower faces towards Fort de Russy with the Trump Tower being built next door. Not much was going on with the Trump Tower construction while we were there – still just a huge, cavernous pit. However, there is currently construction on the streets around the Embassy Suites – on our last morning the loud jackhammer noise from street level below the Grand Lanai (on 4th floor) made breakfast less than enjoyable. I don’t know how long it continued but anyone in the pool area would have been bothered by the noise (unless you are partial to the incessant sound of jackhammers!). The suite was clean and well-kept as one would expect from a new property. The second bedroom had 2 queen beds in it (as we had requested) and also had its own microwave, safe, coffee maker and minibar-size fridge. Strangely, it was connected to the living room by adjoining doors as one would find in connecting hotel rooms rather than in one two-bedroom suite. It also had its own door to the hallway and a separate room number. All suites appear to have a lanai (balcony) with chairs and very small table. If your room is in the Hula Tower on the 4th floor facing west (towards Fort de Russy) then you will have tall cement planters outside your lanai to separate you from the pool area.As others have commented, there are no closets in the suite. The armoire and dresser drawers in each bedroom plus the drawers in the living room were sufficient for us (3 adults, 2 children).Cafeteria-style breakfast is comprehensive and is served 6:30 – 10:00 a.m.. The food service area is very clean and there are always bus persons around clearing trays and dishes. There were high chairs although we ended up bringing our own Wet Wipes to breakfast to wipe down the high chair and sometimes the table. About ¾ of the seating area is covered. On busier days people had to sit at tables that weren’t under cover – which could be a problem if it rains in the morning. Keeping in mind that only 1 of the 2 towers is open, I think there is potential for overcrowding and long line-ups/waits for food when the Aloha Tower opens. At times the kitchen could not keep up with the demand for food and people had to wait around for more food to be brought out. The breakfast is very good and was one of the most significant factors in deciding to stay there. However I do wonder how they will manage when the hotel is fully operational and booked to capacity. I don’t think there is enough seating to accommodate that many people. The pool area currently (February) does not get sun until around 11:30 a.m. There is a bar but no food available for purchase whatsoever. The pool is 4 ft. deep at the deepest part and one small area has been built up to be 18 inches deep and is extra warm for very small children. This worked well for our kids (1 & 4 years old). There is the equivalent of a giant hot tub attached to the pool – the controls are back on the rock wall which most people seemed to miss.The managers’ reception from 5:30 – 7:30 p.m. is a terrific concept that just needs a little work. The drinks flow freely and there is pop and coffee as well. However, the “snacks” consist of potato chips, tortilla chips and salsa. That’s it. At the Embassy Suites in La Jolla where we stayed in Oct. 2006, they also served pretzels. There is live music during the receptions – some days it was too loud and served as a deterrent to staying longer. We sometimes brought our own snacks to eat (i.e., macadamia nuts, Maui onion chips) and once even did a Quizno’s take-out (on Kalakaua & Lewers) and made dinner out of the reception.Construction is fast and furious along Beach Walk Street and when done will look very nice. Most of the shops & restaurants inside the Embassy Suites complex are not yet open (e.g., Ruth Chris Steakhouse and Roy’s Restaurant). About 75% of the street level shops along Beach Walk are open. You can buy coffee, snacks, gelato, sandwiches and salads, as well as t-shirts, jewelry, swimwear, etc.We would stay at Embassy Suites again only after first considering other locations that are more central. It is about a 15 minute walk to the central Waikiki beach area (Hyatt/Marriott hotels) where the sand is nicer and the beach area is wider. There is also a lagoon area across the street from the Marriott Hotel which is perfect for very young children as it isn’t more than 3 feet deep and has no waves. The Embassy Suites isn’t exactly “steps to the beach” as the Hyatt or Marriott hotels are. Yes, you have to cross the street but then you have to walk in between the neighbouring hotel properties that are beachfront. The beach area there is very small/narrow. You can walk along the beach a little ways towards Diamond Head past the Sheraton where the beach area is wider – but the trek is too difficult to manoeuvre with a stroller.Since there are almost no hotels that offer 2 bedroom suites, if you want to keep your family together then the Embassy Suites is currently probably your only choice. Otherwise you’re looking at booking two separate rooms elsewhere at the equivalent or probably higher price. We had also looked for a two-bedroom condo but there weren’t any available. Most have to be booked well in advance of your travel dates and/or rent out only on a monthly basis. The Embassy Suites was pricey compared to their other locations in California, but overall, Waikiki is an expensive place to visit anyways.",Vancouver,25,4.0

Only one tower (Hula tower) was open; shops and restaurants in the complex were still in progress. Compared to other Embassy Suites (Maui, San Diego, etc) this one was less appealing. The best part about it was the fact that everything is brand new. The worst part about it was the size; the rooms are scaled way down. The living room and bedroom were crowded with furniture and there are no closets (only an armoir with hangers/shelves inside). Families with children will undoubtedly feel the need for more space, as the ""suites"" are barely larger than a big hotel room. Parking is expensive ($25 per day). There seems to only be one attendant on duty, and we had to wait for him to show up so we could get our car. The elevators require a room key to get to any floor, and the keys don't always function properly. We encountered other guests in the elevator having problems.The pool area is small, but pleasant. The breakfast is fairly standard for Embassy Suites; the cocktail reception could use some more creative snacks than chips and salsa.Service was OK--check in was slow, maid service was spotty (coffee maker not cleaned, coffee supplies not replaced, burnt out light bulbs not replaced). Restaurant personnel were polite, but not terribly enthusiastic. There is the feeling that there aren't quite enough staff to accommodate a hotel full of guests.The new Trump tower being built across the street will obliterate much of the view towards Fort DeReussy Park, and the construction of this building starts quite early in the morning. We were on the 18th floor--nearly at the top--and the garbage trucks beeping and construction-related noises awakened us each morning around 5:30am.The ""ocean view"" is actually seen between buildings. When the construction in this Beachwalk area is complete, it will be a nice enough place to stay; the beach closest to the hotel has lots of sand and food and rentals--but overall, the location of this property is a bit too far removed from the center of Waikiki for my taste. I would probably not choose to stay here again.",California,163,3.0

Before I booked a night I decided to drive there and check out the hotel before hand. There is only valet parking here. Trump Tower is just being built right next door so the construction and noise in the area is intense. I checked with the concerige to ask about the hotel but when I told him I was not a guest but a local and wanted to check out the hotel he simple handed me a brochure and walked away acting like he was busy. To check in, you use valet parking and go to the desk, all in one section with a few comfy chairs to sit on. Smells like car gas and new carpet. The pool area is very small with a large amount of chairs by the pool to sunbath. So many chairs to sit that its difficult getting to the pool. After todays viewing I have decided not to stay here and stick with the Hilton Waikiki where Im a regular with its vast grounds.","Aurora, Colorado",54,3.0

We had a 2 bedroom suite on the 20th floor. The room actually was comprised of a 1 bedroom suite and a second adjoining bedroom. Frankly, the space was very small. There were no closets at all. I cannot see how the adjoining bedroom could ever be called a suite; it was really nothing more than a smallish standard hotel room.The rooms had balconys which were nice, unless, of course, you have vertigo. They are rather narrow and if heights bother you, stay on a lower floor.Check in is odd since you drive right into the lobby. All parking is valet, so bring some small bills for tips. The reception allows you to sit at a desk which is an attempt to copy truly upscale hotels. It doesn't really succeed since the check-in process was still a bit cumbersome.There are two towers to this massive hotel and I believe that only one was open when we were there (they only opened in mid-December 2006) If both towers were full, I anticipate that the facilities will be strained to the breaking point. While the breakfast area is nice, it was slow even with less than a full house. The pool also seems small for such a large number of guests.The cocktail reception was nice and there was a band. The only problem was that the snacks were served on regular china dishes and if you sat too close to the pool, security or the wait staff shooed you away since no breakables are allowed in the pool area. This is really dumb planning - if the reception is near the pool, get unbreakable plates, for goodness sakes! The glasses were all plastic, so somebody had at least half a thought about breakage.The staff certainly was nice and friendly, although I expect that the ""shake down"" period continues. Our room keys did not all work when we checked in. The elevators require the use of your room key, but that fact is not clearly communicated so the first trip or two is an adventure. Additionally, the card reader is very sensitive and requires multiple attempts before the green lght appears allowing you to select your floor. Several riders missed their floors when I was there.The ongoing construction in the immediate area is an issue and will only get worse as the Trump building goes up. It will also significantly reduce the ocean views.We originally had booked two standard rooms at the Sheraton and canceled them since this 2 bedroom suite was about the same price - I'm sorry that we did.",Florida,178,3.0

It is located in an urban setting with no grounds to speak of. Also, although there are views of the ocean from the higher floors, it is not directly on the beach, but across the street. The section of beach closest to the hotel is a little rocky at the shore.One of the biggest drawbacks is the fact that there is major construction going on around the hotel. We were on the 16th floor and still heard a lot of street noise which started early in the morning with the beeping of garbage trucks backing up. Construction has just begun on a new Trump tower which is directly across the street. The restaurants and most of the shops that will be part of the hotel complex are still under construction. Actually there seems to be quite a bit of construction throughout the Waikiki area so it may be hard to avoid. There are some street closures in the area, but that didn’t seem to cause too many problems. Valet parking in the hotel is $25 per night.When we first arrived on Oahu we happened to get a taxi driver who had no knowledge of the hotel which had opened only days before. When we gave him the address he claimed that there was an empty lot there where a building had recently been demolished. He might have been thinking of the area on the opposite side of the street. In fact, we stopped just past the hotel without knowing it and were about to call for directions when we spotted it. The lobby is open and cars can drive through. The room we had was a one-bedroom suite consisting of a living area and separate bedroom. Since the hotel is new, everything is clean and fresh from the carpet to the sheets and towels. There are no closets anywhere in the suite which made it look cluttered with no place to stash shoes and coats (as you can see from my photos.) Overall the two areas are long and narrow. Rooms are available with either two queens or one king bed. The bedroom was good sized with a hutch that held a tv and a few drawers. The living area was about the same size including a queen-size fold-out couch which was very comfortable for a sofa bed and another tv. There is also a kitchen area with a small refrigerator, microwave and sink but no utensils are provided. There were two narrow terraces, both with beautiful ocean views. The pool is located on the 4th floor. It was very narrow with a kiddie pool connected (sharing the same water.) It was also shallow with a maximum depth of 5 feet. We noticed one of the restrooms near the pool area remained very dirty for over 24 hours. Also located on the 4th floor is a self-service breakfast with made-to-order omelets, a juice and coffee bar, fresh fruit, cereal, toast, French toast, bacon and sausage. Wait staff were very attentive in refilling coffee and clearing dishes. This is offered every morning from 6:30-10 am. Every evening from 5:30-7:30 pm is the managers cocktail party with an open bar and light snacks. Live entertainment was usually provided.Service is definitely a strong point. Everyone was very friendly and eager to help which was the case throughout the two islands we visited; Oahu and Maui. There was a mixup when we checked in at Embassy Suites regarding the ocean view room we had reserved but the person at the desk was able to resolve it after a few minutes. When we first went to the room we had trouble getting the door open. Within minutes three workers were there to fix it. We were always able to get in but throughout the three days the door lock remained tricky. We asked the housekeeper for an extra pillow and that was delivered within 10 minutes. The staff had mentioned a turndown service to get the sofa bed ready for the evening which never happened. It was easier for us to do it ourselves so we never bothered to call them about it. Since the hotel is new, they are offering discounts off what will be the regular prices. They have even better deals for residents of Hawaii to encourage them to stay at the hotel and spread the word.",Chicago area,55,4.0

For the money, I would now go somewhere else. While our stay wasn't horrible, it wasn't worthy of the cost. I guess my feelings are that if you are going to pay $300+ per night you deserve quality - not ho hum. The suites are spacious, but how much time are you going to spend in your room? The beach is good but better on the south end of the island. The food was fair (for buffet) but didn't like having to bus my own table to have a place to sit. For an oceanside resort with a casual atmosphere, they are a little too strict on the shirt & shoes requirement for their ""cocktail hour"". (A swimsuit top does not count as a shirt.) Bottom line - they don't pay attention to details. You can spend less and get the same quality elsewhere.","Rochester, NY",10,2.0
