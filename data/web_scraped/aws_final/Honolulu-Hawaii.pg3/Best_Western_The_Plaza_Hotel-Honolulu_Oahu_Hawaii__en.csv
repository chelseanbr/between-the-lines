I'm so impressed, though I'd stay here again even if I was spending a few days in Honolulu. The staff are fantastic--friendly and very helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable--nothing fancy, but the price is 1/2 that of a Waikiki hotel. If you just use a hotel to sleep, this will do the trick! Best of all for the budget-minded, The Bus stops right outside the hotel and $5.50 gets you an all-day pass. It's about an hour to central Waikiki, and even shorter the other way to Pearl Harbor. On the downside, not a lot of restaurants nearby you can walk to at night. I didn't expect a lot out of this hotel, but was very pleasantly surprised.","Phoenix, Arizona",23,4.0

It's away from Waikiki traffic and close to the airport. Yes, its close to the freeway so you can hear traffic. What we do to counter the noise is carry our noise makers (got them from amazon for under $50 and they fit in your luggage or backpack). I recommend reserving a bigger room if traveling with several pieces of luggage (we lave lots of luggage because we are usually there on business). If you travel light, the smaller room may suffice. Parking garage is like all other garages, tight. It costs $30/night but cost us $15/night because we are Gold Crown Members. Breakfast is included, usually count on scrambled eggs, oatmeal, rice, mini pancakes, fruit, etc. They alternate between Portuguese sausage and sausage links, with bacon once a week. Also, if you go early, you can usually get right in. If you go with tourists, you may have to wait for a table. But its not usually a long wait. The bed slept good. TV can suck because the signal breaks up on some channels (but most people don't even use the TV while there). Housekeeping is extremely polite and friendly and cater to whatever you may need. Mercy took care of us most of the time (we were in room #805) and she is the BEST!!! The only down fall to our last visit was on our last day. We waited thru 6 elevators before we could get on along with a cart full of luggage. Evidently, as it gets closer to the New Year, it gets more and more crowded. But its all good - we got out without too much delay. We will definitely be staying here again.","Lewisburg, Tennessee",55,5.0

The housekeeping staff turned it in promptly. Originally I had planned to pick it up 3 weeks later when I returned to Honolulu, and they agreed to keep it safe until my return. Because of coronavirus, my plans changed, and I did not stop over in Honolulu. I called the housekeeping manager to explain the change in plans, and she worked with me to send it back safely to me at my home in California. Everyone was very friendly and professional. I'm sure you can imagine how differently this could have turned out. I'm very grateful to the hotel staff and would definitely stay here again.",,0,5.0

While it is still a Best Western, the room looks refreshing and I love the bed. There are both a mini fridge and microwave inside the room. The WIFI (free for Best Western members) also works very well. However, the window remains extremely dirty and they need replacement. I also want to remark on the shuttle service, which was quite good. I was picked up quickly from the airport (although the airport should have better signs), and on my return, they have a shuttle to the airport every thirty minutes twenty four hours a day.

Staying at the Plaza Hotel enabled me to turn in my rental car the evening before my flight, catch a shuttle back to the hotel, get a good nights sleep, and then good breakfast, before catching another shuttle to the airport for my flight.

Although it’s close to the airport, we never really heard airplanes. Ask for a room as far away from the freeway as possible. It is a very busy road.

We thought with a free breakfast and shuttle to the airport this hotel would be a good choice. But unfortunately there were several problems. First, there was no place to park the minivan while we unloaded passengers and luggage, there was only one slot for a compact car. Once inside there was confusion at the desk about the booking being prepaid through a third party service. After that was cleared up, I was given a room key and went to the room. When I unlocked and opened the door, there was a man lying there on the bed. He gave me a surprised look and I apologized and quickly closed the door. The front desk clerk apologized and gave me a different room, but there was no mention of discounting the room or any other accommodation by way of apology.

Flights arrive on this island continuously with capability to deliver needed repair parts . In this instance the part is apparently being brought over from the mainland on a canoe . The staff makes it sound like the customer is being done a favor by being assigned a room in the courtyard area , be prepared to encounter full blast freeway noise . The room was expensive and had we known how this experience would turn out , there are multitudes of infinitely better places we would have booked .

Trying to get down to the lobby in the morning especially is terrible, you will literally wait for 20 minutes or more as the elevator not only is trying to pick up people leaving/checking out but also the cleaning teams are trying to get from floor to floor. Sometimes when the elevator finally gets to your floor it is to full to even get on, so you wait again unless you want an aerobic workout doing the stairs. Our room had roaches to greet us upon entering. Parking can be a bit tight if you return to late as there are not enough parking spaces. There is a fairly decent free breakfast each morning and if you join the Best Western club you can get half price on your parking. I would not recommend this location if you want the resort feel as it is located under a freeway under path. 10-15 minutes ride to Waikiki.

I greeted her with a smile and hello and she just looked at me as if I was bothering her and asked another girl who was friendly to help me validate my parking ticket, which btw I had to keep validating daily.

We were extremely disappointed with this past trip. First issue, as a rewards member and frequent guest at this hotel, one would assume a higher level of customer service towards returned and loyal guests. Staff at the front desk lack personable skills and do not fit in the hospitality business. It always seemed as if we were a bother to them from their socializing among other staff at the front. Secondly, each reservation were made with specific request for a king size bed and have failed to accommodate this simple request not once, not twice but at EVERY visit. Lastly, the accommodations in the room was below standards. This past visit was tragic as we were without hot water. We were annoyed to come back after a long day to a cold shower. In addition, the TV service on local stations kept freezing the screen or would constantly lose cable signal and disconnect. Needless to say, we are so disappointed with the lack of Aloha Spirit from this hotel and hope they improve their services in all aspects.",,0,1.0

While my family was there we decided to stay a few days at the Best Western Plaza due to location and convenience and of course a good price. I have to say that I do not normally take the time to write reviews eventhough I would like to I just never get around to it. But this is one I wanted to sit down and give a great review. Ok first off right when I got off the plane I found it very easy to take a shuttle to the Hotel. The shuttle service was wonderful picked me up and took us right to the Hotel. The customer service was excellent, every employee was so helpful and friendly. The rooms were so clean and nice. Really it had everything you would expect to have in a hotel room. I was very pleased and felt quite comfortable. The maid was very accommodating and very nice and would clean the room perfectly each day. I will recommend to stay in the highrise part of the hotel and not in the rooms on the outside perimeter. This is just my opinion of course. I did read reviews that said the Hotel noise level is very loud due to the surrounding airport and freeway traffic but I did not find it loud at all. We had a lovely sized room it was big and spacious with 2 beds and nice size closet and bathroom. My favorite part I know it's silly but was there complementary shampoos and conditioners. They smelled so good, very tropical and fruity. I usually bring or buy my own and am quite choosy in what I put in my hair but I loved and looked forward to using these every night. It conditioned my very tangled beached tossed hair which I was at first pretty sceptical. I even took some extra samples with me to our next hotel. Ok so here is the best part of the hotel (even though all the things I mentioned are still great), was the complimentary breakfast. Wow, what a breakfast buffet, each morning was a treat, they have so much food and an amazing variety to offer guest. My family's favorite was the individually fresh made waffles and fresh yogurt parfaits. We had an amazing waiter/ buffet server who greeted us with a friendly aloha every morning and made us yummy parfaits. So if looking for a place to stay keep this one on your list. It was so convenient for parking and right in the middle of Honolulu, close to freeway access and airport. Excellent stay than you Best Western Plaza",,0,5.0

We called the courtesy van upon collecting our bags and it arrived after about 15 minutes and took us to the hotel which was nice and close. Check in was quick and easy so were in our room within minutes. We were on the second floor facing the highway but there isn't an elevator for this part of the hotel so we had to haul a couple of very heavy suitcases up the stairs. The room was comfortable and functional, but the noise from the highway was pretty loud. I wouldn't normally be pleased about a loud airconditioner, but the noise from the A/C helped to drown out the noise from the highway. I did wake through the night a few times due to traffic noise. Aside from the noise and lack of stairs, it was a perfectly OK hotel for a fair price. The complimentary buffet breakfast in the morning was great, had all the basics and they were all done well. There is a gift shop/convenience store within the hotel which was handy for picking up some last minute souvenirs. The courtesy van runs every 30 minutes (on the hour and half hour) back to the airport so that made it easy to plan our check out time.

It's very convenient to the airport and the shuttle service was prompt to pick us up. It is also convenient to the Honolulu bus system that got us to Pearl Harbor in no time. The rooms are appropriate for a 3-star. We did not have any issues with interstate traffic noise (our room did not face the interstate) and the breakfast was great. However, the best thing happened when we were leaving....As a complimentary service, the hotel will hold your bags after you check out. We checked-out and visited Pearl Harbor. When we got back to the hotel, we get our bags and started to load into the airport shuttle. That's when my 9 year-old girl realizes she left her travel pillow on her hotel bed...We're tired after the day at Pearl Harbor, the long flight to Hawaii, and the new time zone. This is the straw that breaks the camel's back and my daughter starts crying over a travel pillow :(We ask if was returned to lost and found, but the housekeeping staff had already left for the day. I believe every manager in the hotel then mobilized to find that pillow. Some went to our room to look for it. Others were looking for the key to unlock the housekeeping room where lost/found items are kept. They were frantically trying to locate this travel pillow. By now, we had already held the shuttle up for 15 minutes. I told my daughter we're going to have to leave, but I'm sure they will find it and we can have them ship it to our house. She had tears coming to her eyes, but shook her head okay. Due to the roads at this location, the shuttle turns right and then makes a u-turn to get to the airport. After the u-turn, we're driving by the hotel when I see a manager holding the pillow up in the air and running after the shuttle in his dress shoes and tie. The driver gets on the radio with the manager who says he's getting in his car and will meet us at the airport terminal to deliver us the pillow. The driver unloads our bags but he won't leave. He tells us he's staying here so the manager will see the shuttle and know where we are.Five minutes later, the hotel manager pulls his car over and comes running over with the travel pillow. I try my best to give him a great tip in the middle of the airport drop-off, but he would not take it. He runs back to his car and shouts for me to give it to the driver. Just imagine if every hotel had that kind of dedication to customer service.","Huntsville, Alabama",2,5.0

Any guest would expect the worst when entering the room, but once in the room, we are pleasantly surprised because the rooms are clean, spacious, well renovated and the bedding is of good quality.

It is clearly an older property (probably 50+ years old) and while many finishes have been refreshed, the ambiance remains that of a mid-range 3-star hotel. Check-in was professional and efficient. Although we had reserved a standard king bed room, we were upgraded to a “deluxe” king room (a larger room at the corner of the building). Our room preferences had been noted and honored. That deluxe room was very spacious; the decor was comfortable rather than luxurious. There was a refrigerator, microwave, a small side chair and a desk with an adjustable chair, but no in-room safe. The bed was comfy with a thick, soft mattress pad. Lighting was abundant, as were electrical outlets. Highway noise from the Nimitz Freeway penetrated the single pane windows, however, even though our room was on a back corner of the building relatively far away from the freeway. For us, it was more of a background gray noise rather than an annoyance. The hotel is oriented perpendicular to the freeway so there are few rooms truly on the back of the building facing the airport (rooms 1217-1219 on our floor) but those rooms are directly across from the ice and vending machines (not enclosed in a separate room or alcove) which I’d consider to be a much greater noise problem than the freeway.The breakfast buffet was very good, including oatmeal and four cold cereals, scrambled eggs, pancakes and make-your-own waffles. The breakfast meat was unlabeled and were peculiarly dark cubes, possibly Spam. Seating was abundant. Fresh fruits included apples, oranges and melon but no bananas.A number of local and chain restaurants are within walking distance but nothing suggestive if fine dining. The surrounding neighborhood included a car dealer and light industrial buildings but felt safe for walking in the evening,The fitness center was relatively large with a variety of equipment. There is an outdoor pool, surrounded by additional low rise rooms (many of which could have problematic highway noise). The airport shuttle was efficient, but not quite free. I really dislike signage suggesting recommended tips, but there is one posted in the bus, suggesting a per-item tip. Bring lots of dollar bills, but don’t expect those tips to actually translate into meaningful assistance with handling your luggage.All in all: a good but not great hotel. The basics are solid (sleep quality, room features), and the included breakfast buffet is a big plus. It is a good choice for a short stay between flights.","Kihei, Hawaii",135,3.0

The location is great, about a half-mile from the terminal. It is easy enough to walk if you know where you’re going, but there is also a free shuttle that runs approximately every 30min. The room was fairly spacious, clean and comfortable, with cable TV and good free Wifi internet. The main criticism was that there was a lot of road noise, as it is situated very close to the elevated Nimitz Highway and there is no double glazing to block the sound. We kept checking the windows to make sure they weren’t open as there was so much noise entering the room. We woke up to road noise quite a few times during the night. The hotel has a small and poorly equipped fitness room which we didn’t even bother trying to use, instead opting for an in-room cardio circuit session before our flight. There are a number of decent restaurants about a block away, including an IHOP, Dunkin Donuts, Big Kahuna’s Pizza, and Ninja Sushi.

We had to leave too early in the morning to take advantage of getting their free breakfast, but having just arrived in the late afternoon from the East Coast, we were up at 4:00 a.m. anyway, so we chose to walk to the next-door McDonald’s to eat.

They have a pool, small but surprisingly pretty with bushes/trees all around instead of a tacky fence. The restaurant is open for breakfast early but is not open for dinner every night which was not advertised on their website. We got into the hotel at 7pm starving and found that out. They did have a pleasant Shuttle driver that took us over to their 'sister' hotel 5 min away. That meal wasn't very good at all with terrible service.

Overall, it was a decent place to stay. The driver of the shuttle van was quick to pick us up and very friendly. The front desk staff is very knowledgeable, and helped with correcting my reservation. (I booked using the government rate and not the TLA rate). And our housekeeping lady, Mercy, was super friendly and thorough. The wait staff at the restaurant were always cheerful and helpful.Here's our stream of conscience:- The king size bed was dangerously comfortable. More than one day disappeared because of a surprise nap. - Our TV was upgraded from a 36in to a 55in, which was super nice. - The refrigerator and microwave were standard sizes for a hotel. - The bathroom had one vanity and bathtub that was just a little too shallow for a nice relaxing bath. - The pool area was rarely crowded and had a decent size. Chairs and Tables and clean water. But quite a few ants...- Complementary WiFi allowed for four devices. Which for two technologically immersed people is about half as many as we needed.- The location was fairly convenient. Hickam is about an hour walk or 8 min drive, and the Pearl Harbor NEX was about the same.- The floor would get wet whenever it rained, which I found really weird. - Parking was free for guests, and the garage is floors two through five, with six through twelve for the rooms.- There were two elevators, and no choice to use the stairs. There was no service elevator, and the two elevators they did have were slow. Especially at rush hour.- There are four washing machines and four dryers on the first floor, but they are $3.25 per load, each. - There was a free gym on the twelfth floor. It's not real big, but there are some free weights and one bench, two treadmills, and some other things.- On Tues, Wed, and Thurs, the restaurant is closed, and guests are directed to Airport Honolulu Hotel's restaurant, which is honestly better. It's just a 10min walk...- The number of homeless people right outside the hotel is a little concerning.","Honolulu, Hawaii",1,4.0

Parking prices are just like those in Waikiki, but this hotel is not near Waikiki. They used to have an outside company that provided a shuttle service to the NEX, and that was great because while I was at work, my wife could take in some shopping. Maybe the management should do something like that. If you are looking for a hotel with a friendly staff, and away from Waikiki traffic, this is a moderate hotel with normal Waikiki prices.

Unfortunately I had to wait at least 20 minutes for the shuttle even though I used the special phone in the baggage area and was told it would only be five minutes. I had to go back and make another call and was told the shuttle driver was busy dropping people off and was on his way. Going back to the airport was quick and easy since they don’t have other hotels they need to stop at. Most of the people I saw walking around the hotel were wearing military uniforms since it is near Pearl Harbor rather than close to other tourist sites. It is a very standard older hotel but my room was spacious and the bathroom was clean with a hot shower. The beds were comfortable and the air-conditioning worked great! I was wiped out from an overnight flight and was so grateful they had a clean room for me just after 10 am when the housekeeping staff showed up. Even though the black-out curtains were difficult to arrange and I had to use clothespins to keep them shut, I managed a nap. The planes weren’t too bothersome and there wasn’t a huge amount of street noise despite the nearness of the freeways. The location is very industrial so I can’t say much for the view. My other complaint is the lack of free breakfast and the very limited restaurant hours. The fact that they didn’t even serve dinner the night I was there was a problem for me because there are only a handful of small restaurants close by. My experience with the staff was positive—someone even brought me an extra blanket right away when I called the front desk late at night!

When I checked in the military liaison seemed surprised and confused at the rate he gave me. After explaining myself again he decided to change my rate to exclude pet/parking/taxes costing 16% more. Not having another place for my family to stay I felt trapped and forced to accept the new terms. Upon checking in I learned, the hotel allows a local homeless man with an apparent mental health instability to wander the lobby, courtyard, and mini mart to make purchases.

We had an amazing experience, our room was fantastic and spacious. When moving again we decided to stay at the same hotel, difference being we had a pet now. The pet rooms are incredibly tiny, as a family of 4 our space was limited to say the least. The ""pet friendly"" rooms are also right next to H1 and the noise kept our cat extremely nervous and jumpy. We were given ear plugs at check in to combat the noise for ourselves. While we made this doable for the week we needed to stay, our biggest issue arose when our bathroom ceiling (which already had obvious patchwork) began pouring water from the ceiling. Water from holes now formed, from our ventilation fan, and from the heating light inside the shower. It was coming from our upstairs neighbor, and when notified maintenenaces solution was to have them turn their tub off. We were told to go about business as nornak and not given an option to move rooms, despite being an obvious electrical and health/air quality issue due to mold. If you are given a typical room in the tower, yes I would recommend this property as a conveniently located hotel, near the airport and BED among other locations.If you are looking for a pet friendly option, I would not put money towards a room here as it was fairly miserable at best.

My first impression was that hotel appeared to be much better than negative reviews. Very clean grounds and lobby, very pleasant and (I thought) helpful front desk staff. I asked for a quiet room and was given one away from the freeway side. Room was very clean, comfortable bed and quiet.During check-in I stressed to the receptionist that I MUST HAVE a 6:00 am wake-up call to meet my plane. My travel clock had broken and I have no faith in my ability to set hotel radio/alarm clocks. He repeatedly reassured me that I would receive the call and even showed me that he was writing down my request.Needless to say, no wake-up call. I woke at 6:30, grabbed my luggage and flew downstairs only to be told that the next hotel shuttle to the airport would not leave for another 30 minutes. I told the driver that I did not get my promised wake-up call, I'd already loaded my luggage BY MYSELF into the shuttle and I needed to be taken to the airport now! I guess the driver noticed the smoke coming out of my ears, took pity on me and drove me to the airport.After clearing Agriculture Inspection (long lines), United bag check (long lines), TSA (long lines) and then running through the airport I made it onto the plane as the last to board. The main reason for staying at this hotel is its proximity to the airport, its 24-hour airport shuttle and promise of a wake-up call. Whoever dropped the ball on giving me the promised wake-up call generated this one star rating. Too bad, because I would have been very pleased to give the hotel a 5 star rating.","Los Angeles, California",116,1.0

The other thing that mattered most was that the room was quiet- very little noise bleeding from the ceiling or hallway. Even though the airport is 1/4mi away, it will still take 5-10 minutes to get to some of the terminals because they have to basically drive to the end of the airport and enter at the far end- not a big deal, but don't expect to be there in 1-2 minutes.Overall, I'd say that if you need something close to the airport, this is your best choice- a little pricey, but I've stayed at hotels in Oahu that charged just as much for a lot less.I'd definitely stay here again if I have the chance.",NV,752,5.0

As the stay went on i ran ouf of cash and the hotel refused to use the cash held as deposit toward the room & tax. I had an advance for the 5 night's room and tax plus a modest cash deposit. Third day into my stay i was forced to check out as i didn't have cash for that night's room and tax. My deposit was more than 2x the nightly rate so i asked them to take it from my deposit on hold. They said no even though they still had more than enough left over in my deposit to pay even my last night with cash left over. I was waiting for a bank transfer from my new employer and i was waiting for employer to complete a creditcard authorization for the hotel's charges. None of that mattered to the hotel, the desk clerk asked the wrong question to the manager on duty and would not let me speak to the manager directly. The manager said i needed cash for room and tax and refused to use any of the deposit otherwise i must leave. So with no choice i was escorted to my room by security, hastily packed my suitcases and checked out. Ironically, once i had my deposit back i had enough to pay for 3 nights room and tax. !!!

We called down to the front desk but no one answered. The bathroom itself was grungy- old tile flooring that was broken and dirty.

Whatever you do or no matter how low the rate is do not book a room here-even if it is free. If your airline tries to make you stay here tell then no & get a different hotel (or just stay at the airport)We got stuck in this dump because our flight was canceled and this is where Allegiant stuck us. Our stay here started with walking to our rooms, sprinklers were on & housekeeping had their cart on the sidewalk (taking up the whole sidewalk) so we had to walk with all of our luggage through the sprinklers to get to our room.We got 2 rooms on the bottom floor, rooms 126 & 127. Room 127 smelled horribly, like a mixture of mold & cigarette smoke with maybe a smidgen of wet dog. Room 126 seemed better at 1st, it smelled better. It definitely had a cheap motel feel but it was what we were stuck with so we decided to make the best of it, we got settled & let the kids look around. That is when we found a giant cockroach by the pool-although I was somewhat fascinated-it was the 1st cockroach I've ever seen, I was also very grossed out, it felt dirty. Then we discovered rat traps a few feet away from room 126's door, also a giant moth waiting just above our heads walking to our 2nd room. My husband noticed snails on the side of the building. The sound of the highway was so loud each room had 2 sets of ear plugs in the room for you to use. We decided to leave for a bit to go get a bite to eat.When we came back there was a cockroach IN the room that smelled ok. We talked to the lady @ the front desk & her only reply was ""Oh, that's a big one"" Apparently cockroaches are a normal thing here. She would only change one of our rooms so we got a room on the top floor (room 1202) and then they kicked us out of the other room we had to keep(room 126) for hours so they could spray some sort of pesticide(apparently housekeeping does that here). Seriously. All of this and we have only been at this hotel a few hours......who knows what joys the night will bring. Wish us luck and please save yourselves and DO NOT STAY HERE! (a bit more expensive but I suggest the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower)P.S. If I could have given The Best Western Plaza Hotel no stars than I would have.Update: room 1202: while housecleaning knows how to spray for roaches they apparently don't know how to clean. There is hair all over the bathroom and other little bits of garbage as well. The ""clean"" sheets are nasty....I'm not sure if they are dirty or stained (pics attached of bed 1 & bed 2). I can't say anyone in the top floor room really slept last night-we were too busy hoping cockroaches would not come running out from under stuff.....good news we didn't see any up here. The rest of us in room 126 (the room we got kicked out of for a few hours so they could spray for roaches) survived the night. The guys were busy making jokes about the cockroaches giving them massages last night and carrying them to the shuttle bus this morning, so we really are trying to make the best of it but really save yourself the headache & stay elsewhere.","Osage, Iowa",78,1.0

After flying for 23 hours and missing the final connection from Honolulu to Maui I was dead tired and still couldn't sleep. That's how bad it was. To add insult to injury, the airline refused to pay for the stay since the delay that caused me to misconnect was due to weather so I had to pay out of my pocket at a supposed discounted rate of $150. Way too high for this hotel, especially since I was there all of 5 hours as I checked in shortly after midnight and was up and out on the 5:30 AM shuttle. On the bright side, however, looks can be deceiving as I expected it to be a fleabag based on the exterior and lobby, but the room was very modern, the linens and towels were fresh and seemed to be fairly new and the room was spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable but the air conditioning unit runs constantly and there's no way to adjust the temperature which wasn't good on an unusually cool night, especially since there's no blankets. The woman at the front desk was extremely efficient and pleasant at check-in and the shuttle to the airport was spot on every 30 minutes. So, as the title suggests, the hotel has quite a few positives, but price and location are major negatives since, in this case, you don't get what you're paying for at this price point.

It was expensive for a Best Western hotel, but I wanted the convenience, which I did get. But just as I dreaded, getting picked up at the airport by the hotel's shuttle was easier said than done. As others suggested, I called the hotel upon my arrival, but the lack of signage at the airport for a well defined pick-up point made it difficult -- the shuttle just zoomed by and it was not easy to spot the van, especially for someone who just stumbled out of the Baggage Claim area in a strange airport, at night.On the other hand, catching a shuttle from the hotel to the airport was no problem , as it did leave on-time every 30 minutes.The hotel itself is dated. The air control was iffy and the air flow was harsh. The shower head was sub-par. But I was thankful for a clean place to rest overnight, and the Internet (unsecured) connection worked well .On my return visit, I did get an early check-in (without charge) when I arrived around noon, but the desk clerk made it clear that it was a privilege for which I should be thankful. (I checked out at 5:30 AM the next day.)You can catch a bus going in town at a stop a short walk from the front of the hotel. Coming back by bus, the stop is on the other side of the street and you do have to cross a busy highway to get back to the hotel. There is a 24/7 McDonald's a short walk from the hotel, and a small strip mall nearby with some eateries.$2 for a small bottle of water from the vending machines in the hotel-- you are better off buying it from McDonald's.

Had to wait 25 minutes for pick up.The decor in the hotel is a drab yellow and totally uninviting. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom clean and the staff on reception polite and friendly. An hotel of this size should have a restaurant. It does but only on the weekend and Monday. To eat you on other days there is fast food a block away or you can take the shuttle bus which will drop you at a sister hotel where you can eat and charge the bill to your room. You are tied, of course, to the shuttle bus schedule. To return to your hotel you have to wait for that hotel's shuttle bus to take you back. This arrangement is annoyingly inconvenient, obviously done to cut costs and not for the convenience of the customer.

The overhead freeway provides shelter for several transients who frequent the Hotel shop for alcohol. I was there for business in Wahiawa so this was the closest I could get.

They really have an awesome staff. My low rating is really because of the dated hotel along with the price you pay. I've stayed at many best westerns and have loved all of them except this one. It is not because it's not clean because the hotel is actually really clean. It's because it's dated and looks a little run down. Seems like with the amount of money that is made, they could do some renovations.Most hotels here in Hawaii are expensive but many of them ( especially downtown are renovated and look great and around the same price) The other downfall is the bed situation. The beds are full size beds ( not queens) they do have king size beds but with no pull our sleeper sofa option. My husband lift weights and is built with broad shoulders and big arms. It's so hard sleeping in a tiny full size bed comfortably. We couldn't get king size bedroom bc there was no additional sleeping arrangements for my kids unless we purchased another room that conjoined ours. . At 230+ a night that was out of the question. The rooms are a decent size and being that the hotel is about a block from the airport the noise level is low and I can barely hear them of any at all. Bathrooms are a little small but manageable. Parking is insane here and very tight but that is the norm for this area. Food: the restaurant in the hotel is decent. I like the breakfast and have tried many of the menu options. Dinner is good depending on what is ordered. Now for military personnel this hotel has a wonderful liaison that has put together an awesome program and package for military. They offer things that no other hotel will do for military and their families. I would consider coming back to this hotel bc of the staff.

We were greeted by cordial, affable receptionists who were able to efficiently check us in. Make sure to be a Best Western rewards member-- the points add up! From the front desk, a welcoming bell-hop was able to help us into our room with our heavy loads of luggage-- don't forget to tip! I've heard of the hotel offering a promissory note to military using TLA, but this is not the case for outbound families as we are. We were told that is only available for inbound. Either way, it wasn't a big deal. We paid upfront for all 11 nights and are able to pick up the receipt early, showing a zero balance, to take back to our command to begin the reimbursement process.We were given $30 ($10/person) in meal ticket vouchers for the cafe per day. Four nights a week, meals are offered here in the downstairs of this hotel. On Tuesday-Thursday, it is served at their sister hotel down the road. A free shuttle offers transportation and leaves from the lobby every 30 minutes. Breakfast and dinner are served daily-- no lunch. It's casual, sit-down dining and I'd say the average meal costs about $13 or so. You can order as cheap or as pricey as you want. You will be left to pay the remaining difference as well as tip. The portions are very generous and taste about average. My favorite so far has been the spaghetti bolognese and my husband's is the fettuccine chicken alfredo; both are served with garlic toast. There is a mini-mart located downstairs next to the lobby as well selling anything from souvenir T's to ice cream sandwiches. We are in a deluxe King, corner-room suite. The bed isn't our Tempur-pedic, but very comfortable, none the less, and the bedding is very soft. The AC works great for those coming from AC-less housing in town like us! Our room features large windows with views of the airport, Diamond Head, and the ocean in the far distance. Our room is the biggest I've ever stayed in... it's HUGE. Even with 3 large suitcases sprawled out and many other bags, we still have plenty of room to walk around and for my 6 month old to crawl and play. We also have a microwave, mini fridge, cable TV, dresser drawers, cabinet space, and the bathroom is a decent size; featuring a large vanity, and bathtub with shower head. The housekeeping staff has been helpful, attentive, and always very accommodating to our needs. Mercy and Emerita have been taking care of us and are exceptional! Anytime we need extra towels or trash taken care of (so many diapers with an infant), they are there to immediately meet our needs in the friendliest way possible. They were also able to provide a crib in our room upon time of arrival. Parking in the garage is free, just bring in your ticket to the lobby for validation. Also, the free wifi is great and has given us zero problems. Connecting is simple and you're allowed up to 4 devices. There are USB charging ports built right into the table, which is wonderfully convenient. Side note, we don't personally have pets, but I do know they are allowed! Another perk, is the pool! It's never crowded and there's towels poolside as well as tables and loungechairs. The hotel's location isn't bad either. It's not in the middle of Waikiki's hustle and bustle and close enough to basically anywhere you'd like to go. Very convenient Honolulu location. Less than 10 minutes to Pearl Harbor. As far as nearby food, there is a Micky D's within walking distance as well as a Starbucks like 3 minutes away. Next to Starbucks is Blimpie's subs, Ninja Sushi (order the Superman roll!), and Big Kahuna's (the BEST garlic cheese balls, everything is made to order)-- and cash only, ATM located outside! I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place. It may not be a resort, but I don't think anyone coming here is expecting that. For what's it's worth, our stay has already exceeded our expectations. If we are ever stationed here on island again, we will certainly be making a second visit to the Best Western Plaza Hotel.",,0,5.0

No, it's not a resort, but you aren't on vacation, you are trying to find a place to live and get out of there. McDonald's is right behind the hotel, and although I am personally not a fan, I can see how this would be very convenient for many families. Also walk-able are a Starbucks, jamba juice, ninja sushi and some other quick lunch type places. The restaurant in the hotel is good. Nothing crazy, but you can get a good solid meal here. You can easily score an uber or lyft to take you anywhere in town that you would like to go. It cost us about $15 to get into Waikiki and enjoy all the perks of the Hale Koa and other resorts. Here is a tip, in order to use the ""resort"" at Hale Koa, all you need is a military ID. I believe you can also park for free with your military ID. So if you are feeling deprived of the resort experience, just head on over there and enjoy the pools, beach, etc. The best thing is that this hotel actually caters to you as a family on TLA. You will book through Les, who is the military coordinator. He is passionate about providing a good experience for those of us who have just completed an overseas move. The rate you will be charged is calculated so that including tax it will total the TLA rate. No extra out of pocket. Additionally, parking fees and pet fees are waived. Parking is meant to be $30/night and pets $30/night per pet. The waiving of these fees saved my family $90/night. The pet policy for military is literally any pet up to 500lbs. We had our two larger dogs and it was comfortable. If you have pets, you will stay in the courtyard which is well appointed with grassy areas and poop-bag stands. The only downside to this is that there is no elevator for those staying on the second floor. It was an extra challenge to get all of our stuff in, but you make it work. If you don't have pets, you stay in the main tower and I believe you get other perks like meal vouchers to use at the restaurant. We had to attend a one hour meeting explaining all of this, which was kind of a drag, but there was free pizza and it was worth it to keep all of the perks (free parking etc). During the meeting I learned that the hotel will even give you a ""promissory note"" if you can not afford to pay out of pocket before being reimbursed TLA. I feel like this could be a big deal to some families, and is unheard of in this day and age at any other place. Additionally, the staff here is SUPER nice and accommodating. Always smiling and kind. The gym is decent. There were two treadmills, but one was broken during our stay. Also a universal gym, free weights, an elliptical, stationary bike, and medicine balls. It worked for me and I never had to wait for the one treadmill that was working. The view is pretty cool as the gym is on the top floor. They also have a little convenience store that has any basic items you might need. Also, free wifi, small coffee pot, mini fridge and microwave in the room.",,3,5.0

We had quite a rough start but because of the calm and caring efforts of the employees, the bump in the road eventually got worked out.The room was clean and, despite some major disrepair and wear and tear throughout the room and bathroom, it was nothing so disgusting that it would scare someone away. However, don’t expect anything about the room or facility to be in the modern or appealing décor. The room was dated, the hallway not inviting, and this establishment is in desperate need of renovation, as other reviews have noted. If you want modern, updated, no disrepair showing, then choose another motel as this one is not for you. For the extremely budget conscious family, they might make the effort to make a stay here worth it but that is a highly personal decision. It is also very noisy due to the major highways just outside the facility. The motel we were told was here first, but then came the highway that was placed right outside their front door. If you get a room on the side of the freeway, it seems it would be quite difficult to sleep. Even the room we were assigned on the backside of the motel is significantly noisy but tolerable. It seems it would hold true, as other reviews have noted, to get a room on an upper floor and preferably one not facing the highway.There is a restaurant but when it’s not open, the restaurant at their sister-facility just a bit down the road is open and they alternate the days each are open and closed. The free shuttle will pick-up and return guests on the days their facility’s restaurant is closed. For breakfast, the restaurant does not open until 6:30 a.m., which frankly, even for us ended up being too late to meet our need since we needed to catch an early flight. The time they open seems a bit too late because this facility caters to those needing to catch a flight and the military who are being stationed in Hawaii. Also, their free motel shuttle only provides rides to and from the airport every half hour and runs 24 hours. The shuttle drivers were also extremely efficient, helpful, and friendly. Do consider leaving a daily gratuity for housekeeping. They work so hard to keep the guests comfortable and the room clean and tidy. Just a couple of dollars always shows them that the guest appreciated their efforts. While traveling over the years, I’ve talked to many housekeepers and they work diligently and rarely get recognition for the effort from the guests. We’ve always carried the motto that “no one is going to clean up our mess” and we make every effort to help housekeeping out by making the room as easy to clean as possible such as gathering all the towels into one place, throwing away trash, keeping the floor and the room free of our belongings being tossed around the room, etc., and upon our exit we make a point to throw all soaps and other used amenities in the trash, saving the housekeeper from having to clean up after us.","Monroe, Michigan",118,3.0

There are rooms located inside the main hotel; however, we stayed in the outer rooms located around the pool. We requested this room because of medical purposes. The area is ridden with transients and there is no real barrier between the public and the outside rooms, which all have sliding glass doors. The transients had to be shooed away many times and it creates an uneasy feeling at night. There was an incident one day where my son and I left the pool are because a man was smoking meth in the parking lot. The front desk never answers the phone, so be prepared to constantly walk up front. Towels are supposed to be supplied at the pool; however, they go quickly. Both times I asked the front desk clerk for pool towels I was met with a quick, rude response - ""They're outside."" Of course they were not. Why else would I walk the extra 50 feet to ask you? My husband had just returned from the hospital from major surgery. I waited at the front desk and said excuse me twice to ask where I could find an ice machine. After the second time the clerk huffed and complained I made her lose her count. It's as though we were asking too much for simple requests. The room also had occasional roaches, which is normal when palm trees are nearby. I do know a tree/palmetto roach from a german roach though. When I ask for pest control, the clerk attempted to inform me that roaches are common. Yes, I'm well aware; however, I just killed four and found one in my bed and they surely weren't tree or water roaches. There is a ""dining area"" inside the main lobby; however, breakfast is ala carte and dinner is only served fri-mon. Tues-Thurs you must walk to their nearby location for a meal. There is a gift shop i the lobby that is quite convenient if you're willing to overpay for convenience. The perks were the not-so-crowded pool, lobby gift shop, proximity to airport, and friendly housekeeping. Luz is amazing. Very respectful, courteous, and helpful and never made you feel as though you were inconveniencing her for asking for anything at all. If hotels near the Waikiki strip are booked or over $300/night, I could say stay here, but I recommend looking at something on the strip such as the Hale Koa, Embassy Suites, Marriott if you're expecting a more Hawaiian experience.

He returned 1 minute later with the same potatoes with what looked to be someones fist print in them. I guess at the Best Western Hulk Smash potatoes. Again, tonight as I am a glutton for punishment and a lover of pork I ordered the same dish and received the same baby potatoes devoid of salt, pepper, garlic, butter, chives, and even a hint of sour cream. I offered to make the dish for the chef. I asked to have the potatoes reheated, a dollop of butter, salt, pepper, two tablespoons of sour cream, chives and bacon bits but they would not let me make that order. They could not find my credit receipt and so I paid $7 for a container of cold, raw potatoes that were left at the cashier stand. I did not get recompense but did suggest that the chef use the baby potatoes as suppositories. Cashier actually googled 'smashed potatoes' when I pointed out the difference she said, 'Those are regular smashed potatoes, not garlic smashed potatoes. I would not be so upset but the initial knuckle prints in the first batch of 'garlic smashed potatoes' shows an arrogance and distain that does not belong in customer service.

I chose it because it is located very close to the airport. The hotel has a high rise building and a motel-like building. My room was in the (dated) motel-like building, with rooms that open up to the outdoors (no hallway like you'd have in a hotel). My room was on the second floor. With no elevator, it was very difficult lugging our large luggage up the stairs. Also, the room faced a parking area that is adjacent to a small city street. I had a difficult time resting in the room for a few reasons. One reason is that, at some point during the night, the a/c stopped blowing cooled air and instead emitted air that was as muggy as the room. Another reason, there was noise coming from the parking area (voices from people) at late hours of the night. Additionally, the water in the toilet kept running (the kind of sound you'd hear right after flushing when the water level is getting back to normal). At one point (say at about 4 am), I began counting the number of minutes between the quiet and a new round of water noise--- not more than 10 minutes apart!Finally, the most annoying thing during my stay was the noise from the onslaught of municipal and vendor trucks that seemed to come around every 30 minutes from around 4 am throughout the morning. At first, I thought the sound was from a street sweeping truck. I accepted it and figured it would be gone and then I go back to sleep. But not long after the first bit of truck noise, I heard the loud beeping sound of a truck backing up. I am certain that I heard at least 5 different trucks come through with loud back-up beeping sounds. Perhaps they were vendors unloading supplies for the hotel??? I have no idea but it was very noisy and very early in the morning. Surprisingly, my husband was able to sleep through all the noise.

It is conveniently located by Hickam AFB. Room was clean. There was a small wait on the room attached to ours for our kids but they opened it up soon after. My kids are all preteens and they gave us extra cots since they do not like sleeping together. Bathrooms are kind of small but clean. For the price it was okay. The gym is on top floor and has enough equipment to get a work out in. Free weights, elliptical, treadmill, universal workout machine, bike, and yoga area. Everything was stocked up like towels and cups for the water machine. It overlooks tripler area. The pool is very clean and has a lot of seating. Sadly it was raining most of the 10 days but our girls still swam. The best part about the hotel is the parking. You park in the garage near an elevator. As I watched others at nearby hotels running in the rain to their cars parked outside I was thankful for the convenient parking garage. We had a great maid, named Amelia. She was very kind to us and didnt mind restocking towels and stuff for the kids. She was very friendly to the kids. The store downstairs is a little pricey but we would just drive to the shoppette if we needed anything (also NEX mall right down the road). The lobby is nice with a computer and printer that was great for me since I needed to print homework. The wifi in the rooms was fast. Im not sure if the people complaining about slow connection went onto bestwestern.com and put in the password. If you only click on best western through your wifi you will get slow internet so remember to log in on your internet browser also. About the room. Smaller TV but we are use to a 60inch. It worked. Buying movies on demand is nuts $12.99 to rent it. We bought a cheap DVD player and rented redbox movies. The beds are a little hard but slept fine. The A/C is amazing!!!! Gets so cold if you like that. There is a small fridge and microwave. The restaurant is not the best. High priced for not so great food but we have lived here for a few years and have had amazing food so it was disappointing. You do get $10/per person vouchers for food a day so that helps for breakfast (breakfast is not free). We drove to other areas to eat and bought food to make in hotel. We made it work.

Yes, goods cost more because of the shipping/freight involved in getting things there but it is obvious that retailers and service providers take advantage of this when possible. This hotel has, quite possibly, the most limited TV channel selection I have experienced in years. This would not be very important if this property was located in Waikiki or some other interesting area yet there is NOTHING near here but the airport. Based on my initial breakfast I would have given the restaurant a very low score (2 eggs , a scoop of hash, some potatoes for 18 bucks and change). It redeemed itself a little on my last day with some tasty eggs benedict. Still, it pales next to the free breakfast I receive at every other BW I frequent (including those with restaurants). The internet is extremely slow and sometimes the router goes down. When calling the front desk in the evening, the person did not even know where the router was located. The parking, while an insult to be charged, usually has space available....if you are driving a subcompact. You're better off parking against the wall because management is trying to milk three spots in place of two. The water temp is hit or miss and will change in the middle of your shower...and back again. The front desk staff is extremely accommodating and helpful. My bed was very comfortable and the room temp controls were very effective. Just stay out of the direct shot from the vent when using the AC.

Having travelled in from Canada, all we wanted was a bed for the night before we left the country the next day. Having waited for an eternity for the shuttle bus to arrive and pick us up at the airport, we trudged into reception at about 10.30pm and met with some of the worst customer service that I have ever received. It would appear that the lady who had booked our accomodation had made a mistake with the American variation of the dates and our booking had expired the previous month. This appeared to make the receptionist very happy, as she proceeded to inform me that they were full and could not provide us with another room and we shouldn't have been so stupid. At which point she wandered off, happy with her nights work. When we finally managed to speak to a manager, she was equally unhelpful as she explained that they had already charged my credit card for the no show ($300 AUD) and that if I wanted to book another room, she would happily charge me a further $300 AUD for the priviledge. All of a sudden, they were no longer fully booked? Despite explaining the situation to her, she didn't even bother to feign interest or concern and merely told me pay for the room or get out. When I got back to Australia, we looked to recoup that amount from the hotel and having spoken to the manager at length, it turned out that they had also managed to sell my incorrectly booked room on the night of my no show, thus claiming around $900 AUD from me for one booking! I would only recommend staying in this hotel if you are desperate or suicidal as the rooms are old and dirty and the service is the worst I have ever experienced....and I have been to France!

The view east from large picture window was awesome.The only real complaint I have was the parking situation. A new ticket/gate system had apparently just been installed. It was confusing to operate, the cheap paper tickets with mag stripe did not work half the time, you have to wait at the front desk to get every ticket validated, and the front desk staff had a hard time reading and operating the new controller. Was delayed getting out of the garage by the cards. A real pain when other cars are waiting in line behind you to get out (can’t go forward through the gate, and can’t back up). Other hotels use a room keycard reader to let guests in and out of the parking, and that works great. Inside the garage, the parking was very tight for the minivan I drove, but tiny parking places are typical of Hawaii, not just this hotel.Don’t let the parking situation stop you from staying here. They’ll get it sorted out eventually, and the location is far more convenient to the airport and the joint base than anything in Waikiki.

She--along with ALL the workers there on our stay-- gave my fiancé and I an unfriendly, unwelcoming, ""I don't want to be here"" attitude. I signed and retrieved our room keys. As we walked to our rooms we were put on the ground level near the highway where you can hear the unfiltered sounds of speeding vehicles as well as feel their gushing high pressure winds pass by.We entered our room and were greeted by the immense odor of cigarettes.

I drove around for 30 min trying to find the entrance to the hotel. I finally found it on a 1 way street underneath the interstate. The hotel is older and worn. The shower went from hot to cold and variations of each without manual adjustment. The Restaurant was decent food, breakfast anyway but the price was outrageous. I had a basic meat and potatoes breakfast with eggs and coffee for 30 bucks! There is no discount for being a top tier member and no continental breakfast option. The internet was slow and several of the TV channels had poor reception and could not make out the picture. Two light bulbs were bunt out and the view was of a industrial park. Finally I think the bed was made in 1970 something and was hard as a rock. On the upside the parking was free for top tier members and I got a 6 PM late checkout. I probably wouldn't stay here again as it is in a crime heavy area(the not responsible for stolen items/remove valuables from car signs) and heavy transient population nearby.

A few things to say about the facility overall. VERY close to the airport. GREAT staff. The resturant was plain but the food was resonably priced and not too bad. Room was very good, not great. Everything was clean and well maintained, just had a feeling of being an older hotel. View is NOT worth mentioning but I was not there for a view. Parking is tight between spaces but adequate. I was driving a Ford Edge and had little problem manuvering the garage. The pool was ok. Again an older design and some of the tiles were missing or coming loose. The pool area was well maintained. The hotel also had a small store for snacks, incidentals and memoribilia. Priced as expected (high) but not too crazy. Final comment. The facility was CLEAN. I would stay there again on business.","Jacksonville, Florida",6,4.0

We were left entirely to our own resources when a connecting flight was cancelled--weather related so on compensation and I'm ok with that. But no advice from the airline either, as to which hotels they typically used. We were looking for clean and close and reasonably-priced and figured that would be the type United used, but at least three differently airline people refused to give us a hotel name. Fortunately, an airport helpdesk employee was there to recommend Best Western. It has a free shuttle and is only 10 minutes away. More important, the hotel staff was friendly and helpful. It is not fancy or new, but it has a reasonable place to eat on premises and, to repeat myself somewhat, it was nice to be treated with kindness and respect after the airline treatment. United had rebooked me for a 6:30 am flight the next day, so I was up in time to take the 4:00 am shuttle, only to discover that my rebooked flight had been changed to 2:00 pm. I called the hotel from the airport and they sent the shuttle to pick me up again, then gave me back the room I had checked out of, all with a smile and at no cost to me. Yes, that's what I expected, but my expectations had been previously very sorely disappointed by the so-called travel and hospitality industry.

When you arrive, there are only 3 tight parking spaces in front of the hotel so you can run inside to check in. The shuttle bus parks in front and the driveway entrance and exit make for very difficult turns. They have a multi-level parking garage with small spaces and certainly not enough spaces to accommodate all guests. Many people parked along a wall, creating difficulty for those in parking spaces to get out. It took me about 10 minutes to park a mid-size car properly.The hotel room was clean, comfortable, and came with a mini fridge and microwave. We had two double beds and ample space to get around even with 2 suitcases and various carry-on bags. Although the hotel sits on a main drag, we didn't notice any noise coming from the street.There's a nice gift shop on the first floor with a very helpful employee. Buy the large bottle of water for only 99 cents. It's the best deal around. Their prices on macadamia nuts, postcards, and other vacation must-haves are competitive with other shops in Honolulu and Waikiki.You'll pay for parking. What I don't understand is they say guests pay less than the standard rate. I can't imagine anyone parking there who isn't a hotel guest.

To keep from writing a really long review I'll just give some highlights.I was required to stay there due to medical military orders and was not given any other option (which already put me in a fowl mood). I had to live there for almost a month. Pros: The staff was very accommodating and kind. The hotel itself was being painted when I was there, so it seems to be getting revamped a little.The room was clean, but nothing special. It was old, but not terrible. The bed was comfortable.I was on the 4th floor facing towards the airport and it was very quiet.The hotel store had plenty of the things that I needed on a day to day basis, and the restaurant at both this hotel and the sister hotel nearby was actually really delicious.

Best Western is close to the airport, the joint base Pearl Harbor/Hickam, NEX, commissary, housing office, pretty much everything you need to go to upon arrival. While the hotel can benefit from a few makeovers, I would give my entire 60-day stay in the hotel a five-star. There is a military liaison named Les who went beyond his role in helping military families. He drove me to the pier to pick up my car from the mainland. And he had an assistant named Rebekah who was extremely wonderful! She picked me up at the airport and drove me around the first 2 days. I have 2 kids, one was 9mos. at that time, and she would watch them while e.g. I was talking to housing office staff or I was shopping at the commissary. I had to purchase and install car seats and she was very patient throughout the process. My housekeeper was named Madeline and she was very pleasant and would play peekaboo with my baby while she cleaned the room. She would also give me extra coffee and would make sure I had everything I needed. On some of her days off I had a housekeeper named Amelia and she was nice too. The girls at the front desk were very knowledgable about military TLA's. I'd like to mention Sharon who was pleasant and would chit chat with me. Oh, and the hotel gives out $10 meal voucher per person everyday. And they have signature crab leg buffet on Fridays. The staff at the restaurant was wonderful and I'd like to say thank you to Ramon, Gemma and Michael for making my meal times a pleasure! I remember these people's names because I stayed in the hotel for a long time (we bought a house in HI and had to wait for closing) and they made me feel that I have Ohana in Hawaii! Mahalo!",,0,4.0

We've stayed in 2 other hotels in Waikiki... we had to leave b/c of unavailability. (we keep extending our stay b/c we're waiting for our household goods to come in from the mainland.) One hotel was great, but pretty expensive, and the other was much more expensive than this one (Best Western), but the quality was much less. I'd say if I had to do it over again, I'd stay here for the whole time.The location is both good (close to the interstate and convenient when trying to get to work early in the morning), and bad (not many restaurants close by and you can hear the traffic on the freeway all night). Our room was clean, the A/C worked!, the internet worked, but was slow. (those 3 are my top priorities at this point...) The washers were pretty expensive for a very small washer ($2.75 for a half size), but the dryers were better than average ($2.50) .. we put 3 loads of laundry in one dryer and all of our clothes came out dry 40 minutes later. So in the end it averaged out.the restaurant downstairs had friendly service, but the food was not that great. I don't eat at Denny's much (but the food was comparable to Denny's), but a cleaner atmosphere than Denny's. Parking was free for us (my roommate is PCSing here)... not sure if it is for everyone.., and she got a daily voucher for the restaurant.The pool was clean and nice, but again, you can't hear each other speak b/c the traffic from the freeway was loud.All in all, pretty good value!

The hotel did not have a bar or a restaurant, but I think there was breakfast in the morning from 6.30 or so, which I could not try because I left at 5 a.m. Unless you have your own transportation, there was not much to do around on foot. I went to a sports bar called Lisa, but it was not the place to enjoy a quiet drink. It was loud, and people were playing pool. The hotel was pretty basic; I could not even see a cart in the lobby to carry the luggage to the floors. It is possible something could have been arranged if I asked, but I was too tired to go to the desk and wait for it. I went to this hotel because it was paid for as I was on business.

Getting to the hotel to check in if you are in your own vehicle is a trick in itself. The reception area is only slightly larger than a postage stamp. It appears that Honolulu over the years has intruded little by little on this hotel and now it stands alone surrounded very closely by the highway and highway access road, the industrial area on its backside and the used car lot right next to its garage entrance. So I had to park like I owned the place feeling bad I had used up about a quarter of any reception parking area there was. The Reception area is also small, between that and the arrival area creating a somewhat claustrophobic feel. However the front area was quite nice, it has an updated modern feel with PC printer access, a brand new ATM and very unique furniture all very close together. The front staff were pleasant but in a we already know what you want we have don't this a million times sort of way. For example when checking out I asked clearly to have the room placed on my business credit card and the incidentals on my personal card as I am handing her my Personal Credit Card. She swiped my card and put the whole thing on it. When I asked about why this happened she stated that they did not swipe my business credit card upon check in, as if that had something to do with it. The hotel behind the Front counter area is mostly clean but very dated. You can see the wear and tear, from the elevator to the rug stains, to the pool and restaurant area. The restaurant has odd hours and is not even open some evenings, but invites the guest to hop on their shuttle and be taken to their ""sister property"" for dinner. The ""snack, Gift shop"" does not have to much either. If you end up having to go and get dinner there is no place within walking distance.The Room was again dated but clean, this is obviously due to the work of the very pleasant house cleaning staff. The bed was nice but actually a bit too soft. If you sleep near the edge you may experience a sensation of sleeping at a downward angle.(I only weight 165 pounds in case you were wondering). The Bathrooms are very small and the on demand system is unexpectedly difficult to navigate. However, it does offer movies that are still in theaters as well as poplular show catch up options The small things or the things you may expect are industry standard especially for a place that identifies itself with the word Plaza, are at least one step behind. For example the doors still have the Slide chain vs the bolt slide system for security and keeping your door open while you move things in and out. The rooms also do not have safes either key or Code. One thing they do have is extra plug ins and even a USB port built into the bureau, which was unique and useful. If you have Read in the hotel description that there is a fitness room?, there is a fitness room but I would call it a FRINO (fitness room in name only)The parking garage is attached to the building and you can access the elevator directly to your room from the garage area which was quite convenient although the elevators are old and can take a bit of time.If you are in need of a relatively inexpensive place to lay your head near the airport for a night, maybe this is the place for you.

We had planned to return our vehicle the night before our flight but changed our minds once we realized how close and convenient the rental cars are to both the airport and the hotel. We kept our reservation at the hotel, though, and are glad we did.We reserved two rooms for our party and were given adjoining rooms. One was not ready when we checked in, but we were about 45 minutes early. That was no problem for us and the front desk called to let us know as soon as our second room was available. The lobby area is small.We had rooms on the 10th floor. The hallway smelled a little stale, but the rooms were fresh and clean. We did open the window (it will open 6-8 inches) to enjoy the breezes. There were adequate places to plug in our electronics.Our rooms were fully stocked with towels, toiletries, and coffee. There was also a refrigerator in each room.The parking garage is tight getting into the spaces on the lower levels, but P4 and up are easier to maneuver. There is an elevator from the parking garage that will take you up to your floor without having to go back to the lobby.We would recommend signage higher on the building as we were not sure it was the right place from a distance. Check-in parking has very limited space.The front desk staff (Sunday afternoon/evening) was pleasant and helpful with information and directions. There is a small gift shop with souvenirs and snacks, reasonably priced.There is a noon check out time which was nice for us as we had a mid-afternoon flight and could just relax in the morning.","Tallahassee, Florida",71,4.0

With all the stops along the way we got a pretty nice representative tour of the state capital and tourist corridor. On Waikiki Beach we watched young boys diving off the sea wall, beautiful bodies playing volleyball, and the sunset glistening onto Diamond Head. Walking around we checked out the photo ops from the public balconies of some high end hotels and found a delicious, inexpensive, all you can eat Hawaiian buffet with a mini luau show thrown in on the side. Then we picked up the bus right in front of the restaurant used our free transfer tickets and headed back to the hotel.

We used it four times in two stays and each and every time the driver was very helpful and accommodating. We were concerned as we were told it was first come first served when we arrived, but we never had an issue getting a seat on the shuttle. It does not run on demand, but runs on the half hour from the hotel. The rooms themselves, after seeing the outside, were a pleasant surprise, very spacious and somewhat updated. Large rooms with updated linens. Comfortable. One of our rooms, the first time, took a long time to cool down, but the drapes were open when we arrived and the sun was pouring in. The other room was cool on arrival and the drapes were drawn. (a note to the management to have housekeeping draw the drapes when doing the rooms)There is not much around for food, and the restaurant has very limited service hours. So eat before you arrive!

We decided to stay here for a few nights after our reservation expired at the Navy lodge while we were waiting for housing. The military liaison was very pleasant on the phone and so was the staff when we arrived. They let us park two cars in the garage for free. What I really did not like is the pet friendly rooms you have to stay in. I've stayed at other best western's right off I95 where you don't here the highway. Here, if you have a pet you can only stay in one of their courtyard rooms which are in a completely different building right off the highway. It feels very insecure especially if you are a woman staying alone. The doors face the highly trafficked main road and anyone can just walk up to your door from the street. At the back of the room you have a sliding glass door that faces the pool and the courtyard. This also has no security anyone can easily walk into the courtyard from the street. They don't even have a door to this area it's just open to the public. The locks are laughable, anybody can easily kick in the door. These rooms are so far removed from the main tower you feel like you checked into the motel 6. The worst part is the noise you hear from the main road and the H1 bridge which runs right over the hotel. If you are military with a pet and need a good place to sleep well, then this is not your place. You hear every single noise comig from the road. We weren't able to get any sleep and checked out after two nights. We needed a place to stay for four nights while our household goods were being moved.

I looked for a place reasonably close to airport, and planned a day's layover, in case the bags got ""misdirected"", and would there-after be hop-scotching behind us if we moved right on to the Big Island. The bags DIDN'T miss, but we used the lay-over day as planned and saw much of the island close in to Honolulu, but nowhere near Waikiki.This hotel is close to the airport and has excellent to/from shuttles to that facility. We rented a car, because I knew my way around Oahu, and planned to travel a bit on our ""layover"" day.What I had forgotten was that parking on Oahu involves parking spaces that are 24"" narrower than on the Mainland. We managed, and the in/out daily fee at the BW was reasonable.(Note: after 8:00 pm, the slotted spaces will be gone, and you are going to park perpendicular on ALL levels, against the outside wall, or off the property).The rooms were clean, well appointed, and comfortable. The refrigerator worked well, so the bar items we had purchased, and cached, stayed cool/cold. The staff stays BUSY, account theconstant turnover. This is NOT a ""seasonal"" facility. It has a full occupancy rate account the many military families in transit to Oahu - awaiting in processing, and assignment to permanentquarters.It was obvious that they were NOT treated as a ""burden"" by the staff, but as honored guests. That raised my appreciation of the hotel by a QUANTUM degree!! The military occupants may predominate, but do not occupy ALL the rooms - and the in-transit tourists recieve the full range of attention as the longer-staying guests.Because we had a car, we MISSED that (semi-hidden) there is a full range of shops and services, restaurants, just a block away for just casual needs (and lighter meals). The hotel is within spitting distance of the airport, but the roads won't allow you to spit THAT far. Once you figure the layout, Honolulu/Chinatown (NOT Waikiki) is within easy driving distance, and Aiea/Pearl City with shops/restaurants/dining to the West is even closer. We booked a layover here to arrive, and then depart, a couple of weeks later. One of the wiser choices we made on a truly eventful and satisfying trip to ""Hawaii-Nei"". We reorganized all our luggage after arrival, and reduced our luggage by shipping all the excess clothes home by Postal Service - at the nearby USPS facilty - so we could carry all the Hawaiian Treasures home in SAME number of suitcases with which we arrived in Hawaii.Good value, excellant staff, ATTENTIVE security - an NO Waikiki congestion to deal with !!","Marietta, Georgia",53,4.0

I was really unimpressed with the service provided by the front desk agents. Spoken down to when asked questions, and ver rudely served during both check in and check out. There is no other dining onsite, but the hotel is right next to a little take out place. We headed over there as we were starving when we arrived, but I wouldn't recommend it as it was kind of sketchy and seemed like a bit of a hangout for unsavoury types. Food wasn't that great either.","Riverview, Canada",118,2.0

We stayed here on our way in to Hawaii and then again for a night on our way out. As far as the rooms go, it's pretty average. They aren't a vacation or a resort hotel, and they aren't trying to be. It's clean, comfortable and relatively quiet. If you like to watch planes take off and land, we could do that from the window in our room, it's THAT close to the airport.This hotel is very convenient to Pearl Harbor, so we stayed here the night before we left Oahu and spent the next day at Pearl Harbor. Parking at this hotel is kind of a nightmare. They have a parking garage that is the first few floors of the hotel, so it's convenient that you can go right from your car to your room without changing elevators. But the parking spaces in the garage are so narrow, they will barely accommodate a mid-size car. The problem is, they are filled with big SUVs! They also are bordered by support columns, so you're either going to hit the car next to you, or you'll hit the support column on the other side. To make things a little more interesting, they also allow parking along the outer walls of the garage, so while you're trying not to hit the car next to you or the support column, you have to remember not to hit the car BEHIND you. Best to rent a compact car.I will say the price was a good value for Honolulu, which is an extremely expensive place to travel.","Atlanta, GA",70,3.0

Good: Breakfast platters. Front staff. Central location for visiting the island. Proximity to Navy Exchange, car rentals and airport. Easy and quick to-from travel to Tripler. Warm water and pressure.Bad: Dinner buffet. Maid service. Hotel-to-beach access (none).Ugly: The concrete. The homeless along Nimitz Hwy. The sulfur-iron tint to the water. Smash-&-grab theives (more below...)First off, you need to know that I was on a TDY for 45 days training for the US military, so I was busy most of my time here and mostly just slept, studied, and ate in my room at night after getting back from our unit doing afternoon physical training. You also should know that I was here for 28 days after staying at Navy Lodge, Ford Island. I was busy most of the time but I had most of my weekends free. So my experiences may not be comparable to yours. That having been said, ... My initial impression was positive due to the helpful front-desk staff. My room itself was average for Best Western level hotels. It does have a microwave and small fridge with a built in freezer box at the top inside the fridge, so you can do a microwave cook style while there. Regarding eating, I bought the seafood buffet my first night. It wasn't bad, but it was only average at best in quality, so I felt it was overpriced. My room smelled of carpet shampoo, as if they were trying to remove the smell of smoke. The hallways and carpet seemed a little dingy, but if you spend enough time on Oahu you'll realize this is just what happens with time on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. This is a 'smoke-free' hotel, though I do not believe it always has been. There is a smoking area on the 5th floor parking level. There is a pool, but not many people used it (We are surrounded by beaches and the ocean -- why are you at a pool? ...just saying). Loved taking a hot soaking bath most days in the tub. The water definitely had a sulphur-iron scent to it, but we are on a volcanic island afterall. Security is good for parking your car here, especially important on this island where window smash-and-grabs are VERY COMMON. Your parking ticket will be validated and become your parking pass if you are staying. Cost was average for Honolulu inflation of everything, though if I spent $110 a night for this hotel stateside I would be unlikely to visit again. It is only 20 min from the craziness of Waikiki along H1 even with people slowing down before Likelike Hwy for no reason every day. Very close to the main NEX (best of the exchanges by far in my opinion), with a strip mall style eateries close with all the chains (McD, PizzaHut, etc) and several local ones. Excellent location for TAMC commute, though IHG across the street is better location (though rooms much more run-down). Great central location for seeing the sites of Oahu, including Pearl Harbor. Easy access to Nimitz Hwy and H1 (main interstate E-W of the island) which takes you to H2 to the north shore and H3 to the NW shore. If you have a valid CAC/ID, the main NEX is less than 5 min away. Pearl Harbor is 5-10 min away. Ford Island is 10 min away, and a great place to go running.My complaints are that there are too many drug-addicts/homeless along the Nimitz Hwy close to the hotel. The area is also quite industrial in nature, and does not feel as if you are in a vacation area. If you want this atmosphere for your time here, this is not a good place to stay. There are lots of hotels in downtown Waikiki that would serve better for this purpose. No idea on cost, though, and traffic in that area is terrible. Careful with leaving your car unattended. If you are visiting then you have a rental, and all rentals have a sticker that thieves will see and recognize as a rental car. Leave nothing in your car when you are not there, and pay for the included insurance for the rental car. There are lots of stupid drivers and people who may cause you to wish you had paid for the protection. Also buy your protection from the rental company itself, not from some third party or included deal from say Expedia or Hotwire.

The Plaza was convenient because it is close to the airport and the main post office rather than being located where most Oahu hotels are, over near Waikiki. It was also reasonably close to the area I was moving from in Pearl City. With the Government rate, it was affordable, although the parking fee was pretty steep. The parking lot is pretty difficult to maneuver around, even in a small car. There were a lot of huge pickup trucks taking up multiple parking spots, which made it very hard to find parking at times. The smoking area is outside on the top level of the parking garage and if you have to park near there, your car will smell as though someone has been smoking inside the car. Overall, the staff was very friendly and helpful. There are no luggage carts; you have to use bellhop services and tip them. I found this quite frustrating since I had to make multiple trips to the post office to send off items I did not want to have moved as part of my relocation. My room was as far from the elevators as possible, which is great for peace and quiet, but awful for carrying things to and from the car. The hotel is very old and needs a lot of renovation and modernization. The carpets in the hallways are old and outdated, and much of the room furnishings are the same way. The room had everything I required; a computer desk, free internet, a very comfortable bed, a nice shower and bathroom. There was a nice-sized television and cable, as well as movies on demand. Because of the location of the hotel and the traqffic pattern in that area of town, to go 'west' towards the airport or post office required pulling onto Nimitz Highway eastbound (toward town), driving a half-mile or so and making a U-turn to head back toward Pearl Harbor, the airport and the post office. This is easier said than done during much of the day.Overall, the hotel was adequate for my needs and is a far better value than paying hundreds of dollars to stay in Waikiki. But I would not want to stay here for more than a few days due to the lack of amenities and the noise in the area.","Mobile, Alabama",62,3.0

Location is good. Great access to Pearl Harbor Historic Sites, H1 (main east-west on Oahu), H2 (Northshore, Dole plantation, Shoefiled Barracks), and 15 min to Waikiki (due to traffic, not distance). If you have a valid armed services ID the main NEX (Navy Exchange) is just a U-turn and few blocks west on Nimitz. If you don't have a CAC or the like, it still has lots of fast-food places nearby (JackInTheBox, PizzaHut, TacoBell, McDs, PandaExpress, JavaJuice, and a whole lot of local BBQ and a breakfast places) that anyone can access and use. The variety, familiarity, and almost normal prices are nice if you need to get something you are used to. If you want beachfront sights this is not the place. It is on a calm main road (Nimitz Hwy) before it gets crazy in the downtown area. The traffic is loud but constant, so you don't notice it too much. Rooms are clean and they only forgot to replace my shampoo/soap once the entire 21 days I was there. Breakfast is great (ask for a 10$ voucher at check-in). This gets you a nice breakfast for about $5 after the voucher. Please be aware that on Hawaii generally there are no freebies, so a nice sit-down breakfast for ~$5 was nice; runs from 630 to 10 am. Price for me was decent. Parking is safe and included in your stay, both of which are important in Hawaii. I stayed here for a prolonged business trip to the area. Did have a chance to see some sights, but most of the time was at my work-place. I was on the 9th floor. A few things bothered me, but maybe not too much for others: Hallway smelled of carpet shampoo, which for some is 'clean' but for me was a bit unpleasant, so I bought a 99cent air freshener which worked for the entire several weeks I was there. The water had a sulfur smell to it, but I drank it and am doing fine, and the hot water and pressure are GREAT (take a hot bath after a long day on your feet at work was WONDERFUL). I would like to come back to Hawaii with family for a vacation. Don't know how much other places cost, but traffic in Waikiki and the main downtown of Honolulu is ridiculous, especially the stopping on the interstate for nothing (not too many cars, no construction, just people up ahead stopping for no reason and it trickling back to the rest of us), so I really enjoyed the fairly clear roadway next to the Best Western (Nimitz Hwy). If you are vacationing and want beachfront, try somewhere else, but be advised the traffic may drive you fruity.","Champaign, United States",1,3.0

He upgraded our original king request to a king suite. A corner room, I need to say no more. The room was great, we didn't have any noise issues facing the airport. Our night there was pleasant and quite comfortable. They do have a restaurant which is just OK. The seafood buffet that was available was nothing to rave about and the price was high. At $ 30 per person for average food and mediocre presentation the buffet was very easy to pass up. They did recommend a sports bar two blocks away called Lucy's Place.

But, if you are thinking this is a great place for a vacation and think hanging out at the pool all day is the way to go; then you are in the wrong place. Get away from the freeway. Go to the beach hotel, or better yet an out-island. The room was clean, the water was hot, and the carpet was new. The furniture was the standard motel formica. The only real problem was the thermostat just seemed to be soething that hung on the wall and had no bearing on the room temperature.

PROS: clean rooms (some more spacious than others); nice and accommodating staff; 24-hr free shuttle to/from the airport; frig/microwave; comfortable beds/pillows; decent shower;a little shop near lobby; atm; parking garage (though you do pay for parking); (and I believe laundry facilities though we didn't use it); pretty convenient location. CONS: road noise; some airport noise; and on-site restaurant that was too pricey I thought (Seafood Buffet over $60 for 2 people).... (but everything in Hawaii is pretty expensive). I had originally reserved a room outside of Honolulu that did not live up to the online photos; description...so we left and got a room here instead. The first night we had a nice big room (handicap room) with good views and it would have been a wonderful stay except for the road noise (it faced Nimitz Highway and the main highway above it). The next day upon request, they moved us to a room on the top floor, more away from the highway, but it was small and very hot; so we were given another room on a different floor. It was not as large as our room the first night, but quieter. Our final night was a nicer room, again more away from the road noise..but you could still hear it a little. We rented a car and saw Pearl Harbor, Waikiki, and drove to the north shore, east and west shores. Honolulu has a lot of traffic (unfortunately what many people, including us, came to Hawaii to get away from)... but if you get out of Honolulu, the drives along the coast are pretty. I would stay at this property again... but you should ask for a room that doesn't face Nimitz Highway...or possibly bring a pair of earplugs. If you need to be near the airport though, this is convenient. Price was very reasonable with our AAA rate.","Crowley, TX",222,3.0

I have never complained about a room at check-out but here I did.As the H-1 interstate has been there for ages, there's really no excuse for not having proper windows in the rooms. It's not rocket science.

The front desk was really helpful, we even got breakfast for free and paid 129 $ for the room (of course, we booked six months before our stay...). As many others have said, the shuttle service is quick and efficient and even friendly, so we think the hotel was worth it and wikll probably stay here again. Only thing: when we arrived at shortly before 10 p.m., nobody told us that the bar was already closed and the little shop in the lobby would close at ten sharp - when we came back down from unloading our luggage there was no way we could get a snack!","Kronberg im Taunus, Germany",53,2.0

After a 5 hour flight and arriving at just before midnight the lady at reception decided to make us wait for a while before she finally decided to help us. (We only had about 6 hours to sleep before we had to get back to the airport). We were also travelling really heavy and had a lot of luggage. The same lady decided to give us a room on the 2nd floor (the side that has NO LIFT!). After pointing out that we could not possibly carry all our luggage up two flights of stairs - she had to go and check with the manager if it was possible to move us to a room near a lift. This took some more time.We finally got a room with lift access. The room was right next to the freeway and even though I knew it would be close to the freeway, I don't think I was quite expecting it to be right on top of the freeway. The noise was overwhelming. We were lucky we had some earplugs with us, else I don't think I would have slept.The room was clean but the bathroom was very squashed - getting out of the shower meant jumping over the toilet. I think it is overpriced for what it offers. At least offer some free earplugs if you expect people to sleep next to that noise. I would NOT stay here again.","Sydney, Australia",27,2.0

I wish they could spend a little money upgrading the place just a bit.In the past year, I have stayed near 4 airports for one night: Orlando, LAX, Auckland, and now HNL. I would rate this hotel the lowest of the 4. And it was the most expensive at $155/night including tax. The stay near LAX was comparable but cost $100 with breakfast.

There is an outrigger hotel advertised at the airport for $20 more that probably would have been worth it. Ended up paying $170 for a night here, which is very overpriced for what we got, even at last minute. It's next to and practically under the highway!! Noise was pretty constant and creeping in through the old windows. Beds were way to small, I was to tired to think of asking for a king or queen after flying for 14 hours here, ended up with twins. Hotel showing it's age in some ways, but has had some updating. Shower worked , kind of, some water diverted to tub and shower head needed replacing. Restaurant was average, and expensive ($40 for a simple breakfast) like everything in Honolulu. Area around hotel seemed sketchy at night. 24 Hr free airport shuttle was nice. Maid was friendly and thanked us for our stay and said goodbye (more than I get from much more expensive hotels, she was showing the Aloha spirit!). They did not answer the phone when I called from the airport which was frustrating, I let it ring 20+ times, then called back later. Worst problem was NO temperature control, control was set at 80 but never got close, cold air was blowing in morning, we were cold at night as blankets were skimpy too.

Our second story King PoolView room could only be accessed by stairs, which was OK. This part of the hotel looked like a motel, with the doors facing outward toward a street. I was a bit skeptical of our room then opened the door and total surprise. Everything updated and very clean and new looking. Our large window of the room did over look the pool. It had a comfortable bed, nice furniture.The kids Double room was located in the tower and was accessible by elevator. I would highly recommend the tower if you have trouble walking upstairs. The tower has both Doubles and Kings. The Double room was clean, comfortable, and had a great view out the window (11th floor).

This hotel hit on both marks. The airport shuttle runs every 30 minutes and the drivers were very helpful (we used it twice, once to the airport, once the night before after dropping the car off at the airport).We had a room on the top (12th) floor. It was fine, though looked a tad old/dingy. Not so bad that I felt bad staying there, but enough that it was noticeable. The room overlooked the airport, and while there was some airplane noise, it was reasonably muffled. It's by an airport, so you can't expect miracles. It didn't disturb our sleep. The two double beds were fine, though seemed smaller than I'm used to. The room had a mini-fridge and a microwave, which is always handy.When I say it was cheap, that's ""Hawaii Cheap"". We paid about $140 for the night, which is not cheap by mainland standards, but in Honolulu it's very hard to find anything below $200/night, so I though this was a comparatively good deal.The parking garage, elevators, and bathrooms all felt small and cramped. Serviceable, but very tight. The staff at the front desk was friendly and helpful.Overall this wouldn't be my first choice in hotels, but as I said above, it met the needs I had for a one-night flight prep hotel, so I was satisfied overall. With a little room renovation, it's score could go up.","Hastings, Minnesota",16,3.0

First, when you get off a cruise ship on Saturday and need to fly out, it is going to cost you plenty. They know peope need to get bck to the mainland. Second, it is near the airport and has a freee shuttle running every half hour 24-7. Lastly because we sue BW regularly in our travels.The Lobby is lovely and the desk staff efficient. We were in our room in no time. This resort has obviouly had recent upgrades. Carpet, walls, bathroom were lovely. And we had a corner room on the back with lots of windows. Not much to look at except airport ancillary services but way better than listening to and looking at the FREEWAY. We had to wear our earplugs by the pool, just so we could think.( ask for a room way from the freeway!) Otherwise the pool was nice, plenty of chairs and fenced so kids can't wander out of sight.Probably not the best neighborhood for late night adventures, so we wandered out fairly early and ate real Chinese just down the block. Meals are also served in the cafe on site. The buffect looks enticing but bring your wallet and appetite. Just coming off a cruise ship, we didn't need that knid of temptation again. We were able to split breakfast, but beware that the 10% off your food purchase is not covered by your keycard. You HAVE to bring the coupon from the room. The girl even showed it to us, but couldn't (or wouldn't) allow us to use it, like some places do if you don't have a coupon ( like Kohl's). Even with proof of a key card.

To my surprise our experience was nothing like what the other guests reported. Our room was very clean, well appointed, quiet (we did ask for a room away from the freeway) and the bed was comfortable. I realize many more people write about a bad experience than a good one, we all expect for things to go well and when they do, we just take it for granted. That being said, it was VERY noisy when we were laying out by the pool and sleeping in a room that backs up to the freeway would be impossible without ear plugs. Maybe the hotel could provide them to guests that have those rooms.The other thing I must mention is two of the employees, Charae who works at the front desk was very helpful and friendly. She did everything she could to get the room we asked for at the back side of the hotel, suggested several good places to eat because the restaurant at the hotel wasn't open that day and did her job with a smile that made us feel welcome. Lorenzo was the shuttle driver, he handled our luggage, chatted with us on the drive and helped us figure out that time to catch the shuttle back to the airport the next morning. We arrived in plenty of time and was able to get a snack before getting on the plane.

This was a last minute decision based on the hotel's location to the airport (right outside the entrance) and Kaiser Hospital (about an 10 minute drive) where my brother was having triple bypass surgery. Even though they were ""technically"" sold out, they booked a room for me because of my circumstances. Greatly appreciated and they didn't have to do it.Once I got to the hotel, they upgraded me to a King/corner room on the 8th floor. The room was big, but dated and needed refurbishment. The wallpaper was coming off the wall in the bathroom and there was 1 shampoo, 1 lotion, and two small soaps for washing. The shower was hot and strong. There was a coffee maker with Kona coffee (yuck) and limited (and dated) sugar/creamer. I made coffee, but it didn't taste very good. The elevators are slow. Parking is discounted if you are a ""local."" Free WiFi everywhere, free local telephone calls, and newspapers. There's also a free shuttle to the airport.Their customer service is excellent though. Everyone was friendly, helpful, and went out of their way to try and help you have a nice stay. Hopefully, the hotel will get a refurbishment so these people can really sell their property. Unfortunately, good customer service doesn't necessarily equate to a great hotel experience. As the hotel is now, $199/night + taxes makes this hotel overpriced. I guess if you stay just one night because you have an early flight, it's okay and worth the price. But, for less, I can stay in town at the Ala Moana or the Hilton.I returned to the hotel at around 7 p.m. from the hospital and decided to eat in their restaurant. It was full (not because the food was good, but because the hotel was full of military families waiting to get back to their homes on base). I decided to wait. I was immediately seated . . . then, waited 20 minutes to order and another 15-20 minutes to get my food. I ordered the kalua pork with beans, fries, and cole slaw. The pork was good . . . everything else not so good. And, they were out of desserts. I felt as if I was in a cafeteria that served greasy fast food, not a hotel restaurant. Again, the wait staff was great and did their best, but it just didn't overcome the bad food and dining experience.Because I was in Honolulu to see my brother and not on vacation/holiday, my stay at the hotel was okay . . . only because the people were so friendly. If I had to stay here for a vacation, I would have left after the first night.","Wailea, Hawaii",80,3.0

I am military and just moved here while waiting on a house, the front desk crew are very familiar with the process for military which makes life much easier to get to your room and just relax. Housekeeping I will have to say is the best thing going about the hotel. Specifically my housekeeper Anna. She is second to none on politeness and attention to detail service of our room. She is very cordial and a very hard worker. I couldn't imagine that any other housekeeper here would be better, if so give that person and Anna a major raise, because Anna is outstanding. Room is always clean front to back, beds changed often, towels always nice and fresh, bathroom spic and span, and floor always clean. Again I am military so this is semi-luxury for me, but for you folks who have to have everything perfect then this place would be average for you at best. I don't think the hotel is bad at all, at least not that I have seen.

We declined, as we'd eaten on the plane. Our room was clean and comfortable. We needed to be back at the airport around 6:15AM and there is a free shuttle every 30 minutes -- everything went smooth as silk.

Granted. I didn't want to be here. I'd just come from a 4.5 star hotel. I was stuck in the airport and on a plane for 12+ hours. I just wanted to be home in my own bed. Flight delays left me stranded on Oahu, and I was put up at the Best Western Plaza. It's better than sleeping at the airport...I'll give it that. Situated under/next to Nimitz Highway, this is a NOISY location. It's close to the airport and I guess that's one of its big selling points. The staff were nice and seeing as I was stranded without a bag, they kindly gave me a toothbrush and toothpaste. It was 9 pm when I arrived...starving. I was informed their restaurant hadn't been open all day, and I could walk to the drive-in around the corner or ride the shuttle van to their 'sister' property. After dropping my carry-on in my room, I went back to the lobby only to be informed the restaurant at their sister property was not open. Since this is a review of the hotel, I won't go into details about the restaurant around the corner except to say it was a little creepy walking there alone. My room was, thankfully, on the backside of the hotel...further away from the highway. Although all signs indicated it was a non-smoking room, the room reeked of stale cigarette smoke. The carpet was stained. The sink had a dripping faucet and a piece that kept falling off every time I attempted to use it. I immediately turned off the a/c (too noisy and cold). Seeing as my room was on the second floor, I briefly considered sleeping with the sliding door open. Two things made me reconsider: First, the door to my room looked as though it might have been kicked in at some point in its life and the security bolt on the sliding door made me feel as though I wasn't in the safest of areas. Second, smokers tended to congregate in the area outside my sliding door and it was pretty clear the smoke would just blow right into my room. That said, I slept closed up in my room. I was thankful for the coffee maker. The microwave, although I didn't use it, was a nice addition to the room. The bed seemed clean and that was the most important thing; however, the room felt shabby.

My room and the staff at this hotel were excellent. The Location for the airport as well as ease to get to Waikiki Beach area is also great (Waikiki 45 minutes using ""The Bus"").Checked-in our room at 4 PM. Our room was on the corner of the building on the eleventh floor. Very large room with lots of windows and very clean. The view from our room over the city and harbor was fantastic. --The only issue for some might be the highways that run below that can be heard all night, but we sleep with a fan at home and this noise did not bother us at all.-- The room had a refrigerator, ironing board, iron, blow dryer, shampoo, body lotion and three bars of soap which I used. Also had a coffee pot, two chairs and desk. The airport shuttle leaves the hotel on the hour and half past the hour as advertised. We took the 5 AM shuttle to the airport with no problem. We were at our gate in less than 10 minutes from the airport and our gate was the last gate (United Airlines) at the airport.The night before leaving Honolulu we rode the city bus (The Bus) to Ala Moana shopping center on the north side of Waikiki. Several other guest at the bus stop were going to Wakiki beach area from the Best Western also. The bus was very easy to use and there was a bus stop in front of the Best Western Hotel. Coming back to the Best Western was just a matter of choosing a bus route number that had the Airplane symbol next to the route number on the front of the bus. Once I started seeing the car rental lots south of the Best Western I started looking for our hotel and pulled the cable in the bus to signal that I wanted to get off the bus. New to me because I am not familiar with how the bus system works because I am from a small town in Kansas. Across the street northwest of the hotel were several strip mall type fast food eating places less than two blocks away. We ate at Byron's next to the Best Western, but it is going out of business soon. Too bad because their food was excellent, but the other places looked good too. Also, United Airlines overbooked our flight an offerred a nice compensation for 6 passengers to take a later flight. We took the compensation and called the Best Western after we had checked out of our hotel and asked if we could get our room back to sleep three more hours before our rebooked flight. They let us have the room untill noon with no problem. Yes, I will be staying several nights at this hotel during my next visit to Waikiki / Honolulu. Price is much better than the Waikiki Beach hotels that I used and has more room.Thanks Best Western The Plaza Hotel for a great stay.RSW","Andover, Kansas",0,5.0

I would recommend any and all families to stay here while waiting for a house or looking for a place. Everyone from the staff at the front desk to the maintenance, restaurant staff and housekeepers are always nice, helpful, and make you feel right at home. Tysie & Mercy were our housekeepers and always made us feel super welcome. We see them every day and they always greet us with a smile and treat us like family. They really go above and beyond. Same for the ladies at the front desk too. One great thing about this hotel for military is their TLA program. Les is wonderfully helpful and such a valuable source of information while trying to figure out how to navigate the TLA/PCS process. They also offer a promisary note system, free parking and meal vouchers (pet rooms are available too) for the military PCS'ing and staying here. Definately give him a call and he will help you out! :)This hotel is one of two they own. The Ohana is the second. I highly recommend the Best Western over the Ohana. The Best Western had free internet (wifi), flat screen tv's, and free computer access in the lobby. There is also a shuttle between the two properties. If you are military and get the handy dandy meal vouchers, then you will love the restaurant here. We have been eating at both for a while now and strongly prefer the Best Western over the Ohana. The food here at the Best Western is better by far. The Ohana not so much. The wait staff here at the Best Western is the best as well. After only eating here 2 days they knew our preferences and were able to anticipate our wants/needs. The refridgerators and microwaves are a wonderful resource to have for breakfast or lunch type meals. The rooms are spacious so you have enough space to go to the store (recommend the commissary) and stock up to save money on meal costs. I really love how they have 2 connecting rooms available for the larger families. That was a huge plus for us when we were looking for places to stay in between. I could certainly go on and on about how this hotel is the best for the transitioning family! If I absolutely had to find something wrong to suggest something about this hotel, I would suggest that the rooms have a dvd player and the parking have a bit more room. If the hotel had a fitness center for early morning PT that would be great too but I hear they are working on that. There is tons of parking available always. That is nice to have here where parking can be limited at places. Overall, STAY HERE! Don't go anywhere else. You will wish you were here with all the wonderful amenities and friendly staff they have!!Oh, as far as noise complaints due to being conveniently located right by the highway, if you've ever lived in a city then the noise really doesn't bother you because it's normal city noise.","Honolulu, Hawaii",7,5.0

We had the standard king the second time and just this past week, as well. We chose to stay here because we had a pleasant stay the first two times and of the convenience of hopping on the freeway to visit family who are within 15 minutes from the airport. Our room was on the tenth floor with views of the mountains. As in previous stays, housekeeping services and front desk were accommodating and friendly. So why only a 2 star this time?Granted this room was only a standard king, but in much need of TLC. Two of three lamp shades could not be 'affixed' and were lopsided because the screw-in attachment was brokenoff or stripped. The table leg had a major vertical crack that they attempted to fix with two screws. Adjustment on shower head was poor. Okay, so door jambs do get dinged up from suitcases, etc, but major dinging needs some major painting.The plus side: Comfortable beds; nearby eateries that are walking distance. Starbucks, bbq, Big Kahuna pizza (gotta try their kalua pork pizza...awesome!), Byron's drive-in (open 24 hrs).There are only two hotels at the airport and after this third stay it is sad to say that we're surprised that the city, who is pro-tourism, does not offer a higher-end airport hotel.

The check-in staff were surly and not apologetic as they stated there were no queen or king beds available yet we had made reservations for 2 rooms (queen or king bed) back in July 25, 2012. When we insisted, they found one room with a King for our 2-nights stay but only a double for my sister and husband for their 1 night stay. Our door key-cards would not work, meant a trip back down in the only working elevator to be recoded. Our King room was on the top floor right beside the freeway ramp. The cars/buses/motorcycles were whizzing by and actually rattling the windows. Back down in the elevator to ask for another room and surprise, the new room (6th floor) had a queen bed (which the surly staff had earlier stated, there were none) and thankfully was much quieter. Unfortunately, the bathtub and shower were unacceptable.The tub drain was plugged and would not empty plus the shower head was partially blocked. Mildew on the grout and shower/bath seams, under the edges of the badly stained bath rubber piece which should have been securely adhered to the bottom of the tub and rusty tub fixtures. The room was fairly clean, but aged furniture, wallpaper and in need of a facelift. The one great experience we had with this location was our dining experience. The attached dining area provided a welcoming and attentive staff, many meal choices and well prepared/presented entrees.

There was a small microwave and fridge. The tub/shower had the newer style rounded shower rod but there were black spots of mold along the grouting. The king size mattress was by far the softest, least supportive mattress I've ever had the displeasure to sleep on. You can sit on the edge and almost slide off!

The first problem wasa few hours before we checked out when we asked the front desk if they could store our bags so that we could do a bit of shopping before our flight which was 6 hours away. The 'wonderful', lady on the front desk then told us it would cost us another $75 dollars as we would have to pay for a later checkout time!! $75 to store our bags?? We weren't even going to be there!! All that this 'wonderful' lady had to say to it was ""oh well, at least you will be able to have a nice hot shower after your shopping"" What the??!! We made a phonecall to the manager and he told us to stay the entire day at no extra cost which would have been excellent if he had told the front desk, so more hassles about cost when we checked out for good. We later went back to our room after shopping and we had been locked out of it!!!! Another trip to the front desk! The 2nd problem was ordering breakfast. We showed ourselves to our seats as none of the staff bothered, sat down and waited. And waited. No menu to peruse, so we waited some more before one of us got up went to a staff member and asked for one. The breakfast was really small and we are not even big eaters. I asked for the cereal and fruit and a tiny little bowl of rice crispies (honestly approx 7 spoonfuls) came along with a tiny serving of fruit (about another 8 cubes!). My husband asked for the cooked breakfast and had 3 slices of sausage on his plate, an egg and 2 tiny tomatoes, fried. It was expensive. We were still hungry so we walked to the local supermarket and bought extra. On the good side, the beds were comfortable (although there was dried food on the floor between the bed and the bedside table). The bathroom was okay, but the bath was a little rusty and the bottom of the bathroom door was warped from being wet and hard to shut, no jug, only a coffee maker which you had to use in the bathroom, the hairdryer was ok, the fridge was very handy to have and the tv was good. Very noisy as it is directly under and next to the highway, but we had ear plugs when sleeping so it was okay. The convenience to the airport is great and is what you obviously pay for as it's only a 5-minute journey, the man driving us there and dealing with our bags was friendly and helpful - much more so than the front desk.

Our plane had been delayed hours, and we had been traveling over a day. We were dead. It made more sense to stay somewhere close to the airport since we were flying out to the Big Island early the next morning. That being said, we were awake enough to be shocked by our surroundings. The hotel is located UNDER a massive freeway. You will hear it...see it...smell it....don't expect to get away from it. The rooms are standard (perhaps substandard....it depends on what class of hotel you are used to staying in). Double, generic beds... there were a couple small holes in our sheets. Tacky, stereotypical Hawaiian ukeleles and flowered patterns for curtains and framed pictures in the room. The shower seemed nice, considering (but that's probably not saying much considering I would have bathed in a watering hole had that been my only option). The elevators were covered with what looked like heavy blue blankets (hanging on the walls) for some inexplicable reason. There was a small shop downstairs, a gift shop, that sold a variety of goods. The food was insanely expensive, even for Hawaii. One little cardboard carton of milk (you know, the small individual size like in school lunches) was $2.50! Don't even get me started on the cereal. We even found they stocked expired chap stick! I will say that I bought a great pair of sunglasses there, that I still own to this day and wear everywhere, despite their exotic bight blue and yellow hues. I will also give credit to this hotel's pool. While very small, it was clean. I never actually got in it, but I did eat my breakfast laying out by the pool, and it was easily the best thing about the hotel. Another pro is that it is located near the airport (not within walking distance though, mind you, as one man tried to tell us...) and they have a convenient airport shuttle. Ultimately, this place is DOABLE if you are here for a business trip and will not be in the room much, or need a place to crash for a few hours before your flight leaves. If you are looking to travel to Hawaii (leisure trip) and don't want to spend a fortune.....keep looking. This is not the place. This may be cheap, but it certainly isn't showcasing Hawaii and it's in the middle of nowhere. There are other hotels that are affordable that still offer a pleasant experience. If you can't afford Waikiki, check out Kanoehe, the North Shore, etc. Oahu has better.Good luck with your search!","South Bend, Indiana",16,2.0

We just had a one night layover before continuing on to another island. I read the reviews and decided this one looked like the best of the three options in this area. I called them directly and was able to get a corporate rate which was considerably less than the published rate. The front staff were very polite.The lobby is a typical 3*, but small. The elevators are old, and the entire place looks like its been here since WW2. The room is sparsly furnished. We had a king bed, and comfort level was about 4/10. Pillows are horrible and lumpy. Little square things and only 2 per person. There were no extra pillows or blankets in the room. The thermostat was fixed and could not be changed. I'm sensitive to a/c and prefer my room to be a bit warmer. It was however, a comfortable sleeping temp, but I didn't like the a/c blowing on me all night. This place is a firetrap with wiring. The plugins look old and worn. When I went to plug in my electronics there was a spark and a zap. I suspect the wiring is very dated and looking for trouble. The bathroom is so tiny, you can't even sit down on the toilet properly because the door is either right beside you, or you have to squeeze between the toilet and the sink to close the door. Few pics on the wall. Ugly green carpeting and the rooms and walls definitely need a paint job. This hotel is right by a major highway, so even though we were on the 7th floor, we heard highway noise all night. Overall, we got about 4 hours of sleep.The restaurant (actually a coffee shop) is horribly overpriced. $14 for breakfast or $31 for weekend buffet. You can walk down the street to a fabulous diner and get meals for under $5 (by the Chevron station); or walk across the street from the Chevron and there is a plaza that includes Starbucks, a sushi restaurant, and a Hawaiian BBQ restaurant. We chose the latter and had burger and fries for 2 for $12. Breakfast of spam and eggs runs around $3 pp. I'm sure there are other places in the area, but that's all the time we had to explore.I noted that the city buses stop right close to the hotel, so that would be a bonus for people not wanting to rent a car.I noted that the army puts their people up here, so I guess its adequate for them.Personally I will never stay here again.

The photos on this site are fairly misleading. It's actually a pretty small hotel with many floors making up the parking garage. The rooms are modest but adequate. I did appreciate there being a fridge and microwave available in my room. The air and street traffic aren't terrible at night (note: I was on the top floor so I don't know how lower floors fare) but the walls are very thin and you will hear your neighbors if they aren't the quiet sort. The staff is extremely friendly and my room was maintained very well.The hotel shop is well stocked with pretty much anything you'd need, including an impressive array of alcohol. The shop selection is invaluable great because the area outside the hotel is too sketchy for a single woman to walk alone. I witnessed a car pull over and solicit a woman...after that incident, I made it a point to not go outside after dark. If you do need to get out of the hotel, there's a small shopping strip nearby with a Starbucks, Jumba Juice, L&L, etc. Beyond that, you're pretty limited.In summary, the hotel is what I'd expect from a budget airport hotel.

There is a small convenience store in the lobby, a pool (which we didn't use), and check in and check out were quick and uneventful. The price, especially with our AAA discount, was very reasonable. The largest drawback was the noise. We stayed on the 12th floor, which is the top floor, but the traffic noise (even at 2-3am) was bad even with the A/C on full blast as the property is located directly adjacent to Nimitz Highway, which seems to have a constant flow of trucks, cars, and buses travelling at high speeds at all hours.

The surrounding streets are a bit industrial, but given that there is a lot of military housing, and shuttle bus traffic etc, I didn't feel that unsafe as a single woman traveller. Of course, not all women would feel safe if they are unused to travelling alone. The room did feel a bit humid, the carpet had a sticky spot, and the bathroom was fine if you didn't look too closely! No bedbugs to report thank goodness. Sure, most airport hotels in other cities are better value with newer rooms.

Our late arrival meant no food on-site, but heck we had quite sufficient on the 9 hour flight there.The room was spacious with modest sized twin beds. Good air conditioning, perhaps a little noisy. The bathroom was a little old fashioned but everything worked well and there was adequate towels (a little thin perhaps), soaps and shampoos. There was some continual noise from the adjacent elevated, and other, highways. But to tell you the truth we didn't notice it - but we were dog tired. The booked alarm call came on time.

The two advantages of this hotel's positions are the airport, of course, and also the proximity to Arizona memorial and Pearl Harbour, that you can reach by 10 minutes bus ride. The hotel itself is nothing special, the rooms are minimal, there is no AC, no restaurant, there are also very few places to eat nearby (fast foods).If you want to go and visit Waikiki you have to take a taxi (35 $) or the bus, that is cheaper but takes a really long time!

The room was large but sparsely decorated - it would not have hurt to put a sofa our something like that in there. The hotel is close to the highway so it was possible to hear cars passing by.I would assume that being high up (and facing away from the highway) shields some of the noise. Most standard things were provided in the room such as TV, fridge, free wifi, and a coffee maker. I was missing mainly missing a water kettle to be able to make tea but other than that everything needed was in the room. The bed was comfortable enough (granted I was so tired so I would probably have been able to go to sleep on the floor), there was a small desk and an additional table. The hotel is good enough for one night if leaving early or arriving late but I would not go here otherwise as the area is not very interesting.","Stockholm, Sweden",178,3.0

Bathroom with lots of supplies, separate makeup area for the wife, and a couch for packing and staging. The next morning the luggage was back on the shuttle and we were on our way, no muss no fuss.Although we weren't hungry, there are several restaurants within less than one block if you want to eat.

Before the first night was over, I downgraded that to a single night and made reservations for the other 4 nights at another hotel.I made reservations here because of an impending move off-island, and did not want to deal with high prices and traffic from Waikiki, where almost every hotel on Oahu is located.All pet-friendly rooms are in the ""old"" part of the hotel. Not the fancy tower you see in the picture, but an old, two-story motel-looking structure right next to H-1, the busiest freeway on Oahu. The rooms have nearly zero sound silencing ability and the noise kept us up all night. The rooms were incredibly small. We were led to believe we would be given either 2 queens or 1 king w/ a pull-out sofa or rollaway bed plus a rollaway crib for myself, my wife and two children, but all pet rooms are tiny 2-Double rooms that did not even have enough space to fit a rollaway crib, and we had to climb over our luggage to get to the 2nd bed as there was no real storage. Because we couldn't fit the rollaway, my 18 month old daughter had to sleep on the floor in a makeshift bed of blankets between our double beds and our luggage so she wouldn't roll off the bed.The beds were far from amazing, and the rooms were in poor condition, with mildew in the bathroom.The staff was very friendly and wanted to be helpful, but because we had a dog, they would not offer us a larger room in the main tower. They then tried to move us to their sister hotel, the Ohana, but their pet rooms were identical, as the two hotels are practically the same thing.The rooms all come standard with a microwave and mini-fridge, but no other ""frills"". There was a ""barbecue area"" next to the pool, but no grills in sight. Maybe they were in a storage room? All I saw were benches and butt cans. There was also advertised a small ""play area"" for the kids, but when I was there, the play equipment had been removed, leaving only the rubber matting. What??This ""pet friendly"" hotel also adds $50 a night non-refundable pet fee (a fairly standard price on Oahu) to allow you to keep your pet in their ghetto old rooms.

What better place to come than Hawaii? Or so we thought....We checked in with the front desk, who were very helpful, but that may be the hotel's only redeeming quality. After walking into the room, we realized that Nimitz highway was immediately to our right outside the window. Within a weak stone's throw. To our left? Honolulu international. This would have been tolerable had the windows not sounded like they were open....all the time! It sounds like they're expanding the highway with a new exit- our room. The sound is constant, never gives up. The room has a 1970's feel to it. That must be a part of their ""recent"" renovations. Which brings me to our next experience. About 3 power outlets in the room, one of which is in the bathroom, where we had to charge phones.....I will say, that Best Western provided us with a wonderful microwave, and fridge. They were both located below the TV in a cabinet. Upon further review, they were plugged into a power strip behind the TV unit along with enough plugs to fill the power strip. We left the doors of the cabinet open, just to ensure it didn't get too hot for the fridge and microwave. Ready for a comfortable night's sleep? The beds are misleading. They lure you in with a picture perfect made bed (which is another redeeming quality...Thanks Soledad!) But I digress. Although the room gives off a 1970's vibe, the air conditioning shouldn't give off that same vibe. We cranked the AC to approximately 50- to get it nice and cold. Unfortunately, the temperature in the room was a balmy 75- TWO DAYS LATER! So the shower- I don't know about you, but I enjoy keeping up with daily hygiene. Best Western made it difficult without getting either burned, or frostbite by the all over the walls temperature. I can deal with one or the other (in a perfect world absolutely not) but to fluctuate so much is insane!What's next? If you're looking for a centrally located hotel, you got it. Centrally located in the locally acclaimed ""nice ghetto"". Although it is wonderfully close to the airport (.6 miles, yes .6; not 6 miles), it is terribly far from anywhere I don't feel like I'm going to get shanked. Step into my office for a side story-We ventured out onto the streets (Nimitz Highway- great) to try to get food- a basic need. On our approach to Byron's, we realize that not only are we the minority, but we are just waiting to be front page news- ""Two Tourists die in Fast Food Stabbing"" I can see it now. So we move on- trying to find the near shopping plaza with a buffet. Upon walking about 50 feet, we realize that people are coming out of the woodwork, clearly not liking our presence; so we sprint to our room to get our car keys and drive. To all the other reviews; I completely do not understand your logic or thought process. If you get here late one night and need to leave early the next morning, don't want sleep, or sleeping on the highway, like the thrill of possibly getting stabbed, sweating profusely in your sleep. This place is for you. Other than that, absolutely never again!","Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii",1,1.0

Since I had seen noise complaints and reports of bedbugs from last fall, I emailed the hotel to request a quiet and pest-free room. The manager was very gracious and assured me this would be taken care of. I booked a deluxe king which anywhere else might be about 2/3 the price but as there's not much competition at HNL it was a little pricey at $120. When we arrived, the front desk staff were very gracious - Lance and Cynthia helped us with getting our room situated, answered our questions about the shuttle etc. We got to the room and it was quiet and very spacious. VERY obviously new clean sheets and new shower curtain which we were very happy about. There's a fridge and microwave in all rooms. We had an early dinner in the restaurant - it is open weekends only. Others have complained about the quality and price of the food but honestly, Honolulu restaurants are expensive and for an airport place especially we thought it had a good range of choices. There was a seafood buffet for $28 all you can eat but we don't eat seafood. The seafood did look and smell good. We had spaghetti and a chicken burrito. Our server, Sharon was one of the highlights of our trip. Because we don't eat seafood and couldn't do the buffet she brought us rolls and salad, and some rice for me, that weren't really included with our meals.The spaghetti was good and burrito was more like a fajita with a nice spicy sauce. We were pretty satisfied. There is a Byrons Drive in Next door if you wanted burgers etc. Don't know about prices etc. Our bed was comfortable but we did wake up several times with a screaming family of children, I'm guessing ""Army brats"" whose parents had obviously let the kids take over one room so the adults could get some sleep. We had to tell them several times to be quiet which really really spoiled our sleep. I was kind of surprised the next morning at 5 AM when I complained that the front desk didn't offer to comp our meal or something. It's not their fault but it did ruin our night. All in all I was Ok with our stay. We try to avoid Best Westerns, to be honest, and this one seemed at least newly renovated in the more expensive room category and fairly quiet too. I was VERY concerned about bedbugs and am a little concerned that there was a more recent complaint than the one I'd seen from last fall. My experience with contacting them beforehand was that the manager did his best to get us a clean, quiet room so I was very happy that he was so responsive. Oh yeah parking is $20 a night so do what we did - return your car to HNL and take the free shuttle to the hotel and back. I'd say the staff make this hotel better than it might otherwise be.

I contacted the hotel to advise and when I received a call back was patronized, and treated as though this complaint was frivolous. I was advised that they had a very strict policy, that they checked the room and that if I was really persisent they would return his room for the night but that was because they were being nice, not because he was eaten alive. Which still hasn't happened , by the way.I was advised that perhaps it was the hotel he stayed at the other ten nights. I attempted to explain that in those 10 days he was not biten once and arrived at this hotel without any bites. I was advised that bites can come out 14 days after a person has been biten and I must be mistaken!!!!!I was asked several times whether or not I was happy to be called back and if calling me back to advise the room was checked was satisfying enough....There was no concern, no compassion and definetely did not care that this complaint had come in.We travel numerous times a year and the majority of those are to third world countries, where we have never come across bedbugs or attitudes such as the one I dealth with.

We had a flight first thing the next morning to travel to the Big Island and we knew we knew after our long days of flights from the Midwest US (not to mention getting married a couple days before!) we would be exhausted. We booked this hotel with convenience and practicality in mind. We didn't want to spend too much on a room we'd only see for one short evening, something close to the airport that would be safe and comfortable without any expensive bells & whistles. This was exactly what we needed. I would not have chosen this hotel for a romantic getaway - it's close to the airport and highway, not much of a view, a little outdated, very busy, etc. However, the staff were very friendly (especially the FREE shuttle drivers!!!!) and while our room was a little oddly situated we found it clean and comfortable enough for our night passing through. Getting to the hotel was no problem and the driver was nice enough to visit with us and give us good helpful advice on getting to our flight the next morning. Check-in/check-out was easy, and it was helpful to have a little convenience store on-site for drinks and snacks. The bathroom was not that super but this was a very inexpensive hotel for the area.I would not reccomend the hotel restaurant. We were shuttled to another Best Western. We figured that (like our room) it would be a fast, easy way to have a simple meal before we crashed. It wasn't terrible but there was a pretty long wait for our table, and we both felt the food was a little overpriced considering we didn't like the food all that much and the service was average... My only real complaint - While we stayed in the the staff was very nice and helpful. However, during our visit we realized we'd lost a luggage lock. We stopped by the hotel before leaving Hawaii just to ask if they had a lost and found. My husband said that when he ran inside to ask, the person at the desk that day seemed not only to have no idea what to do/where to look but also didn't seem to care.

He was very nice, unassuming, helped us load our bags, and wanted to make sure we were getting where we should be going.Before writing the rest of this review, let me just say I've stayed in other Best Westerns and understand that while they are not 5 star first class accommodations, they are typically comfortable, a good value, safe, clean, and friendly.This hotel is right off the freeway, well, right below the highway, and with rooms opening to the outside, it made for a very noisy walk to our room. The lighting of the walkways was quite poor and for a weary traveler, it made me nervous to be walking outside, around corners alone. Once inside the room, the noise from the roads was very well blocked, but some of that was from the modified window unit air conditioner that blew cold air but made you worry that it was going to leak onto your belongings.The room itself was fairly larger than expected, but a lot of space was taken up with oversized furnishings that wasn't needed. The bed was more comfortable than you would expect, but don't plan on flipping through the channels you would get at better hotels -- there aren't many channels to choose from. Because we had been stranded for an extra night without our bags, we were relying on the toiletries provided in the room. These were extremely limited and sparse. There was a small bar of hand soap, a tiny (smaller than you would usually find in hotels) bottle of shampoo, and the same sized bottle of hand lotion. Tada, seriously that was it. There was a sign saying that the front desk would happily provide any personal items guests may have forgotten so we went down to the front desk to ask for conditioner and toothpaste. The front desk staff told us it would be sent up to our room right away. It never did show up. Every other Best Western I've stayed in has offered their guests a pretty good continental breakfast for free. The only breakfast this BW offered was one you could purchase in their on site restaurant and from our experience as a whole there, the restaurant was not something we wanted to add to our experience. Then, when checking out, the staff seemed to have better things to do than practice customer service or ""service with a smile."" The front staff was very flat and curt. The shuttle driver loaded our things onto the shuttle, allowed us to load, and then hopped off and walked away for about 5 minutes. We were glad that we weren't in a rush to get to the airport.Overall, the service staff isn't really hit or miss, it's just pretty much miss except for a couple of very nice staff members including the darling man who drove our late night shuttle from the airport. We wouldn't really recommend staying here unless you were stranded unexpectedly late at night like we were. We didn't feel safe, felt like the money spent wasn't worth what we got, and would not recommend it to others. There were several servicemen staying there and I felt bad that the men serving our country and protecting us were having to stay there.","Honolulu, Hawaii",5,2.0

We are military residents of Oahu, and needed somewhere to stay with our two cats while our home was treated for termites. We received a military special package: our room (2nd floor poolside), parking, 5PM late check-out, and the fee for one pet for $145 before taxes. We felt that rate was very fair. Paid an additional $20 for the second cat we brought (we foster for a rescue group). The positives: the room was nicely decorated, we had a nice selection of TV channels, the king bed was comfy, and there was a large selection of fluffy pillows. Also, lots of towels readily available and plenty of storage space. Even with two adults and two cats, we felt we had plenty of room. The curtains across the window were great for providing an almost night-like effect, which was great, since my husband works night shifts. The room wasn't too noisy--not a lot of activity at the pool. The room air conditioner was quick at cooling down the room and kept it at a great temperature. We were able to get parking right in front of our room, and there was a diner within 10 feet for a quick greasy snack (Byron's Drive Inn).The negatives: The room air conditioner was not properly attached to the wall, and several layers of plastic grates fell to the ground loudly in the middle of the night. The nonsmoking room smelled of cigarette smoke when we first entered, although a few quick spritzes of perfume got rid of it. The wired internet in our room did not work, but we were able to pick up the wireless signal from the lobby, although it dropped in and out pretty frequently. Also, a little gross--our kitties began playing with something on the floor, and when I took it from them, I realized it was a large chunk of fingernail or toenail. Found a few more of these gems around the carpet. Room had no ""do not disturb"" sign, so we had to call down to the front desk for one (didn't want housekeeping to come in and startle/lose our cats). The sign was at our door in less than 5 minutes. I shared my concerns with Cherae at the front desk upon checkout, and she graciously offered to remove the additional $20 pet fee we had paid and was very apologetic for the inconveniences. I was very disappointed with our stay this time, since we had stayed here in June and had a great experience. I would advise you to stick to the main tower building and avoid the pet/poolside rooms if you can, as those seem to be in need of some TLC.","Honolulu, Hawaii",29,3.0

The primary reason we chose this hotel is because it was pet friendly and we were moving to the island and had our dogs with us. Possibly my view is a bit more relaxed because it is so hard to find a pet friendly hotel in Oahu. The room was renovated, but had an old a/c window unit that was loud and was situated over the desk area where the intermittant internet cable was located. There is not much of a variety of cable channels on the tv. Now keep in mind that I was not on vacation and was spending more time in the room that the vacation travel would have. The tub drained really slow too. Housekeeping was friendly. The front desk seemed a bit overwhelmed at times. Parking was available but kind of tight spaces. Its an airport hotel so that tells you what you need to know about the location. It is industrial and does not have that vacation feel about it. That being said, I pretty much sucked it up and dealt with it because I could have my whole family there with me and that included the dogs. However, when our housing fell through and we realized we would be staying in a hotel longer than expected my DH decided he couldn't take it here any longer. Fortunately, we found a pet friendly hotel that we loved that was closer to Waikiki. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for the vacation of a lifetime at all. If you are on a budget then fine or needing a place close to the airport for a night or two then fine.

Unfortunately, that means a business district, ugly views and insane distance to walk anywhere, but the airport. That would not bug me as much, as the two ""episodes"" I had with receptionists. First was on our first trip in December, when someone screwed with our departure date and all of our card-keys stopped working. Instead of admitting a human error, I was lectured about having my key near to cellphone, or other strong radio/magnetic field. Well, there was none, not for all the cards, especially when we left (forgot) one card in our car. Because I am an IT guy and I KNOW how these things work, because I service them for our company's clients, I was pissed, but swallowed it. It insulted me to be lied to in the face, but I told myself to cool down and enjoy the vacation.Second thing was, when my in-room internet stopped working. Being an IT guy, I have tried everything possible, except the last thing - trying different cable. I went down to reception, asking them if they have a spare. Instead of being told ""no"" first, I was told by the receptionist in a strict tone, that I have to return with the cable to my room. On the second try, the receptionist told me, that they don't have any spare. So I asked, if it would be possible to go to another free room and borrow a cable from there, just for a test sake. She told me, that she has to check with the security... ""WTF, why security?"" I asked myself, but maybe in this country you need a security guard to fetch you a TP cable, whatever. Woulnd't matter to me as long as I would got the cable. But the receptionist answer was after a while, that the security will not touch any internet cable in other vacant rooms, due to liability issues. LIABILITY ISSUES? It is a stupid piece of twist pair cable, with no identifiable markings on it, it is simple to remove and put in, unless you are a retarded monkey, because common monkey could do it. So I am pissed, writing from a slow lobby connection, unable to send my photos home, unable to solve my e-mails, stranded and sleepless with the receptionist. The internet here is slow, sometimes crawling, my cellphone is faster, hell, my smart watch are faster that that! :/ But I can live with it, as long as my photos get sent home overnight... Which is not going to happen now, because I am not spending my night in the lobby, being aggressive and silent threat, pondering about human lazyness, inteligence or lack thereof, and ability to not make any unnecessary actions on behalf of the hotel's clients...The bottom line is - LIMIT YOUR STAY AT THE HOTEL TO THE MINIMUM TIME POSSIBLE, it is not bad hotel all and all, but the service is terrible.

Rooms were clean2. Beds were comfortable3. Staff was smiling and helpfulThe Bad:Problem 1: Welcome to Hawaii, unless you smoke.If you smoke you are discriminated against at every turn.Smokers are forced take an elevator to sit or stand in unprotected areas to have a cigarette, regardless of wind, rain, or mosquitoes.There is one area (P5) that is in the parking structure protected from rain, but is subject to fumes from cars exhaust, gasoline and oil, hardly an equitable situation.During my stay I incurred 11 mosquito bites, and you can rest assured that if I come down with any disease from those mosquito bites I will be suing Best Western Plaza Hotel and the State of Hawaii for medical bills, discrimination, and distress (disease incurred from mosquito bites, anger at being subjected to mosquitoes in the first place, irritation at being treated like a leper, and the three weeks of itching since then).While non smokers do have the right to not be subjected to cigarette smoke, smokers also have the right not to be subjected to the elements and disease carrying insects.To treat half of your guests like this simply because they smoke is ridiculous and unfair, and leaves you open to lawsuits if a guest becomes diseased due to being forced to go into mosquito infested open air areas just to have a cigarette.Solutions to Problem 1:A. Best Solution - Provide a smoking lounge on each floor with adequate ventilation fans that remove smoke from the air, comfortable couches and chairs, small tables and ashtrays, wastebaskets and a TV. This will allow guests a very comfortable place on each floor to smoke away from non smokers, yet still be protected from the elements and disease carrying insects, just like your non smoking guests enjoy.It would also eliminate the necessity for guests to take an elevator each time they want a cigarette, resulting in all guests being happy, instead of just the half that don’t smoke being happy while the guests who do smoke being irritated and unhappy.Oh, and it would also negate the possibility of lawsuits resulting from disease incurred while being forced to stand in a cloud of mosquitoes to smoke.B. Adequate Solution - Provide covered screen enclosed balconies on each floor with chairs or benches, cigarette disposal units or ashtrays, and wastebaskets.This will allow guests a semi comfortable place to smoke away from non smokers, while protecting them from rain and disease carrying insects.There would still be wind, which would act as ventilation for the smoking balconies, but smoking guests would not have to take an elevator, or be rained on, or be bitten by mosquitoes.This solution also negates the possibility of lawsuit due to disease contracted from being forced to feed mosquitoes while having a smoke.Problem 2:Rooms in the front part of the hotel are subject to loud noise from the freeway.Cars, motorcycles and trucks go by all night, making it impossible to sleep.After the first night I had to check out several rooms before I found one quiet enough to allow me to sleep all night.Solution to Problem 2:Invest in double paned windows and foam wall insulation in all noisy rooms.Problem 3:Newsprint cleverly disguised as toilet paper had me bleeding so badly that I had to resort to using washcloths, which I am certain disgusted the maids as much as it disgusted me.Solution to Problem 3:At $130.00 per night you can certainly afford to provide toilet paper that is softer than 220 grit sandpaper.Problem 4:Water temperature in the shower constantly fluctuated every 10 seconds between burning hot and freezing cold.There was no comfortable or consistent water temperature in the shower at all.Solution to Problem 4:Call a plumber.Problem 5:TV in room on 6th floor has no sound on half of the channels.Solution to Problem 5:Call a TV repair man.Problem 6:Hallway on 11th floor smells like wet dog.Made me gag every time I walked in.Solution to Problem 6:Shampoo carpet until smell is gone.Problem 7:Beds are made like burritos.Sheets and blankets are tucked in all around making it necessary for the guest to unmake the bed and then tuck the bottom sheet back in before being able to go to bed.People like me with medical conditions have difficulty with this chore, and to have to do it every day is irritating and simply exhausting for us.I ended up having to write a note for the maid to please not make the bed.Solution to Problem 7:Tuck only the bottom sheet under the mattress, allow top sheet and blanket to simply drape over the end and sides of the bed.The Bottom Line:I will be staying at the Marriot from now on.Final Note:I hope that bringing these problems to your attention and offering solutions to these problems will prompt you to improve these situations so your future guests will have a much more pleasant stay at your hotel and actually wish to return.Mahalo",Kaneohe,0,2.0

We arrived after 11 hours on the airplane and the hotel shuttle transported us to the hotel with no fuss or problem.

The emergency room doctor fitted him with a brace to limit the knee movement and sent him on his way with crutches and a request that he see a specialist.) We had no time for that! Therefore, I needed to change my reservation to a room set up for a person with disabilities. (No bathtub, just a shower) This hotel accommodated our needs at the last minute. The driver of the van took care of the luggage also getting it to our room. Our friends stayed in a corner room, which was larger than ours with windows on two sides. Their room was clean and comfortable as well.Our room was nice, clean, and met our needs. We felt safe, welcomed, and respected. We appreciate what was done at the last minute to help us have a restful stay before we flew out to Kauai. The room was on the 6th floor but road noise was not a problem as noted in other posts.We only ate breakfast at the hotel and it was as we requested. The price was not out of line with other urban hotels. I read many reviews before we made the decision to stay here. I realize some were unhappy with the hotel. We were very happy with our stay. We will stay at this hotel on our return to Honolulu and the final leg of our vacation. This is a fine hotel to stay overnight. It is not a resort but matches “Marriott Courtyard” and is so convenient to the airport. No big taxi fee!Even with the crutches and knee brace, we went into Waikiki for a day on “The Bus” As a travel note… It would be good to recognize landmarks from the hotel is on the way out, so you can find it in the dark later. However, the bus driver was gracious and told us when to get off. We found Waikiki interesting and expensive so a one-day visit was enough.

Waikiki Beach is about 25 minutes away. Good location for military personnel. Pearl Harbor Naval Base and Hickam AFB is about 10 minutes away.Value: In my opinion, the $109 a night I paid for this room night was too expensive. I consider this property comparable to a Days Inn or Super 8. For this type of room and industrial location, room rate should be between $75 to $89. Parking a car is an additional $10 per night. A FREE 24-hour airport shuttle is available.Rooms: Room we had was a perfect rectangle shape room with ample space for 3 people.Sleep Quality: Poor, in addition to the airport being close by, the Airport Viaduct Freeway is a mere 20 yards away from the building. So, please bring earplugs if you plan on sleeping.Another issue is Security. Parking Garage and Guest Room access use the same elevator. So basically, anyone can pull into the garage, hop into the elevator and press any button above 5 and your immediately in the Guest Room corridor.

Also, we found the rooms clean so no problems there. Otherwise, aside from the shuttle driver don't expect good service as the people there are slow and apathetic. Plus, no free breakfast and the Wi Fi in our room was pretty much unusable on one of the nights we were there (apparently because there were too many people using it so there was nothing they could do). I should add that the downside of the location is that is right on the freeway so you do get some traffic noise but we found it wasn't too intrusive, especially on the second night when our room was higher up on the ninth floor.

The receptionist simply grunted at us and gave us our room key. Up on the 20th floor the rooms are nicely decorated and on first impressions we thought we'd chosen a decent enough room to get us through the night. However, as the temperature of the room could only be described as freezing I tried to turn the air-con off but found that I couldn't! Not only was it freezing but it was also very loud for a bedroom system. We called for maintenance to come and investigate it but were told on their arrival that because the hotel has one large system it can not be turned off. Instead he opened the vents wider (to stop the rattling noise) which only made the temperature colder. We then requested that we had a different room, where the air-con was quiter, only be moved to another one with the same problem. We were then told that they had no other rooms available before we were eventually told that we could move again to another room situated in an annex near the pool which had a separate air-con system which could be turned off. To my relief this was indeed the case. However, the room which clearly was an ex-smoking room and was rather tired and quite dirty was situated right under the Nimitz Highway which links the main H1 highway across the island and so the noise was even worse than in the main building! By this point we kind of gave up as we only had 5 hours before we had to get up and so decided to use the hotels free computer at reception to pre-check-in for our flights. Unfortunately the computer wasn't working either and so we had to get up even earlier to manually check-in at the airport. I'm not normally one to complain and may have just put up with the first room had the staff not been so unfriendly and unhelpful with us. We had even paid for a 'deluxe' room in order to finish what was a fantastic trip to Hawaii on a high, however, we both feel completely ripped-off and disappointed with this Best Western hotel and will never stay at one of there branded changes again, due to fear that we will have another expensive horrible night awake!

But next time, I would rather go 1/2 hour away to Waikiki and stay at some place more decent - although will cost me more - hotel and taxi.Hotel is just OK.

It was midnight and we decided to stay close to the airport. After renting our car for the next day, the attendant recommended that we stay at the Best Western Plaza near the airport, since it was clean and nice. Since we could think of many hotels from this chain in our own city that were nice, we decided to stay here. That was a big mistake. This hotel is nearly impossible to get to because it's under the freeway so you can't see it when you exit the airport and you're looking everywhere for it. There were like 3 rooms left when we got there. We got to the room and were shocked. Our main problems with the room were 1. smokey smell, 2. three burnt out lightbulbs, 3. disgusting bathroom (I couldn't take a shower like I had planned), 4. carpet with so many stains on it that you'd think they made the pattern on it, 5. a coffeemaker that leaked coffee all over the counter when in use, and worst of all, 6. the inability to sleep due to the fact that it's 20 feet from a major highway. I remember telling myself they should just demo this entire place and build a new building if they plan to have guests in the future. In my opinion, they should rent these rooms by the hour. And as for parking, forget it. We had to pay their daily parking fee of $8 (even though our car would only be there for about 6 hours), and there were NO spaces left. They claim to have a restaurant and gift shop. I didn't do either because we were dying to get out of this place the next morning.

My belief is that you can survive anywhere for one night. My belief went down the tubes with my one night stay at this Best Western!I read all of the reviews that were posted to this website and decided that I would give it a try anyway, since I had managed to survive (and am still healthy and alive) in so many other facilities. To all of those that took the time to write - and I did not heed your advice, I realize that my experience was a result of my own stupidity. I stayed here because of the proximity to the airport and the shuttle service that was provided.I found the pick-up service to be terrible. After waiting for about an hour and calling twice, the shuttle finally arrived. It seems that the driver was helping some friends relocate from South America and the van was filled with moving boxes and people. There was barely room for me or my luggage. The driver had to hold on to my suitcase while he was driving because there was no place else to put it.There are no words that can describe this airport facility. It is filthy, the odors are a combination of dampness, old stale smoke and urine combined, and the front desk people are rude. I went into three different rooms and they were all the same. To those that wrote that it was acceptable for a night, you may have been in a section of the building that I didn't experience. I had just gotten off of an eleven hour flight and just wanted a shower and a place to put my body to prepare for my early morning flight. The shower was so dirty that it was not usable. I believe that the odors were embedded in the carpets and drapes because they were so stained and worn. I slept on top of towels (which were clean) because the bed was also unusable.I cannot comment on the restaurant facilities because I did not use them. The noise factor that everyone seems to complain about did not affect me - - the smell and dirt were far worse than the noise.If you have any kind of alergy to smoke (which I do not), or are sensitive to unpleasant odors, or are unwilling to gamble with the usability of a room, do yourself a favor and stay in a real hotel. You are at their mercy. I was trying to avoid the time and cost of a cab ride to and from honolulu which was a big mistake.On my return flight, I took a cab to the Radisson in Honolulu (which is reasonable priced) and had a very pleasant experience. It was well worth the cab fare and the bit of extra time and effort to stay in a civilized facility. Penny Wise and Pound Foolish was the mistake that I made on the outbound. You could not PAY ME any amount of money to spend another night at this Best Western. I am not a writer, but I felt that I had to write this review - and when this is completed I will begin my letters to the Better Business Bureau, the Department of Health, and Best Western. They should be ashamed that this facility is allowed to stay open.","Livingston, New Jersey",36,1.0

Because of annual church conventions, I always have need for ""group"" reservations , from air fare to hotel, and car; sometimes for a weekend, and sometimes for an entire week. Therefore, I try to look into the ""affordables"" yet convenient lodging for everyone. My curiosity got the best of me once, and I made reservations at another hotel just down the road from the Plaza Hotel. Total disappointment and I know now, I won't be doing that again. Nor would I recommend it to anyone. In fact, for July 11th - 18th of 2004, I will be needing rooms for my church members and I'm crossing my fingers for the availability. The Plaza Hotel near the airport is an absolute plus!","Maui, Hawaii",5,5.0

The room was clean and comfortable. Here is some info which I would have found helpful. Hopefully you can take advantage of it.*Bus 62 stops directly in front of the hotel and goes to the Ala Moana Mall. It departs FROM the Mall at 7:45 PM, then again at 9:15 PM. Be aware of this 1.5 hour gap in service if you plan to take the bus back and forth. *The Restaraunt in the lobby closes at 9 PM. See my note about bus schedules if you plan to eat there. *There is a drive in restaraunt around the corner from the hotel (Byron's). I didn't eat there because I didn't know it was there until the day I left, but was told the food was good. *If you walk out the front door and head right down the street, there is a strip mall with a Subway Sandwich shop and other restaurants about .25 miles away. *Directly across Nimitz from the hotel is an entrance to a Naval housing area. If you cross the street, make the first right and walk about 200 meters, you will find a NEX shoppette & gas station. This is a good place to shop if you are with the military. They open at 0600 on weekedays and 0700 on weekends and close at 2100 daily. *The hotel has internet access via web TV, but no drops for laptop hookups. Daily fee for web TV is $10 per day.","Seoul, Korea",15,4.0

It is very close to the airport, has a free airport shuttle, has nice rooms and a friendly staff. It's not where I'd stay if I were on vacation in Honolulu or if I was staying multiple nights. But for a nice hotel very convenient to the airport it can't be beat.",,3,4.0

Hotel is located in the airport industrial area so there's absolutely nothing in the immediate vicinity -- good place for someone just passing through Honolulu and not really wanting to partake in the crazyness of Waikiki. For obvious reasons, if you're a tourist expecting resort level treatment, this spot isn't for you.",,366,4.0

The shuttle to and from the terminal is a big plus.Try to get a room on the upper floors away from the freeway. The room has the necessary amenities, nothing plush. The staff is great and very accomodating. If your work takes you to Honolulu, you can't beat the rates and convenient location.","West Hollywood, CA",5,3.0
