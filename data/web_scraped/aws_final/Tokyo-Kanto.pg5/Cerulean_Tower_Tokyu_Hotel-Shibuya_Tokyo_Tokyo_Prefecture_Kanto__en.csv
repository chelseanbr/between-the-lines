However, when a different part of our trip was cancelled at the last minute, the hotel had a room available so we thought we’d try them out.The hotel and its staff are second to none! It’s definitely one of the loveliest places to stay in Tokyo! Our room was large by Japanese standards, with an opulent bathroom and all the amenities one could possibly want. We stayed on the 33rd floor, and the view across Tokyo was wonderful, a real treat! I can’t put into words how friendly and polite all the hotel staff are. They really go above and beyond.The location of this hotel is also great, particularly if you’re in Tokyo for 4 or 5 nights. It’s adjacent to Shibuya Station, which is a perfect departure point to get anywhere in Tokyo and beyond.My only small niggle is that they make you pay for access to the pool and gym. This seems out of place for a luxury hotel, particularly one where everything else is included. But that’s really it in terms of things they could improve.We will be back!",Canberra,98,5.0

But there’s a cheap bus service to Haneda (1030 yen) / Narita airport (3100 yen) right next to the hotel.At check-in no deposit was held, just card details were added on file. Final payment was made upon check out.My neighbors next door were party guys, I could hear them in the hall, but not in my room, so I could relax and enjoy the silence.The room was quite small but there’s a small storage room for the luggage, that’s very comfortable.There’s an air cleaner in the room. Hotel offers an interesting ladies kit consists of cleansing gel, washing essence, lotion and cream - all of them were high quality products and really good on skin. All amenities are fully refreshed every day: even if I used just a half bottle of shampoo, I’ll additionally get a new one.Ventilation system is poor in the shower. You need to close bathroom door before taking a shower to avoid fire alert.However mirror is heated in the middle, so it’s not steamed up in the middle even after a long hot shower.There’s a nice typical Japanese toilet with a control panel (seat heating, bidet, shower).It was disappointing that I didn’t find any hook in the bathroom to hang on my wet towel or a bathrobe. The only shelf there is for dry towels, the bathroom itself is very small. Towels soak up the water really good and are very soft.Quality of sleep was perfect: soft blanket, comfortable mattress and choice of pillows - we took memory foam pillows.Room service food was average and quite expensive, but you can order it 24/7. You can find better and cheaper options outside.Tea (300 yen) and coffee (400 yen) in the room for extra cost. Gym and swimming pool access are also for extra cost.Hotel staff is great and very helpful. Concierge answered all my questions (I had plenty) and booked tickets to the flowers park in advance.I really enjoyed my stay and hope to come back.","Athens, Greece",41,5.0

Check-in is fast and efficient, lifts will take you really quick to your room. We booked an Executiv room which we were really glad we did. It was fairly large in size with a very comfortable bed, a desk for working and a very nicely appointed bathroom with branded amenities. Executive rooms will grant you access to their Executive lounge which is a nice oasis to relax after a day of walking around the area. Typical hotel exec club amenities can be found here.Tokyo is a very big city so if you are going to be staying mostly in that part of town, I would not hesitate to book this property, you'll be happy you did.

Upon checkin, as a Expedia Gold VIP member I was given a room upgrade to a corner room on a high floor. It was beautiful - think “Lost in Translation” looking out over Tokyo beautiful. From the window you could see the Shibuya crossing Starbucks but you’re so high up that you don’t get the noise. You could also see Mount Fuji! The service throughout the hotel was exemplary, from the check in staff to being shown around the room, and those working in the restaurant, bars and spa.I would suggest to the hotel that breakfast and spa access should be included, though I would also gratefully note that my room upgrade came with spa access. The swimming pool and jacuzzi is beautiful and very quiet.The breakfast room is very well featured and has incredibly attentive staff (a fantastic first experience of Japanese hospitality) though at 3000¥ per person/day you may wish to get your own elsewhere or go for an inclusive package.I can’t imagine staying anywhere else in Tokyo now - thank you Cerulean Tower Tokyu!","London, United Kingdom",2,5.0

A map shows that the hotel is walking distance from Shibuya Station. However, it’s not as easy as it looks to find the hotel once you emerge from Shibuya Station. A nice person on the street took pity on us and helped us find the hotel. I recommend taking a cab to the hotel, even though it’s not far from the train station, because Shibuya Station is absolutely huge, and it’s no fun wandering around lost with luggage. We stayed in a room on an executive floor for access to the executive lounge for breakfast in the a.m. and a light dinner/hors d’oeuvres/drinks in the evening. The food in the executive lounge was good and the staff was polite. Our room was small but clean. The hotel pool is heated to a nice, warm temperature and the locker room was spotless. There is a very large shopping area nearby where we found, among other things, a great place for a foot/chair massage (Queensway Relaxation Station — we went there twice!).

Yet instead of giving in, or simply going by the rule, customer is always right. He was asking for additional money. After a 30 hour trip from Miami to Tokyo, we were tired and had enough.

Getting around Tokyo is easy, although the Shibuya station area is currently under construction and walking can be disorienting with pedestrian traffic re-routed here and there. Shibuya area is also quite crowded. Nonetheless, this is a good location. First stop from the airport for the airport bus limousine service. Airport transfers are therefore very convenient. Second, the hotel itself is modern, up-to-date, and quite clean. Our rooms were on the 36th and 33rd floors. Rather large for Tokyo standards. Nice walk-in shower and lots of good amenities in the bathroom. Bed was a super king size. Very comfortable. Big screen TV with two or three English language news channels. Third, we liked the breakfast room and its service. The room is bright and cheerful, full of morning light. There's a lot of buffet choices. Fresh squeezed orange juice is a favourite.

I was offered a complimentary upgrade to a king size bed (YAY) and had a lovely view of Tokyo. The room is clean and quiet; but nothing special. When I booked this hotel, I got a sale rate. For that rate, it was fine. Without the sale rate, it isn’t worth it. Several bathroom amenities but notably no lotion or shower cap. Just an FYI. Also no coffee maker in the room - I think it was instant? I don’t drink coffee often but I don’t think I’ve been in a hotel in Asia that hasn’t provided a nespresso machine or something similar. Especially at this price point.The bed is comfortable; actually softer than I expected. A couple of different types of pillows. The blackout shades work like a charm and are necessary for the very early sunrise. The hotel is about a 3-4 min walk to the Shibuya train station, which is one of its huge benefits. This station has a JR office, for those of you starting your rail pass or the like. Service has been wonderful so far, though I certainly haven’t required much. The gym is free from 6-7am; after which you must pay. It opens at 6am and is quite busy bc it’s free. If you want to workout in peace - go after 7am. The gym is compact with the basics. There is a small stability ball and some stretch mats. No yoga mats or foam rolls. There is a stretch area as well. Breakfast is also a separate cost, which I didn’t opt for. There are a 7-11 and a Family Mart right around the hotel.Laundry service is prompt and good - but fairly expensive. WiFi was excellent - no problem with FaceTime or streaming shows.Never had a problem with any smoke smells in the room. I know this can be a common issue in Asia.

It is a 5-10 minute walk to the station. Remember though that once you get in the station, you may have to walk another 10 minutes - its big. If you are trying to catch the NRT airport express, I would leave at least 20 minutes ahead of time. There are plenty of bars and restaurants within an 10 minute walk. The famous Shibuya crossing is 5-10 minutes away - you can get a nice view from Starbucks or the L'Occitane Cafe.Service: Amazing. The gentleman at the front desk, Mr. Ishioka, was most gracious and helped us resolve a room issue (we were initially assigned a double twin room but wanted one with queen/king bed ). The front desk manager, Mr. Takahiro Tsuruga, was also fantastic. They also gave us helpful recommendations. There are plenty of staff in the lobby to help with whatever is needed. We had not wait for checkin or checkout. Room: Luxury. Large bathroom with L'Occitane products to keep you smelling nice. The shower is large and roomy. The room itself is large with great views. Of course, they have a fancy toilet. Nespresso machine in room! They also provide several bottles of water. The only negative on the room is that there are few outlets;however, at lest one or two outlets will accommodate a US three prong plug which is nice. Unfortunately, they do not have any dedicated USB outlets. Sleep: Large,comfortable bed. No noise. You control the temperature. The black out curtains are very effective.Food/Drink: We went to the 40th floor bar which had great views of Tokyo. Drinks are little on the pricey side, but hey, it is Tokyo. Let me repeat, the view is fantastic. We did not dine at the hotel. There is a convenience store in the hotel.Value: The hotel is above average in cost per night, but I think the value is high.

We struggled with staying in Shinjuku vs. Shibuya and feel we definitely made the right choice. In our view, Shibuya gives you the typical feel of Tokyo without some of the touristy or seediness you will find in certain parts of Shinjuku. The Cerulean offered comfortable rooms, a prime location just a 5 minute walk from Shibuya station (and the Shibuya crossing) and quick access to a multitude of great restaurants. We splurged and booked a room with Executive Floor access. Pricey, but worth it. Stunning views, afternoon tea and snacks, free cocktail hour and special check-in. An airport shuttle bus also stops at this hotel; for about $30 pp easy transport direct to the property after a long flight which was much appreciated.We would definitely stay at this hotel again.","Downers Grove, Illinois",5,5.0

Location:I saw another guest comment about how the location is awkward within Shibuya and I don’t understand this at all. The location is absolutely perfect as it is only a few steps away from Shibuya station and the infamous Shibuya crossing. There are elevators on the long walkway crossing from the train to the hotel also, so it’s luggage friendly without having to worry about steps. There is easy access to everywhere you want to go in Tokyo as you can access the JR pass lines from the train as well as all the local trains. You are also walking distance from night entertainment in Shibuya, Roppongi, etc. without feeling like you are in the heat of the madness. Rooms:The rooms are massive for Japan and we had a great view of the city. Beds were super comfortable, top class toiletries and bathroom was luxurious. There was a cute little seating area with a table next to the window and it truly felt like we could relax in a luxurious room after coming back from a tiring day running around Tokyo. They also had a pocket WiFi (kind of like a hotspot) you could bring with you around the city for a small fee if you wanted. Facilities/grounds:The hotel itself is huge, but somehow manages to not feel crowded and it maintains a personalized feel. Between the abundance of restaurants, attentive staff members, high ceilings and multiple entrances, it never feels like you’re drowning in the mass, which I found to be unique. There is also a 7/11 on the 2nd floor which came in handy for local snacks and beverages when we would come home at night. Although we didn’t have time to use it, there is also a pool on premise (next time!). Service:Service level was top notch, especially considering that we speak zero Japanese. Check-in was a delight, complete with our bags brought up and a full tour of our room despite not staying in an executive suite. The concierge somehow pulled off a last minute dinner reservation for us for a same-day omakase reservation with 4 hours notice. Upon check-out, we were able to store our (many) bags up front for a few hours while we searched for our last bowl of ramen. Overall, this was one of my favorite hotels on our trip and I would fully recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Shibuya area. It was an absolute delight for us and I’m looking forward to staying here again next time I’m in Tokyo. Highly recommended! ","New York City, New York",14,5.0

Considering how expensive hotels can be in Tokyo, the Family Suite setup represented a really good value for a luxury hotel in a great location.The Cerulean is located inside a high-rise office tower. It is an easy 5-10 minute walk from Shibuya station and the famous Shibuya scramble crossing. The walk requires crossing a busy street and highway using a pedestrian overpass, so it could be challenging with a lot of luggage or if you aren’t good with stairs. The Airport Limousine stops at this hotel, so access from either Narita or Haneda airport is very easy. Even though the Cerulean is in the heart of Shibuya, it was a very quiet property and provides a nice respite from the noise outside.Our hotel room was great. It was spacious by Japanese standards, and the bathroom is simply fantastic. There’s a nice shower as well as a separate bathtub, both with great water pressure and nice hot temperatures. There’s also a huge spread of bath amenities. Because it’s a high rise, there are great views of Tokyo on a clear day, and the city lights are stunning at night. You get a sense for how immense Tokyo is. One nice touch is that a mobile phone is provided in the room. It’s nice to have a local telephone number to make dinner reservations and the like.We did not eat in any of the restaurants at the Cerulean because there are simply so many options steps away. We did however find the 7-11 convenience store in the building to be very useful to purchase a variety of food and snacks.We’d definitely stay at the Cerulean again. It’s perfect for the tourist family who desires an upscale modern hotel in Tokyo.","San Francisco, California",107,5.0

It is my ""go to"" hotel after traveling to Tokyo for work 8 times in the last year. It is the rare hotel which caters perfectly for both serious business trips as well as family vacations. It does not disappoint in the impeccable service of its highly trained staff to the elegance of its restaurants and can't miss hotel bar (Bellevisto) from the top bar.

The views from the room are simply majestic and like having a window from Instagram. Every faucet and detail is managed in 5 star manner by the incredible staff. Cerulean offers this 5 star experience with extremely reasonable rates which sets itself far apart from its peers whose nose bleeding pricing only makes it available to ""travel expense budgets"".

We settled on the Cerulean in Shibuya because the reviews were really great and the price was very reasonable for a high end hotel in Tokyo with incredible skyline views which was very important to me (the Hyatt in Shinjuku was just too expensive for us to swallow and this seemed like a great second choice at a lower price point). The beds at the Cerulean were comfy which was really important for me because my back was very sore after the long-haul flight from Toronto. This is a true 4 star hotel with lots of nice little luxury touches, but it is not a '5 star' hotel by any means. We had a room on one of the upgraded floors, which was great and spotlessly clean. The view of the city from our room was awesome and we even had an incredible view of the city below us from the bathroom right over the bath which was very cool! The breakfast buffet was excellent and had something to suit all tastes, including 'classic' North American and European breakfast options. The only issue was that my husband and I felt nauseous while we were staying at this hotel, which, it is important to note, was for the first three nights of our trip. That being said, we were extremely jet lagged because we started our trip in Tokyo and it took us a while to adjust to the time change so we always felt kind of groggy and gross the first few days whenever we were in our hotel room. My husband thought that maybe we felt nauseous because our room in the hotel was really high up since the hotel is on the upper levels of a super high-rise building, and that we were feeling nauseous from feeling the towers sway very subtly in the wind. However, I really do think it was the jet lag that was the culprit.TIPS: DIRECTIONS FROM HANEDA AIRPORT TO THE HOTEL -Online it said it was approximately one hour to get to the hotel from the airport but we arrived during rush hour and it took us nearly two hours to get to the hotel by bus from Haneda Airport, so plan accordingly in terms of timing because it was a long bus ride for sure.Option 1 – Hotel Limousine Bus (approx. 60 minutes) Buy ticket from information desk - Keikyu Bus Touchscreen ticket machinesCost: 1030 yen per personTicket: Bus departure customers from Haneda Airport International Terminal should purchase ticket first from the Bus Ticketing Counter on the 2nd floor or the Bus Ticket Machine in the Ground floor. Bus stop shown in Orange is the bus stop for Airport Limousine Bus.Boarding: See map below (orange little bus is where to board from the international passenger terminal at Haneda Airport):Option 2 – Subway (approx. 60 minutes)Purchase a Suica card at the airport and load up Suica card, cost is about JPY 580 to get to the hotel.Directions:(1) Haneda Airport International Terminal / Haneda Airport Domestic Terminal Keikyu Airport Line (approximately 14 - 25 minutes )(2) Shinagawa Station JR Yamanote Line (approximately 12 minutes )(3) Shibuya Station on foot, 5 minutes.(4) Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel","Toronto, Canada",88,5.0

Overall we were completely satisfied with the service and the room. They have a shuttle service for fairly cheap that we used to get to the airport, and it was super easy and got us there right on time. You will see the time chart of the shuttle buses in your welcome papers, and you can just reserve at the concierge. The buffet breakfast was good. Although I wouldn’t put that in the amazing category, it was good enough to take advantage of the convenience and eat there each morning. They have fresh squeeze orange juice, fruits, and an assortment of both American and Japanese standard breakfast items. The one thing I would say is overall in the amazing category is their pastries. Their croissants and other pastries are made at the hotel, and kudos to them, they are as good as ones in France (they have a bakery counter if you just want to buy a coffee and croissant, right at the restaurant entry). The best thing about this hotel is the location. It’s less than 5 minutes to walkto Shibuya Crossing and Metro station. Very well located if you are into walking and exploring. If I had to find nitpicky things I wish were different for this hotel, I wish they had a spa (most people won’t care though I’m sure). Also, they did not have a large selection of TV stations, and no english stations. Only local stations. But neither of those dampened my opinion too much. This hotel made our stay in Tokyo very pleasant, and I would definitely recommend staying here. We were able to walk around and use the Metro to get everywhere. We also took a day tour to Mt.

The Cerulean is quite central, near the Shibuya railroad and subway station and an interesting walk to many sights and shopping districts.Strange to say but the hotel's distinctive shape and height were also really helpful and made it easier to find in the mass of people, cars and multi-level/multi-dimensional movement at Shibuya street level.We loved the muted, cloth and wood decor.

Toilet was just as I'd expect a Japan toilet would be (First time with warmed toilet seats!).Could not fault anything about the room (except maybe the size of the TV.... such a nice big room... yet the TV was small by comparison).The only negative was the cost of some things within the hotel itself. That was our fault though. For instance... the bar on the top floor was expensive. You can't go up there and not have a drink and some nibbles to go with the view, but the prices were exorbitant. The worst though was in the lobby. We sat down to have 2 coffees and were absolutely shocked at the price. Over 2,700 Yen (Almost $35 Australian) for 2 small cups of coffee is an absolute rip off.

We were given a room on the 24th floor (rooms start from 19th floor) which had a decent enough view (city view of Skytree, Tokyo Tower etc) but I would have liked for us to have been higher given how people rave about the views from the higher floors. My husband went downstairs to see if they could change our room and after some persuading, they moved us to the 31st floor- this was good of them and I did appreciate this. We went to the Bellevisto bar on the first night and it was great and the drinks are very well made- views are outstanding too. The second night we went back and my husband asked if we could have some nuts with our drinks. Little did we know that on our bill we would be charged a ridiculous amount for these nuts (£6-7 GBP). Most bars give this complimentry yet they charged so much for so little. Really disappointed. On NYE after we had returned from the countdown at the Shibuya Crossing, we asked if we could have one drink at the bar but were told no- perhaps they were at capacity but they didn't seem to care much when turning us away. My husband woke up extra early on New Year's day to go upstairs to view the first sunset (it was promoted by the hotel as a guest only event) but he was initially told he couldn't enter even though he was the first person to arrive- it was all a bit odd and the man was not helpful to him.For the fact that we had spent five nights and quite a bit of money staying here, I just didn't feel that Japanese hospitality that I'd become used to elsewhere. The bathroom was ok but the toiletteries were not very good and I'm glad I'd still kept mine from previous hotels which I ended up using.The most helpful person was the sweet girl at the porter desk who helped me find out where they sell the amazing Panasonic hair dryers that are in the rooms. We stayed in the Capitol Tokyu Hotel in the first leg of our trip which is in the same group as the Cerulean Tower Tokyu and the service, rooms, toiletteries etc were far better at the former. Seems that the most positive reviews are from those who stayed in the executive suites/floors and received other great benefits from doing so.The hotel location itself is great as it's a 3 min walk to Shibuya Crossing and there's so much to see and do around there. Shibuya station is also a hop away. I don't think we would stay here again if I'm being frank.","London, United Kingdom",20,3.0

We took the metro which is relatively easy to get around once you know where you need to make a change to get from point A to point B.Our hotel was located a few minutes from Shibuya station and we took the subway to get to the hotel. You are able to see the hotel from the station providing you use the correct exit.We followed the West exit sign to get to our hotel. The check in was relatively quick and first impressions the hotel was easy to get to and also very clean airy inside. We were taken to our room located on the 26th floor which had good views.Unfortunately, we were facing the road side rather than over the city. Although we had requested city view it but we let it slide as jet lagged kicked in and we decided to venture out for dinner quickly.There are so many restaurants located near the hotel and you are not short for choice. After dinner we decided to head back to the hotel and ask the hotel concierge to request a seat for the bar for New Year's Eve. We were informed by the staff that a reservation was not necessary and we could go up there on the day. With that information we went of on our way back to our room to rest. As we woke up around 2am due to jet lagged we had spotted a 7 Eleven attached to the hotel outside. We ventured there to grab some snacks. As we had metro cards(our version of the oyster) we could use this to purchase our goods. This can also be used in other shops too. Around 3am we went to the concierge to try and get a taxi to the fish market which has now relocated. Unfortunately, no taxi was waiting outside. The hotel informed us that they could call a taxi in but there would be a charge for them to call. I found this quite surprising as the lady we had helping us barely looked for a taxi and to then try charge us was a bit of a shock to say. We declined this as the call would have set us back £30. We walked to the main road and were easily able to find a cab. By the time it got to New Year's Eve we saw the sign on the hotel board that advised a reservation was required to go to the hotel bar. We went to the concierge to enquire as this is not what we were advised. Unfortunately, all of the seats had been reserved by this point and we could not get a reservation. I went back to the room while my partner decided to go to the hotel bar to explain the situation and see if they could do anything. Luckily for us a few cancellations happened and we were able to get seats by the bar with a good view (see picture 3).From this experience of the hotel unfortunately, we will not be going back or recommending it as the staff provided mixed information and also a lot of them were not able to communicate in English which made understanding difficult as they were unable to answer our queries.However it has not hindered our experience of Japan and I hope to go back to visit other places as the time there passed by really quickly.

The location is fantastic - very close to Shibuya station, which has easy access to trains to almost any neighborhood in Tokyo, but on the other side of the motorway so it has an enjoyably calm environment (and also within walking distance to lovely Daikanyama). We spent four nights in rooms on regular floors and, after a visit to Kyoto, one night on an executive floor. The rooms are spacious and well appointed - comfortable beds, good lighting, excellent bathrooms - and had wonderful views of Mt. Fuji. Executive rooms are on higher floors and have nicer amenities and furnishings. None of the rooms were cheap, but relative to other luxury properties in Tokyo, the Cerulean is a great value.This is a fairly large hotel, so you won't get highly personalized service, but the staff were very friendly and accommodating, and well organized. And before our arrival the concierge was helpful in booking a reservation at a Michelin-starred sushi ya in Ginza.The executive lounge is much quieter for breakfast than the bustling lobby restaurant, though both offered a nice selection of Japanese and western foods. Great way to start a jet-lagged day. The bar on 40 has spectacular views over the city and is not to be missed.

But I can definitely say that I will be staying at the Cerulean Tower again, and that's 100% down to location. For me it was perfect, and beat the better hotels I have stayed at in Tokyo. I was out and about 90% of the time, and being in the heart of Shibuya, a walk from Harajuku and Omotesando, made this hotel unbeatable for me. Also, a 3 or 4 minute walk to the easy-to-navigate JR Line which gets you everywhere is perfect. Plus, a 10 to 15 minute journey to Shinagawa for the Shinkasen is a further bonus for getting around Japan.Now, for my three gripes. You've paid extra for an Executive Level room. I think a 10.00am clearing away of breakfast is unacceptable. Why the rush ? There are people on vacation who want to relax, plus they are adjusting to a different time-zone and jetlag. Also, the food offerings at the Executive Level were so Westernised. I don't want Western food in Japan. Surely there could be a mix of Japanese and Western ? Lastly, I'd like to watch a bit of TV in bed before going to sleep. A huge percentage of the World speaks English.

It’s a quintessential Tokyo hotel with great views from the rooms and a central location, however the hotel is a little dated and the food is poor.Here’s what’s great...Location - this is a great asset of the hotel. You can walk to Shibuya and Harajuku so you’re never short of great restaurants, bars and shops.Design - although the hotel is quite old, there is something classically Japanese about it which is quite appealing. I ended up in an executive room which was far better than the standard rooms which are starting to look tired. Views from most rooms are spectacular. Service - service is overall good (with the exception of my check-in experience) and there are plenty of staff around to help out. Here’s what I didn’t like:Food - the food is consistently bad. Just some examples....1. ordered room service. 41$ for a burger, 11 fries (I counted) and soft drink. The burger was so undercooked I couldn’t eat it.2. I ate at the lobby restaurant and ordered pasta. The tomato sauce was almost pink and the bacon again totally undercooked.Reservation Mix-Up - when I arrived to my room they had given me a twin room although I was alone. The front desk told me they didn’t have any king rooms available and that I had booked a twin. I’ve never booked a twin before and my confirmation did not state bed type. The front desk did not manage the situation well as I was not willing to stay in a small single bed for my stay. The only offer was a paid upgrade which would cost me an additional 200$. Good customer service would have moved me free of charge - it’s not my fault the standard king rooms were sold out. This put a dark shadow on the rest of the stay. ","Sausalito, California",145,3.0

The area around the hotel is like New York’s Time Square and very alive and filled with great restaurants, bars, shopping and people watching. Our room was on the 27th Floor with a spectacular city view. Our room had excellent appointments and was very clean with large bedroom and bathroom. Also the bathroom had a full wall window with the same outrageous view as the bedroom. Shout out to the hotel staff who made sure that are large pieces of luggage were transferred to our next Tokyo hotel while we were in Kyoto. When we arrived back in Tokyo after 5 days, our large luggage was waiting in the room of our next Tokyo hotel. Overall staff and service was incomparable. Can’t wait to go back!","Los Angeles, California",11,5.0

It's in the heart of Shibuya with easy access to the trains and it was walking distance to where I used to live. Its also great because when taking the bus from either Haneda or Narita, this hotel is the first stop. Also, when leaving the Hotel, you head directly to the airport without additional stops.That being said, this hotel is a premium brand and can be quite expensive. The hotel is clean and staff is good but I don't feel like the experience was over the top and wow'd me. The hotel is the tallest building around so if you book on the upper floors, You'll get expansive views of Tokyo. When checking in, ask for the Mt. Fuji view (seen on a clear day) or the Shibuya Crossing view (great view day or night of the Shibuya scramble)I would stay here again but if you are a budget conscious traveller, you may want to seek other alternatives.

Bed and bathroom fine but I could not stay in the room. 30th floor. I was ready to find another hotel and it was almost midnight! We complained and asked for a different room. They were apologetic and immediately accommodated our request. We were moved to the 33rd floor - an executive floor. It was like we were in a different hotel. The hall was lovely. The room was fresh - everything was beautiful. Top notch. So - if you are going to stay there, ask in advance for a non-smoking room on a RENOVATED floor.Breakfast was OK - not spectacular but OK.

Primarily, it has a great position. It's arguably the best in Shibuya and located very close to Omotesando Avenue and Minamiaoyama. It's therefore very close to a wide array of the coolest shopping and eating areas in Tokyo (which is definitely a big plus).Secondly, the service is good. You feel like you're well looked after. Thirdly, it's uniquely positioned as a relatively affordable 5 star hotel, though it is a far cry from others such as the Peninsula or Mandarin located in Ginza.However, this doesn't mean it's cheap. Unfortunately the state of the rooms let it down here too. They are certainly in need of an update. Food options are equally as ordinary. If it comes down to a question of whether it is good value for money, I would say only just. It really could be a lot better. In saying that, you'd be hard pressed to find a hotel in a better location, with facilities and service as good as the Cerulean's at the same price point. People stay here for safety, convenience and moderate comfort and that's about it.","Hong Kong, China",9,4.0

Its gives a good balance between a spacious american sized room and amenities, and price. Room: i just get the basic room....2 twin beds...i love that the rooms start at a very high floor, so you get great views....ive seen both sides...and they are both great. The window is big unobstructed glass that frames either Mt. Fuji or the shibuya station on the other side. Theres even a space to sit on the ledge if you wanna do the lost in translation by the window shot. I like the fact that the shower is separate from the bathtub...although, there was 1 time i was here, and it was not...but most of them separate. They offer 2 bottles of water every day for free. They also have a loaner cell phone, although i didnt try it. My only negative is the sheets have a hint of cigarette smell. There are smoking rooms in the hotel....and i suspect they wash the sheets in the same batch as the smoking rooms, so you can notice it. Also, the mattress is not as comfortable as i remember it to be....maybe its time to replace with new ones?...or maybe im just getting old and my back is not as forgiving anymore....Hotel- ive been here about 4-5 times already over the years since 2003.....and the decor is still holding up, but it is showing its age. The penthouse bar is being remodeled so, hopefully it will breath new life to the place. I did not try the pool this time, but i remember you had to pay like $50 per day if you wanted to use it. It was a big nice pool...would have been great in the summer months.Service: This is what makes this place shine....everyone is very professional and efficient and very helpful. The concierge team is amazing! Naoko Tsugita and Yoko Sumida were so patient with all my requests and were on the ball when it came to getting me in all the restaurants i wanted to go to. They answered in 24hours and sometimes instantly if you were responding in the window when they worked. After hours, they have a senior manager who took care of us when we had last minute changes in plans. Absolutely worth staying here just for that. bell staff were very helpful as well and polite.Location: Big plus is the Limobus goes directly from narita to the hotel. its so convenient getting in and out of narita into your hotel. Cerulean is adjacent to the shibuya station....you just need go up the overpass to cross the street....if you have bad knees like me or if you have kids in a stroller...its a bit of a pain to go up and down stairs...although you can use the elevator on both ends.... it makes me think if only cerulean was on the same block or side as the shibuya station, it would have been perfect. Shibuya Excel is on the station itself and $40 cheaper but its not as nice as the cerulean. Theres tons of places to eat around the area....even behind the hotel, there are a ton of cool small restaurants you can choose from...or walk across the street to the bigger department store food court or the food show below the Tokyu department store.Overall...this is a great place and ill definitely stay again.","Los Angeles, California",31,4.0

The breakfast buffet is excellent, extensive but expensive at 3326 yen for the ""full"" proposition. There is easy access to a choice restaurants on separate levels and also a Seven11 type convenience store on site. I am told the top floor bar is marvellous but unfortunately my schedule did not allow a visit. Now for the really strange and also irritating bit. They have a fitness suite with a great range of cardio and strength equipment. But you have to pay for access!????? In a hotel like this!? That is already expensive to say the least!!??? It's unheard of in my experience. In fairness this only matters to the minority of hotel guests that like to work our every day if possible. To everyone else.....who cares about the gym right!? Frankly, at this price, the gym should be free at all times to hotel guests. It must be mentioned that the gym is FREE to access between 06.00 and 07.00hrs, but outside that time, your paying.....and it is more than you might imagine!!! From memory, something like 2000 yen(!). My only other dislike was the furnishing in my non smoking room (2310).....really quite old fashioned and in need of a refurb. Also, the room and indeed the corridor to the room did smell of smoke, on what is stated as a non smoking floor. Yeah right!? This may be the case for the entire floor but I can only objectively comment on my room.So, in summary, a beautiful, but expensive hotel, that from what I could see, needs a decor update in some rooms and a strict smoking policy and needs to get a bit more of a 21st century policy on it's fitness club access. Good but pricey. ","Stockport, United Kingdom",21,3.0

Stayed here for 9 nights and booked 2 rooms. We wanted to book Four Seasons by Tokyo station but got attracted to the Shibuya district. They do have large rooms, American size, but the beds are smaller than Queen. The bathroom was also spacious with large sink counter and shower space. Large windows with great city views. The air conditioner was working great, a huge plus in a hot humid summer. In-room wi-fi has high speed and we had 4 devices running at the same time with no issues (game, movie, surfing).The best was their complementary smart phone (called handy phone) provided in the room (with its own charging station). You can take it out of the hotel for internet/map/calls, saved me over 10000 yen if I were to buy one of those sim cards for my phone at the airport. We walked (with young kids) to the Shibuya station everyday, easy commute to everywhere. Be warned, local Japanese do not know ""Cerulean"", as we got lost coming back late at night. Breakfast buffet was pricey (3500 yen) but that's average compare to its competitors (from my research), we didn't try it. There's a 7Eleven on the 2nd floor. We asked for COLD (us Americans) complementary bottled water daily after returning from a long day at the Porter desk, they were always happy to give it to us. You will feel like a King/Queen by the excellent service they provide. Despite limited English, each person will try his/her best to help you. We used their hotel limo minivan to move to another hotel by Disneyland, only 9000 yen for 6 people and lots of luggage. I asked the driver to take a side-trip and show us ""downtown"" Tokyo, no problem and no extra charge. We lost a bag behind, called the hotel and they delivered it to us the next day, only charged me 1000 yen for the gas.

On the one hand, there are some great features. The first is that they provide you with a smart phone to take out and use (yes, it’s a bit of a brick but i found it extremely useful to avoid roaming costs.It’s fine if you just need it for Chrome and Maps). I’ve never heard of a hotel doing this, but wow; what a great touch. A second great point was the room itself - spacious, with good aircon, a big bath and shower, hairdryer, stunning view, comfy pillows, etc. To be fair, for the high cost of the hotel, it was on par with expectations. However the bed was a bit strange - they’d pushed two doubles together to make a bizarre, comically large, Optimus-prime-esque king size. We would have preferred a good old queen, especially if it meant more floor space and avoiding the awkward join seam in the middle.The third good point is the location. Just a short walk to Shibuya station, (and Shibuya itself is arguably the heart of modern Tokyo) but one block removed from the crazy noisy hub of the city, so it’s safe and quiet. Perfect. Now for the bad points. The first is that the gym and pool are not free for hotel guests. Well, the gym is free only if you go between 6 and 7am in the morning... and the pool doesn’t open till 7 so doesn’t even count in this deal. (Logic? Not so much). At all other times, using the hotel gym will cost you ¥2160 (which is almost $30 AUD). Have you ever heard of such a thing, in a 4.5 star hotel?! Charging guests to use the hotel pool and gym! Plus, they conveniently refrained from telling us this when we checked in, despite me asking details about the pool and where it was located (I mean hello - it was the perfect time to drop in a casual tidbit on the random cost right there?). So I turned up to work out at 7:30am and was asked how I’d like to pay, which came as a huge shock. Every other poor point has to do with charges - the buffet breakfast was a whopping ¥3300 (so we didn’t end up doing breakfast there). One night we went to the top floor hotel bar and they said it was a ¥1500 charge per person if we wanted to sit near a window. I mean, come on guys.Ultimately, this place was lovely to stay at, and very well located, (which is reflected in the price), but if you want to use the gym or pool, or eat breakfast there, be aware of the costs.","London, United Kingdom",70,3.0

Staying in a queen I found myself greeted not only by masses of space (something that can be a luxury this close to the more 'touristy' areas of Tokyo) but also an air of sophistication that was only increased by an amazing view out across the Tokyo skyline. The room held not only the expected amenities (the nespresso machine adding a welcomed change to the usual sachets of instant coffee) but also the addition of a smart phone that, if I so wished, could be taken out of the hotel and used for the duration of my stay at no extra cost. I had asked to have a ticket forwarded to the hotel and the staff not only took it in before my arrival but then assured that I received upon my first visit to the hotel despite my arriving before check in time (they also, very kindly, took in my bags and then delivered them to my room in duration between this and my actual check in). In this interaction, as well as all others that I had with the staff, I found them not only polite but very willing to help with any issues that arose (not that I, myself, experienced any true issues during my stay) As one note if, like myself, you only have a debit card make sure you bring cash to pay for your room if you have not already done as such and be prepared to pay for any extra costs (mini bar, laundry etc) when they arise as a 'tab' can only be authorised with a credit card.

There is even a currency exchange machine in the lobby. We have stayed there many times. If you want to know everything wonderful about this hotel, there are hundreds of reviews on this site for you to read. So I will focus on the flaws which are not so obvious.1. Tokyo is a city to walk around and enjoy the convenience of the subway system and the JR trains. As such, visitors will want to take advantage of the very close Shibuya Station which has convenient connections to anywhere in Tokyo that you would want to go. But you must be very healthy and mobile to enjoy this convenience because to get from the Cerulean to Shibuya Station one must cross over a series of pedestrian bridges. Unless your heart, lungs and legs are in good shape, this could be a daunting task.2. The Cerulean will want to make an imprint of your credit card when you arrive with payment being made on departure. The problem with this scenario is that many brand new chip cards (like mine) are not embossed. As a result, we had to pay for our seven day stay up front. While this in itself may not be a major issue, it meant that I was billed in the current credit card billing cycle and not the next. This is called a cash flow problem. 3. The buffet breakfast should be avoided. It is expensive and, quite frankly, not very good.4. Back to that currency exchange machine. Yes, it is convenient if you want to exchange foreign currency bills to Japanese yen but the exchange rate is not as good as you would find at an ATM.","Thousand Oaks, CA",13,4.0

The room itself had all amenities required (and some more) and was very spacious and spotless. The roomservice was great, the staff in general was great - not many vegetarian hot dishes on the roomservice and restaurants' menus but the staff were open to making changes to suit my needs.

Airport buses go directly from the hotel at a variety of times.Check-in / reception - Very professional and quick - we arrived early and were still able to check-in.

Bed / pillows - Exceptionally comfortable (even beating the Granvia) - perfect  nights sleep. Bathroom - Large wet room and bath. The most powerful shower on our holiday  and lots of room. Lighting - Large window and good room lighting. Electronic curtains and blinds.Other The hotel was spotless and the sound proofing in the rooms was good. Large TV, excellent air conditioning and relaxing piano bar. Superior room services for teas, coffee, cakes, cocktail (self service) and breakfast area superb (including friendly concierge).A large amount of handouts / information was given to us which was relevant and helpful for our stay. Cafe and restaurants inside had a good atmosphere.The hotel also provided us with a mobile phone for travelling to avoid roaming costs. Staff - Professional and polite. Less interactive than the Granvia and some struggled with English. Seemed more corporate than the Granvia and as a result less personalised (not a criticism just a perception). Very responsive to emails and requests. Very good first impressionSummaryAn excellent hotel, the only thing I would question is the price vs value given its area / location.

We are a family of 5; my wife, 3 young children and I. Despite having a written confirmation from the Hotel for adjoining rooms, a strong preference for connecting rooms and an email sent a day prior to our arrival to reiterate the above, upon checking in at 12am after a 12hr journey to Tokyo, I was informed that the only two rooms available were on different sides of the floor.Management was unwilling to understand the inconvenience they were putting me through or the logistics of my family having to split our young children on the other side of the floor. We finally got to our rooms at 1am and settled in and slept at 2am. We had to wake up and pack again the next day after I spoke to the General Manager, who offered a feeble apology, and moved us to adjoining rooms. Clearly seemed the management was banking on the fact that I wouldn’t walk out on them at the last minute due to shortage of rooms in Tokyo during peak travel season. GM wasn’t bothered to the least that due to the disruption to our schedule we lost out on part of our planned tour the next day. To further add to our woes, the room they moved us to has loud rattling A/C ducts. We could not even use ear plugs to sleep as we had children in the next room and had to be able to hear the phone in case they called. Had a terrible 2nd nights sleep.

Pros of the hotel: easy, fast check-in, very impersonal but efficient. WiFi speed was great -- I was able to stream Netflix with no problems. Water pressure is INCREDIBLE -- hard to leave the shower! Our city-view was also quite nice. The decor was very basic, but clean and comfortable, especially the pillows. The location, close to the Shibuya train station was very convenient. All of the staff we spoke with had almost perfect English and were pleasant and efficient. CONS: This is a very institutional, not overly friendly hotel with no ambiance; which may not matter to you; we would have liked a hotel with a Japanese feel. We rarely saw staff as we were leaving or returning to the hotel because there are so many exits, most of which are not staffed. Added to the impersonal feel. We wanted interconnecting rooms, and so we could not get a room on the executive floor (there are no interconnecting rooms on the executive floors), as a result, we were not able to get the free breakfast in the executive lounge. The buffet on the main floor is roughly $35.00 per person -- not worth it to us to spend $140+ for breakfast. We brought bathing suits only to discover that the pool was for guests over age 18 -- crazy. Also, because we couldn't stay on the executive floor, we had to pay a large fee to use the fitness facilities -- annoying to be constantly asked for extra fees in a 5-star hotel, these amenities should be included. The smell in the hall was very smoky and musty, not pleasant to come home to but the rooms weren't smelly, the air quality isn't terrific though. We also were awoken many mornings by the sound of yapping dogs. I thought I was losing my mind until I discovered what appeared to be dogs being boarded on top of an adjacent low-rise building. They were very loud... I counted 14 or so dogs, all of them little yappy things that constantly barked while they were outside for their ""break"". Overall, if you are in Tokyo on business, this is probably a great hotel for you. If you are with your family, I would try somewhere else -- probably a different location like Shinjuku.","Toronto, Canada",91,3.0

I cannot fault the hotel.Initial check-in had us all in one “family room” but after some “clarification”, the hotel Assistant Manager had us all sorted in two very comfortable upper level rooms. The rooms offer gob-smacking views over Tokyo (from 270 degrees). Baths too with windows - Very cool.The staff at this hotel speak English very well, and the Concierge service is nothing short of excellent. They also manage transport and taxis for small and larger groups. Well done people. Apart from the fact that it battles the Grand Hyatt for its excellent breakfast selection as the BEST in Tokyo, the Cerulean Tower is probably one of the tightest-run 5-stars in the city and Shibuya (with its associated crossing) is a stone’s throw from some of the more desired inner-city destinations.

The room was large (not just for Tokyo standards, but legitly large) and had a direct view of Mount Fuji. The small walk-in wardrobe was useful for storing parcels and such from our online purchases. Snacks and drinks can be had at the 7-Eleven downstairs -- not easy to find as it isn't on the street level, but up an escalator.We made good use of the direct limousine bus from/to Narita. When we checked out, we simply called the porter to pick up our bags from our room. She took care of everything and the next time we saw the bags again was at the airport -- very handy. Speaking of bags, if you have a Rimowa, the hotel is one of a handful in Tokyo that participates in the brand's complimentary repair programme. Rimowa will pick up, fix and return the suitcase for free. We took advantage of this to fix a wonky wheel that we never found the time to attend to back home. (Having said that, we had to speak to three different people before someone knew what we were talking about -- best to head downstairs to the front desk instead of talking to the operator.)The only reason why the hotel did not get five stars is this: two months before the trip, I emailed the concierge a list of restaurants to book for the trip. Someone wrote back to clarify something, then silence. I thought things would have been taken care of, but when I enquired one month prior to the trip, I found out that my request had vanished into a black hole. After some scrambling, we still weren't able to secure a couple of reservations at the desired date/time, which meant that we had to reshuffle our other commitments.

It is wonderfully located. I have been staying at the hotel for many years and every time, I cherish the moment I open the door to any of the rooms and find myself staring––through a window as large as the wall––at the most amazing and classic view of Tokyo.The hallways are a little worn out, but still clean and very quiet. The rooms and bathrooms are compact but feel very spacious because of how well designed and outfitted they are.

You can get shiatsu massage in the room.There is a fitness center with good equipment, a spa, and a sun-kissed, quiet (indoor) pool, made even more soothing by the fact that it is not over chlorinated. Please note, unless you have a special deal, you might have to pay extra for the fitness center.The restaurants are delicious, the service alert and solicitous.

This one fit the bill—it’s decently sized by Tokyo standards. There is a large window sill that I loved to sit in and take in the view while eating a snack, having a beer or morning coffee. We were fortunate to get a west facing view, which made for gorgeous sunsets and a stunning view of Mt Fuji on clear days. We never bothered with any of the hotel restaurants as the prices were high and so many inexpensive alternatives are nearby. There’s a 7/11 conbini around the corner where we bought coffee every morning for ¥150 each morning (along with loads of other goodies like breads, cookies, egg sandwiches, and mochi). We bought some beer there to take back to the hotel to drink in our room at much lower prices (and with less smoke) than the hotel bar. There’s also a quick service noodle shop next door that is open early in the morning and into the evenings, maybe 24 hours. For about ¥500, you can get a really satisfying and delicious bowl of soba or udon. I had Japanese curry there one morning for breakfast with a bowl of soba and that was tasty too. Lots of great izakaya very close as well. Bottom line, unless you’re dying for western style breakfast, you can spend a lot less than the hotel restaurant without going any farther away. The bathroom was lovely with abundant high end amenities like bath salts, special face care kit for ladies, green tea shampoo and more. Of course they provide all of the standard products like brushes and razors as well. The room did smell of smoke, despite being non smoking. There is an air purifier that helped somewhat, although we weren’t certain how to properly operate it as the controls were all in Japanese. The location of the hotel is so convenient to Shibuya station which is a nice place to stay as a home base from which to explore Tokyo. The hotel is a very tall tower, so it is easy to spot when leaving Shibuya station via the west exit. When you’re jet lagged and trying to orient yourself to navigate to your hotel, this is great. Shinkansen leave from nearby Shinagawa station, which is about 20-30 minutes away via the Yamanote line.

Outside restaurants i find are heavy on the proteins and starches. Sometimes you can get a corner suite as an upgrade. The hotel also has a free shuttle bus that drops you off near the Metro and the heart of Shibuya.

The rooms were clean, comfortable, and were large for Tokyo standards. They also had a great view of Tokyo. No complaints there. The hotel is very centrally located in Shibuya, near all the major departmental stores and major train lines. Be aware you are in the heart of Tokyo, so there is hustle and bustle and plenty of people, so if you want something quieter and more relaxing this is not the place.The service was okay but could be warmer, its hard to describe but I guess there could be more smiling? I found the service to be very curt.We also unfortunately had a major fire in the car basement and had to evacuate down 21 flights of stairs, which royally messed up my nanny's knee. At first the announcement was only in Japanese and we had no clue whether to leave. The house maid was also misleading saying we should stay since it was only a car fire. Once I figured out it was a fire fire we high tailed it out of the building. The hotel needs to update its policies to inform its guests in all languages. Since 9/11 and earthquake disasters I don't take evacuation orders lightly. Also there were maybe only two staircases down the exit, I was glad things were orderly but there were times the evacuees were stuck in the stairwell and it was hard not to panic, especially since I was carrying my baby. So there may be a con to staying on the 40th floor if an emergency happens, at the very least be aware where the exits to this building are. And the hotel needs to firm up its disaster and evacuation policies. We got comped for the evacuation but that was an experience","San Diego, California",11,4.0

We figured we would be spending more time in the hotel and as such would benefit from a great view of the city. After we were checked in by a very formal and icy receptionist who took my card details for room incidentals. This had the unfortunate result of locking my card down for the rest of the stay, however my wife had her card so further purchases were made on that. When we got to our room, we were initially underwhelmed by our south west facing room. A guide was supplied with the room to suggest what the various epithets of the sky line were and what we should be able to see. Such as the rainbow bridge and Tokyo tower. We unfortunately were too far west facing for Tokyo tower and we would have needed a pair of binoculars or a telescope to see the rainbow bridge. On the plus side we did have a fantastic view of Mount Fuji on the rare days that the sky was completely clear so that was a pay off. Also on a positive note the room came with a complimentary ‘handyphone’ for use around Tokyo, giving us 4g internet access everywhere in the city and which allowed access to google maps and some social media. The family room we had been given was adequate but small though additional storage was located in a side room. The staff were for the most part courteous although there was an issue with some members of staff not speaking English to a competent level and accidentally giving incorrect information which was a pain, especially on the last day when we needed to get the limousine bus back to the airport and was told to wait in the wrong area to board the bus. Luckily we had allowed enough time to compensate for this oversight. The location was fine in a good spot approximately 5 to 10 mins walk from shibuya station.

This was my 3rd trip to Japan, and so far in every experience with restaurants, hotels, taxis, etc I've come to love the country and the friendliness of its people. This is why I've come back here to vacation every year for the last 3 years, as my wife and I have absolutely fallen in love with the culture and its people. Because of this background, this is why my stay at the Cerulean was so shocking and disappointing. Perhaps it was because everyone in our grouped tended to look young or that I had dressed quite casual during my stay there (cause I'm on vacation). But I had never been so rudely treated by a group of hotel staff as a group before in my life, especially at a ""5 star hotel"" which if that is true, shouldn't just be on the amenities and quality but also due to service.This wasn't just one isolated incident but many. For example, even when we checked in the person at the counter asked us rudely for our passports since I forgot that for international travelers it was required. It echoed the tone I felt throughout our stay there which was slightly condescending and dismissive. We actually stayed in the executive rooms which start on the 33rd or 34th floor so we had access to their special executive lounge where you can get breakfast as wells as snacks/drinks throughout the day. One time when we went up to the lounge for drinks the lady asked us for our room keys to verify we were executive guests in the same slightly condescending manner. Since we had very young kids with us, we wanted to go out and get some dinner and bring it to the lounge to eat at night when the kids were down. When I went to the counter to ask the same lady if that was ok, she reacted in slight horror and said that definitely was not allowed and if we got food we would have to eat it in their lobby. So that's what we did, we got some food and while we were eating in the lobby a hotel worker accosted us and demanded that we leave or go to our rooms to eat. We tried to explain that the whole reason we were eating in the lobby was our kids were sleeping in the hotel rooms and we couldn't eat in the executive lounge. He had literally waved his finger at us aggressvely like a parent disciplining a child and stated in an angry tone that they are a 5 star hotel and don't allow guests to eat in the lobby! I think he thought we had just come in off the street and was a little taken aback that we were actually executive guests because after that he literally scurried away like a rat after we had stated we were executive-level guests and he had no right to treat us that way. By this time we were furious because of the combination of events. The next morning, their front desk manager talked with us and we agreed that we would get a slight upgrade and a 25% discount on our stay. We shook hands and were happy with it and went out for the day. When we returned at 3 pm to move into our new rooms, he then informed us he could not give us the discount although we had agreed to it but he swore he did no such thing. Other hotel workers and my cousin all witnessed him agreeing to the 25% discount. This was incredibly upsetting because we were lied to in our face. Even worse, he claimed to have called Agoda (3rd party which booked tickets) and asked for them to discount us and they refused. When we talked to Agoda, they said they haven't talked to them and offered to give us a full refund on the rest of our stay so we could find other accomodations. I'm pretty sure that the manager never even tried to call and offered us the 25% discount knowing he would later revoke it and making it hard for us to find new accommodations. We ended up moving to the Westin, where we loved our stay.Finally, this hotel is great for business travelers but is NOT a kid-friendly place. We weren't allowed to bring our kids to breakfast, and they charge a ridiculous US $21 a DAY for the pool. We had brought swim wear assuming we could bring them to the pool or at least hang out there even if the kids didn't go in the wate.All in all, this was the most infuriating experiences I've ever had at a hotel. A true 5 star hotel shouldn't feel like it needs to constantly tell its guests they are a 5 star hotel and make the guests feel like prisoners with all their rules. We weren't trying to do anything out of bounds except for eating together and having fun with our kids. I'll never stay again at the Cerulean and will be telling all my friends and colleagues in the future to avoid the hotel at all costs.","Sunnyvale, California",19,1.0

The hotel itself is beautiful. It's in a great/central location. Certain staff members were friendly and had some nice perks if you're staying in one of the executive floors, like daily breakfast or happy hour in the private lounge with view. I think I would have mostly enjoyed this if I was there by myself, but I was not alone, I came with my wife and 11 month old and family that also had an infant baby. This hotel should just be upfront and call itself an adult only hotel. It's not on the 3rd party travel sites that you cannot bring children to breakfast. We didn't even realize the gym & pool had a daily charge per person. Then we find out not only there was a charge, but pool is adults only as well. These things just kept adding up, that it felt like its this nice hotel, but we couldn't even use what we were paying a premium on. After being frustrated with all these things piling up, we finally hit our breaking point with the service, or lack thereof. Both us and the family we traveled with had our babies down for bed in our rooms. We went up to have a drink in the executive lounge and asked if we could bring in food since they didn't serve food there. They were appalled we even asked and told us we couldn't do it, but could in the lobby. We went and picked up some food next door and ate in the lobby like they said we could, to then get verbally abused by the lobby workers for eating in their hotel lobby. First, it seemed like they profiled us, thinking we were just rift raft in their 5 star hotel, seeing us being young and in shorts and t-shirts. They pointed their fingers at us and screamed and made us feel like we were scum. We finally let them have it and demanded a refund to let us check out. They seemed embarrassed once they realized we were staying in their premium rooms. Their manager took us out of the lobby to try and keep us from causing a scene and acted like they would take care of us. We spoke to a higher level manager the next day and initially they just offered breakfast passes to another restaurant on lower floor. We still wanted to not bother and just get a refund. They claimed they couldn't because we booked through 3rd party, Agoda. They did act like they wanted to try and make things right though, and after a lot of back and forth, they promised us an executive suite along with a discount in rate. We left for the day, agreed we wouldn't check out, to come back and find that they didn't give us the suite, they just moved us to a corner room that was older and then said they wouldn't honor the discount. They just flat out lied to us and we just wasted a day working with them, dealing with stress of this whole situation, to then have them pull back on what they promised us. They also said they wouldn't refund us if we wanted to leave, so I went and complained to Agoda that we just received the worst customer experience we had ever faced, and Agoda went ahead and refunded us, no problems at all. We still gave the hotel another chance to try and make it right, now that their excuse of not being able to do anything due to being through a 3rd party booking no longer applies, but they still wouldn't honor it. On top of all of this, the manager was downright disrespectful to me. He only agreed to speak to my family member for some reason, and I was the person that booked the rooms for our family while I was there for work. When I tried to speak to him, he flat out ignored what I had to say and even turned his back on me. It was downright the most disrespectful treatment I'd ever experienced. They liked to claim they were a 5 star hotel, but a big reason for getting a 5 star rating is service, and their service was the worst I could have ever imagined. It was such an anomaly as we have found service in Japan to be wonderful. Since it was late in the day, we checked out the next morning and went over to the Westin, which was absolutely wonderful and they catered to families and treated us with true 5 star service from a 5 star hotel. It truly was a shame, as I'll be back for work and my company's Japan office was a short walk from the hotel, but I definitely will never stay here again and would highly urge anyone else with families to avoid as well.","San Francisco, California, United States",23,1.0

It also helped that they are an Accor partner hotel so I could earn some decent points for my 6D5N stay. PRICE - really expensive and the only reason I could only stay here was because 3 nights out of 5 were borne as business. My total stay was JPY 196,736 (est SGD2,380) and I opted to upgrade to the Tower Floor for another total of JPY36,828 (est SGD450) as the cost would have been almost the same if I add 2x breakfast to the base rate. So my total was about SGD600 per night! That upgrade gave me breakfast and access to the Executive Salon but still, this is one of the most expensive non-suite rooms I have ever stayed in. Note that the rates are a little lower if you book through their website proper instead of the Accor website. LOCATION - right smack in Shibuya and the towering height makes it too hard to miss, plus a good navigating point if you get lost in the area. 5mins-10mins walk from Shibuya station and a quick walk brings you to the middle of the action. GETTING HERE - Super easy after a little research. After getting out of the arrival hall, grab your airport limousine bus tickets from the counter, go to the correct bus stop number (they will check your ticket again), and get on while they load your luggage. Get down when they announce Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel. Must easier than attempting the train! CHECK IN - was super happy the room was already available at 11am+ and process was courteous and seamless. I had also ordered a box of items to be collected upon my arrival and was impressed that the hotel even allows such transactions for the brand (payment was made to hotel upon checkout)ROOM - I got 3302 (twin beds) and the the size was adequate for 2 ladies with big luggage. Cleanliness was top notch, and so as the toiletries offered in the bathroom. L'occitane toiletries was def a bonus! Super comfy beds but the a/c takes a while to get the room comfortable enough. EXECUTIVE SALON - I had access to the Executive Lounge and most times it was never crowded, even at breakfast. Service was always polite and attentive. But the cocktail hours had a poor showing in terms of the quality and quantity offered - pre-packed cheeses and dried fruits, nuts, and cookies but no other cold and hot items. I understand that its not supposed to be dinner food but with the other properties offering much more, its always good to stay competitive. Coffee was good though. Bonus points for champagne available during cocktail hours. I also had a bad breakfast experience one morning but I've corresponded with the management directly so not going to repeat here - essentially about flexibility and offering options to guests. FACILITIES - I paid JPY1,080 (SGD15) to check out their indoor pool, really nice with a adjourning jacuzzi. But I found it really strange to have to pay to use the facilities with a $600 per night room.CHECK OUT - Swift and painless. SERVICE - not too bad except for my crappy breakfast experience. This will be my first choice if I come to Shibuya again but the prices makes it really hard for it to be an easy choice.","Singapore, Singapore",176,4.0

We were also ecstatic when we got a complimentary upgrade to the executive level. Maybe it's because we were staying on a Monday to Wednesday. We didn't get the executive amenities, but we were very happy with our room. The executive room was impeccable. More westernized and larger than any other rooms we had stayed at in Tokyo. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. The whole room was spotless. And to top it all the city view from the room was awesome. We were able to see the famous Shibuya crossing, and I was so in awe by the city lights. Service was also great. After checking in, we had a bellhop who also gave us a brief tour of our room and showing our amenities. Front desk was also very helpful. One even tried helping us make a dinner reservation. Another one was able to assist us in reserving spots on the airport shuttle for the next day. That was the best decision we ever made. It's much easier than taking the subways to get to the Narita Airport. The bus picked us up at the hotel and took us directly to Narita. It's honestly the best way to travel to and from the airport for families with children too.","Sunnyvale, California",10,5.0

It was worth the wait - the view from our room was absolutely stunning, overlooking some of Tokyo's sights including Shibuya crossing and Tokyo Skytree. At night the view was even more spectacular! The room was an excellent size and spotlessly clean, with a generous supply of toiletries and bottled water. Despite being in the centre of Shibuya, there was no traffic noise and we were not disturbed at all by other guests. We didn't eat at the hotel during our stay as we felt there were more reasonably priced alternatives available elsewhere, but there seemed to be a wide range of dining options available.

(Shinjuku is also really convenient but felt way more crowded - like Times Sq before the pedestrian areas) (7-Eleven downstairs in the building)Rooms are modern and clean. Unfortunately, my husband and two kids had to split into two rooms because two double bed configurations don't exist but they did give us two joining rooms which was nice but not very economical for us. The hotel itself does not have a lot of personality - felt like a nice business hotel that could be anywhere in the world. So here's the most interesting part of our stay - we were there during a 6.9 magnitude earthquake. Being from CA, I am not particularly afraid of earthquakes but being in a high rise during one is a whole new experience. I think the buildings are meant to move with the quake so an already long earthquake was made extra lengthy. I woke up at 5 am and it felt like I was on a Caribbean booze cruise. The rolling went on so long that I scanned the room for potential falling items (absolutely nothing), checked on my kids in the next room(still asleep) and looked out the window (locals walking to work totally chill) and we were still rolling. When I opened the door, we found crazed Americans running around heading for the stairs so we decided better safe than sorry although by then the movement had stopped. After grabbing our kids and trudging down 31 flights, the hotel staff kindly told us we were safe and could head back to our room in the elevator or hang out in the lobby if we felt more comfortable - with a gentle reminder that they do have alarms if we actually needed to evacuate. I noticed we lost my daughters sneaker at some point and asked a staff member to keep an eye out for it. We quickly went back to our room and back to bed. Five hours later we get a call that the staff had searched the lobby and all the stairwells for the missing sneaker with apologies that they could not locate it anywhere but they would continue to search and wanted to know our exact path downstairs. A quick search in our room revealed it was behind our door. Oops. (Don't worry, we quickly called back to call off the search) Tldr- that building is earthquake safe and service is almost too good!

It's a 5-10 min walk to Shibuya, and just a couple of stations away from Shinjuku which makes it very conveniently located. Access to the airport is also very convenient - can either take the airport bus or the JR line (JR Shibuya station is just a 5 mins walk from the hotel).The rooms and bathroom were clean and nice, and by Asian standards, also very spacious, so it was a very comfortable stay.

We had already stayed in other hotels in Tokyo and this one was by far the most expensive and so we had prepared ourselves for a bit of luxury however it hardly met that expectation and the front desk staff did not provide the warm welcome weary travelers were looking for - it did seem the hotel catered mostly to business guests so perhaps the service style wasn't quite what we were accustomed to. Without going into the ins and outs of our check-in woes, we were informed that we had been upgraded rooms as they had oversold the standard room we had booked and we would be given a key card to access our floor from the elevator - it was highlighted to us we could not use any amenity afforded to those who had booked the more expensive rooms and that it was an upgrade in room only which was fine for us, we would have been happy with the room we booked.Anyway, our 'upgraded' room did not seem to have anything extra over and above a standard room and the only positive I can give is that it was large for Tokyo hotel room standards however still small and not exactly spacious. Cleanliness was okay and comfort was so-so, however having stayed in comparable hotels in other areas of Japan (such as Osaka) this hotel was severely lacking. I understand Osaka and Tokyo are completely different cities, however the idea of a luxury hotel in Tokyo is completely different from Osaka and this hotel did feel rather basic, but with a large price tag and they had completely neglected the small details that make an expensive stay at a premium hotel worthwhile. The restaurants and bars located inside the hotel were absolutely extortionate and room service prices were actually pretty comical which placed dining or drinking inside the hotel way out of our budget - had there been at least one affordable option we may have dined in. The location is pretty good in terms of transport, shopping and dining, however I did much prefer staying in the Shinjuku area - but that is just personal preference, there was more that appealed to us in Shinjuku than Shibuya. Overall, I personally think the hotel is overpriced for what they deliver and that there are more affordable hotels in the area that offer the same standard as the Cerulean Tower does and the customer service is hardly a redeeming feature of the hotel - we experienced far better in other hotels in Tokyo, many much cheaper than the stay we booked here.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom",54,3.0

Sometimes they miss booking note on their desk, so that my guest will be putted back for the confirmation of booking, which takes long.Simply as their system is out-dated, or maybe just laziness, everything takes longer than I expect. When I ask something to concierge and desk for confirmation, they are always afraid of being accused, or gives me skeptical glance with the atmosphere of ""defense"".Japan is not the place to do legal fight, not quite sure why they are not so confident as staffs for luxury hotels.If you don't mind about cost and location, I'd suggest Grand Hyatt Roppongi or Park Hyatt Shinjuku, you'd better to have better experience.

They have done a great job of maintaining this property which is in the heart of Shibuya within a 3 minute walk to the train station. The rooms were very nice with great views of the city (get the bathroom with the window over the tub) and the service is always wonderful. If you're a frequent Tokyo visitor, you know how nice it is to have a 7-11 tucked on the second floor of the building for easy ATM's, snacks, and whiskey highballs in a can. We had drinks a couple of times at the Italian restaurant on the second floor--go see Sunny at the bar, he's awesome.As for location, I just don't think you can do much better in Tokyo than the Cerulean. Shibuya is fun to walk around, and it's also a super easy walk to Harajuku, Aoyoma, and Naka Meguro. The train station is big enough that you can get everywhere easily, including catching the NEX to the airport and the Shinkansen to Kyoto, etc. I've looked at pricier hotels that look super swank, but they just aren't located all that great, and the Cerulean feels way nicer than its price.

I had heard that the Cerulean hotel in Shibuya is a good bet. Not in the middle of the frenetic footfall but close enough to be near the cool factor. The hotel is certainly well located and the price point is value for money. We took a large corner room that was huge and great for lounging. It was the little things that let us down. The stuffy bedrooms even after maintenance checked it twice. The lack of turn down service. The fact that the massage service could only be booked from 4pm and you could only contact them from 4pm. The knowledgeable but unwelcoming concierge service. The weak hairdryer. It was like they got the architecture right but the experience of hotel guests was an overthought. Which is fine in a business hotel where harried guests just want a wake up call and an early breakfast. By any other standards, it was a good stay. But this is my 8th trip to Japan, where the level of courtesy (from bellboys to random strangers helping you find your way on the street) and hotel service makes every other guest relations officer look like a warden keeping discipline in a super max prison.

Very easy access to the station and the shops of Shibuya. We had a standard room on the 26th floor, and because Tokyo is so vast, I suspect the views are equally incredible regardless of which side of the building they're on.The hotel is what one would expect of a business hotel in a city - nothing special, although having seen a number of 4* hotels with extremely small bathrooms and rooms in Tokyo I was a bit worried, but this was not a problem here. As it's pretty standard though, I just wanted to share a few 'be aware' notes:- We booked on Hotels.com which is usually really good at small print, but the hotel had not told them (I guess) that there was an additional charge - I think about Y2000 ppn - to use the pool and gym. I was extremely angry because it was one of the reasons we booked that hotel, and they were not even slightly apologetic. However, on pushing a bit, we were told that signing up to a Japanese hotel loyalty scheme they would give us free access for the duration of our stay - well worth doing!- The bar on the top floor - like many upmarket hotel bars in Tokyo, we later discovered - charged a cost just to be seated, even for guests. This was fairly pricey, so just be aware if you want to go and take in the view of the crossing (which is pretty cool, but not worth the price of two extra cocktails when you can just walk up there and take a look!). They also didn't do nibbles with drinks, which seemed unnecessarily stingy!- The restaurants attached to the hotel are - unsurprisingly - really expensive, but the one we went to (the Italian) was not worth it at all. We only went there because it was late and we needed to eat, but in hindsight should have just crossed the street!- The hotel pool does not allow access to people with tattoos!

The bathroom was spacious, but could have done with a bit more space for placing your personal toiletries. I enjoyed the large bath. The one thing that really let it down was a pervading smell of cigarette smoke in our non-smoking room. I couldn't tell if the precious occupant had been smoking or if it had been circulating from smoking rooms via the air conditioning. As a non-smoker and an asthmatic it was quite noticeable.

The room was a good size and clean. The staff was very helpful and helped coordinate a plan to send our luggage to our next hotel while we traveled to Kyoto. After busy days of sightseeing it was so nice to return to a neighborhood we loved. We could casually wander Shibuya for an hour or so without it becoming a stressful thing. We also really enjoyed getting drinks at the bar at night. Great view. It was a five minute walk to Shibuya Station which was such a hub. So many lines ran through there. Later in the trip we stayed at the Park Hyatt and though that is a beautiful hotel, there wasn't much to do in the neighborhood and the nearest subway station wasn't that conducive to easy travel around town.

First for 4 nights and then again our last night in Tokyo in a different type of room (notes on both below). Overall the hotel is really nice, but definitely a business hotel. It's located very close to Shibuya Crossing and the train station--you become very intimately acquainted with the overpass bridge to go back and forth from the hotel to the train. The location is key as many trains stop here and you can get almost anywhere with this as a starting point. The concierge was not as helpful as would have liked though. I expected quick recommendations but they looked things up online and one time suggest a restaurant in a mall food court (for the record there's nothing wrong with food court restaurants but this one was not very good and it was my husbands birthday).Our first room, room 3318 on the 33rd floor. Great room--small and very clean. There is a large window that you can look out while laying on the bed and we had a view of Mt Fuji (when it wasn't hazy). Comfy bed, hard pillows (one of which has weird pearl type things in it, I didn't like it when sleeping on my side). Medium sized bathroom, nice L'Occitane amenities, no counter space. You have to use your room key to access this floor (which makes you feel special) and you get free breakfast in the morning which was insanely helpful every day. Breakfast is good, not great. LOVE the coffee/latte machine! Free internet was ok, worked but couldn't stream anything (that's probably the point).Our second room, 2208 (I think that was the number). Very clean much bigger than the other room. It had the biggest bed I've ever seen in my entire life! The bed was very comfy with ok pillows (same as other room). The bathroom was quite large, tons of counter space and a separate ""room"" with the shower tub. This shower did not have an ""American"" shower where the shower head is over the tub with a shower curtain. We stood in the tub while holding the shower head over us. Amenities are good but not L'Occitane. The thing that killed me in this room was that if you need an iron, you have to rent it from the hotel. The other room had an iron in it. No special room key access for this floor, makes you feel like a plebian when you're in the elevator with someone who has special floor access. Had a view of Tokyo Tower which was great! No breakfast with this room but that was fine because we were going to the fish market for breakfast. Free internet was ok, worked but couldn't stream anything (that's probably the point).Overall, I would stay here again in Japan and recommend it to others.","San Francisco, California",10,5.0

The place is bustling and efficient as well as near various shopping areas. Had ordered from Amazon Japan and the box was promptly handed to me as I checked in. The luggage service was prompt and pleasant. We had opted to splurge on a room with access to the 33rd floor executive lounge instead of doing the group rate. The room we had turned out to be smaller than one of the rooms for the group and more expensive but bed and pillows were super comfortable.. The executive lounge is a treat though with great views including Mt. Fuji on a clear day. The people in the lounge couldn't have been more helpful. Breakfast there was lovely. Afternoon tea was meager as far as food but great if you happened to be a big drinker as booze is free of course.My one complaint: when we checked in they advised they were totally sold out and although the room was quite small and there were stains on the carpet, we were too tired to say anything. I expected that the stains would be taken care of by the next day but nothing was done. As we were there for business, we were seldom in the room and only thought to mention it as we checked out.

We stayed here two years ago and loved it, but the price had increased substantially since then , so we opted to stay first at the Ecxcel Tokyo this time, with just our last two nights here.Really loved the amazing service as soon as you approach reception. The hotel seems to have a swarm of people to serve you as soon as you arrive, and the staff are genuinely friendly and helpful. We stayed in a twin room on the 20th floor, and had a huge corner room which was very light and bright.Our only concern was the strange noise which periodically came from the bathroom throughout our stay. We couldn't work out whether this was someone flushing a toilet or emptying a bath on another floor, but it was certainly a loud noise. We didn't worry too much about this though.The breakfast buffet was reasonably expensive ( around A$40 pp ), but quite good, with freshly squeezed orange juice, good pastries, and all the usual breakfast options. If I was deciding on future bookings whether or not to pay a breakfast inclusive rate, I'd probably opt for no breakfast, as it was nice to do for a couple of days, but after that I think I'd just head to Starbucks where you can get a reasonable coffee, fruit, yoghurt with granola and a juice for around $15-$20 pp.All in all, this is a really nice hotel with a great location, but if the price keeps escalating, I'd go to the Shibuya Excel which is considerably cheaper.","Melbourne, Australia",88,5.0

We had prebooked the Airport Limousine Bus which goes directly from Haneda Airport to this hotel but as our flight was late and we ended up arriving after midnight so we could not use our prebooked ticket.

It's a quick walk over the pedestrian bridge into Shibuya and all the restaurants and nightlife. But be warned, with luggage it's a haul, especially after a long flight. Best to take the Limousine Bus which drops you right at the hotel. The hotel is also great proximity to some more residential neighborhoods for more quaint cafes and restaurants (Tomigaya and Daikanyama neighborhoods are worth a visit). The views from the hotel are outstanding, especially from the top floor bar. It's expensive but worth a drink, especially on a Saturday night when you have prime view of the Shibuya Crossing.We had a corner room which was very large for Tokyo standards. It had a large bench seat along the picture window that our 4 year old would play at for hours, taking in the views. The beds are double beds, which are small by American standards but manageable. The bathroom was luxurious and again had fabulous views.The service was top notch. Emails prior to arrival were promptly answered. We accidentally left our daughter's stuff animal behind and housekeeping located her prized possession and quickly mailed it to us.

Hotel location and accommodations had great reviews. Nightly rate was a little higher than other hotels in the vicinity. However, when planning a family trip, didn't want to save few dollars and be miserable for the duration of the trip. We have booked two queens with the two minors for the room (2 nights). Upon checking-in front desk lady said you need to book an extra room because you have only indicated two adults on reservation. So she reserved an additional room on a totally separate level at additional $500/per night. At this moment, my comment was we are here on a family vacation. You are expecting us to be in two different rooms? How about upgrading to a suite so we can be together? Front desk lady's comment was ""we are sold out with suites."" She showed no effort to accommodate and when I asked her to cancel the EXTRA room, she threw the credit card back at us. I told her, I would rather find another hotel in the vicinity for the two members of our family than book an additional room here at this hotel.

It is not cheap but for the location and service we had from everyone at the hotel, we have no complaints. Couple suggestions. Order your sim card with unlimited internet access before arrival to Japan. Pick up at post office in airport. Works with iPhone, not sure about Android. Make sure you have Whatsapp on every phone of your family before arrival. Your itunes account will not be accessible. Google maps is a must to get around.Know your location in relation to other places you plan to visit before arrival to Japan.

The hotel is also a good starting point for walking trips to other neighborhoods.The hotel itself was a bit disappointing, especially compared to the price.

For us the Cerulean Towers ticked the boxes- but not without a bit of re-work after we arrived. Once we got sorted we had an excellent stay. I would easily stay here again. We are a family of 3. That is, we travel with a teenager. If you have one you understand. These fascinating creatures have different needs and requirements than others in our species. A new adventure can be life-changing. Afterward you might be amazed to hear them tell friends and family how awesome the trip was because during the experience they seemed to prefer to be anywhere else much of the time. Gotta love 'em. We love dragging our teen around the world, but we also love that they are old enough to entertain themselves at times. That said, sharing a hotel room has reached it's term limit. Beds in Tokyo hotel rooms, it turns out, use ""double"" and ""single"" differently. And getting a room for 3 is a non-starter. If you are a couple you will have 2 beds (a double). A single is one bed, small or large. We arrived to our room after exchanging emails asking to have our room prepared for 3 only to discover a chaotic nightmare of beds/tables/chairs crammed together to suit our request. Sharing a room with a teen for a week is daunting enough. This was going to break even the most unified of families. Luckily, Cerulean Towers rose to the occasion. We sifted our reservation to two rooms, a single room and double, which ended up costing only slightly more than the ""triple"". The extra cost made the trip a pleasure for everyone that combined family time with a getaway.  During the day we adventured everywhere by foot and train. The station is not nearly as daunting as I feared. Most things are written in English somewhere. Just leave yourself plenty of time to find your way and figure out the ticket-buying machine. For dinner nearby the hotel there is a hill just behind it that is filled with fantastic tiny Izakaya places, as well as all kinds of other places including Indian and even an American-style diner. We ate at local Japanese places and the food was fabulous and super local.  In-room amenities were excellent which makes packing light. For me that alone almost earns a hotel 5 stars. Razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, as well as the usual shampoo, etc. are all provided and good quality. I was thrilled. But just in case you forgot something, there is a large 7-11 in the hotel and the concierge is fantastic. I had them purchase tickets for me to a museum I wanted to attend (that only sold tix in Japan) and they had them waiting on check-in.  Do stop in the upstairs bar, Bello Visto. The bartender, Park (?) is working on his Aviation which happens to be one of my favorite classic cocktails. They have a good selection of Japanese whiskey and a view that has to be one of the best anywhere in the world.","Boulder, Colorado",109,5.0

Most speak English and those who do not try and make sure they understand you and you understand them.Food (4/5):Though I ate here only twice, I was impressed both times. The coffee shop and the Mediterranean restaurant were good. The Chinese restaurant seemed to have a decent spread and the rooftop had a great view. Prices are on the higher side though !Rooms (4/5): The rooms were decently sized. I was lucky to get a room on the 30th floor, overlooking Mt Fuji. The view was mesmerizing during sunsets, and it let me see Mt Fuji every single morning when I woke up right from my bed. The temperature control was effective and fast, the toilet seats were heated, the bathtub and shower were cozy as well. The only low point was the wifi speed, it was terrible to say the least. Luckily they also had an Ethernet connection in the room, the speed for which was decent enough to be used for my work. Check in (2/5): I flew in from a Bombay red eye flight with a total 14 hour door to door commute and expected to just crash in the room. I was told by every single colleague who has taken the same flight and stayed at cerulean that they ""do not"" give an early check in. Just as expected, I was told to come back to the hotel at 2pm as the room isn't ready yet (I was there at 9am). Check out (5/5): Checkout at 6am was a smooth process and took under 5 minutes. The porter desk also helped arrange tickets for the morning bus back to Narita.Overall, I was super happy with the stay and would definitely want to visit and stay here again. I just wish they allow early check-in and improve their wifi speeds. ","Munich, Germany",107,4.0

The Shibuya location is great for getting around the city either via taxi or metro. 5 min walk to the famed Shibuya crossing. 15 min taxi to Shinjuku and 10 min to Harajuku, rush hour not withstanding. Excellent location with Tokyo hot spots right near the hotel.  We initially where booked into a king room on a tower floor. These rooms included the executive lounge access. The regular king rooms are small, with small bathroom including glass enclosed shower tub combo. The King Corner room is the best bet, 3 different picture windows including a bathtub window view. The room size is comfortable including couch seating area, desk area, and bathroom with dbl sink, soaking tub, and separate glass enclosed shower.   The hotel website was a bit confusing as there are numerous different types of rooms. I'd suggest the hotel streamline the room categories if they could. We were initially booked into a regular king room and switched to a corner king after one night. The ease at which we were able to switch rooms made me think this might happen with some frequency.   The executive lounge located on the 35th floor was intimate yet well appointed. Holding approx 35-40 people, the lounge never felt crowded. The wall of picture windows lets you enjoy breakfast with Mt. Fuji in view on a clear day. The breakfast was a combination Japanese, American, European. Something for most everyone. I suggest getting to breakfast early as you'll want to linger in the picture window seating and soak up the vibe.  All around solid chose of home base to tour Toyko.

The rooms are very quiet, with Tempur-pedic beds, great pillows, and curtains that shut out 100% of the lights, so that you get a really deep sleep after your exhausting days in Tokyo! We ate breakfast almost every morning at Denny's, which is about a 5 minute walk through an interesting neighborhood. You have to go to the Nanpeidai Denny's (not the Shibuya Denny's), which Google Maps will guide you to. Don't use Google Maps inside of the ""scramble area"" of Shibuya because the tall buildings will block the signal. But when going to the Nanpeidai Denny's, which is in the direction away from the ""scramble,"", there was no problem following the Google Maps directions. So, about Denny's: we found that they serve a really nice American breakfast set for only 549 yen, including great coffee. That's quite a bit less than the 3,000 yen breakfast at the hotel! We also found out that Denny's is considered at the top quality of breakfast places in Japan. If you're short on time, you can pick up breakfast the 7-11 and have them heat it up for you when you buy it. The other tidbit is to utilize their concierge service as much as possible. Aside from one concierge lady who never smiled and and who gave the most minimalist answer to any question you asked her, the people were very helpful to give advice about anything from which trains to take to where to purchase certain things. If the lady is sitting there, just ask the porters- they were very helpful too. Every hotel in Tokyo charges for swimming/exercise facilities. I think that in Tokyo it is not considered a normal activity. I know that when we stayed in Odawara and Takeyama it was included, however.

I'm sure the one is wonderful, but we never experienced it as they wanted an extra ¥2,500 per person. We were already paying ¥270,000 for 3 nights (2 rooms) so we didn't bother. I think this policy is dreadful in a modern international hotel. I'm not even sure if the cost was per stay or per dip!As a less significant second gripe, I needed 5 small gifts wrapping for some business colleagues. Having little time I asked the concierge to do it for me. It took two attempts and even included a few attempts at Japanese, but both people made me feel like it was a lot to ask. I must say that they came back looking really nice once they had agreed and only charged ¥550, so not all bad, but I have come to expect better service in Japan. The hotel location is close to Shibuya junction and the views of Mt Fuji were nice, but I would not recommend it. ","Shrewsbury, United Kingdom",5,1.0

The gym is small, and they charge for it ($20) , unless you want to go between 6 to 7 AM, not my idea of a good time, but maybe for some. The exective lounge is great for cocktails and hors d’oeuvres, but the breakfast offerings are average at best and don’t change at all. By day three, you’re ready to go somewhere else for breakfast to not die from boredom or monotony. Lastly, the front desk staff is rigid regarding a late checkout, wanting to charge us $3000 yen for an extra hour after we spent a week at the hotel paying top dollar!

It costs a little bit more, but generally in Japan, you get what you pay for. I've been to Japan four times and tried countless hotels, and this is the place I always choose to stay. Please trust me and splurge a little for this hotel, as it will make your Tokyo trip that much better.First of all, the location is absolutely ideal. It is minutes away from Shibuya station, which will easily get you anywhere in Tokyo. However, it is also on the edge of Shibuya, so away from the craziness for when you want to relax peacefully. On the other hand, if you're feeling restless, you can cross a bridge and be in the middle of it all. I highly recommend checking out Shibuya late night, as it turns into something different with merry, drunk youngsters barely able to walk.Room is large by Japanese standards. Bathroom is exquisite with granite showers. Bed is absolutely huge and comfortable. Air conditioning/heating works well. You also get spectacular views of the city from your window.Hotel staff is polite and also warm and friendly. Everything from check-in and baggage handling was great. There is also a 7-11 on the second floor for everything else the hotel cannot provide.One last tip, it is definitely possible to take the Narita airport express to Shibuya and walk to the hotel. However, if you want to do that, make sure you are adequately prepared to find the hotel, as it is a few pedestrian overpasses away and involves scaling some hilly sidewalks. Also, the Shibuya station is usually crazy busy, so take that into account if you plan on traveling with large luggage (it could be a stressful experience if you're lost). Don't be shy and ask the information desks which station exit to use and follow the signs. Alternatively, you can take the airport ""limousine bus"" directly to the hotel which is much easier.","Santa Ana, California",7,5.0

It's just a few minutes walk from the main station there, so the location was excellent in that respect. However, we did find ourselves having to cross to the other side of the highway (via elevated crosswalk) for almost all of our Shibuya destinations, so places that seemed to be just a few minutes away were a bit more than that.With that being said, I didn't see anything too comparable on the other side, so the Cerulean might be as good a hotel as any. Our room was large and decorated very tastefully, and our city view went on for miles, so it really felt like we were perched on the top of Tokyo at times.The breakfast was fairly pricy, but very excellent. For those wanting to start their day like a local, it was a peaceful, zenned-out way to do so.The concierge was helpful in calling some restaurants we had researched, but the one Izakaya that they recommended was the worst meal of our entire trip, so I wonder if they're advice might be skewed, or just dated.

The room (corner) was huge, well laid out, & was made of high quality materials--I.e. Everything was crisp and clean despite the hotel being 15 yrs old. The granite bathroom was particularly handsome & luxurious. I agree with other reviewers that it is a bit niggardly of them to charge for in room coffee. I found the service to be completely in keeping with expectations. It is located in afar more interesting neighborhood than most 5 star hotels and is a far greater value. Very pleased!

The hotel is located a few minutes from Shibuya Station, but we had some difficulties to actually get to the hotel with our luggage. Being spoilt by another hotel in Tokyo that offers a meet&greet service at the station, Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel kindly answered me by email that the hotel is to be found at the west exit of the Shibuya Station, nothing else. No mention which high rising building it actually is, how to get over the fly-overs outside the station or where the entrance to the hotel is. After some asking (luckily I had the name of the hotel printed in Japanese) and searching around, we finally got to the lobby of the hotel, where we were literally asked by a bellboy what we were doing there? We guess he was still learning English, because what would people with a suitcase be doing at the reception of a hotel? Anyway, we were checked in professionally, but we could not really feel as welcome as in other hotels in Japan. We were taken to the executive floor and when entering the room, our first reaction was really ""whow"". The views from the room to Odaiba, the sea and Yokohama were incredible by daylight and even better by night. When staying here, one can probably easily skip a visit to the Tokyo Sky Tree, you get the views here from your bed. The room itself was spacious and clean, the same for the bathroom, the colour scheme maybe a bit dull in different shades of dark brown. Unfortunately, the rooms are a bit noisy.Contrary to our impression at the lobby, the staff at the executive lounge was really great, helpful and friendly, the choice at happy hour and breakfast good enough for moderate eaters. We thought it was worthwhile to choose a room at the executive level, we sincerely enjoyed staying here.At the last day of our stay and holidays, we wanted to print our boarding pass, but this turned out to be quite an adventure. It could not be done at the executive lounge, so we were sent down to the lobby, where we were informed that we would have to wait until the business center was available. We could not be informed how long this would take (depended on the person using it) and we could not make a reservation neither. We decided to come back later, but we were lucky, at the moment we wanted to leave, the business center was free. We were informed the use of the computer costs 500 yen per 15 minutes plus 45 yen per printed page. This seemed quite expensive if you look at the price you already pay per night at the executive floor, but we had no choice, so we accepted. The ""business center"" is a separate room with 2 computers, one Japanese and one international and a printer. We tried desperately to connect to the internet, but nothing happened, had to search for staff to help, to find out that the entire computer had been turned off. When we finally got to print our boarding passes, the printer did not work and we needed once more help from the staff. The printer was out of ink... We needed almost 25 minutes to get something as simple as printing 2 pages done. Because of these problems, we did not have to pay for the use of the internet, only for the use of the paper, so that was a nice gesture. We were on holidays, so this was no big deal, but we would be extremely unsatisfied if we would be on a business trip and would need to use the business center for something really important. The location of the hotel is very central, it is practical to be able to take the shuttle to Haneda airport from the basement of the hotel (difficult to find), but the service at the lobby makes us wonder if we would choose the Cerulean Tower again, specially if taking the price into consideration.It is thanks to the staff at the executive lounge that we rate this hotel at ""very good"" instead of ""average"".","Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",96,4.0

The rooms are adequate, but they miss that extra caring touch that makes all the difference in hotels of this class. One particular annoyance was the lack of clarity about the tea and coffee making facilities. From the in-room price list, it seemed as if we were actually supposed to pay for tea bags and coffee !!! We complained about this, and were assured that it wasn't the case. However, when we checked out, they did indeed attempt to charge us for the coffee.

I will say that we had come from the Marriott in Osaka, so Cerulean Towers had big boots to fill... Which unfortunately they didn't quite fill..Quite a pleasant room on the 28th floor, nice views over Shibuya station/scramble way - even had a brief view of Mt Fuji when the smog lifted one morning which was uplifting. However our first impression on arriving to check in was to be told that the pool/gym were not included in our stay... Considering the cost of our stay I think that was a less than stellar start. Move forward to our room - no complimentary coffee! Even cheap dives I've stayed in have complimentary coffee... (I realize these are small gripes overall, but given the price we paid to stay here AND the fact that Marriott Osaka included everything for much less cost - jus' sayin'...) I will say tho that the staff were lovely, housekeeping did a spotless job each time and the hotel was in a great spot for moving around and seeing the sights. I suspect had we have stayed here first instead of elsewhere my review would not be quite so judgmental (tho the lack of coffee thing is crazy, and should be attended to imo)... Bed was comfy, pillows were a bit weird to my taste and the bedside lamps are just annoyingly and immovably in the wrong spot. Very small choice of tv channels. Shower was great, great views from the bath as well. No moisturizer supplied in the complimentary toiletries. Cannot comment on the restaurants, as we did not eat in the hotel - I did find the prices quite high by comparison- but they certainly were beautifully presented. Would've liked to attend the jazz club onsite, but found a fairly pricy cover charge off putting. This was our first trip to Japan, and I understand that the Tokyo area is more expensive (like most cities)...so perhaps I'm judging unfairly between the two hotels in different cities - but I know which one I'd go back to again.

We have travelled to Tokyo and Japan many times and stayed at very different types of locations, first time at Cerulean, and very satisfied. Points to share :1) It is an excellent, comfortable. luxurious hotel , not brand new, but does not feel worn in any sense, well kept; a bit anonymous perhaps, but style is grand.2) Location in Shibuya is nearly ideal, less than 5 minute walk from the station, some uphill and over pedestrian bridges, but has elevator where you need it for luggage. Shibuya station area is under massive reconstruction but this does not pose serious nuisances for staying. Very easy to find the hotel - the tallest building in Shibuya.3) View from our 22 floor room (=not executive or top level) was outstanding - we were lucky to get the city side with all of centre from Shinjuku to Tokyo tower in sight. Even the bathtub had this view - amazing day and night4) It was a 3-person room, of extra size (corner room), but the third bed was just added, not 'built in', so even if space was large for Tokyo it was not like enormous.5) Note: WIFI is now free throughout the hotel, we did not have a special deal.6) No noise to notice from the very busy city below thanks to thick window glazing (aircon worked well and was also quiet)7) Breakfast was Ok fine, nothing grand or exceptional. We had to pay for it , so only did it once, plenty other options nearby8) Surprised we had to pay for the in-room coffee, was not indicated on checklist9) Awesome dinner at elegant European style top restaurant Coucagno (separate review), but also very expensive10) Efficient service (although we did not need much of it), no wait at check-in/out. We got our room around 1 pm, 2 hours before official check-in11) Main drawback. It was expensive! We were a bit late with our bookings so many good cheaper options were gone.

Down a walkway and you are at Shibuya station/ metro station and the famous Shibuya crossing and all the shops.

A young girl insisted on taking my case and showing me to the room and no one expects a tip. The room was fabulous on the 28th floor on a corner with amazing views over the city. We had a huge bathroom, lounge area and two big double beds and there was no noise from within the hotel. Everyone was so happy, helpful and smiley. I can thoroughly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in the city. The only complaint that I would have is that when we went up to the beautiful bar at the top of the hotel we were told that there was a 1300 yen (about £10) charge per person to sit in a comfortable chair at one of the tables even for residents. The only places to sit that did not incur this charge were at the bar or at the back of the bar on high stools. We decided to have some food there with a business colleague one night and even though we had 6 glasses of wine in total and 3 main meals we still had to sit at the bar. The views were spectacular and the atmosphere was super but the next night we ate out as we felt that this was a penny pinching attitude especially when we were spending a lot of money on accommodation and then subsequently more money on food and drink - to expect us to pay £30 on top of this was ridiculous.

Arrived at the hotel door less than an hour drive, I had to figure out which way the hotel entrance, because the bus will drop you at B1, so you wont see the main hotel entrance, luckily saved me the hotel porter, carried my luggage and it was easy check inn, just note that most the porters at the hotel are women, which I had to help her carry my luggage in my room, it wasn't an issue for me, but for some it might be embarrassing especially if your luggage are heavy, the room was nothing but great, the bathroom by it self is a room, separate shower and you have the choice to shower in the tube or standing! , there was a welcome fruit, the view I belief all around the hotel are excellent, why I say that because after four days from my arrival I changed my room just for a change for a view, I had a deferent view were I can see shibuya crossing, Tokyo tower, Yoyogi Park, and most of Tokyo skyscrapers, the A/C in the rooms, the coldest temperature you can get is 20 Celsius the thermostat wont go below this temperature, the hotel location is great, calm with many restaurants and cafes close by, even there is seven eleven supermarket at the hotel building made my stay very comfortable especially for water as the hotel will not provide you with in your room, the hotel staff are very respectful and helpful, as matter of fact that was my first visit to Japan and let me tell you I found not only the hotel staff respectful but most of the Japan people are very respectful from the minuet I arrived at the airport until the minuet I left Japan, nothing bothered me at all, shopping at shibuya is great, if you want women clothing at good price go to Shibuya 109 Department Store's and there is 109 for men close by also, tax free every where in japan, very easy, every shop has its own tax free, right a way, they don't count the tax for you just carry your passport, and if you want Convenience store with groceries & household items, plus take-out sushi, cosmetics & other prepared foods for cheaper prices go to Don Quijote Shibuya, very crowded but it worth the visit, not to forget the Shibuya Station at the Shibuya crossing intersection, where you can visit most of Tokyo by JR or the metro where you can find the Tokyo Subway Navigation for tourist application at the apple store very helpful, but don't forget in the way back to exit from west exit at shibuya station to your hotel, Overall the only thing that I didn't expect from the hotel is that they count my first night that I missed from my late flight at Dubai, which they kept telling me that they will solve it In spite of my call in advance while I am at Dubai.","Kuwait City, Kuwait",22,5.0

In our completely overheated room (2720) the smell got worse and turned into ""mold"" and ""wet dog"". We asked the bellboy to activate a Daikin streamer (cf picture) which was already in the room. (A streamer is especially made for purifying air form bacteria and humidity - we had to look up the machine because the operating panel is only in Japanese).Nothing happened, we called reception and they were sending up a technician. Meanwhile we took a midnight walk in the neighborhood. Upon our return the room was acceptable at the price of having a strong rattling fan noise. So we had to sleep with ear plugs. Everyday, the cleaning lady raised the temperature on the AC and cut off the air purifier. This meant that each time you got back to your room you had an unpleasant situation. This is evidence for blunt money saving at the back of the well being of the client. Dear hotel manager have you ever considered that an unsatisfied client might cost you more than a few marginal gains on the electricity bill. You proudly state having ISO 14001 - go ahead and subscribe green electricity, replace the old generation of air conditioners, clean the filters but don't compromise on hospitality standards!Same misery in the generously sized bathroom. The air extraction is not powerful enough. Humidity and odors stay for hours.Last but not least, the also generously sized closet has no shelves. We had to live out of the open suitcase put on the floor. After 2 days our clothes were as damp as the atmosphere in the room.Check-out was smooth, no eye contact no inquiry about our satisfaction.

Though the hotel is reasonably priced for 5 star in Tokyo (about $500 a night), they make up the balance of their income from what I personally regard as exorbitant prices for ancillaries. Eg: coffee in the restaurant downstairs $10. One load of laundry would have come to $170 but I just washed it myself in the bath. One small bottle of Perrier soda water cost me $13.

Of course, Shibuya has tons of shopping and restaurants as well.The hotel is modern, very clean, with large bathrooms, especially for JP/EU standards. The beds are smaller than US size but fine. Staff speaks English and is super helpful. The concierge can help with tickets, reservations, transportation, etc. There's also a 7-11 convenience store attached to the building (though you have to go outside up the escalator) which is nice.Note that kids 11 and under are ""free"", meaning if they share a bed with there is no charge - i.e. you can have 2 adults and 2 kids in a double room (essentially two double beds). The beds are smaller than US (not Queen size!) - should be fine for the average US 8 year old or under but bigger kids and adults will be cramped.The hotel caters more towards professionals but I'd come back with my family. It can be one of the pricier options but I've always been able to book rooms between $275-$325 a night.","Chicago, Illinois",29,5.0

Their Room Reservations Dept. provides prompt response to my enquiry and their website is very comprehensive. Since we went to Karuizawa before we arrived Tokyo, I enquire about the transfer on JR. And it turned out to be quite convenient with the information they provided.Upon arrival, we are efficiently checked in and we have the whole late afternoon and the evening to spend.Room size is decent with enough space to move around with the 3 of us. We are a family with older children. There are a lot of coffee house, noodle shops, convenient stores... in the vicinity, so we didn't have breakfast at the hotel while we stayed.It's convenient to move around Tokyo from Shibuya. The hotel is strategically located, immediately above the airport bus stop which is also the last stop before getting to Terminal 2 of Narita International Airport. If you are not buying a return ticket of N'EX or haven't arranged anything, it's a bargain to jump on the airport bus. One-way ticket is only 3,100 Yen (adult).It's also very close (5-minute walk) to JR and Tokyo Metro stations. Absolutely no complain at all in every aspect.

I spoke with travel agents who pushed me to choose Keio Plaza or similar hotels and get 2 adjoining rooms. The Sakura suite at cerulean was going to cost more than 2 rooms at Keio. But it was worth it and cost effective. First of all, the kids loved sleeping on futons on the tatami mats every night. The beds were very comfortable. The area was cleaned and changed into a sitting area with a low table every day. The ""king"" sized bed could fit 4 people. The pillows and bed were so comfortable. This is from a pillow snob. My only one high maintenance thing. There is a ton of closet space. The bathroom is amazing- soaking tub for one and shower and of course, the famous high tech toilet. The bath products are L'Occitane. They provide you with toothbrush, razor, hairbrush and more. The outlets accommodate us plugs. The Sakura suite gives you access to club level. So here's the cost analysis: we saved money on breakfast included- not just any breakfast but 4 choices of great breakfast. Choose from buffet which has American and Japanese choices and fresh squeezed orange juice and Nespresso coffee (a favorite), Japanese breakfast at Japanese restaurant ( ceramic bento box tower with soup), club level room buffet or room service. We got 4 bottled waters free every day which was useful for the amount of walking we did. For some of the days, we used the cocktail hour at club level to have a light dinner with Chivas for my hubby. The fitness center/pool was free for us ( only able to use if 18 or over so not for our teens). These amenities saved us hundreds of dollars and made it similar in price but a much nicer room. This goes in the top 3 hotels we have ever stayed at and that keeps company with the St Regis, Four seasons and Ritz. It's worth it. Did I mention the view. Amazing view of Tokyo from our room and club level lounge. Location was easy for travel. Take JR train Yamanote line to Shibuya and exit from south gate (west exit). You walk across pedestrian bridge straight then right ( make diagonal to go across). Don't take New south exit. It was fine with luggage from Narita Express. We each packed carry on bag and a backpack. We packed quick dry clothes and rinsed our clothes out with powder detergent I packed. The bridge has ramp in center so easy to pull bags up. We are fit and used to traveling so it was not bad. But easier would be to take airport shuttle which would drop you to the front of the hotel. I would recommend this if you have bigger bags. Service was great and very friendly staff which keeps place impeccably clean. They will loan umbrellas but we packed small travel ones which I found easier than lugging big ones. 7/11 is on site and can be used to get money from atm. We would definitely stay here again. As an FYI, we went to the Keio plaza for a tour meeting point. Keio is Not the same caliber on how luxurious it looked and much bigger touristy place. This is not to knock Keio. I didn't stay there and it looks like a nice hotel but Cerulean is really first class. ","Orange, Connecticut",61,5.0

Our room on the 30th floor has an incredible view of the city. The room itself is modern, spacious and spa-like with a deep tub, separate shower, cozy robes and slippers, plush pillows that have a cushiony side and a rice/bean side, and long sofa for lounging. Upon entering, the room was quite warm but there's a standalone a/c that fixed that. All the buttons are in Japanese characters but we figured out what worked through trial and error. The staff are all very polite and friendly and speak English. Love the Japanese toilet with bidet/splash/sound features. There are several restaurants and a 7-11 on site. Tried the fitness gym and pool/jacuzzi today. You should definitely check it out. It was practically empty and I got to enjoy their many up-to-date exercise machines, their massage chairs (they have 2), their shallow lap pool with perfectly lukewarm water, and the heated jacuzzi. The pool and jacuzzi offer a view of the city from the 3rd floor. There is a powder room with lots of toiletries, several private showers with Shiseido shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, and a sauna. There are also lockers for your valuables and clothes. A bracelet with a locker key is furnished upon entering the fitness gym. They offer swim caps for the pool to keep the water fresh. Upon entering the pool section, you enter a short hall where a shower automatically rinses you off. I showered ahead of time and bypassed the extra shower by just walking fast. The fitness room also has a blood pressure machine, water fountain, beverage vending machine, and lots of large and small towels. I just brought the complimentary water bottle from our room and kept refilling it at the water dispenser in the ladies room, as needed.

Location to Shibuya train station is close and very convenient. And there is a Family Mart just around the corner if you need anything. Lots of shopping and eateries in the area. Staff were very polite and friendly. The Haneda or Narita airport limousine buses stop here so thats a plus! My only small complaint would be that no complimentary water/coffee/tea was made available to us in the room. And breakfast is not included in the room rate and for us, I felt it was not worth the additional high cost of having the breakfast.

It would have been so great to hit the hot tub before bed but $21 per person was more for that fun than we felt was reasonable.All that being said, I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.

The room we have been given is very small, extremely dusty (see photos attached) and quite smelly (due to a smoking level). My husband has asthma and both the dust and smoke affect this condition.

Whilst there are other similarly well-located hotels in the Shibuya area, we booked this hotel as the rooms here (all high floors) have a fantastic view of the Tokyo skyline.

Return fare per person for airport limo bus was ¥4,500 - we purchased this at Narita airport).

It is colossal but still retains intricate Japanese touches. Staff were friendly and professional; nothing you wouldn't expect of course. The rooms are extremely spacious yet distinctly cosy. Bed was comfortable with a choice of pillows. The bathroom was modern, and wifi was stable. It's everything you'd need, and more.Overlooking the greater metropolitan area, the comfortable rooms offer a true Tokyo experience. If you can, go for the higher floors.

It is worth stating that for my sister and I visiting Tokyo has been our shared dream and I wanted wherever we stayed to reflect this. It also meant that I had researched the city fairly extensively before arrival and knew almost exactly what I would be getting from the hotel. The Cerulean Tower is a grand, imposing building situated just a 5 minute walk away from Shibuya crossing and if you walk a few minutes more you will hit Shibuya station. Where location is concerned I don't think this hotel can be beaten. From a tourist's perspective I would recommend staying in either Shibuya or Shinjuku because you will become heavily dependent on the excellent train and subway services for sightseeing and both places are connecting points for most of the major lines.We stayed in a superior twin room on the 30th floor with a city view. The room itself was sleek and modern with more than enough storage space for 2 adults with large suitcases. The view from our hotel window was breathtaking. The bathroom was also tastefully decorated with a large bath and separate shower area. The sink was inbuilt into what looked like a large dressing table. The mirror was huge and the whole area was well lit and ideal for applying make up. It is worth commenting on the size of the room and bathroom. These were extremely large by Tokyo standards. I wasn't able to find anything bigger in Shibuya. I note that other reviewers have complained about noise. This was not an issue on the 30th floor. If anything it was deathly silent.I found all the hotel staff to be quiet, meticulous and helpful. Whilst it was clear that English was not their first language, they were more than capable of dealing with requests if you spoke slowly in simple sentences. Checking in was quick and seamless. The concierge staff were also brilliant when I needed to organise an Airport Limousine bus back to the airport. Cerulean Tower is a direct stop for this service, which provides very convenient transport to and from Narita/Haneda airport. I can't comment on the hotel wifi because I never used it. I bought a pocket wifi package as soon as I touched down in Narita airport and this served us very well. I would highly recommend doing this if you are planning to do serious sightseeing as wifi in many areas of Tokyo is not free, streets are not well signposted and you will become pretty dependent on Google maps.I would agree with other reviewers who think that for a hotel of this calibre you are not getting as much bang for your buck as you might elsewhere. Hotel dining is expensive and the gym/sauna facilities are not free and apparently cannot be used by under 18s. Neither of these things were an issue for us as we had 8 days of jam-packed sightseeing and wanted to spend as little time as possible in the hotel. You can also easily find very cheap, high quality food when eating out in Tokyo. The only thing I took issue with is that water is not complimentary. For a 5 star hotel I think that is pretty shocking. There were a few criticisms of the hotel on this site, which I thought were unfair. I can't comment on individual experiences with staff but to say they generally lacked warmth seems a strange point to raise when the Japanese are known to be quiet, respectful and very helpful but not particularly warm or effusive. I also don't understand those who complained that the cost of hotel dining and charges/restrictions on the gym were not made clear to them. Cerulean Tower has a very well laid out, user friendly website, which quite clearly stated all of this. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is pretty self-sufficient and would prioritise a great location, large room and an outstanding view, with no real desire to lean heavily on the hotel amenities.","Glasgow, United Kingdom",9,5.0

Latest stay was in a King Sky room for two nights. Location near Shibuya station and as a Narita Express stop makes this a good choice. As usual the service was excellent - check-in, attentive staff, making things easy. This included checking the housekeeping/room service was done to our satisfaction.The room had a slightly different layout to some of the others I have stayed in - more like a semi-corner because of windows on two sides. There was also space for a sofa which was comfortable and quite sunny for reading the morning paper. The other plus was the small luggage/dressing room/walk-in wardrobe space which meant the suitcase wasn't cluttering the room like so many other places.On the minus side, it is an expensive hotel and I wouldn't consider it if I had to pay full price - normally they sell rooms around half price. Using the in-room coffee seems expensive, and I don't dine in-house with a JPY3000 price tag for breakfast. Probably other people don't mind the cost.",Japan,72,5.0

There were 3 families travelling together and had booked all rooms as Dble/Twin City views.The property itself is very good, well presented with large public spaces and large rooms by Tokyo standards. Very easy to get to and from. I'd suggest using the Airport Limo Bus rather than the train. Similar cost and time but the Bus is so much more convenient, and not dragging baggage around is much easier.Firstly the property did put our rooms together on the same floor as requested. The staff are very efficient but I can't say that they are helpful or understanding. Perhaps it's a cultural thing, but the word 'sorry' was said alot without any real meaning.It took over 40 mins to check in at 3pm in the afternoon, and 2 of our rooms weren't ready until after 4pm. We weren't even offered a coffee or glass of water in the lounge while waiting.Rooms: There is a massive difference between the Twin and Dble city view rooms even though they are the same price category. You would think the Dble might be the better room but it is inferior to the twin. It is much smaller (25-30%) and the ensuite is a single basin with toilet and 'shower over small bath' (shower curtain is impractical if you're over 6ft). By comparison the Twin room is very good and has better storage spaces. The bathroom also has a seperate wet area for the shower with a full bath, a large vanity and mirror area, and the toilet is behind a blade wall allowing for some privacy when 2 people are using the room. We ended up putting our teenagers into the Dble and taking the twin.Facilities: We didn't dine onsite apart from one room service breakfast which was served on time and met the order. But one serve of butter for 2 people highlighted that only the minimum would be offered. It lacked any flourish or finer touches that other 5* properties usually use. The pricing in the lobby bar is interesting with a ginger ale costing only a touch less than an aged Whiskey with Dry.The pool, spa and fitness areas are only available at an additional cost which wasn't pointed out during booking or on any of the sites I looked at. AND they are only accessabile for over 18 year olds. So the 17yr old in our group who is an athlete in current training was unable to use the facilities. The cost for adults was approx $24AUD per visit.So yes the hotel is good, rooms decent size (stick to the Twin City View) and location good. BUT there is no warmth or recognition from the staff and at times it felt like we were more of an inconvenience than guests. The word 'sorry' was thrown around with abandon... ""sorry- you cannot pay to upgrade"", ""sorry- the pool and gym are not available for your son"", ""sorry- we cannot recommend an alternative pool/gym"", ""sorry- your rooms are not ready"", ""sorry - we cannot issue another room key"" .....With many other 5 star properties to choose from we are ""sorry"" but we will choose another for the next visit.","Canberra, Australia",13,3.0

So won't be able to give you any insight to that.Location: Excellent - is located just south of the highway, across from the main Shibuya crossing. The only downside to this is trying to lug your suitcases up and down the pedestrian crosswalk. If interested, there is an elevator if you walk westward only the highway to the 7/11.Hotel: The hotel itself is beautiful. The staff is very accommodating (in true Japanese fashion). We were able to get a few packages delivered (i.e. cell phone SIM card) and had the front desk make some dinner reservations for us. The room had an awesome view (see picture) and was every more beautiful at night. Bathroom had a large tub and a shower.

Very imposing entrance and comparatively large, luxurious rooms with good views from high floors. No porters when we arrived so had to take all our luggage up several escalators by ourselves. Rooms very warm even with air conditioning set to lowest temperature (20 degrees C). Great bathroom and amenities. Large double bed (rare in Japan!) but could not source decent foam pillow despite several requests. Was woken at 04:00 first night by what sounded like someone in room above moving a heavy desk and other pieces of furniture for the next 1 and a half hours. Second morning woken by dogs barking from exercise area for them at top of adjacent building. Breakfast (a buffet) very good but expensive at $37 a head. Ate at in-house Italian restaurant second night. This was disappointing: waiter had almost no English and despite assurances to the contrary the main course was essentially fish on its own with no vegetables or potato.

Very close 5-10 minute walk from Shibuya train station depending on whether you are rolling cases or not. Similar walk to great shops if you are into it. Lots of places to eat cheaply. Can recommend the 7-11 located at the hotel for great quality food to go. They will microwave meals for you. Has atm suitable for Aussie travelers. If you can afford it have an expensive drink at sunset in the 40th floor bar with spectacular views- not more expensive than Aussie bars of similar caliber - well worth it.Booked through Expedia with their Lowest Price Guarantee. Be careful you will pay much more than the amount quoted. You will be redirected to the Japanese Expedia website. Expect to pay more for taxes and fees which are not displayed upfront but in fine print on right hand side. We updated our quote request several times from twin room to 3 bed room for the 3 of us and were NEVER given an accurate quote to reflect this. Still same initial cheap price quoted but never updated. Problem 1 be careful here: They will say Priced From initially, which is not their Stated Lowest Price Guarantee. Problem 2 be careful here: They will say book now several times as part of the process and will not update the price or disclose the fees and taxes until the last page.They also do not guide you to these taxes and fees as a matter of good faith.I have had ongoing discussions with them regarding my complaint which they refuse to accept any responsibility. They enjoy sending emails in Japanese when you send your question in English - given this is a global company- they are annoying travellers.I'm still waiting for me refund which I don't expect will be forthcoming.

The best part of this hotel was the view. Our room was near the top floor, and we chose 'sky views', which meant our huge window looked out over the city towards Yokohama Bay, but Tokyo Tower was still in sight, too. It was entertainment in itself to just sit on the window sill and look out across the city, even if it was grey and cloudy outside. It was especially beautiful at night overlooking all the city lights. The room was very large for Japanese standards, the decor sleek, classy and clean, the beds large and very comfortable, and the bathroom very spacious and luxurious. Definitely the best room we had whilst in Japan - actually made us want to stay inside for longer! The service was very impressive, too. My partner and I aren't used to luxury hotels, but loved all the little details - an English newspaper being slipped under our door in the morning, and how easy and efficient the check-in and check-out process was. Another plus was the fact that there were numerous restaurants within the hotel complex - traditional Japanese, modern Japanese, Italian, and a few more (we chose the Italian place on the ground floor and had an incredible meal). It was also pretty much right across the road from the Shibuya JR station, too, which was very convenient. The only negative was that it was a little convoluted to get to and get out of - it was right next to a busy intersection, and you had to take multiple overpasses just to get anywhere. It wasn't a huge problem, however. Obviously on the pricey side, but in my opinion you definitely get what you pay for.","Adelaide, Australia",23,5.0

When it comes to location - this hotel is pretty close to Shibuya station. Keep walking straight on the overhead pass and turn left at the top. Those stairs will take you directly to the south exit of Shibuya Station. I think Tokyu Excel is a better location but the Cerulean is a higher rated hotel (room service, mini bar etc). Depends what you're looking for. Cerulean is definitely good value for money.In room wi-fi was very patchy. We bought sim cards at the airport so that wasn't so much of a problem....just a bit annoying.There are some exceptional restaurants behind the hotel. Take a stroll and a gamble.

Used to be crouded with Fashion designers coming for research / business but now a lot of trourists also staying this hotel. (they have a nanny service too btw).The service was not as superior than it was, although it was beyond best for the price once apon a time - they used to slice a bowl of expensive exotic fruits for you in your room, but now you just get bottles of evien instead, But still fantastic enough to beat other hotels in the area.Single rooms are very spacious and beds massive - bigger than a regular double size bed. There's dressing gown, a pair of slippers etc.. good selection of amenities.When you are tired you can call or massage til about 2am?Double roooms have a big king-size bed, so perfect for my partner and me who likes to sleep diagonal withought a leg fight.I also had a corner room, which has a spacious shower and bath with a large window with Tokyo view.On my last visits, I came back to my room around 4:30pm to drop my stuff from work - OMG a beautifl pink / orange sunlinght coming in to our room with a huge Mount Fuji on the backgroud. Hair raisingly beautiful (if your room was facing the south west).Also beautiful for the evening lights of Tokyo but it's the late afternoon sun set time is more amazing and which most of the hotel guests are likely to miss (too busy with out and about sight-seeing and shopping, anyone?)The hotel staff will accommodate with some tricky requests too in an emergency. I didn't have an extra suit case so I brought a cardboard box, except didn't have anything to secure to use it as a check in luggage on a plane. On check out the staff helped to tie up the box, OK it was badly done, but 3 staff helped to secure my box - super.My past colleagues who had health issues etc. while on a work trip, and the staff had helped with doctors to come in, brought in a toaster because she couldn't move and just couldn't eat anything other than a plain toast etc.. it's quite amasing the depth of service they provide when absolutley needed.It's probably around 150 GBP at today's rate, and for that price in very Central London you'll get a small room with cold shower water or the water leaking from a room above and if you are lucky they can assist in ordering a taxi for you.So it's an excellent hotel for the value at today's rate.","London, United Kingdom",14,4.0

We booked a 'King room' but when I called the hotel prior to check in (I wanted to confirm our view request) I was told that was just the name of the room. The 'king room' came with a queen bed. Needless to say I was a little frustrated because - for the price - I thought the expectation of a king bed in a room called the 'king room' was not out of line. But I chalked it up to a translation misunderstanding. From her tone it sounded like I wasn't the first confused English speaker she had to explain the unfortunate naming to. The woman spoke good English and was very polite. But she told me there were no rooms with king beds available for upgrade as they were all booked. I placed my view request - a view of the Tokyo tower and although they said there was no guarantees they promised they would do their best. In our room category we would only be able to see the tower out of the smaller side window but that was enough. The first plus of the hotel is its location! It's proximity to Shibuya train station could not be better. The walk was super short and easy (even with our luggage). There is a long staircase but it has a ramp for luggage that makes it pretty painless. And Shibuya station is a good hub for getting around the whole city. The walk to nightlife is as equally short and easy. A couple quick street crossings (including the Shibuya street scramble) and you're into the bars and shopping. The metro shuts down about 12:00am so nightlife and dinner options within walking distance is a huge plus. Even at 2:00/3:00am in the morning we were able to find a good place to eat and then walk back to the hotel. We arrived around 7:00pm to a pretty quick check-in process. I reiterated my request for a view of the Tokyo tower and moments later the woman checking us in said we had been given a complimentary room upgrade with a view from the main window! I was ecstatic! The porter service was quick and polite and he showed us up to room 2113. I have to say the room was amazing! The first thing you pass is a walk-in closet nook with plenty of room to store two suitcases and hanging clothes. The next thing you see is the bed! It was huge! It looked like two queens pushed together. We have a California king at home and the size of this bed blew it out of the water! Like most beds we slept on in Japan it was on the very firm side but the pillows were soft and you had so much room to stretch out. Last but not least was view. We had a friend with us who had been inTokyo for about week and he said it was the best view he had seen thus far. Tokyo tower glittered off to the right and the city lights lit up the left. It was the focal point of the room and you could watch the city from the bed and couch. The large bathroom had a view of the city lights all its own that could be enjoyed from the tub (and separate shower). There was a small separate area for the toilet but it did not have its own door. And a nice vanity area for make-up that got good sunlight from the large bath window. The hotel staff was also wonderful - very nice and helpful. It rained one day and on our way out the front desk staff made sure we had umbrellas. I'd recommend this hotel but make sure to check your room type and corresponding bed size. ,"Pasadena, California",8,5.0

The room was very comfortable and well appointed as you would expect. The bed was high quality and the black out curtains worked a treat.The bathroom was very large with plenty of high quality amenities. There were double vanities and a large shower room.The Tower's Floor gives you access to the Club lounge which we enjoyed. It was very pleasant sitting in the lounge drink in hand watching the sunset over Mt Fuji. Breakfast was also available in the lounge but we preferred the restaurant which had a very good buffet with both western and Asian options.I have to make special mention of the staff who were all extremely friendly and helpful. I left my mobile phone on the Shinkansen train from Kyoto and the concierge went out of his way to track it down for me. Unfortunately, it could be not located but I really appreciated the effort he went to in assisting me.I would definitely stay at the Cerulean again.","Brisbane, Australia",54,5.0

Speaking of the King rooms, in my experience, the standard King actually features a larger primary window and an additional corner window that's not included in the ""Superior King."" But the Superior King rooms are larger overall and include a separate shower and tub. In short, if views are your jam, go for a standard King, but if bathroom size is your priority, spring for a Superior King.On the topic of location, the popular ""Limousine Bus"" from Narita Airport provides door-to-door service to the Cerulean Tower and the famous Shibuya Station is a 10 minute walk away. In short, it’s easy to get to and you won't be at a loss for things to do. And a pro tip for seasoned travelers: The nearby Shibuya Hikarie mall, which is less than 10 minutes away on foot, features a great informal food court (i.e. inexpensive) in its basement levels, along with a small grocery store where you can pick up snacks & staples for your stay.In terms of amenities, the Cerulean Tower includes a small but functional gym, along with a fantastic indoor pool. I think it took me six visits before I discovered the pool, but it's surprisingly nice and now I always try to use it at least once during my stays. For dining, the hotel houses several formal restaurants in addition to a casual cafe adjacent to the lobby where breakfast is served (the buffet is solid, but expensive). A nice benefit to having all of these restaurants in the hotel is that you can order Western, Japanese or Chinese food for room service, but, like almost everything in Tokyo, it'll put a dent in your wallet (or expense report).I mentioned in the title to my review that I think the Cerulean Tower is the perfect hotel for business travelers, and I've outlined my rationale above. I would say that if I were traveling on holiday with my spouse, I'd probably look for a boutique-style alternative with a less ""executive"" feel. But if you're in town for work, it really doesn't get any better than this.","Portland, Oregon",53,5.0

Everyone, from the executive lounge hosts, to the concierge, to the porters, try to help as much as possible. One example: I got up one morning too early for the gym, and without my room key. One of the girls in b&w kept my gear while I walked, walked me to the gym on my return, then took me back to my room when I was done.Room service was the best meal of our trip, an intensely flavoured fish soup being the highlight.Tips:Gym is free if you arrive before 07:00.Upgrade to 34th floor was well worth it, with half price access to pool, simple breakfast in the executive lounge, all day access to juices and mineral water, and evening cocktails. Nothing better than relaxing after the day's activities with a glass of French bubbly.The August heat makes it difficult to do a lot of walking outside, but one of the trips we found most enjoyable was to catch the train up to Daikanyama station, exploring the quaint back street shops, and the beautiful Dainkayama T-site, then walking down the hill in the cooler evening to the back of the Cerulean.","Sydney, Australia",7,5.0

I know that sounds crazy, but I'm so glad I did it.The location is so awesome. Shibuya is a really fun part of Tokyo and it ended up being near so many things I wanted to do. Lots of great shopping, restaurants, bars and beauty treatments. But the best part is that you literally walk out of the train station...(go out the South Exit- not the ""New South Exit"") and you will see two bridges that form an X. If you are arriving from the airport express train there are elevators for your luggage so don't even worry about getting a cab. Walk out of the train station...and go over the bridge. At the bottom of the bridge go right and about 1/2 block and there are escalators that take you directly into the hotel. And the Shibuya stop is so centrally located. If you buy the JR Rail Pass...you probably won't need another train ticket during your trip. The hotel itself is really nice and well maintained. Go ahead and get the breakfast plan. The buffet is great and even after 5 days I never tired of it. It is well worth it. The rooms are big and the views are insane. The bathrooms is great and there is every amenity you can think of or in case you forget something. The beds are really comfortable and the linens were lovely.The bar and restaurants on the 40th floor are great. I had dinner at the bar and it was fantastic. No need to go to the Park Hyatt...this bar is very similar...they even have a pianist. The French restaurant on the other side is amazing. I chose one of the special menus and it was a really memorable meal. Service was impeccable. Highly recommend it.The only thing I would say is that they speak very little English, even the concierges. I was a little on my own to figure things out. However, the JR Rail Line office is right near the entrance closest to the hotel. They all speak great English and are super helpful. My suggestion...bypass the hotel and go see them. They will get you anywhere you need to go.Also, loved the pool. Really helped with the jet lag!I highly recommend this hotel for business or for pleasure.","Los Angeles, California",130,5.0

Plus the 7-Eleven on the lower floor gives us easy access to ATM machine, good coffee and the never ending supply of their local MontBlanc dessert.Service- took care of our luggages for the takuhaibin transfers from hotel to hotel, received as planned our pocket wi-fi, nice touch of having ""welcome"" and ""birthday"" cake boxes from Dalloyou (Paris)!!!Food- Had the Japanese breakfast day one. It was so good we got kind of hesitant to try the Western Breakfast the next day. Good thing we tried the western too---it was equally good and impressive with our made to order macchiattos and freshly squeezed juices. Not to be missed is the omelette station manned by a 'perfectionist' chef. Yum-O!Amenities-Super fluffy beds will make you not want to leave! But alas it's Tokyo and a place of discovery.

In terms of comfort and luxury, I would rank 1/JW, 2/Cerulean, 3/Century Southern and 4/Granvia. The room rates go from high to low in that order, i.e.. you get what you pay for.

You can go everywhere in Tokyo from there and still have peace an quiet when you get back to hotel.Cerulean is a beautiful hotel & in a quiet section of Shibuya. Service is amazing, front desk staff speaks enough English and go out of their way to help you. I did not try any of the restaurants as the price is a bit high for what is offered. There are good restaurants all around Shibuya within 5-10 minutes walk. Shibuya is teenage central so my teenager loves the area & prefers it to Shinjuku. I find it too crowded and messy. There are also many overpasses and bridges you need to walk up and down to get to the Shibuya centre and station.

After crossing a few roads via the walkway, and a slight walk uphill, it took less than 10 minutes to get there.

The bathroom and toiletries were excellent and we were very happy with our room and the way it was maintained during our stay.We did not have a good map of the hotel and it wasn't until the second last day that we discovered there is a 7-eleven store in the outer area of the hotel complex.

However, at night the whole area comes to life with video screens on many of the buildings and the quite loud sounds that add to the spectacle. Together with the large number of people on the streets in the evening, your senses can become somewhat over-stimulated although it is a fascinating experience.There are many places to eat in Shibuya and the department stores have a very good range of well-priced restaurants often in a basement or a few levels above the street.

The hotel is a walking distance to the station with ramp for ease of luggage. There is a Food station nearby with great food choices that accepts credit card. The concierge and people in the hotel are so helpful. We travel on our own with a set of places to go. Since one of the places we want to see was Hatchiko the famous dog, the girl in the hotel walked with us to see it. We frequently consulted Wajiwa-san (sorry if there is lapse in my memory but he is the person assigned in the concierge) with our itinerary. He would give us advice as to the route with regards to the train stops and the sequence of the place. He became our personal travel consultant :)The room was nice. I think there is a hotel power saver as there is a personal cooler in the room to cool down the temperature. I am impressed with the towel as it makes you feel so dry after a shower. Wonder what detergent they are using. The odd thing in the bed set up is that there was 3 single beds. We might be saving a bit had it been a king size bed as there are bed pull out seen in the single bed. Overall it was an excellent stay for us in Tokyo.","Quezon City, Philippines",71,5.0

Here's why you should consider the Cerulean Tower for your visit.1. CLEAN: The hotel was spotless, very much up to standards you would find in North America. 2. SPACIOUS ROOMS: Very much in line with western hotels in this regard. The room we had featured two twin beds, plenty of lighting, including floor lights in the night stand between the beds. This was great for middle of the night trips to the bathroom. Speaking of the bathroom, it was fully stocked with complimentary items such as soaps, shampoos, razors and even a hair brush. It also came with a blow dryer. The toilet featured a heated seat and bidet feature which is common in Japan. The shower area with a tub/shower combo; a full tub with a shower wand NEXT to the tub all enclosed with a glass wall and door. Definitely different but very functional. Rooms also featured televisions (not many English choices) and a desk. Each room was equipped with WiFi which was included in our room rate. Since my wife and I were traveling with our daughter, we ordered a rollaway bed, which fit easily in the room. Our room was also equipped with an air purifier machine, which also doubled as a sound machine to mute my snoring!3. LOCATION: You can't beat the hotels location. It's literally a five minute walk to the Shibuya train station, one of the main stations in Tokyo. From Shibuya station, you can get ANYWHERE in Tokyo by either the JR line or the Tokyo subway system. And since the hotel is located on a busy thoroughfare, there are overhead walkways which make your trek to the trains simple and safe.4. OPTIONS: There's a 7-11 located on the property which turned out to be a great stop for filling up on things like snacks, water, breakfast items, etc. It's located on the second floor on the outside of the hotel. The Cerulean features several restaurants, a nice lobby bar and a desert bar that's located close to check-in.OTHER HELPFUL INFORMATION: The staff is fluent in English, so that won't be a problem....I would recommend you skip breakfast in the hotel since it's rather expensive. It ran about $85 USD for three of us and that was less than the cost of the buffet. Either load up at the 7-11 or pick a neighborhood spot. There's a coffee house called Excelsior that's about a 3-5 min walk towards the train station. We had breakfast sandwiches and drinks there for about $16 USD. They also have seating outside which makes for a great people watching spot.....if you are traveling two and from Narita, use the N'Ex train (The Narita Express). It's clean and fast and will get you to Shibuya Station in about an hour.....for those using the Shinkansen (bullet train) during their visit, you can take a train from Shibuya station to Tokyo station to connect. ...bring snacks from home! You will walk ALOT when exploring the city. Snacks are handy when you get hungry or can't find appropriate food. As for food, you'll need to have an open mind. It can be much different than North America, but very good. There are plenty of American style restaurants as well.....bring a tablet with you so you can explore recommended spots. Also, download the Tokyo subway app, a great way to figure out train times and routes. MUST SEE: Plan a day trip to Kyoto. It's two hours via the Skinkansen train and was a highlight of our trip.",Atlanta,59,4.0

After the Park Hyatt obviously it wasn't as amazing, but it's still a lovely hotel. I had emailed to ask for a Shibuya Crossing room view, and they said they'd try to accommodate my request. On check-in obviously this had been overlooked, but they did give me a higher up room with a great view over the Tokyo Tower (east) and I could actually see the crossing at the edge of the view. It was a better room than we booked, so that was good!Spacious room, comfy, temperature fine, no noise, lovely bathroom with huge tub, usual amenities.Only real criticism is that we had to pay for the coffee provided in the drinks drawer - seems really tight for an expensive 5-star hotel to charge an additional Y400 for a coffee that really should be included! Only the green tea is free. Plus they charge to use the pool, so we didn't bother.

On one of the days I came back to the room while it was being cleaned and I was rudely turned away from my own room!The lobby is large but doesn't have nearly enough seating for the number of guests and while the rooms were a good size with nice views of the city,the furnishings and interior seemed outdated and worn for a 5 star hotel. The hallway areas were too hot and had a funny smell. They charged you for using coffee and tea in the room (which much cheaper hotels would provide for free)In all, Cerulean towers may be a good place to stay on business but as a tourist expecting some level of luxury at a price like this, what we received was very disappointing.","London, United Kingdom",7,2.0

Also, I had a medical emergency and immediately, someone came to our room with medicines. As usual, that level of Japanese customer service is outstanding.

One of the reasons for the upper floors is the great view across the Tokyo skyline, and with some brooding cloud cover gave the city a very ""Blade Runner"" feel.As a luxury hotel the staff are very attentive and check-in/check-out were very easy.

The second room we had, after popping down to Kyoto, was much smaller, technicall the grade we paid for, and was just an average hotel room, no bath, decent shower.BreakfastWe had breakfast twice here, it's an ok selection breakfast buffet. Amazing waffles/bacon/eggs and freshly made omelettes. Then a relatively standard buffet, cereals, code meats, and some traditional Japanese breakfast foods.BarThe bar on the 40+ floor was great, with reasonably priced cocktails (compared to London prices) ie £9 for a negroni/martini. The view is incredible, overlooking the famous pedestrian crossing in Shibuya, and the surrounding areas and most of Tokyo! It's a shame so much of the bar is smoking, and the non-smoking section is tiny with significantly less-impressive views. We managed to get a seat by the window on both occasions even if the second time we had to wait in the bar area for about 15 minutes first, we still had a seat to wait at.ServiceThe service in this hotel is incredible, with such attentive staff ready to take your luggage as soon as you get in to reception and eagerly take it to your room. You don't feel like the service is good because they want a tip because it's not custom to tip here. Reception staff very friendly, everyone spoke a good level of English. We needed advice on the local area a couple of times and the staff were very eager to help.AreaThe area is great for the nearby train station (5 minute walk) to connect to all parts of Tokyo on both the overground and subway systems. And the hotel itself is just a 15-20 minute walk from Harajuku/Omotesando areas which are great for shopping.Gym/PoolI used the pool once while here, the fact there is an additional charge seems strange and the price (about £15) was too high to warrant visiting more than once.That said, the changing facilities were very nice, the pool is huge with nice floor to ceiling windows alongside it letting in daylight, and the jacuzzi is very spacious. The changing room had a good sized sauna in it as well, with decent shower products avaliable. I didn't visit the gym area so can't really comment.","London, United Kingdom",60,4.0

Huge and the most luxurious bathroom. No complaints about the room. View was also nice. Location great. Not sure where previous reviewers were walking but I timed it and it was literally one minute walk to the station. Not sure how it can physically take anyone ten minutes!!Now on to the bad stuff. Barely any of the staff speak English including reception which isn't helpful when trying to arrange a wake up call and they don't know what that is!! In general nobody on reception understood even the most basic stuff like where is my key. Kind of vital vocabulary for a receptionist. They also have no clue what customer service is. I am a vegetarian. There was a menu option on room service of spaghetti and tomato sauce with bacon on top. I asked without bacon and they refused. Not possible apparently. Not possible for a five star hotel to give me spaghetti with tomato sauce? What nonsense! Also the worst was a male receptionist who checked me out. Down right rude and got annoyed I refused to pay for an airport van I never ordered!? I was going to kyoto not the airport!! I then asked him to take off a breakfast charge for a day I didn't have breakfast and the rude man refused saying it was included in my deal. It Most certainly was not! I even had proof I hadn't had breakfast that day and asked what loss they incurred and he just barked at me and refused. In America they would have simply canceled the charge to retain custom. I won't be going back. Whilst the room was amazing, for the ludicrous price they charge Everything should be amazing and it wasn't. The staff were also not remotely friendly, even the polite ones. Facilities like hairdressers and spa never had any appointments and I got the distinct impression they all hate foreigners. Pretty useless when you work in a hotel.Spend your money elsewhere.

Should be an breeze as you only cross one overpass and you're already there. Apart from the station, it also also nearby popular tourist spots such as the Shibuya Crossing and Hachiko Statue. There are several restaurants and drinking places around the same strip as well. You just go down towards the overpass to the station. Instead of passing the overpass, turn right. On the other end of the train station are several malls and much of the happening takes place there.Rooms were spacious and clean. I enjoyed their shower as it provided ample space and was separate from the bathtub. We were 4 in a room and two of us shared one bed each. You had two choices for your breakfast: international buffet or Japanese set breakfast. Since we stayed here for over a week, I would alternate eating at both places. I definitely would recommend the Japanese breakfast.When we checked-in, there was no free wifi yet.

We didn't bother booking a hotel because we wanted to be spontaneous and we figured something would be open once we arrived.We couldn't have been more wrong!After wandering around Shinjuku and Shibuya for a few hours, taking in as much delicious food, local beer and all around night life as we could we were getting pretty tired. It was fast approaching midnight and we still didn't know where we'd be sleeping that night. I had a tip that there were some cheap love motels at one end of Shibuya. Surprisingly, they were all booked for the night. With heavy heads and sore feet we trudged toward our last hope, the Cerulean Tower. Taking in the luxurious marble floors, high ceilings and smart design I wasn't expecting an opening, let alone to pay less than 50,000 JPNY. Although, we still tried.They ended up giving us a room on the spot on the 36th floor. It ran about 43,000 JPNY (430.00 USD), which was about double what I'd pay for something similar in Seoul. But, hey, Japan's not a cheap city and it was extremely last minute.Our room was big, swanky and extremely comfortable. The view made the whole thing totally worth it. We could easily see all of Shibuya and into the surrounding area. It's close enough to the subway station and there's plenty to do right within Shibuya. I'd say the location is just about perfect.We didn't check in until about 1:30 in the morning and we had a full day of activities the following morning so we didn't get a chance to really experience any of the added amenities. However, I wouldn't hesitate booking in advance at this place if and when I'm back in Tokyo. What I can say is that the staff were extremely professional and helpful, even to a couple of tipsy tourists trying to get a room in the middle of the night!",South Korea,11,4.0

For that, it lack uniqueness of character or that special human touch that makes a place endearing to the heart. Rather, it is a hotel I would describe as ""excellent"", and begrudgingly stay there every time, because no other hotel in Tokyo offers the same level of comfort and convenience. First of all, you simply cannot do better in terms of location. 2 min walk from Shibuya-station, where half a dozen train lines intersect. Perfectly ideal for both business and leisure. The city of Shibuya is at your footsteps, providing shopping and dining at every price range. Rooms are understated but tasteful. For Tokyo standards, it is almost spacious. Bedding is comfortable. The bathroom is luxurious and well appointed. And if you manage to book a room on the higher floors, you are pretty much guaranteed a fabulous view owing to the fact that Cerulean is the only high rise tower in the immediate vicinity. Buffet breakfast is served at the sunny 1F restaurant. They always have fresh squeezed orange juice at the far corner, which I personally think is a great touch.The hotel has several restaurants. If you love Chinese food, do try out Chen. Wifi worked fine during our stay. Owing to its superior location and the fact that it is a relatively new property, this is an extremely popular hotel for both the local population as well as foreigners-in-the-know. As such, the lobby area is always crowded. In fact, the only real complaint I have about this hotel is that there aren't enough comfortable seating in the lobby. While Japanese servers are generally reserved, but tend to go out of their way to please (within the rigid confines of what is deemed proper for them), don't expect any service staff at Cerulean to go an extra mile. Their service is in demand and they know it. Any special request will generally be handled in a somewhat hesitant manner or charged a hefty price. Case in point, when we asked the concierge if they could keep a small package in their freezer, they accepted, after telling us repeatedly that their refrigerator may not be able to accommodate the size. Also, when we asked for an check-out extension as our flight was leaving at midnight, they wanted to charge 1/3 of the room rate (47,000 yen for 3 hours).","Seattle, Washington",106,5.0

This is partly because there are very few hotels in Shibuya. The best part about the hotel is the location, rooms, and view. My biggest disappointment was the attitude of one of the concierges. When we first arrived, we asked for directions from the woman concierge (the one who is a little on the heavy side/sits on the left). When we approached the desk, she didn’t say a word. We finally said something to her and she didn’t smile nor did she seem to want to help. This happened every time we spoke with her. I was so surprised since my last visit was to the Westin Ebisu where all of the concierges were always smiling and ready to help. That being said, the rest of the concierges were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is very convenient to the train station but there are a series of walkway bridges to get to the hotel. It is a little cumbersome in the cold and rain. The rooms are very spacious, clean, and modern. The views are also very panoramic.

Okay, I'd better justify that high praise so, from the top...The BasicsThis is of course a luxury hotel so at the very least, it has to do the essential things properly. And so it does. The building exterior is smart and modern, the entrances and lobbyies spacious and elegantly decorated with clear signposting and a logical, intuitive guest journey through check in and onto your room. The rooms themselves (I stated in the slightly larger rooms on the 30th+ floor but I don't doubt that this is true for all rooms) are very good with a stylish, neutral decor and an understated opulence. There standards of maintenance and cleaning are excellent too, as are the in-room facilities. The free WiFi is very easy to set up and extremely fast. The air conditioning is quiet and effective.The LocationThe hotel is very well located a short walk from Shibuya station. By the way, If you're not familiar with Tokyo, I'd always recommend that you find a hotel adjacent to a station on the Yamanote line (as is Shibuya) at whatever price point you are interested in. 80% of Tokyo can be reached from the Yamanote line with just one change and 90+% with two changes so really will help with your travel arrangements. Connecting with the Yamanote is what all other metro stations like to do ideally so being near the line is so much more convenient. Just my tip, hope it helps. What Makes Good into SuperbHaving established this hotel gets the basics right (even allowing for price and the fact that this is of course Japan we're talking about here so you'd expect everything to ""just work"") what did it do to a) surprise and delight in ways you didn't expect and b) differentiate itself from the huge competition in the central Tokyo upscale hotel market ? Well, let's start with what I said about location. Shibuya is an exciting and vibrant district which is great fun to visit but you probably wouldn't want to live there. So what you'd really like in a hotel is to feel that when you enter it, suddenly the noise and chaos of the hussle and bussel of the outside world has magically disappeared. The Cerulean manages to do that. The building lacks the drama and verve of the Shinjuku Park Tower's Hyatt Hotel but instead has a restrained opulence and quiet understated feel of a London private club. But it isn't stuffy or pretentious.Not being any sort of foodie, I didn't visit the showcase restaurants so if you're the foodie type I'm sorry that I can't help -- but I did go to the informal cafes on the ground floor and use room service which if the main restaurants match the standard of these, you shouldn't be disappointed. What really sets this hotel apart though is the staff. And this is the hardest things to get right. Too much drilling and rote learning means you've got curteous automatons rather than warm and friendly human beings. The staff at this hotel are nothing short of a delight. Polite and professional, of course, but there's a rare quality of seemingly genuine charm that pervades the entire team and lifts the atmosphere of the whole place. You can't put your finger on it, but you know when it is there or when it isn't. The lobby clark guy who made sense of my complicated reservation. The room service lady who made sure that everything was perfect. The endlessly patient woman at the porter's desk who politely and flawlessly sorted out when I left my room card in the room (and didn't mind at all me having the temerity to say that she might have inadvertently kept it when I reserved a limousine bus to the airport when in fact I'd mistakenly locked myself out of my room -- and in the process turned what could have been a toe curlingly embarrassing incident for me into an enjoyable whizz up and down in the lifts, turning the room upside down to find the key card and, all-in-all probably the high point of my stay. The ability to do that is little short of magical. It isn't always down to how much you're paying. There is a hotel in the Home Coutnies of England (I won't name names but it's where the English national football squad stay) where the is no lack of blingy swank. The staff are neat, scrubbed and polished and will do whatever you ask, but you can feel them assessing your net worth when you enter the building and bigging up the haughty attitude if they don't think you're worthy enough of staying there. And that isn't the only hotel where the management and staff mistake condescension for what is actually required - care for their guests. That comes across in everything about the Cerulean. Best hotel in Japan? A big claim, but I'll stick to it. No, you can't compare, say, a $1000 a night ryokan with a western style hotel like this and it would be silly to do so. And a $150 a night airport hotel that is quiet, pleasant and restful can seem like Heaven maybe because it is just the right place at the right time. But no, I genuinely think that, this hotel is in a class of its own.",,3,5.0

The 2 reasons why we chose this hotel location and on site creche for our baby. There is a Poppins Creche right in the building which looked after our baby during the day sometimes and even into the evening until 11pm. The staff there are excellent are looked fater our baby well, the facilities, toys etc really well done. It can be billed to your room. We stayed in 3405, this was upgrade becuase on checkin our room was not ready. It was the same room class but 4 floors up so we were pleased becuase the views were incredible, we looked over the Shibuya Crossing, over the park and up to Shinjuku. The room was much larger than expected and fitted us all in very comfortably. The bathroom is large with a fancy toilet. It would benefit from infloor heating during the winter becuase the stone floor can get very cold. The cleaning maids were excellent and did an inpeccable job every day. The hotel however has a distinct business feel to it. There was only a few seats in the lobby to wait for our room. When waiting for airport transfer bus there was only 4 seats below which were all taken of course, so I had to feed my baby on the floor. This hotel needs more chairs for the large amount of people using the public spaces. The restaurants are expensive and people are paying with company money, this didn't really bother us becuase there is many many many good places nearby to eat much cheaper. My god the food in Japan is good! THere is a 7/11 across the road which has good kids snack food like fruit and yoghurt. Concerge were very helpful in directing us to a chemist and big supermarket for nappies. The is an amazing food hall nearby which is quite possibly the largest I've ever been to and has amazing dinners and food to go. There is also a great kitchen and smaller food hall down the hill, near station (underground floor). On the last night we got room service and it was so expensive for the measly plates of food that came, for 6000 yen it was a very tiny bowl of bolognese which was plated just boring (even just adding a slice of baguette with garlic butter, costs nothing but would add to the appeal) and a ceasar salad again a few leaves with dressing, (again a slice of baguette, an egg, an anchovy or two) it was just so unappestising, this was surprising given the italian resturant in house. Just because its room service doesn't mean it shouldn't look good and be tasty. Use their website to book and become a member, the rates are cheaper, you can use the gym/pool (no kids) and free internet. Also the limo bus for 3,100 was excellent, door to door and for us with a baby and luggage much easier than metro and narita express train.

The room was remarkably spacious, very clean and well appointed and has a cracking good view of the city. The room service breakfast was serviced bang on time and was of good quality. The hotel staff were very polite and efficient and were basically great! A couple of downsides was we were charged for wifi which I think is not good nowadays and you are charged to use the pool area quite a lot considering it isn't brilliant and you have to wear swimming caps which aren't exactly comfortable if you want to laze in their Jacuzzi. In summary this is a great hotel and I have no complaints.

Another plus point of its location is the short walking distance from the hotel tower to many shopping and foodism places. This made us easy to spend our whole day with fun by exploring the district. Hotel staffs were very friendly and helpful. Room was completely clean and neat. And for the bathroom, I really love the design that they use. It's modern and cozy. If you read some other reviews said nothing is free in this hotel, I guess they are true. You will be charged for the usage of wifi connection.

The check in counter and this was where I had the problem that stops me giving this hotel a better review. The check in staff were extremely rude and argumentative. I'm a Japanese teacher so I frequently travel to Japan, and this is the only place in Tokyo that I've ever had a staff member argue with me. So my problem is that I don't have a credit card because I've never needed one. Whenever I check in to a hotel I have everything pre-paid and usually agree to not use room service or something like that, if they really need a card I hand over a visa debit card. I e-mailed this place before I arrived to make sure this would be ok. They e-mailed me back and said that was fine. Well when I got there that wasn't good enough. They demanded a credit card. I said I didn't have one, they tried to say I couldn't check in even though I'd already paid for the room. I said if I couldn't check in I'd take my two thousand dollars back and go somewhere else. They said they can't give me a refund but I can't check in. Eventually they said I could check in if I gave them a cash deposit that was more than the entire cost of the room (so, more money than I had on me). After much arguing and speaking to the manager they eventually let me check in and made a note saying I can't use room service, but it really put me off this hotel. I understand 99% of people won't have this problem because they have a card, but still think it's worth mentioning because I travel a lot and have never had a problem with not having one. Anyway! We got to the room and it was very large for Tokyo (but we paid extra for a larger room on a higher level). Decor was very boring and business-like, but the room was spacious and very clean, it was nice. The beds were big and comfortable. If you pay extra for a nigh level floor it's really worth it, because the view is amazing. We stayed in January last year, and it started snowing! (snow is a novelty for us, being from sunny QLD, Australia) Seeing the snow blowing from up high was really beautiful. Location is pretty good, it's close to Shibuya, but not directly part of the chaos of the city because the hotel is also an office building. There's not much right outside the hotel, so you have to walk to the areas around the scramble crossing to find things to do and the train station. It's about a 5min walk up a lot of stairs/hills to get to the station/city.I definitely think when you pay as much as you do here, WiFi should be free and use of the pool should be free.","Gold Coast, Australia",11,3.0

The hotel rooms are spacious for Japan standard, the beds are very comfortable, crisp white sheet, fluffy towels, clean rooms, all important for fussy travellers. However, the best thing the hotel has is their staff, or one in particular, at the reception. At 6am on 15 January, 4 hours before our flight out from Tokyo, my son announced that he has lost his passport, the night before, somewhere in the shopping district of Shibuya! Thinking that we will be stranded in Tokyo until the passport is sorted, I approached the reception to get an extension of our stay. The young lady at the reception after finding out our problem, rang the police station and unbelievably located our passport! The passport had made its way to the Shibuya police station. She then negotiated with the officer for us to pick up the passport at 7.30am, so that we could still make it for our 10.30am flight.

The real selling features besides prime location are the rooms which are massive for Tokyo and have decent views. The tower is raised in a podium so even the lower rooms have city views. You can usually see mount Fuji from your window if facing the right direction. Service can be hit or miss and there is a certain coldness and aloofness that sometimes arises.

We wanted to experience the grittier side of Tokyo that Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku and it's surrounding environs had to offer, but we knew that staying at a hotel right on top of the ""Scramble"" just won't do. The Cerulean, despite the mixed reviews, was our best option. It was also a plus that the hotel is a mere 5 minute walk from the Shibuya station which serves as a stop for the Narita Express. The Cerulean is located across an 8 lane road from the Shibuya station. The neighborhood behind the hotel pleased us as it is quiet and affluent. The topography is hilly. Crisscrossed by narrow lanes that encourage a leisurely stroll. Home to the Shibuya Cultural Center, a scattering of cafes and restaurants, low-rise apartment buildings, small homes straight from an architectural magazine and a few old wooden houses, it is a world apart from what images of Shibuya usually convey.The hotel is par for the course in Asia as far as 4 to 5 star hotels go. The modern lobby with its high ceilings, medium-toned wood paneling, immaculate dark tiled floors and floor to ceiling glass walls looking out onto a lush garden is imposing, dignified and elegant all at once. It was meant to be this way as The Cerulean is not a budget hotel. The restaurant beside the lobby has a split-level design to allow diners at the rear to also have a view of the garden. The rooms were huge. Really. And we had an amazing view of the mountains. As is expected in Japan, everything was up to spec. The decor was modern, but the medium tones brought the energy level down a notch. The bed and linens were fantastic. The bathroom was big and clean. For the amount of money we paid for it, we were surprised at how much we got. As it is in a mixed-use development, there is even a Family Mart (24 convenience store) and an Italian restaurant just outside the side entrance.During our stay, we found that the hotel is truly a convenient base from which to experience what we call the ""left side"" of the Yamanote line (on the JR route map, the Yamanote Line is depicted as a circle). There is, of course, the Shibuya ""Scramble"" touted as the busiest intersection in the world. It is easy to find as the intersection is right outside the ""Hachiko"" exit of Shibuya station. Also, if you want to experience eating like a local, head to the food court at the basement of the Shibuya station called the Tokyu Food Show. Your. Jaw. Will. Drop. There are no tables and chairs. Instead, what you get is wall to wall of any kind of Japanese food you can think of. Tempura, sushi, sashimi, sukiyaki, ramen, tonkatsu, yakitori, etc. From Shibuya station, it is just one stop to Harajuku station which is the gateway to five, yes, five points of interest. Yoyogi Park where skaters and the youth of Tokyo hang out. The Meiji Shrine which is a must see. Takeshita Street of Cosplay fame. Omotesando/Aoyama which is touted as the Champs Elysee of Tokyo. And Cat street. (Top Tip: Don't get turned off by the description of Omotesando/Aoyama as the Champs Elysee of Tokyo, otherwise, you'll miss the chance to wander the side streets off of the main drag where hip and cool local labels have located their stores.) Shinjuku, known for its shopping, eating, non-stop nightlife and red light district, is also just a couple of stops from Shibuya.If you want a Shibuya hotel that removes you from all the hustle and bustle at the end of the day, then The Cerulean is the right choice.","Manila, Philippines",15,4.0

We expected Tokyo accommodation to be expensive, so the kids and I spent first night in a hostel (also reviewed) and when my husband joined us we moved for 3 nights to this hotel. It deserves it's 4-5 stars for location, cleanliness and buffet breakfast but the service was 1 star. After communicating via email before we arrived, asking if possible for inter-connecting rooms as we were travelling with 3 kids, I was told we could have adjacent but not inter-connecting which was great. At check-in I was given rooms on a smoking floor - no mention of this at check-in and we phoned from the room to ask for a non-smoking floor as the kids had runny noses and itchy eyes within minutes of arrival. Couldn't help via phone so we went down to lobby. I was told they couldn't accommodate me. They could, it just took some time and patience. When my husband arrived later that night he was told he couldn't have a 2nd room key as all had been provided. One key per room. When I called to ask for a second as my kids locked themselves out they said they would charge the room $5 for a second key. And $5 again for my husband. On the second day we left the hotel at 7am and returned mid afternoon to uncleaned rooms. I called front desk and was told that housekeeping is done in the afternoon and I should have notified front desk if I wanted the room cleaned in the morning. They asked us to leave the room for an hour for each room - and no, we couldn't use the pool downstairs as the kids were under 18 and the pool is not just for hotel guests but Club Members. I just found everything about the service provided at this hotel was unpleasant. I don't mind paying $1800 for great accommodation and service but when the experience makes you feel like you are an inconvenience I think it's better to spend the money elsewhere. I would have felt less inclined to write a review if at check-out they had just asked one question: if we enjoyed our stay.","San Diego, California",21,1.0

This was our first time in Tokyo and only did minimal research into getting to the hotel. The hotel staff also provided emails on which routes to take. The easiest including cost efficiency was using the Airport Limousine (Bus) to get to the hotel. Is it the orange and white bus. When you leave baggage claim and exit the doors, just look for the ""Airport Limousine"" bus kiosk desk. Tell them the hotel name and the bus drops you off directly under the hotel checkout desk. They even store your baggage under the bus for making it easy. The bus is clean and very comfortable. Seems very new as well. We were worried about traffic and transit time, and landed around 7:00PM, then took the 7:30-8:00PM bus with no issues. We arrived at the hotel in about 90 minutes. Check-in & Check-Out:The staff speaks great english with both check in and checkout services an easeConcierge:Very friendly and helpful. They even offer free umbrellas if it is rainingHotel Lobby and Hallways:The hotel lobby is excellent, what you would expect from a high class hotel.The hallways from the elevator to the rooms, a little worn in and small but non-issue odor. The main reason for this, in my opinion, is the lack of central air and making the air feel fresh and clean. But this is not an issue at all. Room:We stayed in a queen sized bed single room with a great view of the city on the 32nd floor. Room was very clean as well the bathroom. TV provided a few international channels as well local channels. Read the book in the room on how to show international channels. All amenities, provided in room, shower gel, shampoo, toothbrush, combs, the usual. Beds a little hard, and pillows can be a little better for the price of the hotel, but all in all good. Housekeeping came everyday while we were out and cleaned the room as well new towels and restocked the shampoos and bath supplies. There is also a mini-bar, but way overpriced. Just go around the corner on floor 2 to the 7-Elven and stock up. Staff:As stated above the staff of the hotel was great, providing an iron board and other things as needed. Very professional and courteous. Location:Great! Shibuya is a bustling area with lots to see. The hotel is within 5 minutes walk from Shibuya station which will get you wherever you need to go. The Minor Issue that kept it from getting a 5 star rating:Stay away from the Bar on the 42nd floor unless for the view (if they let you just watch it) and the restaurants downstairs. While the staff is great, they have rules they follow that are not welcoming. The Bar on the 42nd floor provides a great view, but you must purchase a drink to even walk around up there. (And it was not even busy) The drinks are way over priced as well. The restaurants downstairs have the friendliest staff, but we purchased a coffee and breakfast tart that was $10 to go, then realized the coffee cup lid was not secure so asked to sit down and eat our breakfast there, but they told us NO! The chairs are for dine in guest. I can understand if they were busy, but there wasn't a single person in the restaurant. We found this just rude and very ignorant on their part. The hotel really needs to review their rules and how they treat customers.","Geoje, South Korea",6,4.0

A very standard 4-star hotel; there's nothing outstanding on that part, but the staff at the hotel was the epitome of politeness. The front desk was friendly when checking us in, and they were efficient in getting our luggage to our room. We stayed in a corner twin, which had a fantastic view of Tokyo from the 30-something floor. The room was very spacious by any standard, the beds were comfortable, and all basic amenities were provided. Wifi at this hotel isn't free so we had to pay for that, but they do offer a nice deal for a week's worth of wifi.

I had high expectations because the concierge desk was SO extremely helpful prior to our trip, helping to make plans and securing baseball tickets. Immediately upon check in, I realized that level of service was not standard apparently. The fellow that checked us in was rather standoffish, not very informative and actually needed me to prompt him for basic questions (such as, do you need my passport...which he did. And then forgot to give back). Things he didn't tell us: what's up with the wifi? Don't I get breakfast? Anything at all we should know? So, not having wifi passwords and breakfast coupons, I went back down to the desk to ask about these things and spoke to another girl who proceeded to tell me these things were not included because we were upgraded, so the upgrade was our benefit. Now, not only did that not make sense, it wasn't even correct. After five minutes she finally looks at the computer and says ""oh, you are right"" and then tries to say that what we don't get is access to the executive lounge. Whatever. Here is the problem at this place. They live off their location and don't seem to do much over and above that. We stayed at Marriotts, Sheraton's and little hotels during our stay and each time felt like the most important people who ever lived. Here, I felt looked down on as if I didn't belong there. There's no question this is a nice hotel. But between what I've written, the lingering odor of smoke in the drapes and what I can only describe as the worst club sandwich in the world from the restaurant, I wouldn't suggest this hotel to anyone I knew.

We were only at this hotel for a couple of nights concentrating our sightseeing to the Shibuya/Yoyogi/Harjuku areas. With the temperatures in the 90sF it was draining to be walking for around for more than a few hours.

Getting to Cerulean from Narita was a breeze using the Airport Limousine Bus, https://www.limousinebus.co.jp/en/Since we were delayed there was no bus directly to Cerulean before another hour, but the attendant kindly suggested that we go Westin hotel on one of their other routes, take a taxi to Cerulean, and that worked out just fine, 1500 Yen for the taxi.Reception at the hotel was a bit underwhelming, which almost made me award 4 stars. Got the feeling the person receiving us wasn't too happy with out travelling attire. Anyway that's about the only complaint I have. The hotel is gorgeous, location is unbelievable and the views from both standard rooms and tower rooms (we have tried both) are stunning. In my view you are not missing much if you go for a standard room, but the gym is half price, wifi is free and you can eat complementary breakfast at the executive salon, there is a dvd player and some better bathroom amenieties if you go for towers room or better. Breakfast is rather expensive and will cost about 3500 Yen per person, but quality is very good, Execute salon breakfast is adequate but cannot compare, but is complementary as far as I can make out.Rooms are good size for two persons, nice bathroom, nice beds, stunning view, quiet.Good restaurants in the hotel, a bit on the expensive side as expected. We haven't sampled all of them, I thought the Italian style was average, but the Chinese restaurant was very good. We didn't try the Japanese restaurant, hey we're in Tokyo, eating Japanese in the hotel seemed heineous.We are close to Shibuya station, but far enough (and high enough) that little noise is heard. Location is one of the things that we are most pleased with,Finally I will mention the incredible service we've got on the service desk. They've assisted us on travelling suggestions, navigating the subway to peripheral parts of Tokyo, writing down notes for us and assisting with most everything.

It was important because of experience with tiny rooms in Japanese hotels. The twin beds are double beds and can accomodate one adult and a child easily. The bathroom is also huge by Japanese standards. The hotel is conveniently located near Shibuya station, about 10 min walk over the pedestrian bridge. Shibuya station is next to Tokyu Department store. Foreign passport holders can get password from the Shibuya station information counter for free wifi access in surrounding area, which extends to Tokyu department store. Because the hotel charges for internet access, naturally, we resorted to the free wifi at the station. I have also noticed that the department stores offer free wifi but you have to show your passport to prove you are a foreigner.We arrived earlier in the morning and did not expect to have a room. However, the reception staff was kind enough to have found an available room and we managed to check in in less than half an hour.One tip for passengers arriving in Haneda Airport, is to buy the Subway and metro pass from the airport, if there is plan to be in Tokyo for at least 3 days and planning to travel alot. This is different from the JR pass we realised but in the end, the costs might equal what you would spend on the subway but save on the hassle of having to buy a ticket each way. I believe it costs yen 2500 for 2 adults and 1 child. An average subway ticket might be at least Yen 250 one way and alot more depending on the distance. This ticket does not entitle one to take the JR but we didnt see that as an issue as the the lines appear to be run alongside anyway but the JR tickets costs more.The bus ride from Haneda to Cerulean is about 30 mins and costs Yen1300 one way.",singapore,66,4.0

Perfect station to hub from. Also a ton of shopping, restaurants, bars in the area. While it would be considered a younger area - lots of teenagers with the types of stores you would expect (Forever 21) but definitely a fun area to check out.- Room was huge and had a very nice view. I'm told we were upgraded which was a nice touch, however, after trying to book another night and hearing the actual cost of the room - certainly not worth it in my opinion. - Staff was friendly, albeit impersonal. Nothing was bad per se, but was I wasn't as impressed with was:- Personality - the hotel had zero personality, sorry to say. We basically came and left. Really no place to sit down in the lobby except for the restaurant/bar areas.- No free wifi, pretty much tablestakes in my opinion. However, I've found the more expensive the hotel gets, you pay for wifi. The less expensive the hotel is, you get free wifi. Not sure I get this? Good thing we had a mobile wiFi device which I highly highly highly recommend in general around Tokyo as wifi is hard to come by and things are not the easiest to find if you don't read or speak japanese. Cost is nominal - less than $10 US per day or so and you can rent at the airport (or in advance and its even cheaper if you're more organized than I am!)- Expensive breakfast, didn't partake - however, good patisseries (Viron), coffee shops (Fuglen, Streamer Coffee) - within 10 min walk If you like and need a large breakfast (western style) it will not be cheap. However, again, pancakes are all the rage in Tokyo right now and there are 5+ places within a 10-15 min walk with delicious breakfasts (Bills, Eggs & Things, Sunday Jam Harajuku, Cafe Kaila). Only downside is most have huge lines daily.- We tried to stay another night but ended up changing hotels. We were more than willing to move to a less expensive room given the upgrade, however, given that room was going to be significantly more per night than what we originally paid, we decided to move on.Overall, great location - however, for the price which doesn't include wifi or breakfast I'm not sure we would stay again.","Toronto, Canada",56,3.0

The view from the room over Tokyo is a welcoming site when you first wake up in the morning and when you fall asleep.Customer service is exceptional, they helped us find any restaurants/bars/shops we were looking for that day.ONLY negative is they charge an additional fee for wi-fi which I think is ridiculous.

The last time I stayed in a hotel in Shibuya the room was the size of my walk-in wardrobe at home, so I was pleasantly surprised how spacious the Cerulean is. It is also very new, or at least it seems to me as it is new, which means the room is also very clean. I love it. The only downside is that the room is slightly too ""cool"". It does not have the luxury taste that you get at the Four Seasons or Grand Hyatt; then again, you are not paying those prices!The bathroom is enormous - and so tastefully designed. The whole decor is modern Japanese and it reminds me of a modern ryokan. The bathroom has a huge ""wet area"" where the shower and bathtub is in one room. Service is excellent, as is expected from a top hotel in Japan. I did not have breakfast at the hotel so am unable to comment on it. There are plenty of noodle restaurants in the vicinity so it is easy and efficient to get a quick bite.Apparently there is a airport limo shuttle bus that brings you straight to the hotel so that makes it easy. I took a MK taxi with a meet and greet service; the bill was slightly under ¥10,000 and for two people I thought it was worth paying for the convenience.

Rooms are as luxurious as you'd expect for the price, with an amazing bathroom. The room was surprisingly roomy (for Tokyo standards), and our group of three adults fit comfortably despite there being 3 single beds, 2 arm chairs, and 2 small tables. The beds were really quite hard, I was surprised I slept as well as I did given they were so firm. Location is excellent, just a short walk (up a reasonable hill) up from Shibuya station. When you exit Shibuya station from the West exit, just stand on the street and look up, and the highest building you can see ahead and to the left is the hotel. You have to cross an overpass to get over to the correct side of the hotel, but there are lifts you can take if you have a lot of luggage. Just an easy 5min walk to Shibuya crossing and all the great shopping in that area. We enjoyed a lunch and a dinner on the top floor of the Seibu shopping mall, which was very well priced and delicious. (In Tokyo, it seems that most shopping malls have excellent top-floor eating areas which are comprised of smaller restaurants that are well priced and good quality.)As mentioned by others, the only downside to this hotel was the exorbitant costs for anything that wasn't included. Internet was $10 a day (not a 24hr period I believe), to sit down and have a coffee in the foyer was upwards of 1,300yen, and to use a tea bag in the room was about 300yen. Ouch!!The service was amazing, with super polite staff on every corner just to greet you and assist in any way. We booked the airport limousine to return to the airport through the concierge, and they took care of every aspect. It was wonderful having the porter come up to our room to collect our bags when we were ready to check out, which they then stored for the day and then packed onto the limousine bus for us at the end of the day as we left the hotel for the airport.","Kiama, Australia",30,5.0

I was expecting a pretty standard business hotel - it is located in a tower that also has offices etc - particularly as the reasonable price didn't suggest it would be anything special. But it was a really great end to our stay in Tokyo. The hotel is in a handy location - we were able to walk just a few minutes, pushing our suitcases, from Shibuya station. There is a great pedestrian overpass that gets you up and over the very busy intersection outside the station. So only a few minutes from trains and from all the shops, bars and restaurants of Shibuya - you are really close to things, but get a little bit of peace and quiet as you are a few minutes away. The view of the city from our room on floor 32 was amazing. The rooms are modern and spacious with big bathrooms and lots of space to put bags. Our only option when booking through the Expedia website was a Queen Room, and the reception desk confirmed our booking in a Queen Room, but when we got up there it had a huge King bed so that was a nice surprise. Not sure if that is standard or if there was a mix up, but the bed was very comfy. I didn't touch the mini bar but it seemed to have only drinks, no snacks. The toiletries in the bathroom are only average, but snuggly bathrobes and a good hairdryer made up for it. We caught a limo bus back to Narita Airport for about 3000 yen each - really easy. The concierge organised for us the day before and we got picked up downstairs from the hotel carpark. Annoyingly, we could get a coffee in the nice looking lobby café either time we tried - the first time it was full and the second time they weren't letting people in because they were expecting a large group. That was a bit of a blip which they should sort out. Overall an excellent spot and we would return.",,25,4.0

A corner room provided enough space for 3 adults, still leaving enough room for a small table, desk and sofa….quite a lot of space for a Tokyo hotel. Room 2315 had a good view of the famous crossing from ""Lost In Translation"" and straight up the main street of Shibuya. The bathroom was spacious too with a double basin, separate shower and bath.Location wise this hotel is excellent, being close enough to Shibuya Station to make luggage not a problem and an easy walk to the busy Centre Gai area, with all its little restaurants and bars. We had some great days wandering through nearby Harajuku and shopping along Shibuyu's chic Omotesando Street. For a dose of nature in the big city, the Meji Shine is close and if you can manage it, go on a Saturday morning when you should see some traditional weddings taking place.Best of all is the nearby Tokyu Food Show situated under the train station, which is a fascinating food hall full of delicacies from all over the world. After some very pricey restaurant experiences and two weeks of (delicious) Japanese food it was still a pleasant change to indulge in some French wine and cheese. Having said that, the gyozas were tasty here and the sashimi fresh. There's also a small noodle cafe and a good ice-cream bar. After 1500 lots of sushi and sashimi items were reduced.Behind the hotel there is also a little street of restaurants with what seemed to be a very popular sukiyaki restaurant - so busy we couldn't get a table. Go out via the hotel door to the taxi rank, take the exit on the left, left again once on the street, cross the street and you will see a small, though busy restaurant area on the right.The hotel staff in general, are very helpful and accommodating and happily arrange onward bookings, transfers and tickets. My only criticism of the hotel staff, concerns the 40th floor bar. We went for a quick drink and to enjoy the wonderful view. There were very few people there as it was early evening. My husband and I both ordered cocktails however our daughter chose not to drink. We were firmly told that it was one person, one drink. I could possibly understand it if we hadn't already ordered 2 cocktails or if there was a seating issue, however such a policy should not apply to a young person accompanying her parents to a bar and an pretty empty one at that.The lobby bar is a busy place in the afternoon both for drinks and afternoon tea. The cakes were excellent. We ate breakfast in the cafe for convenience only as the food was not great - typical of our experiences in Tokyo for European style breakfasts. Tokyu Food Show provides some excellent alternatives however.This a a good hotel, easily accessed on the train and connections to most major areas were easy too. Be sure to get a corner room if you are staying long enough and definitely if there are more than two of you. Non smoking rooms are available.","Sydney, Australia",100,4.0

The hotel is beautiful but I would not stay there again.POSITIVES:The hotel stands out in Shibuya from far away - it is one of the tallest building in the area and is very easy to find. It has a nice, grand lobby with a lot of staff to help you check-in, take your bags, and guide you around. The rooms are nice and spacious by Tokyo standards - we didn't have enough room to do cartwheels around the bed, but there was plenty of room for two people to move around. The bathroom was really nice and big, with an enclosed glass shower and tub, double vanity and ""washing"" toilet.Prior to our arrival, I emailed the concierge to help us make some dinner and lunch reservations (including at the famous Jiro's) and they were very quick to respond and help us out. When we arrived they had a printed map to show us where to go and details about the reservation. NEGATIVES:The Cerulean is a 5 start hotel with a pretty hefty price tag, so I had high expectations. It was very disappointing to learn that wifi was not free in the hotel - it was $10 a day and you got a code that worked for only 24hrs at a time. This seemed outrageous! How can you charge this much for a room, in a busy tourist area and not include wifi?!There is a bar at the top floor of the hotel with an incredible 360 view of Tokyo. BUT if you want to grab a seat or a table, there is a $10 per person charge (the only ""free"" seats are the bar). Again, outrageous, especially since the drinks are really expensive as well - I had a $26 cocktail and my husband a $17 glass of whiskey.There was a gym at the hotel, but we did not visit it as it was also NOT free. It was $10 a day to use it, and only free for two hours at 5am. Very strange.Overall, I was happy with the location, the room and the staff, but a hotel this expensive should not charge its guests for every small amenity. Unfortunately, I would not book the Cerulean again.","Chicago, Illinois",86,3.0

A seat at the bar gives you a great view of the city and the cocktails are fab. The hotel seems more catered for business guests and it seems to be a local hub for business lunches and meetings. The location is what really sells this hotel. You are within 5 minutes walking distance of the subway and two minutes from the centre of shibuya. Also the airport limo bus stops at the basement level of the hotel. This is really convenient for getting to and from the airport. The concierge can book your tickets for you in advance.

We have always asked for the Shibuya crossing-view and luckily gotten it every time, It´s really the best to watch dusk falling over busy Shibuya and all the lights of Tokyo from the 34th floor. The view & location are some of the best things about this hotel, it is very close to Shibuya station (maybe 4 min) BUT you have to walk across a elevated walkway to get to it. Luckily there is an elevator on the station side if you have heavy bags. The hotel itself has a luxurious feel i think, big lobby, superfast (earpopping) elevators and attentive lobby-staff. Sometimes we had to deal with some confusions, like trying to charge us for internet-access even though it´s included in our plan or different quotes on charges which was a bit annoying. But overall totally worth it for me, because they always give us the room (view) we want, and the misunderstandings are worked out.

At US$350 a night it's about the same or even less than it's equivalents in NYC and London, and the service for every requirement, from room service, to bell-hop, to concierge, was impeccable and seldom bettered in my experience. We spent little time in our accommodation as we were in full tourist mode to look around at a Shibuya I last saw 40 years ago .

Very large room by Tokyo or any standards (plus we had 3 single beds in there), an enormous divided bathroom with a powerful shower and separate tub in their own glasses in section , and unbeatable city views from 20th and then 21st floors facing Sky Tree etc. Even better from 39/40th windows which faced Mt.Fuji. Excellent front desk and concierge staff who helped us with everything from JR railways tickets (organized all connections to snow monkeys land and then Kyoto and back), had them delivered to the hotel for a 5% commission. Then they managed to track down a specific coat which my daughter wanted at Takashimaya department store. Internet is extra , but one charge for unlimited devices (we had 6) , once codes are punched in it lasted for entire stay. They offered the weekly rate ($36) which was cheaper then the daily. Pool is also an extra charge but we never had time to go anyway. We felt at home and were well taken care of at all times in the incredible city of Tokyo.

Let me just say, this is a great location, with restaurants and convenience stores just next door. Also, I thought the service around checkin and breakfast was great. While those were positives of this hotel, there are a few things that would make me reconsider staying here in the future. First, while the room was a nice size, the bathroom was very dark and there was limited counterspace. I had a hard time getting ready and finally just started curling my hair and applying makeup in the bedroom where there was more light and space.Next, I visited the gym twice and both times was disappointed. There were not very many cardio options, only treadmills. Also, the weights area was very small and there were no complimentary waters. Finally, my coworkers and I were disappointed with the bar on the 40th floor. We visited for a drink after a long day of work but were met with a VERY smoky bar and poor service. It took our group of 4 a half hour to recieve our ordered drinks! Only when we said we were leaving did our drinks appear.All in all, this isn't a bad hotel.

We just stayed a few great nights in Kyoto and hoped our stay in Tokyo would be comfortable too. We were not disappointed. Check-in was super quick. Our reservation was found quickly, our bags sent from Kyoto were waiting for us. Since we booked through Expedia, we got an additional upgrade. Initially we booked a queen on the Sky Floors for a better view.... we were put in a deluxe king room on those Sky Floor. First thing you notice as you enter is that the room had nice size closet that fit all our large luggage. After that you see a nice size room with large bed and HUGE window with great view of Shibuya with Shinjuku in the distance. Angle your head and you can also see Tokyo Sky Tree.The bathroom was also amazing. We had a separate shower and tub. The tub was very deep with another HUGE window. Such an amazing view.

Plenty of room for us when we spread our souvenirs out to check.The staff is always friendly and took care of every need we had from room service, to laundry service, even to help us ship boxes back home to the States.The hotel is very close to the JR Shibuya station. There is shopping very close. Just cross the street into the heart of Shibuya.Only few minor cons I can think of it that the sheets had a funny feel to them as though the soap wasn't completely washed out. The mini-bar was really expensive compared to the same available drinks less than a block away (330JPY for a can of Coke when you can get a bottle downstairs for about 150-180JPY).

Our rooms was gorgeous, very spacious, huge king size bed, with separate dressing room for luggage. The bathroom was all marble, with a view over Tokyo, so no need to visit the Tokyo Sky Tree for a city observation. There is a window ledge where you can sit to watch the sun rise (depending on which side of the building you're on) which was just beautiful. We were on the 23rd floor. We were a 5 minute walk from Shibuya station which has access to both the Metro and JR lines providing seamless travel throughout Tokyo. It's also a stop for the Limousine Bus from Narita airport so there was no juggling with train stations on arrival in Japan, simply door to door service, 3000yen per adult, 1500 per child each way. I couldn't find fault with the room, the service, or the cleanliness, but it was devoid of any personal touches that you may get with a smaller hotel. Also, it seems ridiculous free wi-fi is not offered in the rooms. It is not cheap to stay at the 5 star hotel so surely the cost can be included in the room rate. It is available for about 1000yen I think for a 24 hr period. An early checkin was not available even though it was requested in advance, but they did accommodate us in the fitness centre where we could have a shower and change after an all night flight. Regarding the fitness centre too, under 18s are not allowed to use it, including the pool which I thought was too restrictive. Maybe it would be better to set aside certain hours where children may use the pool and not interfere with business guests so everyone could be accommodated. So all up, the hotel was superb, but not very family oriented or traveller oriented. There were no little extras provided, most likely because business travellers have an expense account and don't worry about the incidentals. I wouldn't stay here again, because I would like to try a different area, there are so many to choose from in Tokyo, and a more family friendly hotel would have been better.","Samford, Australia",2,4.0

Service was excellent - when I noticed the room was warm, the workman told me they have sensors that turn off the AC when you leave the room.

And the location is great, in walking distance to the center of Shibuya, which is why I always recommend it. But once you get into the room things feel immediately disappointing. I paid over $300 for the night and expecting something that would reflect that price. Not so unfortunately. The carpet was stained, decor was beyond boring (no colour at all), room size was poor for the price, view wasn't even that inspiring. The shower room didn't have a fan and the toilet didn't have any of the latest functionality (if you're a visitor, you're seriously missing out if you don't try the latest in toilet technology whilst in town!).. I had forgotten my facial moisturizer but nothing in the amenity kit (in fact the amenities didn't look impressive at all). To top it all off, they didn't have free wifi!! Over $300 per night and they wanted to charge me for wifi!! Got to be kidding me. My client told me the next day he paid for it and that the reception was terrible. During our conference we also had to go without wifi as it was not available there. I'm semi-vegan and asked them where in the hotel I could get lunch. The answer was nowhere... so again, definitely not to an international standard.Even the service wasn't top notch.

Most of the employees can speak enough English to enable me to communicate (I only know thank you in Japanese!). And they are spot on with white glove treatment. When you come in there is always someone to greet and assist you (sometimes with a refreshing cool wash cloth) before you get to the front desk. If you call room service or anyone for service they are prompt! One time I called the front desk to ask about laundry facilities (they only have laundry service) and they sent someone up within minutes to pick up my laundry even though I had not requested it! I also had called down to inquire about an ice machine and they informed me that room service delivers ice. I said okay and hung up figuring it seemed to much of a hassle and would likely have to pay for it. Nope! Within 5 minutes room service was at my door with a bucket of ice delivered in very much a 5-star manner! Great room and roomy for Japanese standards from what I've been told and the bathrooms are awesome and appointed nicely. The only negatives: Well the beds are a bit hard; but I didn't have any problems sleeping. Also the carpets in the halls especially near our elevator were a bit worn but that pales in comparison the superiority of everything else. Oh yeah, yes the Tower bar rocks (had to pay $8pp for a window table instead of bar but view was worth it). Service awesome there too! And yes the 7-11 on the 2nd floor is convenient. BTW the Food Show (a grocery store with everything!) at the bottom floor of the Shibuya station is also nice when you are coming back and want some ready made food.

We got there early and got an earlier check in which was nice. I have stayed in many hotels and this is one of the best. Not just that The staff is so nice, they are nice every where in Japan. Everything about this hotel is good. They have a lovely breakfast buffe and the food is nice in the restaurants that we tried. The location of the hotel can not be better. So easy access to the train/metro station, max 5 min. We took the train from the airport and it was so handy. You get a card that takes you to the hotel and that is loaded with 1500 yen and is refillable. No rush on that train and stops at Shibuya station. Can not be easier. Someone said it would be hard to understand the train/metro system. It is dead easy, do not hesitate.The rooms are great size and with fantastic view and clean. The only thing was that one can tell it is mostly men travelling in Japan. If ypu wanted women toiletteries you had to ask and the schampoo was men smell. I solved that by using the products in the gym/pool. They had good products. Loved the gym and the pool except that you had to pay (free 6-7). I think that should be included on the other hand it was almost empty. The gym/pool is from 18yo, I liked that. No kids junping and screaming but maybe a minus if you have kids.You have to pay for internet too but not too much and it was fast. I tried to book a spa apointment when we arrived, i so needed one but they were full for the next days. So if you want to use it book in advance. Was a bit disapointed over that.This is the best area in Tokyo. There are so much going on and great shoping area. Easy to access the rest of the city. Lots snd lots of great reastaurants. We found that many good restaurants were in the basements. They do not have menues in English but that does not matter be wild and crazy and they try to explain as good as they can.I liked it so much so we cancelled our other hotel for when we get back from the trip around Japan and rebooked this one. I then tried to store a small bag to with things we bought but that was not possible. Done that in Thailand and there it is never a problem.",Stockholm,27,5.0

Customer service and cleanliness are impeccable. Most of the staff speak English. The hotel is expensive and the size of your average hotel room in the states with very nice amenities and very comfortable room. Hallways were hot but, I believe that was related to energy conservation and I assume the tsunami. It was like that all around Japan. Some of my family members stayed at Shibuya Excel hotel. Still nice but, I got to see the average hotel size in Tokyo which is half the size of a room at the Cerulean. We had two rooms with 3 in one and two in the other. Yes folks who are new to visiting Japan apparently most hotel rooms in Tokyo do not sleep 4 people. It worked out for my family because we had an extra adult traveling with us to house one of my kids. We took the Cerulean Airport Limousine Bus which drops you off at the front of the hotel. They were very organized getting everyone's luggage straight which I appreciated as we were all tired from the long flight. Airport bus transport is definitely more expensive than the train but, I most definitely would not have wanted to get on a crowded train to get to the hotel after a long flight. Shibuya Train station is a 5 minute walk away from the hotel across from East/West Mall near the Hachiko statue and the Shibuya Crossing which should be a requirement to cross at night just to experience the strangely organized chaos. Pay attention on the walking bridge. If you get confused just look up for the Cerulean towers and you will get your bearings. We were in Tokyo during a massive heat wave and one day I was by myself and felt like Chevy Chase in European vacation walking around on the bridge. I am going to blame it on dehydration. My only complaint would be the expensive WiFi and the gym is only free from 6am-7am in the morning. Any other time you have to pay along with the hotel bar. Restaurants in the hotel are also very expensive. I think we paid $12 for a coke which brings me to my love affair with the 7-11 right next to the hotel. You literally get off on the 2nd floor and head to the exit on the right staying right walking past the restaurant you come up to my beloved 7-11. This isn't just any 7-11 that you would see in the states. This place offers fresh fruit, salads, sandwiches, cold ramen and soba at very reasonable prices. We never ate in the hotel again and enjoyed one or more meals a day from the 7-11. I especially enjoyed the salads and sandwiches with lots of greens as I found it difficult at most restaurants to get lots of veggies. Trains are definitely worth taking getting around Tokyo. I was lucky enough to be with Japanese speaking people so it helped that they knew the transit system already. I think I would have had a hard time otherwise. If you get confused while managing the train system or a cab for that matter and the person does not speak English I found just showing the Japanese version of the website of the place I was going to on my phone helped the cab driver and the attendant at the train station. Can't wait to go back to Tokyo and stay at the Cerulean again!",midwest,134,5.0

Just the 7-11 had me in awe, the cleanliness, customer service. I could barely figure out what the heck I was buying snack-wise, but still fun to walk around and shop. The room was very new and modern, great walk-in shower/tub room thing, amazing large window view. My only little complaint is they charged me for a coffee from the mini-bar ($4) which is standard in Tokyo, though, and the breakfast was expensive, like $30 - $40 a plate so my husband and I ordered one and split it. Great location for tour pickups for Viator tours. Great drop off spot for airport limo. In a business area near the Shibuya station, another sight to see at 8PM, jam packed.

It's quite hard to find good-sized rooms in Tokyo so when I found Cerulean in my search I knew this was the hotel for me. The room was big (about 30sqm) and the bathrooms were perfectly-sized. I considered another hotel to book but what clinched it for me (although the Cerulean cost $100 more per room) was the fact that the shower was separate from the tub. We all know that Tokyo is the cleanest city and all hotels would be very clean but I just don't trust tubs. The bathroom was large and tastefully-designed. Ask for the Shu Uemura pack which has makeup remover and toner. They didn't have body lotion though which was unfortunate for me as I forgot mine and lotions are incredibly expensive in Tokyo!The concierge was always very helpful.

Also, to use the swimming pool and fitness center there's an additional charge so we did not use either.The room was pretty clean and spacious relative to other hotels in the area which was expected considering the premium we paid. The condition of the room was good, the bed & pillow was comfortable, and the towels were soft. Customer service was very attentive even compared to the other hotels we stayed at in Japan.

It's nice that there's a 7-11 convenience store located at the building. A major plus is that the Cerulean is a stop on the Limousine Bus service to and from the airports so we didn't have to deal with paying a ton for a taxi or lugging our suitcases and backpacks to and through the train station on our way home. It's only 3000 Yen per person and was stress-free.Overall, our stay at the Cerulean was a great one. For the price, I feel that it's worth the premium if you can afford to splurge a little bit.

The housekeepers are polite and attentive to my needs. As there are too many pillows on the bed for one person, I left them at the side and on the couch. On the following day, the housekeeper left the extras aside(saves me the effort to remove them from the bed). It is at a great location as it is a 5 mins walk to JR Line and Metro. Also, you are 5mins away from food haven and Shibuya Crossing! There are several restaurants and convenience store just next to the hotel.

You are a 5 minute walk to the Shibya crossing and all the amazing streets and shops. Also, the station is located there so you have access to all the sights. A fine place to splurge. The only issue is you have to pay $21 to use the pool/exercise room per day. And a $15 a day Wi Fi charge is utterly ridiculous.

It's a short walk from Shibuya station, which is on several subway lines, the Yamanote JR line, the Narita Express, the Shinkansen, and offers good connections to the rest of greater Tokyo. It is also in the Shibuya district, which has a variety of restaurants, clubs, and other nightlife. The hotel is slightly expensive, and the restaurants in the hotel are rather expensive, but it's very easy to eat elsewhere. Some of the rooms offer views of Mt. Fuji, and all of them look out over Tokyo. The rooms are quite large, and the upscale corner rooms are like a small suite. I like being able to get a king sized bed easily. The staff all speaks good english. The lounge for the rooms above the 32nd floor (concierge rooms) has a nice view but is only so-so.My only complaint is that the gym is somewhat small. It's bettter than most American hotels but worse than the full-service gyms you can find in Southeast Asia. The gym is free between 6 and 7 AM. Also, like most Japanese hotels, you can't drop off laundry after 5 PM, so if you need something pressed for the next day, you had better arrive early.

To me, hotel is like any other real estate: location, location, location.As for the facilities, rooms, service and all that jazz, well it's right up there with any top end business hotel. I wish the rooms could be bigger, but frankly having stayed at the Hyatt and the Hilton in nearby Shinjuku, their room sizes are about the same so it's that's all even.

We managed to get upgraded to a corner room which – for Tokyo standards – was massive. Now about the area: Shibuya is now one of my favorite places in the world. There is such a chilled out party atmosphere. Its got great metro connections so you can get yourself to anywhere within Tokyo relatively easily. I was not 100% sure whether I should stay here or the Excel Shibuya.

Shibuya is a lively and trendy part of town with plenty of shopping, eating, and entertainment. Everything about this hotel was excellent.

Clean comfy sheets, two types of pillows, and soft mattress, nice TV, WiFi worked perfectly, mini-bar stocked with a nice variety of drinks. The bathroom was immaculate and was quite big considering the room size. Separate shower and bathtub, huge vanity and sink space, and of course the wonderful Toto Washlet heated toilet. We ate at the breakfast buffet twice, which was very nice. Decent, but not excessive variety of food. Mainly western-style. We really enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice made to order. For dinner we asked the concierge for suggestions and directions to nearby places and were very happy with their suggestions. Our favorite was a casual Japanese restaurant about 5 minutes walk, which featured yakitori, sushi and full service bar. The pool and fitness center were superb as well. Pool and huge hot tub have large windows with views of the city. Sauna and showers were super clean and always had everything perfectly organized and ready for use. I used these facilities twice and both times I was the only person in the pool, which was very relaxing.Overall, this was an amazing stay at this hotel in Tokyo.

The staff are extremely polite and proactive, and never failing to bow to guests when they return to the hotel. I did not try the eateries in the hotel but there is a good and affordable Soba eatery very near the hotel. If there is one thing I like least, it must be the lack of free wi-fi in the hotel.

Most of the action is over the bridge from the hotel, 5 minute walk.There is a Tully's coffee shop and excellent food hall at the Tokyu department store ( it makes Selfridges look poor!). I'd also recommend the Ginza cozy corner which served amazing chiffon cakes. We managed to eat well each evening for between £8-£10. Shibuya has every food type you could wish for, we stuck to the Japanese options which included an amazing sushi place where you order via touch screen and it arrives on a track! There are the usual KFC and McDonalds for those less adventurous!It is easy to get around and the station gives you easy access to the main sites. We took the limousine service to and from the airport, it costs 3000 yen, which is around £24 pound each way. It is convenient and drops you off outside the hotel. You should pre book your return journey though.The staff at the hotel spoke good English, they booked us a visit to a tea ceremony and helped us locate tube stations aswell as providing us with local area maps. I couldn't fault them, they also gave me some plasters when I'd hurt my foot. I am pleased that I chose this hotel.

I will start with these:1) Organisation and friendless is paramount. Everyone smiles all the time, checking in and out is swift and the information desk bends over backwards to help however big or small the query. Everything is incredibly well organised with porters eager to help with luggage too and from your rooms, to the coach- airport luggage ticketing system (a must if travelling from Narita airport) about £25 its easy, direct and perfectly organised, leaving from outside the hotel.2) The breakfasts are AMAZING!! At £21 it isn't cheap (the hotel in general isn't) but you can have a fully cooked breakfast (sausage, egg, toast etc) and the egg is cooked in front of you so you can choose how to have it. I asked for a hot chocolate (instead of tea or coffee which was no problem and delicious) a selection of juices (again squeezed in front of you) cold meats, cereals, and icy cold selection of fruit. I was totally stuffed after eating as much as possible and really set me up for a full days sight seeing.3) The rooms - We were very lucky to be upgraded to a corner room on floor 25 where both the bedroom (2 windows) and bathroom (1 window) had sweeping views of the city below. They are a nice size, with walk in showers and extreamly comfortable beds. There is a nicely hand drawn ""map"" of the landscape so you can identify various buildings from your room (and maybe Mt Fuji on a clear day) which is also a nice touch. Room service and laundry is impeccable, room ordered breakfast comes and exactly the time its ordered and any maintenance involving your room (we couldn't get the CD player to work) a porter is sent up to help immediatly.On our return from Kyoto, we stayed at The Cerulean again and were upgraded for a second time on to the 34th Business floor which granted a smaller non corner room but smarter smellies and an extra table.4) Attached to the hotel is a Seven11 which was very handy for water, coffee and the best cheesecake in the world- a must try really!!The not so great..1) For English speakers, the TV choice is poor and we struggled to find a music station or news channel that was understandable. There is also no I pod docking station but they do have CD players2) The swimming pool you have to pay for which I thought was unacceptable. As a paying guest, this should be a luxury that everyone could enjoy. We actually ran out of time to even try it, but when I popped up to have a look at it, it was completely deserted and I'm not surprised!3) They have (amongst others I think) a few restaurants in the hotel. A word of warning...DO NOT BOTHER with the Japanese one. It was empty, we had to wait 45 mins for ANY food to arrive, the portions (when they did) were tiny and HUGELY over priced for what was served. We all left disappointing, hungry and few pounds lighter. This is NOT a bench mark for most restaurants in Tokyo. However, both the Chinese looked buzzy and the Italian lively and with a neat interior which both (although we didn't try) would have probably been better options if eating at the hotel.4) Although the staff are attentive, helpful and continuously smiling, this is a very large hotel with office space in the middle taking up about 13 floors so the volume of empty space in the entrance can often feel overwhelming and pointless. The general style of the entrance is slightly old fashioned (I think) but is their attempt at modern with a traditional Japanese twist. It's obvious from the website that it is large so if big is not you you then neither is this hotel.IN CONCLUSION: A very enjoyable stay and would highly recommend :-)","London, United Kingdom",12,4.0

We chose it after reading the reviews on trip advisor, Tokyo is huge but Shibuya is where the action is. The hotel is five minutes from Shibuya railway station, one of the biggest and busiest stations in Tokyo. If you arrive by train from Narita take the west or south exit. When you come out of the station look to the left and the tower is visible. Use the overhead walkways to reach the hotel. - there are lifts if you have luggage.The reception is on the first floor but the rooms are on the 19th to 40th floor. Our non smoking room was on the 25th floor and had wonderful views of the area. The room is spacious with a spacious bathroom with lots of marble and a great shower. The hotel charges for WiFi. It costs 3600 yen for a week. We were able to run a laptop, ipad and mobile phone in our room and the speed was excellent.On the ground floor is the Caramelo restaurant where there is an excellent breakfast buffet. It might appear expensive but is a great way to start the day with excellent food. No one hurries you to leave and breakfast is served until 10.30am. Time to plan your day.Without exception the staff are helpful and friendly. They make you feel welcome. We used the concierge service to book restaurants and seek directions. The staff remembered my name 24 hours later. This is Japan at its best.On the second floor just outside the entrance is a very handy 7/11 convenience store. 7 bank has an ATM inside which works with overseas travel cards and other cards. Be aware few Japanese banks ATM will work with overseas cards, but the 7/11 chain works fine.To sum up:Whilst the Cerulean might appear expensive it is great value and a genuine 5 star hotel with service to match.

It costs you 1,000 yen per person.The room in Cerulean is spacious by the Japnanese standard. The shower and bath tub are enclosed behind a glass pane to avoid the steam transmitting into the rest of the bathroom.If the weather is good, you can also get a glimpse of the Tokyo Tower from your own room. Request for a room on a high-floor zone if possible. It would enable you to have a better view of the entirety of the Shibuya area.In terms of location, there should be no complaint. When you walk down from Cerulean (check from the lift), you should come across a pedestrian walkover (please watch for the FIRST). After you cross it you would find yourself landing in the Shibuya station. It is one of the biggest and busiest transit stations. You can get a day pass to save some money. Please make sure you get the correct line e.g. JR/Metro etc. If you do not opt for breakfast in Cerulean, there are nice coffee shops and fast food shops around offering nice coffee and sandwiches to choose from to fuel youself in before staring a day for sight-seeing.If you are starved, the basement floor in Tokyu Department Store is the best place to shop for fresh and reasonably priced sashimi and sushi. Facing the Shibuya station and opposite to Tokyu Department Store is the popular shopping area of Shibuya. You will find 109 and Mark City close-by.For food gourmets who look for better quality for dinner, there is a ""food"" street across the pedestrian cross-over (mentioned above) close to Mark City where you will be afforded with loads of choices varying from Japanese noodles (ramen), sushi, BBQ (korean style) and teppanyaki etc. It is only approximately 5 minutes away from Cerulean.

Bar on level 40 is nice enough but the ambience is a little lacking. It could be made so much better and help them capitalise on the stunning views of the city if the brought it up a notch.Customer service overall is what you expect from Japan but as many others state here, this hotel has a bit more of a business feel, than it has character ambience and that shows in the staff.

We booked a room on the executive 'Cerulean' floor which included breakfast and access to the lounge. I would recommend this as it is nice to have the extra facilities inclusive. The service was excellent and the staff were very attentive and polite. The room was clean and I believe large by Tokyo standards but for me was a similar size to a standard hotel room in other major cities around the world. The bathroom and shower were excellent and the whole hotel was spotlessly clean. As I mentioned, the let down for me was comparing similar facilities between the ICON and Cerulean but the ICON just managed to go one step beyond in terms of service of what the Cerulean offered. Both had breakfast included but the ICONs spread was a buffet and also full service and was a much larger selection rather than a small buffet. They both offered afternoon tea but again it was full service at the ICON rather than serve yourself at Cerulean etc etc. I don't want to keep comparing in this review as what is on offer at Cerulean is excellent but for me I only recently had better in Hong Kong.The bed was very comfortable and of course the location of the hotel is superb right in the middle of things. If you wish to travel by public transport the station is only a short walk away but as with all Japanese service, the hotel are most efficient at organising a taxi should you prefer.All in all I would recommend the Cerulean but just be aware that other than attentive staff you are getting quite a bland corporate 5 star hotel rather than a hotel with huge amounts of character or a hotel that really does go above and beyond.","Wellington, New Zealand",44,4.0

We decided to transfer to the Disneyland Hotel and when asked about a car transfer they quoted us about $250 saying there was a taxi shortage due to a soccer game in Yokohama! I assume they only called the places they had deals with where they could overcharge you again. Not getting much help I called Hotel Disneyland myself and they sent a 9 person van for half the price so much for the shortage of local transport. Ironically we had a much better experience at the much more touristy Disneyland Hotel in Tokyo - well at least they didn't nickel and dime us to death and directed us our queries appropriately. The two stars are basically for the central location and the reasonably sized rooms but I would not recommend this place especially if you have other options especially for families.","Singapore, Singapore",40,2.0

Overall the price was reasonable for a hotel of this type and the service we received was excellent. We arrived at 11am and wanted to leave luggage there until we could check-in, but our room was already available so we were taken to our room early. Porters were polite and spoke good English. The room itself was clean and quiet and had everything we needed. We didn't use anything from the mini-bar - anyone traveling on a budget knows that's a no-no! Location is excellent, very close to the Shibuya madness, and easy to locate from Shibuya station - just take the south exit and look up to your left! - that giant tower is Cerulean. We ordered a room service breakfast as a treat, (Japanese-style) however in comparison to the Japanese meals we'd had at other Ryokans and hotels this one was a little bland and not quite the 'feast' that is the usual Japanese breakfast. It's nice to have it bought to your room in the morning however I don't think it's worth the money. We missed out on checking out the on-site Noh Theatre but if you are there when there is a Noh performance on I would go - Noh Theatre really is a treat; there is nothing else like it; it is very strange and don't expect a narrative but quite a cultural experience. Overall our stay at Cerulean was pleasant and we were comfortable however the traditional accommodation in Japan is far better value for money in my opinion, but it does just depend on what suits your taste.",Brisbane,13,4.0

Also the airport limousine bus stops direct here if you are flying in from narita airport. Unlike other countries where the bus stops at several hotel, this one only serves two.

They were extremely helpful in getting us dinner reservations and gave excellent recommendations as well as detailed explanations that made everything simple. The room size is great for Tokyo and the view was spectacular from the room. The only reason I gave it a rating of 4 is the small things like - 1) No free internet (doesn't make sense nowadays, there is free wifi in most of the city)2) When we went to the bar on top (amazing view) and asked for a table near the window, they told us none are available, so when I said we will wait, they said there is a charge per person to get those tables, and as soon as I said yes they took us to an empty table.3) Needed to print something before checking out, the first reaction was - there is a charge of 500yen per 15 mins, which again doesnt make sense since we are staying in the hotel.

The location is superb and the hotel is modern, well-appointed with efficient curteous service, as you would expect at this price range. We noticed a surprising number of families during our stay, probably due to the relatively spacious rooms and it being a holiday weekend.We had a standard two-twin room with modern furnishings, a work-desk area, a stuffed chair and ottoman, flatscreen TV, mini-bar. Large picture window with panoramic views of Tokyo and beyond. The bathroom is fantastic, even by Japanese standards, with a large glass-enclosed shower/tub area. The usual brevy of bath products, plush robes, nightgowns, etc. Plenty of closet space and drawers.The only negative of the room was, amazingly enough, the noise. I'm not sure if we had especially active people above us but, frankly, it sounded like they were doing gymnastics above us. We didn't hear any noise from nextdoor neighbors but, then, it didn't seem like the rooms were occupied either.We had breakfast at the hotel each day and sampled the buffet as well as the Japanese restaurant; both start at 3,000 yen per person. The buffet is mostly western (or, rather, the Japanese version of 'western' which includes salad and brunch-style dishes as well as the typical breakfast items) and only very limited Japanese offerings (no rice or miso soup.) For a typical Japanese breakfast, you need to go to the Japanese restaurant.We also had meals at the Chinese restaurant (excellent) and the Italian restaurant (OK). Overall, the service at the restaurants was surprisingly mediocre. The servers were young and seemed inexperienced and rather inattentive -- we waited often, it seems, for water glass refills, coffee, plates to be cleared, etc. and at the Japanese breakfast, we missed a course all together.This hotel is one of the two Shibuya stops for the Limousine (Tokyu) Buses that service Narita and Haneda airports. We took the bus from Haneda (1,000 yen) and to Narita (3,000 yen) after our stay. The concierge made the reservations for us. My father has mobility issues and the bus transportation was extremely convenient and comfortable.Shibuya (train) station is less than a 5-minute walk from the hotel and can be negotiated by those with impaired mobility. The pedestrian overpasses have elevator accesses, as does the train station.All in all, we thought this was an excellent hotel for travellers who appreciate a convenient location and modern spacious rooms but aren't looking for warm gracious service. At rack rates, I think the property would be over-priced.","Ann Arbor, Michigan",15,4.0

The breakfast restaurant at the lobby level is rather good, with plenty of fresh choices, but the rate of 30.000 yen (abt. 30 euro) is a bit too high for no good reason. Even if you clearly warn them of your arrival in the morning, usually your room will not be ready until 11.00 or so. If you have some luck they will upgrade to a superior room if availbale.

OK, that's not a small amount, but the Towers room is located on the high Exec floors and includes access to the Exec lounge for breakfast and complimentary drinks each evening from 1700-1930 as well as refreshments throughout the day. In general I think the hotel advertises its basic rooms at not much less than this rate. The hotel is very easy to locate if you arrive into Shibuya station as we did - if you've previously had a look at an exterior photo then you can't miss it when you exit the station main entrance. From there it's a less than 5 minute walk to the hotel lobby. The lobby is not particularly inspiring and lacked seating space on occasions but there are always many staff on hand to assist. Check in was quick & efficient if not particularly friendly. Our room on the 34rd floor was large by Japanese standards with a comfortable king bed & work area. There are great views in all directions and huge windows to take it all in. The bathroom was very nice with a completely separate screened off bath & shower area which I'm guessing is to prevent the rest of the bathroom getting steamy. One thing I did notice about the room that it was on the warm side...despite the A/C being set lower I couldn't get the temp much below 25C (as indicated by the thermo)...the corridors outside were very warm. My understanding is that this is fairly typical in Tokyo now as there is an attempt to reduce power consumption after the 2011 earthquake and its results on the power grid? We very much enjoyed using the executive 'salon'. It was always very quiet in there, never any issue getting a seat by the window to watch the sun setting over the city. As a business lounge the atmosphere was more conservative than party, but still a great way to start the evening. They served Moet for Champagne lovers, a small selection of beers, wine and the usual array of spirits - the choice of nibbles was fairly simple - cheese, crackers, nuts, chips etc. Towers room permits breakfast in the salon but not at any of the other hotel eateries. A simple affair but covered all the basics...tea, coffee, fruit juices, toast, fruit, cereal, scrambled eggs, poached eggs, bacon, sausages etc but nothing cooked to order. They did also serve salads & soup for breakfast. It's an entirely self service affair including the tea & coffee...some guests seemed to be waiting to be waited on! The lounge attendants were happy to provide wifi logon passwords which were complimentary (although I believe the hotel does charge some guests) and good for 24 hours - you do need one PER DEVICE though. The room certainly included complimentary wired internet but no details about wifi were offered at checkin so it was good to find out this was available after all - note that this may be executive floor only benefit? Shibuya is a good area for shopping and transport connections...it would be less than 10mins walk from the hotel to Shibuya crossing and the centre of the shopping area. It's a very quick journey to other tourist areas of Tokyo - Harajuku, Shinjuku, Roppongi, Ginza etc. The express train to Narita leaves from Shibuya and I believe the hotel is also served by the slightly cheaper Limousine buses. I'd be more than happy to stay at the Cerulean again but the price would have to be right having been spoiled by the Towers room & exec lounge this time around!","St Kilda East, Australia",93,4.0

It is designed for a business traveller, and is very well located in Shibuya, which makes it a good choice if you are looking for a functional place to stay. Worth noting, this place is also quite expensive, so I would only recommend it for business, and when your company is footing the bill. For a personal trip I would recommend somewhere with more uniqueness and personality at this price point.Arrival is easy, just take the shuttle bus straight from the International Arrivals hall at the airport - it drops you off straight at the hotel for a fraction of the price of a taxi. I found hotel check-in to be relatively easy, but the conversation became difficult after I asked about changing to a different view. But it all worked out in the end, and I got a room with a better view, but at a higher rate.The staff is very polite, and helpful with any requests you may make, but the service lacks personality, and you won't feel as though you are a unique visitor in the same way you will at the Conrad or Park Hyatt in Tokyo. The rooms are very functional, with a desk and internet setup that allows for easy working. And the bed is very comfortable with nice bedding and a good selection of very comfortable pillows, including memory foam. The main selling point of the rooms are the views that But overall, the decor is very 90's and slightly dated, nothing special or unique to speak of, and in general the rooms feel quite bland. No special amenities to make you feel wowed or fuzzy when you return to your room after a long day. The TV selection is all Japanese, so unless you want to watch Japanese game shows or programs dubbed in Japanese, you are kind of out of luck. The bathrooms are nice and very clean, but the toiletries provided are lackluster and generic, which I wouldn't expect from a hotel charging these prices.Room service is lackluster and very expensive. For snacks and such, though, there is a 7-Eleven in the building on the first floor which is much less expensive and with wider selection than the mini bar. The bar on the top floor is a great view, but again, very expensive. You are paying for the view. Also, I was shocked that the restaurant on the top floor wanted to charge my coworkers and I a cover charge to sit and eat dinner when we were guests at the hotel.The location is great, however, and for any wanderings you might do in your free time, you are very close to the hustle of Shibuya and very close to all major transport options.All in all, I would say that this is a good choice for business, but I wouldn't recommend it for any other purposes if you want something special.","Portland, Oregon",32,4.0

But the restaurants and bars aren't open late or early so you're out of luck if you can't get to sleep or wake up really early...as one is likely to do the first few days of the trip.

On my birthday night after dinner we went to a local bar and were given free soju which was great until I got so drunk I fell flat on my face and was basically carried back to the Cerulean Towers. *sigh* so many great memories of Shibuya.Our room was spacious and the view was breath taking.The bath room floor seemed to be fashioned out of a single slab of marble, with drainage ducts carved into it.

The hotel is located in Shibuya and is within walking distance to Shibuya Station as well as great shopping, sightseeing, and dining. For anyone needing a Starbucks fix like myself, there is one located a short walk from the hotel at Shibuya Crossing. The rooms were very clean and spacious. I liked that there was a foyer area to remove shoes and hang up coats, umbrellas, etc. before entering the ""living"" space. We also had amazing views of the city from our couch as well as from the large bathroom window. Service was quite good albeit somewhat sterile.The hotel has some restaurants located within: Italian, Japanese, Steak/Seafood, a lounge, a jazz bar, and a cafe where they serve a terrific breakfast buffet for a hefty price. There is also a 7-11 connected to the hotel that is convenient for water, milk tea, and other snacks. They have an indoor pool, but you must pay an additional fee to use it. We decided there were too many other things to do than sit at an indoor pool for a fee, so can't really comment on that.The only negative I would have to say about the hotel is that the moment you enter, you are met with the noxious smell of smoke. This was pretty typical throughout Japan, as smoking is a habit many have picked up, but it would have been nice to not have to smell it when returning to rest from a long day. This was one of the reasons we never really spent time in any of the restaurants other than in the mornings for the breakfast buffet. There are non-smoking floors and rooms, so at least one can escape the toxic fumes upon returning to the room.Overall, this was a great choice for a stay in Tokyo. It's a clean, comfortable, and modern hotel. Also, the location made it easy to get around and explore Tokyo.","Phoenix, AZ",113,4.0

Shibuya station is also on the Yamanote line (which goes around Tokyo like a big ring); the Yamanote is the one train line that is the best friend of all those who go to Tokyo for the first time.2) Also, the Cerulean is literally 3 and a half minutes away from Shibuya Square... if you are going to Japan, this is where you want to be. The place is so characteristically Japanese you will have a blast. You are also a short walk (or 1 station) away from Yoyogi Park (where you can visit the Meiji Jungo Mae shrine), and shopping districts like Omotesando and Harajuku. Shinjuku and Meguro are also close by on the Yamanote, and Kamakura (with its wonderful temples) is no more than a 1 hour train ride away (making it a perfect day trip).3) The Cerulean has crazy breathtaking view. Dont get to close to the windows if you have vertigo! I normally go either to the Cerulean or to the Shibuya Excel, with the Excel being closer to the metro, but the Cerulean having better rooms/service/vibe. Both are good choices, and both are in the Expedia VIP program (which is always a +).Other than that, great staff and great stay. Couple of suggestions:1) If you are leaving with a plane, always reserve a bus ride to the airport. The concierge can help you.2) The breakfast buffet is kind of ""bla"" - but their patisserie bar (right before the entrance to the buffet area) is excellent! You have to try one of their sweets.

It has several good restaurants and bars in the hotel building itself, as well as a 24-hour convenience store (more of this please). The wi-fi is good and strong. The beds are hard as rocks (not my personal preference, but when you look at the elegant and poised Japanese compared with the slouching Westerners on the streets you can't help wondering who's got it right).But I was not overly enamored of the service. The staff were acceptably polite, and the doormen who oversee the alighting and departing were terrifically helpful, especially with my limited Japanese.

The hotel is amazing and beautiful. A short walk from Shibuya station and crossing this hotel is in a prime location to go anywhere in Tokyo. The rooms are very nice, clean and generous sized.If you stay check out the bar on the very top floor. It's got amazing views of Tokyo at night.That being said there are some major drawbacks. There is extra charge for everything. Internet? Extra. Pool? Extra and so on. Although the staff are friendly the English level for this, a five star hotel, is not up to par. If you have questions, concerns, problems, etc you will be met with confused looks and having to repeat yourself many times. When asking about shipping some luggage to our Kyoto hotel it took quite awhile for the front desk staff to understand. When we asked the concierge about where to obtain stamp books for temples we were met with more confused looks. The Italian restaurant had a small English menu that clearly did not have everything listed on it. Likewise the restaurant had huge display of wine but there were only a few listed on the English menu. The staff did not really speak English and could not even tell us how something was prepared. This being the hotel's restaurant the staff should be trained in basic restaurant English communication. For example: When a family member wanted a vodka drink that wasn't listed on the menu the waitress didn't understand ""vodka"", I ended up looking it up in my phone's dictionary and showing it to her. It's pronounced wadoka, by the way,One of the person's traveling with us was in a wheel chair and had trouble going over the bath tub wall to take a shower. Upon our return from Kyoto we requested a room with a separate shower and bath. This was ignored and not understood so when we came back she still had the same issues. The one handicapped friendly room only had twin beds even though the upgraded rooms have separate shower and bath she was only offered this after a fuss was made. She ended up taking it but as she was there with her husband it wasn't very romantic.The menus in the hotel's main restaurant, on the first floor, had silly spelling mistakes or weren't translated correctly instead just had the Japanese words in roman letters. Likewise, the information book in the rooms also had silly spelling mistakes. It is my view that a five star hotel, or one trying to be, shouldn't be making these silly mistakes. This is a hotel that advertises in English trying to attract foreign guests. If they cannot answer anything but ""what time is check out"" and ""your room number is 2103"" it isn't worth the money.In the end this hotel is centrally located, clean, beautiful and has great views of Tokyo and Fuji, The management needs to get all of their menus, not just a few items, translated and encourage their staff to gain a higher level of English. Because of the communication issues I do not recommend this hotel to English speakers (or non Japanese speakers) who haven't been to Tokyo before and are planning to spend a lot of time in the hotel. Also I wouldn't recommend spending the money to eat in this hotel Shibuya is an international area most places will either speak a bit of English and/or have an English menu. You can get the same good quality food elsewhere.","Nakano, Japan",128,3.0

After spending a week in Tokyo I think this location was perfect. It was only a very short walk down the road and over a pedestrian overpass and you were right in the middle of Shibuya station - great for subways to all sorts of places, and the Yamanote Line train that loops the city. Also to see the crazy-busy Shibuya crossing (which is actually pretty easy to navigate!). Lots of department stores and places to eat.Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was pretty expensive at 3000 yen for buffet - so if they have an option that includes the breakfast go for that. It was excellent though - with a chef on hand making fresh omelettes to order and a good selection of cooked and fresh foods. Espresso coffee included in the price. We ended up eating there most mornings as it was a great way to start the day - I just mentally added the cost to the room price.The queen room we stayed in the ""lower"" level (still floors 20-24, where the hotel starts) was a decent size with a good bathroom, great views, and a very firm but very comfortable bed.

She asked how adventurous we were with exploring and looking for street signs (very difficult when they aren't written in English and you have to match up characters!), and we were happily able to find each one after a 30-45 minute adventure. Finally, I fell ill one evening and my husband called the hotel manager to help us find a nearby hospital with a doctor who spoke English.

Free Wifi was convenient and there was no limit to the number of devices we could 'hook up' which was appreciated and meant that Skype phone calls were easily done, as well as using laptops etc. The room itself was modern (enough), pleasant looking and super clean (though I wouldn't expect anything else in Japan) - we were lucky enough to get a corner room which made the space a lot bigger so I would recommend others try and obtain this same position. Service was most accommodating and friendly - without any trouble we got a late checkout which was a real bonus as we had a late flight out of Tokyo.

It's clean, beds comfy, shower is skin peeling. The location is great; near public transportation and with many good neighbor restaurants nearby. If you are on business, it is a fine place to stay but it's expensive. For an upper class hotel there are some things that are annoying, and these have been said before by travelers. Maybe some day Management will iste. At these rates it is discomforting that the management choses to charge a la carte for everything (internet, no complimentary tea service in room as is custom in Asia, pool). The management must be studying the practices of the US airline industry but apparently are not aware of the ire of their customers. Good grief, a tea bag costs, what ten cents? Why fleece the customer so much? There is great hoopla over energy saving and on check in the guest is asked to declare which items they do not need replaced during their stay. No matter what you check, you will consistently get clean towels and robes every day. Why bother pretending to be green? Service is very impersonal. Yes, lots of bowing. But the Concierge desk could not provide accurate directions. I would stay here again if there was no other option but I'd prefer to go someplace where I do not feel so taken advantage of. Other than that, it's a good place. Hint: if this is your first trip to Tokyo you may want to take the Airport Limo Bus from Narita rather than the Narita Express. The Airport Bus will take you door to door. The subway station can be a bit intimidating when you first experience it. Also, eat in the local restaurants.

We were able to find our way there based on comments from other TA reviewers. It is close to eveything that Shibuya has to offer and is only 5 mins walk to the train station over a pedestrian overpass. Our room was on the 32nd floor with great views over the city and the heart of Shibuya. It was spacious, quiet and smartly decorated. The bathroom was huge with a separate bath/shower compartment. It was perfect for relaxing and sleeping after a day out sightseeing in the stifling heat. We would have liked better teamaking facilities in our room; small handleless cups, japanese tea and a kettle that never quite got the water hot enough.The buffet breakfast was better value than the set breakfast but we felt it was expensive and quite ordinary compared to other places we stayed at in Japan with a poor selection of Japanese goodies. This may be a reflection of the clientele in that they are trying to cover all bases with breakfast preferences. We went up to Level 40 for drinks one night and I had what must be the worlds smallest strawberry daiquiri. We were also charged Y800 each to sit by the window. Great views and ambience but it comes at a price! Service was efficient and we were upgraded to a club room on a higher level on the other side of the building when we returned for two more nights at the end of our stay in Japan; a nice touch. Th foyer and lobby lounge however was cavernous and rather soul less in contrast to all the other spaces in this hotel. Overall we enjoyed our stay here and would return.","Brisbane, Australia",185,4.0

I needed a hotel where the rooms were comfortable to work in for half a day each day, but with business support and convenient to the Ginza line of the subway. This was a superb answer. I had a King room on level 32. Colleagues in corner rooms were in slightly larger spaces. It is worth seeing if you can get a room facing Mount Fuji, although variable weather and poor visibility makes sightings rare.The room was very comfortable and well set up for a business traveller (and large enough to avoid cabin fever). Rooms in the nearby Excel hotel are totally unsuited to work in. The guest services staff were excellent. Shibuya station is very close. The hotel itself is well located in Shibuya. The ground floor restaurant and bar were handy for meetings and the food was fine (although lovers of good italian espresso will be disappointed, but will at least survive!).The curiously named ""Airport Limosine"" Bus service offers comfortable, reasonably priced transfers from hotel door to Narita.While there I had a reasonable meal in Kanetanaka-so, the inhouse Japanese restaurant. Sashimi was delightful and well presented. A bamboo rice cleverly evoked simple rural fare. Unfortunately the tempura batter was falling apart and oily. A meal at the Coucagno on the 40th floor was superb (I am unsure whether it still retains its Michelin hat, but would not be surprised if it does).Perhaps the most extraordinary act of service I have ever seen in a hotel occurred at check out. Rushing, I dropped my house keys on the floor as I left my room. I was just boarding the airport bus a few minutes later when front of house ran up to me and returned them. For housekeeping to be in the room, see them and for me to be located and identified in the space of 5 minutes was simply remarkable. It was consistent with the whole tone of the establishment.","Sydney, Australia",81,5.0

It is conveniently located in Shibuya, next to Shibuya Station, so you can take the Narita Express all the way into Shibuya Station and then walk to the hotel if you wish. If not, it is less than 5min by taxi.The hotel itself is comfortable and well maintained. We opted for one of the up-graded rooms with a king bed, which had a lovely view over tokyo. The bathroom was large and well-appointed, with a large shower and bath.The reason why I gave this hotel a 3* and not a 4* was because of the lack of certain amenities you would expect in a hotel of its class as well as the inability of the staff to give accurate directions. This is in comparison to other hotels we have stayed at in Tokyo.There is no complimentary WI-FI for hotel guests, even in the lobby / reception areas. This is also the first hotel I have ever stayed in that does not provide complimentary tea/coffee in the rooms. It is available, but please do be aware that a teabag is charged at about 400 yen / US$ 5. I thought that was rather bold of them considering the room rates they charge. Also, although the hotel has a pool and gym facilities, it is not complimentary for all hotel guests - only those on the executive floors, otherwise, there is a fee.The biggest let down for us was the inability for the staff to provide accurate directions to restaurants etc. The address system in Tokyo is notoriously difficult so we can understand small inaccuracies. However, they were not able to accurately direct us to the New South Entrance of the Shibuya Station, which is about 150m from the hotel. This entrance provides direct access to the platform for the Narita Express train. They conveniently omited to tell us that this entrance exist, instead tried to send us on a round-about route through the main station, even though it is clearly marked out on the map of the station they provided us. When asked about this entrance, they recommended that we take a 5 min US$10 taxi ride to the station. Anyway, we did not have much luggage, so we took a chance and seached for the entrance ourselves. For those interested, you go up the staires on your right just as you pass under the train tracks straight up from the hotel, and it is 50m down the road there. It is incomprehensible that the hotel is not able to provide directions for such an easy route to a station that I am sure 80% of their hotel guests would use.Our main impression is that the Cerulean is mainly interested in business clientele and not the leisure traveller, which is a pity, as it's great location would suit both.","Singapore, Singapore",41,3.0

From the moment you enter the large reception area and are greeted by liveried Bell Boys and Girls who whisk your luggage away to your room and the reception staff who bow as you approach the desk, you realise you have entered the world of Japanese service which is unrivalled anywhere else in the world. The rooms are all modern with large bathrooms, each having both a bath and double shower cubicle, the bed linen is thick and ironed until it's as smooth as glass and the rooms are kept spotlessly clean.The food at breakfast is incredible with traditional English beakfast competing with Japanese specialities and also fresh croisant and other French pastries. For the healthier resident there is also an abundance of fresh fruit and freshly squeezed juices.The hotel has a large gym area with a good selection of machines to use as well as a good sized swimming pool, all on the 3rd floor. Shibuya, where the hotel is sited, is a bustling area with lot's of shops and bars playing cool jazz whilst serving steaming bowls of Udon noodles, it's a young hip area and a great place to start your holiday in Japan.

We have chosen the Mount Fuji view which was just magnificient to see. We woke up every morning and find Mount Fuji straight in front of us from our bed, and that was such a beautiful experience.

Originally my travel companion and I had opted for the Capitol Hotel in Tokyo as it seemed to mix the wonders of cultural diversity with a savvy price. Modern traditional Japanese rooms in the photos so why not? The more I did research on the location, the more I was opt for changing. Ok so Roppongi was next on the list of spots to scope out for a hotel, but thankfully having a friend who is Japanese suggested Shibuya. Shibuya? He sent me links to the hotel, read majority of the TA reviews on it, found a great deal on a booking site for the hotel, became more convinced Cerulean was the hotel to choose. My Japanese buddy was most influential in the decision as he stays there quite often when back in Tokyo so what do friends do best? Steer other friends in the right direction.....Cerulean it was.  I flew out Thanksgiving day to meet up with my bf who was flying back from a dive trip in Palau so we only had 3 days total in Tokyo. I haven't been to Tokyo city, just other prefectures north and south years ago. Cerulean is perched high enough to spot when you exit the WEST exit of Shibuya station. As soon as you exit, cross the street where the buses are lined up, or walk across the pedestrian bridge (with elevators) conveniently within a 5-minute walking distance. Narita Express platform 4 direct is the way to go. Taxi's need not apply, but be warned, it is up a small hill. The staff is extremely friendly, plenty of options for dining but keep in mind it is PRICEY at the hotel. I suggest snacks at 7-11 just outside the hotel, or of course cruising around Shibuya. Two 7-11's in and next to Cerulean with a ton of snacks so stock up! Rooms are very well kept, amenities are great, just outside the hustle and bustle of the busiest intersections. I'd suggest finding a balance of a nice hotel and cheaper food through the streets of Shibuya. Meiji Shrine is about a 15 minute walk on the way to Harajuku, Roppongi is a short taxi drive away, you can't go wrong with this hotel and I'm quite pleased my friend suggested it as I looked past it several times thinking it was too much to consider. However with the endless amount of options for food, entertainment, and distance, this is the hotel to review and consider.I did choose to put ""Average"" for my rating on value because of legitimate reasons, average price for a hotel like that. It's not cheap, it is a high end hotel so if you're like us who like to sleep well, have amenities, but don't mind 2* dining, then nothing wrong with the compromise. It's not cheap, BUT not putting you in an economic downfall either. I would put 5* if the rates were miraculously subdued compared to other high end hotels but let's be real here, for a hotel like Cerulean, the rates are reasonable and I say this to their benefit. Suggestion: Do your homework, find booking sites, compare rates, and then make a decision. As all booking sites say it's time sensitive (....""Only 3 left at this rate!"") It fluctuates usually within $20-$80 difference comparably on average all for Cerulean.","San Diego, California",78,5.0

The hotel has a very good location - very close to the centre of Shibuya, with lots of interesting bars and restaurants close by. The Shibuya train station is less than 5 minutes walk away (and you can get there with luggage quite easily, by using the lifts to help you access the pedestrian walkway to the station). Shibuya is very well connected, being on the Yamanote line. Only one gripe - I wanted to use the gym, and thought it would be included given we were paying over US$300 a night for our room. But it wasn't - instead they asked me to pay another US$30 for each session! This policy obviously isn't working - the gym was empty at 1930 in the evening, normally a busy period! But anyway, it did me a favour, as I ended up having a lovely run through the back streets of Dakanyama, Ebisu and Meguro - much better than a boring treadmill. So overall we were pretty happy - with only the gym experience lowering the ranking from 5 to 4 stars. I think that on our next trip to Tokyo we will return to the Century Southern Tower, which seemed slightly more comfortable and a bit swisher. But the Cerulean is definitely a good option if you want to be in Shibuya.","Mexico City, Mexico",85,4.0

Rooms are certainly spacious by Japanese standards, as well as comfortable, with a modern design style (nothing extravagant however). Room service both good and efficient.

My son, who teaches martial arts, wanted to go to a dojo and they found him one and made the call telling the dojo that he was coming. They inform you of everything by slipping notes under your door. My son had forgotten he had made the request for the dojo, but the staff didn't forget.The view from the 21st floor was wonderful. The breakfast buffet is terrific, but not cheap (but when one eats at a hotel nothing is cheap). I parttook of two full body and two ""just-feet"" massages, which are done in your room at any time up until 2am. I also had room service, which runs all night. Even the ""American"" food was good.We had our ""fancy"" dinner at the restaurant on the 40th floor. We could only do one fancy dinner as it's impossible to get my son into a jacket and tie. The dinner was excellent. The service was marvelous.

My room is pretty big for what I expected in Tokyo, and I have a high floor so the view is great. I ordered room service several times, and it was pretty good.The concierge was very helpful and polite. Couple tips: -I ordered a car service to pick me up, which was extremely expensive. There is a bus associated with the hotel that runs from the airport to the hotel which i would recommend.-If you get jet lag like me, there's a lovely park up the hill about a mile. Running though a deserted Shibuya is pretty fun.-If you want to visit the tuna auction at the famous fish market, you can have the concierge organize it for you on your first, jet-lagged morning. -The beds are japanese style, which means they are a bit harder than westerners are used to, but still a good night's sleep.I probably wouldn't stay here again, only because I feel like there are so many amazing experiences to be had in Tokyo, and would like to explore other neighborhoods, but I would recommend it as a 'first timer' hotel for Tokyo.","Brooklyn, New York",28,4.0

They are firm however even the missus had excellent sleeps on the firm mattress.Room service is over priced, so may I suggest you take an elevator ride and walk 50 meters if you feel peckish. It's a nice stroll and ya never know what you will see. Huge amount of shops and restaurants close at hand so if you don't feel like paying 50 bucks for a club sandwich go for a quick walk to the 7/11 directly underneath or across the road and grab something for 10 bucks instead. Also many noodle shops and yaki-tori close by so no need to eat in the restaurants every night at the seriously over inflated prices. MUST go to Bellovisto Bar on the 40th floor of the Cerulean Tower. The view is intoxicating and so were the single malts !The hotel is a bit impersonal but not surprising. Staff service, as everyone else on here says, is good but that is Japan service so sort of expect nothing less. Manners go a loooong way in Japan so pack plenty of them and you might find that the hospitality goes to another level when they see you at least trying to say thank you and please in their language. BE a loud and expectant American type tourist and you will find a subtle change in the way you are treated, mind you if you are that way you probably wouldn't notice.... ( saw it happen a couple of times in different places ) Booking on their website was the better deal for me as if you are staying three nights you get the same prices as all the agoda.com and booking.com websites offer + you get FREE internet and FREE use of gym/pool.Best way to get from NARITA AIRPORT to CERULEAN TOWER Hotel is LIMOUSINE BUS. It takes about 80 minutes and goes directly from airport to hotel. Has toilet on the bus. Cost YEN 3,000 per person. This way you don't need to haul your suitcases through a busy train station.If you are heading on Shinkansen to Nagoya/Kyoto/Osaka/Hiroshima and have large suitcases and bags, easiest way is to grab a TAXI to Shinagawa Station ( West entrance ) and every time we used it, it ranged from YEN 2,340 - 2,580 .","Auckland Central, New Zealand",3,4.0

Our room was huge and had great views in both the main room and the bathroom which was super cool.Because we had been upgraded to the Executive floor we looked it up in the hotel guide and saw that it included breakfast and free internet. Yet much to our surprise the next morning when we showed up for breakfast we were told it wasn't included with our room and had to pay the full price.

When we questioned the employee who was checking us out she said something along the lines of because we were upgraded, and didn't pay for the Executive floor, we didn't get any of the perks, such as the breakfast and internet, that came with it (except for the room itself). Because her expiation was in broken English we ended up paying it and not arguing it.Overall the hotel is very nice and the staff were helpful but didn't speak a high enough level of English as one would expect of a five star hotel.

The Cerulean Tower is literally across the street from Shibuya Station, which links you up to all parts of the city. The NEX (Narita Express train) stops at this station making it super easy to get to and from the airport. With hot weather and lugging all my baggage, having the hotel a 2 min walk from the station was a life saver. I recommend this hotel because Shibuya is the perfect neighborhood for tourists to stay in. There is nightlife, fun restaurants, the quintessential ""pedestrian crossing"" that is awe inspiring to look at and best of all, the Cerulean Tower is the nicest hotel in the area with amazing views of all the districts on Tokyo. I would describe this hotel as the ""lost in translation movie experience"" without the gigantic price tag and pretentiousness as the park hyatt in Shinjuku.This hotel made my trip one of the best trips of my life. Amazing views, huge bathrooms, the best showers around and an awesome staff. Oh yea, the breakfast buffet is amazing too!! You won't be disappointed. Thanks Cerulean Tower!

You couldn't get to all of them even if you were staying there for a year* Great supermarket just across the street at Shibuya station (""Food court"") - open until 9 pm* Very clean room, enough towels, nice bathrobe and night gown. What could have been better:* The 'upgrade' package also included free alcoholic drinks from 5 - 7:30 pm. If you are a business traveler you are not likely to have any benefit from that. Outside of those hours it's just a small selection of soft-drinks and coffee and tea. Also the 'snacks' offered during 5-7:30h don't vary, I found it to be the same every time I went there and I personally would have preferred something more local* I like the environmental consciousness, in my opinion the replacement of bedsheets every 2nd day is not necessary * The lobby bar is only open until 10 pm and the restaurant downstairs which opens until midnight is not really a place to feel 'cozy', especially if you are going for a drink and snack by yourself","Vienna, Austria",29,4.0

Didnt use the expensive breakfast option or any of the restaurants although the bakery is quite nice next to reception. The conceirge was very helpful.

Also the station is 5 mins walk and you can get anywhere in tokyo from there on the JR trains or the metro.If you are travelling with large luggage to or from airport, easiest option is the airport bus which stops at the hotel or you can drag the luggage on narita express train from shibuya which is actually not as bad as it sounds which is what we did due to time we were travelling. Price is about the same.Rooms were large with large bathroom with walk in shower. All the normal amenities were there of a business hotel. TV had english channels.

The view from the window was wonderful (CTTH is one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo) both at night and at day. The restaurants in the hotel were delicious - the breakfast buffet in particular was one of the best I've seen to date. The spa/pool/gym area was great too, including the massage chairs that one could use for free once a day pass had been purchased (but they let us try them out before deciding).There were loads of facilities inside the hotel that we didn't use, but I'm sure are used often by businesses (beautiful meeting rooms, as well as an in-house Kabuki theater!).

It is a little on the expensive side, with a Tower's Room being about AU$550 per night but this allowed access to the Club Room for breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails at dusk. The views from the rooms are spectacular and your really get a sense of the enormity of Tokyo. The Cerulean also provide free shuttle service to and from Narita Airport, which is more convenient than dragging your luggage on the trains.The rooms are clean and comfortable but had we stayed for longer than 2 nights, I would have liked a little more space. Internet access was free with the room. The downside for me was the bathroom. It's a little small in size with nowhere to place your toiletries, which we ended up having to place on the floor.We didn't try any of the restaurants in the hotel, to be honest there is so much on offer close by that we got out and explored each night. We did use the Bar on the top level both nights which has spectacular views to Shinjuku and a base rate of AU$19.50 for a glass of Australian wine which I find a little on the ridiculous side, but I'm sure comparable with other Hotel bars of this quality.During our previous stay we had used the pool and spa facilities which were splendid but there was an additional charge for their use which I chose not to pay this time around.The best thing about this accommodation is it's location - a 3 minute walk across the overpass and right into Shibuya Station. Shibuya is a fantastic area for shopping and restaurants and people watching. Be sure to cross the street at the main square during peak hour.I'm sure there are more affordable places in the area than the Cerulean Tower - even if you were to get a standard room, you might expect to pay around AU$400 per night but there are alot of things on the plus side of this Hotel and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Shibuya.","Metropolitan Sydney, Australia",3,4.0

The never changing sameness of the hotel menu gets difficult after repeated visits, but as the hotel is so close to Shibuya, and the Tokyu food hall, Dean & DeLuca, etc, etc you can get away and eat very well on a sensible budget.","Chiswick, United Kingdom",13,5.0

By far, the cerulean was THE BEST. We stayed at the Cerulean for a total of 5 nights. I think I can say it 's probably the best hotel I've stayed at generally speaking. Actually...the bed could be softer, but after experiencing all other hotels in japan...I think the hard mattress is the norm for Japan.The hotel is located very close to the Shibuya station (5minute walk), and walking distance to plenty of shopping (ie Uniqlo, starbucks, Koen Dori, shibuya 109, etc). It's also walkable to Harajuku and Yoyogi park. However, if you want to take the subway to Harajuku, it's only 1 stop away for 130yen (approximately ~$1.50-2 depending on currency rate.) Luckily I downloaded the Metro App onto my iphone (no internet connection necessary) which helped me navigate through all the stations/trains in tokyo. It saved us a lot of time and I highly recommend it.  We're really pleased that our Tour Agency (Super Value Tours) recommended that we stay here. The hotel is ultra modern and clean. Our room was on the 23rd floor facing Mt. Fuji. Unfortunately, it was hazy everyday so we couldn't view the mountain, but for short moment (10min) the haze dissipated so we were able to see the outline of mountain. I heard that it's really rare to see mount fuji, so perhaps seeing the outline was as good as it got for us.My husband and I had to try the Japanese breakfast and it was really delicious...but it wasn't enough to fill our tummies for a full morning's adventure. Maybe it's because we're accustomed to the american culture where you stuff your face when eating. The next 4 days we stuck with the american breakfast buffet. Considering it's a buffet, I never felt disgustingly full. Even the bacon was light, airy, thin and surprisingly ungreasy! go figure! I looked forward to breakfast everyone morning at the Cerulean. Since our breakfast was included in our hotel stay...it might be on the pricier side for those who have to pay extra out of pocket. I recommend this hotel to anyone who visits Tokyo. If I come back...this is the place I want to be. Excellent!","San Francisco, California",4,5.0

This was our ""home base"" for four nights. It's hard to pick ""a spot"" to stay in Tokyo. There are may fun neighborhoods. But Shibuya is really central, there is lots to see and do around the hotel, and the hotel was very nice.The staff was friendly, helpful and spoke great english. Anything questions or needs, they fell all over themselves to help us. The hotel is a five minute walk to the ever-famous and ever busy Shibuya subway station. The rooms are large by Japanese standards, and by western standards typical of what you'd find in a Ritz or nice Hyatt.There is an Am/PM convenience store actually in the buliding which we used to get snacks and sandwiches. My only knock on this hotel, is the following. The lobby is a little sterile, which you would find in Manhattan too. But it lacks that Japanese cultural feel. You could have been in any big city in the world. And also the food is mega expensive, again like what you'd find in a NYC hotel. We had two cups of coffee in the coffe shop and it was $20. (that includes what you'd tip in the US, since you don't tip in Japan). So we grabbed stuff in the AM/PM mart and snacked in our room, which was actually fun. (bring cash though, c-stores in Japan generally don't take plastic).Gym (which is pretty small...three tread mills, a couple stationary bikes and weights) is free to 18+ if you use between 7:00 and 8:30 I think. Forget exact hours, but if you want to workout, it's free in the morning. You do have to pay $20 PP to use the facility the rest of the day. My daughter and I did pay the fee once while the rest of the crew recovered from jet lag, and we did have fun. They have massage chairs in the spa (in the locker rooms). The pool is heated and very nice, and we enjoyed the hot spa too. But having to pay, and excluding kids (common in Japan) was a bit of a drag.Like hotel a lot, and have no regrets about staying there.

You will not regret staying in this hotel and the Shibuya area in general, which we thought was much classier than Shinjuku, which was the area we intially toyed staying in. You can easily explore Tokyo from the numerous subway lines running from Shibuya direct, without the need to change lines. We stayed here for 3 nights on our return leg from Kyoto and Hakone (after starting off our Tokyo trip at the Asakusa View Hotel - I've reviewed this too) and our room (booked through expedia for about GBP £200 a night) was excellent with great views of the Tokyo skyline (as the rooms start on the 19th floor I'm sure they all have good views). The hotel is easy to get to from Shibuya station - take time making your way up through the station as you can avoid most of the stairs if you look out for elevator and escalator signs and if you make your way to the attached Mark City shopping mall exit. From outside the station it's about a 7-10min walk with luggage, part of which is uphill as you approach the footbridge to the hotel which can leave you looking a little undignified (we still managed it ok with 2 heavy suitcases). The footbridge has an elevator to the hotel level. Without luggage, it will just take you a couple of minutes to get to the heart of Shibuya and the Haichiko crossing, which is also a great area to have your morning coffee/breakfast - like most foreign tourists we would start the day in the Starbucks overlooking the crossing because of the great location. Yes it's disappointing breakfast is not included, which is about GBP £30 a head (had it just the once given the cost) and that there is no free LAN or wi-fi access (about GBP £10 charge), which is outrageous for a business orientated hotel, and that the swimming pool fee was about GBP £18. We did manage a drink in the tower bar which was expensive but worth it for the classy ambience and views (don't bother ordering the mixed nuts/crisps to go with your drinks - costs about GBP £10 for a couple of spoonfulls). The cost of a formal dinner in the hotel was too horrific to contemplate but Shibuya has hundreds if not thousands of informal eateries for the after work office crowd so food is not a problem in the area. As others have commented, there are also plenty of convenience stores offering Japanese snacks/take-out nearby where the Japanese also happily buy and eat from.","London, United Kingdom",11,4.0

As far as location goes, given the many prefectures, it really depends on whether or not you were aiming on touring the prefecture highlights and of the neighbouring prefectures too. However, it is Tokyo and it does indeed have great public transport so getting around is easy. Absolutely wonderful view, especially during the night.Again, the type of hotel that probably is ready to help you with any possible concern that may come up.

They've got a solid staff, who truly want to help each guest to have the best possible stay in Tokyo. The rooms are appointed with amazing woods, fabrics, tiles and marble.

The Corner King had a bathtub right by the view, so naturally I had to draw a bath to admire the Tokyo skyline. The rooms were also large, contrary to what people had warned me about Asian hotel room sizes. Loved the complimentary items they provided for use. I also loved that they had Animal Planet and Discovery Channel in English, especially because I was a bit homesick.Being right across from the Shibuya Station, the hotel location was superb. Shopping malls/stores/awesome restaurants were all walking distance. What I loved the most was the 7-11 right at the second level. It made it very convenient for emergency water/beer/coffee runs. To the person who complained about coffee in the restaurant. The coffee was actually espresso and not regular drip. If you wanted regular coffee, Starbucks and Tully's were right across the street. 7-11 also had machine made coffees.

Our view was beautiful, although the did put us on the side facing away from Shibuya Crossing. The room was great - super comfortable and perfectly clean. The linens were very fresh. The bath was also excellent. The bath/shower portion itself, was more or less in the Japanese unit-style, where there was a tub and one could shower outside the tub in a larger open space. I recall it was all granite. We had a little noise from the people above one night. The hotel is nicely located with all the chaos and lights of Shibuya Crossing about a 5-minute walk away.Due to the floor we stayed on, we could make use of the club room breakfast, which was quite extensive and good. It included both Japanese and Western style (American and European) dishes. There was also an espresso machine which made coffee which was good enough (not great). Tea and cocktails were also available (free) in this lounge. The view from the lounge was great too, a bit different from the one in our room, but equally nice.Now, the downside. First, avoid the ""jazz"" club. That comment is based on only one night, so it's possible other nights might have been better. The real negative is the food, and the price of the food. We were there for quite a few nights. We were also jet-lagged. So, over the course of the stay, we sampled a couple of the restaurant options, and the room service. They were uniformly disappointing, and unbelievably overpriced. We also noted that Western guests were not treated as well as the Japanese. One does not have to be sensitive to pick up on this - it's quite blatant. Unless you're really desperate, I would walk to somewhere in Shibuya. The bar on the top floor has a great view, but again the price to quality ratio is terrible. Note that the top floor bar gets a bit crowded, as anyone (not necessarily staying at the hotel) can go, whereas the club lounge is not open to the general public.","San Diego, CA",44,3.0

We arrived at Haneda Airport at 6am on Christmas Eve. Arrived at hotel by taxi, we had to go inside to ask for help with luggage. Funny reaction from the staff at bell desk, they asked, ""CHECK IN ?"" I had to explain yes, check in, later in the afternoon today. It was funny that we had about 10 suitcases, 2 families with 4 young children, and arrived at the front door, and they seemed reluctant to let us inside. We left our luggage at the storage, and as minimum of a chance of getting early check in requested granted, I still asked. I understand some Japanese, so when I asked, the man at the front desk asked the supervisor next to him about letting us early check in since we had so many children, and tired from a sleepless night on a red eye flight, and it was 6 degrees outside, with no stores or restaurants opened..... but the supervisor said very coldly to him ""don't give them early check in. Get them out of here until 2pm"". Then the man translated all that in English to me. Of course, I understand it would be a favor if they did, but standard procedure if not.Anyways, we went out, hung out with the kids at different eateries like Soba places, convenience stores, and Excelsior Coffee, until 10am, stores opened, we walked around, had lunch, and finally made it back to check in at 2pm. Rooms were ready, and we settled down and took a nap for the afternoon.Room was good size, good amenities, I really liked the bathroom, very big in size, and the shower and bath were in one big shower box so it was so much easier to shower the kids because the shower just sprays onto the floor. Floor isn't slippery, lots of counter space, and design of the whole room was very efficient.We had a king size bed, and internet is 1000yen for 24 hours, but cut off is 12 noon. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel. Very convenient location, there is a convenient store right outside the entrance of the hotel, and JR and Metro was about 5-7 minutes walk. Concierge was great.

I rate this as one of the best hotels in Shibuya (and I have stayed in most of them). The staff are extremely helpful. Our flight was cancelled and we had to book another flight and stay at the hotel another night. I was very satisfied with their help in arranging this. Bad points would include the expensive restaurants in the lobby and a severe lack of seating in the lobby. For a massive hotel like this, when you need to wait for the airport limo bus etc., there are only around eight chairs and many people were standing around.

She was very helpful with all our questions while staying there.However, it is one of those hotels where you could be in any city in the world! Typical rather than special. Probably more suited to business travellers. Breakfast buffet was good but like all hotels - not cheap. Boys could not use the pool - have to be over 18.

This is by far the most well rounded of the lot. First off, the location is difficult to beat. You are located about 2 blocks from the famous Shibuya Crossing and station. The view is better than the Park Hyatt Shinjuku and the Royal Park Yokohama. Plus, both of those are more expensive. I stayed here over New Years, and we had views that ranged from the Tokyo Tower to downtown Shinjuku. It was amazing. The price actually wasn't that bad relative to other luxury hotels i've visited in Japan. My bill for three nights was under $800 US Dollars. The Park Hyatt Shinjuku (Lost in Translation hotel) cost me better than $600 for one night. I'd argue that I had more room than both of those hotels as well. The rooms were large for Japanese standards.The service was excellent. I speak very bad Japanese so everybody spoke English to me. They even sent one of the Western bellhops up to the room to drop off our luggage. He then explained the sights we were seeing from our massive windows. I was extremely pleased with everything from price to location. If I decide to stay in downtown Tokyo again, this is where i'll stay.","Austin, Texas",7,5.0

For our earlier 6 night stay in Tokyo, we picked a different, more budget-friendly hotel in Shinjuku, but wanted to ""splash out"" a bit for our last couple of nights. The Cerulean Tower really delivered in that regard. From the moment we checked in, we truly felt like honored guests. We were greeted warmly and offered a half-price upgrade to the Executive Level (rooms on floors 33-36), which also includes free Internet, free breakfast in the executive lounge, and some other nice perks. Since we got a great rate booking online, we jumped at the upgrade and thought it well worth the additional price. Our deluxe single room faced Shinjuku, with the famous Shibuya crossing at our feet. The style was modern Japanese minimalist, but nicely done and we didn't think it was tired, as a few others have said. The bath was quite nice as well; spacious and with good quality bath/shower fittings, etc. The room had a desk area (with Internet cable) as well as a sitting area (two chairs and a table) near the large windows. The beds were the most comfortable we experienced during our stay in Japan.The executive lounge was on floor 35 with excellent views. We even saw Mt. Fuji at breakfast the day we left. Breakfast was good and sufficient to start the day. Given hotel breakfast prices, that amenity alone probably made the upgrade worthwhile.While we didn't have a lot of extra requests, those things that we did need help with were quickly and expertly addressed. Arrangements for the limo bus were a snap and got good help with restaurants for our last dinner in Tokyo. We did not dine in the hotel other than our breakfast.All in all, I'd recommend this hotel very highly, particularly with some of the reasonable prices to be found now on the internet.","Atlanta, Georgia",12,5.0

We selected the hotel primarily for its location in Shibuya, as well as offering big/luxury hotel amenities (concierge, business center, english-speaking staff, etc.) at a far more reasonable price than the well-known luxury chains. First, the location worked out perfectly. The stores, restaurants and bars of Shibuya surround the hotel, Harajuku and Shinjuku are a nice walk or short ride away and the Shinjuku station is just a couple blocks from the hotel. As a bonus, the airport bus/limo goes straight to the hotel and, as the tallest building around, it's always easy tto navigate your way home.Based on some reviews, I was expecting the hotel/rooms to feel a little outdated. That was not the case at all. The lobby/common areas and rooms all felt as if they'd been updated. This isn't a W or luxury boutique hotel, so the decor is relatively uniteresting, but it was certainly modern and not at all run down. The staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful, and we did not have many communication problems. The hotel facilities -- gym and restaurants -- were expensive, but not outrageous. We only ate the morning buffet in the hotel and, depending how hungry you were, that could be a bargain compared to some other meals in Tokyo. Regarding rooms, the corner rooms were nice, but not so spectacular that I'd necessarily pay extra for one. I would recommend a room facing towards Harajuku for a better view.I would definitely stay at the Cerulean if/when I return to Tokyo.",TorG,52,4.0

Between the tub with a view and the great toilet, it was difficult to leave! The location of the hotel was great as well with 2 foot bridges leading away from the hotel into the center of the city. The concierge helped us with everything from money exchange, purchasing sumo tickets and drawing a map for us to find a dumpling house in nearby Shinjuku.

Bed was great and the bathroom clean and spacious.On the negative side, in our whole trip to Japan this was the only hotel that did not provide free Internet access - rather mean as it was also by far the most expensive.

The room was awesome, on the 33rd floor with a 180 degree view over Tokyo. We stayed in a standard king city view room and found it perfect.

Complimentary toiletries included toothpaste & toothbrush, hairbrush, razor & shave cream, cotton wipes and hair ties, as well as Molton Brown shampoo, conditioner & body wash (which i looooved!) The room itself was large enough, with a fabulously comfortable king bed, separate chiase lounge, desk and large flatscreen TV. The hotel is perfectly situated, around a 5 minute walk from Shibuya station, and the famous intersection crossing. Be warned though, if arriving/departing via train at Shibuya Station, you will have a (albeit short) walk down a steep'ish hill to get there (or uphill if coming from the station to the hotel) Okay if you're just walking, bit tough with suitcases! There were several restaurants within the hotel, but we didnt try any of them as there are so many cheaper options in Shibuya (and all delicious!) There's a little noodle place just down from the hotel's entrance that you can order a hot bowl of noodles for around $5 (AUD) You choose the dish from the plastic models in the window, then order using a vending machine & then take your ticket to the chef and request ""soba"" or ""udon"" noodles - ingenious!

However, the upgraded room was more spacious and had a beautiful bathroom with fabulous views, from the bath as well, of Tokyo. The bed in this room was also much more comfortable than the firmer beds in the standard rooms. Such comfortable beds are very hard to come by in Japan!I would recommend paying a little extra for the superior rooms, even on the lower floors, as the views are still fabulous,the rooms are a more spacious, the beds are wonderful and the bathroom is really special.The location of the Hotel is perfect for tourists or frequent visitors such as ourselves who want to be in a very central area.Shibuya station has great transport links with the Ginza subway line and the Yamonote Circle line which covers all of central Tokyo.There is plenty of great shopping and lots of restaurants nearby. You can spend hours lost in the maze of shopping streets in Shibuya alone.The hotel can also give you details of a nearby coin laundry if you are staying for a longer period.We will definitely stay here on our next visit to Tokyo.","Osaki, Japan",15,5.0

They were also very clean and had great views overlooking Shibuya.Now the disappointments. I booked a room to house three people and booked via the internet - expedia. However, upon check in we realise the room accommodated two people and an extra bed cost an extra 5,000 yen/night. In no fault of the hotel, shops in Shibuya closes relatively early.

When you get to the higher-end hotels, the minute details are what make the difference, and there were no shortage of those here. Since everyone else has spoken in general terms about the hotel, here are a few of the details.I came back from my day and tossed the business cards from my briefcase on the desk. The next day, after I returned to my room, the business cards were sorted into piles, by company, and stacked in perfectly square piles next to each other. I left my pants crumbled up on the bed. They were perfectly folded when I returned. Rather than disturbing where my things were in the bathroom, they moved the hand towels to the other side of the counter top.Everyone wants perfection in a room but has to settle for second best. We all subconsciously accept defects in the room, like a handle that doesn’t work right, a scratch on the counter, or a dent in the fridge. But there wasn’t a single defect in the room that I could find, and the quality of construction was superb. The grout lines in the granite on the walls was so perfect, they were art. There were great details like the way the granite tile was rabbited where it came together, details that they didn’t have to do, but did. There were no scratches, dents, rips, smudges, in anything in the room. And the service was incredible. Others have described the quality of the staff. I’ll cite one example. My colleague and I were taking the 11:50 a.m. shuttle to the airport. We had been asked to be at the porter’s desk by 11:40 a.m. I was running late packing and hadn’t yet checked out. At 11:38 a.m., the phone rang: “Mr. <name>, are you still planning on taking the 11:50 p.m. train to the airport.” “Yes I am.” “Very well, you must hurry.” I got down to the checkout desk at 11:42 a.m. Two people were waiting for me with my bill already pulled. While I checked the bill, a porter came to me and apologized, but she needed to take my suitcase to the bus. She handed me a tag and whisked it away. Another person apologized, explained to me that they would call us in just a few minutes and motioned for me to sit in the lobby. In one minute a woman came through the lobby with a sign saying “11:50 p.m. Narita Bus”. I watched as simultaneously each bus passenger (ten or so people sprinkled about the lobby, intermixed with other people not waiting for the bus) was approached by a staff member and invited to follow the woman with the sign. The woman walked us to an escalator holding the sign and motioned us onto it. She then ran down the stairs next to the escalator (presumably out of respect), and directed us out to the bus. There was no way they could have made that experience better for me.I have many more examples about the quality, but you get the idea. Superb!","Atlanta, Georgia",4,5.0

I have also stayed at the Grand Hyatt (best hotel in Tokyo) and the Hilton Shinjuku (old outdated hotel) and the Intercontinental Yokohama (great hotel).

It was a big room with plenty of space. The bed was a wee bit too hard I thought. Surprisingly, the TV isn't a flat screen newer model.

Not too practical if you owned it, but fine with maid service to clean the room. Great but expensive buffet. Lots of good restaurants close by. But Shibuya is the gathering place for Tokyo youth, hordes of them. You will feel out of place if you are a Westerner and older. But they are polite. There are a couple of train lines across the street. Express bus service goes from Narita directly to the hotel every hour. You can take the express train to Shinjuku, a few stops away and then take a Japan Rail line to Shibuya. If you're not dragging a lot of big bags, that would be faster.

The Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel is located in Shibuya and after having stayed here for 4 nights I believe it is perfectly located for exploring Tokyo's neighbouring ""Wards"".All that has been previously written about this hotel I totally agree with. Firstly the hotel is easily accessed from Narita by the Airport Limousine Bus - its a door to door service and it took roughly 1 hour 20 minutes in each direction. The Cerulean is one of only 2 hotel drop off points for Shibuya. The Cerulean has an impressive entrance and grand foyer which is ultra minimalistic in its design. Huge windows look onto a formal Japanese garden - it all makes for a wonderful first impression. Check in is brisk and efficient. We also used the Concierge several times and the staff were all friendly and knowledgeable. Rooms are located from floors 19 to 37 and this is the selling point for this property - all have incredible panoramic views from large windows. All of Tokyo seems layed out before you. They are nicely fitted out in the less is more Japanese style and are quite spacious by Japanese standards. The bathrooms are also generously proportioned. Lastly - the hotel is within quick walking distance to Shibuya Railway Station and the famed Shibuya Crossing which has be seen to be believed.","Melbourne, Australia",87,4.0

You have the rail right there. Seriously I would never stay elsewhere...plus the service was impeccable. To this day, I have never stayed in a place that had that much attention to your comfort, We needed toothpaste and within 2 seconds there was a bellhop with toothpaste, an adapter, 2 minutes, a pen, anything and they were at our doorstep.So stay at the cerulean.

The location at Chibuya puts one within a short walk of an endless number of restaurants and all kinds of shopping. If one wants the high end stores then there were several department stores with all the high end possible.(Worth a visit just to see the quality of merchandise with men's shirts starting at $165 and ties at $100..and one of these great department stores even had a real theatre pipe organ where a young lady was giving a mid-morning performance). My son found a store (Ulo I think) nearby where he could not believe the deals and ended up buying so much I had to carry home a pile of t-shirts (at $19 each) and a linen sports jacket at $49. To visit Chibuya Square at 10pm and see literally hundreds lined up obediently waiting for the light to cross and then they come like a tidal wave of humanity...sit upstairs at Starbucks and marvel at the Times Square of Tokyo). And a tip with all the many restaurants, go to the top floor of the department stores..you will find a dozen restaurants and all reasonably priced with excellent food..in fact I have lived and travelled over much of the world over 35 years and have never eaten so well so reasonably.Now as for the hotel all I can say is outstanding. First the staff are so courteous and helpful..the concierge insisted in wallking me outside to show me the 711 which is in the hotel where there is an ATM and the chamber maid refused any tip..what a change from almost anywhere! As many other reviews point out the room is quite spacious, well and tastefully furnished, the internet at $10 a day worked perfectly on my laptop, but the bathroom is to write about...we loved the walk-in marble shower with glass separation so the bathroom does not get steamed up. Beds are very comfortable with European duvets and three types of pillows so I had my favourite down-filled. The fridge has room to add a few things of your own...(I was surprised that they did not provide an ice bucket or wine glasses, only regular drink glasses). The breakfast is excellent and well presented but like any top hotel at $30 for the buffet a little pricy especially when outside nearby the Starbucks or a myriad of other little coffee shops offer sufficient for less than $10...even $5. The hotel gave me a room facing away from the Square on the 27th floor but at my request moved me when my son arrived to a room on the 37th overlooking what I call Tokyo's Central Park with all the skyscrapers like the Hyatt in the distance..incredible view night or day and on top Mount Fuji as well became visible one weekend of my 2 week stay. The beauty of this hotel is that although next a major cross-city 6 lane roadway because the rooms are all on 20 or above floors with excellent sound-proofing there is absolutely no outside sound except an occasional helicopter. And finally it was well worth the price to have dinner in the bar on the 42nd floor..incredible view..(the French restaurant is one star Michelin but expect $100 a person minimum)...the only complaint about the bar is that the non-smoking is in a small area so we preferred to be in the smoking area with the incredible view and the ventilation system was so good despite the two men smoking cigars nearby we could not smell the cigars. With pre-dinner drinks, wine, a full three course meal for 4 persons and after dinner brandy plus the cover charge of $8 each the meal came to just under $300. On top of everything, I can only praise the excellent and very courteous helpful service at all times..wonderful.","London, United Kingdom",16,4.0

After making it through customs, traveling on the N'EX to Tokyo Station, then hopping on the JR Yamanote line to Shibuya (as a travel tip, purchase a Japan Rail Pass in advance of your departure), we were ready for a brief period of relaxation at our hotel. The Cerulean, from the minute we steped into the hotel, was just what we needed. The hotel has everything a weary traveler requires, including a spa, workout room, pool (for a fee), and several restaurants for a first evening after a long flight. It is also centrally located, approximately 3 minutes from Shibuya Station on foot. By JR rail or subway, a resident of the Cerulean is no more than 30 minutes from any major site in Tokyo. The rooms of the Cerulean are immaculate, and are certainly on par with many American 5-star hotels. They each come with a dramatic view, regardless of your floor. If you feel lucky, and are able to catch Tokyo on a relatively smog-free day, ask for a room facing south for a view of Mt. Fuji. During our stay in Tokyo, we were able to see other hotels, including the Park Hyatt (of Lost in Translation fame) and the Prince Park. While both hotels are nice, for the money do yourself a favor and book at the Cerulean. If you have any questions, or are interested in a Tokyo-centered activity once you reach the hotel, ask for the concierge, Yoko. She speaks excellent English, and goes out of her way to make your stay in Tokyo a little bit better. Here is another quick tip for Tokyo-goers interested in sushi. No matter what you read, or who you speak with, the Tsukiji fish market is the ONLY place a rationally-minded individual should go to for sushi. After eating at one of the oldest (and supposedly ""best"") sushi places in Tokyo, there is little difference in quality or selection (although an unbelievably huge difference in price). For the money, and to keep your child's college fund in tact, go to Diawa-zushi in Tsukiji.","Tyler, Texas",1,5.0

The first was a deluxe double, which was a corner room on the 31st floor with two double beds. It was marvelous. Immaculately clean, contemporary design, spacious (and not just for Japan!) and very well thought out in so many ways. Take for example the desk - it was situated at right angles to the corner window, alongside a small counter containing a lamp with a dimmer switch, numerous outlets, telephone jack and Ethernet port, pen and paper, and tissues. In the desk drawer was a LAN cable! As I set up my laptop, I realized that my power cord had a 3-prong plug and the outlet was only for a two-prong plug. A call to housekeeping brought the adaptor to my room in minutes. The climate control worked beautifully in the room, there were 3 of each towel for two people, and two different bathrobes for each of us. There were both a ""normal"" and a buckwheat pillow on each bed, and extras in the closet. The comforters were thick and comfy and warm. And yes, they change the duvet cover every day. It's an awesome process - if you get a chance, watch them do it - you'll learn how to make a really awkward process easy and quick!Our second stay was in an Executive Double on the 33rd floor which can only be accessed by using your key in the elevator. It was almost exactly the same room, but on a different corner, and this one was set up with a third bed for my daughter. It was a cot - but more of a portable bed than what you would think of as a cot, not some thin flimsy piece of junk. There was plenty of room even with it, and they rearranged the other furniture so we could still use the sofa and chairs. The Executive room added a DVD player to the flat screen tv (though they don't rent or sell DVDs, so if you want to watch, bring your own!). It also added complimentary bottles of water, and the 3-prong plug adaptor was already in the desk socket. It included breakfast in the Executive lounge on the 35th floor. I have seen several people complain here about the crowds there - we did not experience that. We ate there on a Sunday and a Monday morning, and it was very quiet both times, with plenty of choices, and they refilled things constantly. It was fine - although the buffet we paid for downstairs in the lobby in the Garden Cafe was absolutely outstanding! But it was $25 pp.As a matter of fact, all the food we ate at the hotel was outstanding. The service was excellent. Everything was excellent about the dining experiences except of course the prices. As in every other hotel I've stayed at in Japan, the prices were exorbitant. But when you're exhausted and it's cold and rainy out and you don't want to experiment any more for one meal, it's an awesome treat...I'm not going to repeat what all the other reviews said about the awesome views, fabulous bathrooms, etc. other than to agree.Overall, if you can afford it and want to be pampered, stay here.

Also had coffee and desserts in the Italian one, and I had one of the best tiramisus I have ever had—who knew I had to go to Tokyo for that. If you can, try the traditional Japanese breakfast through room service—it’s not cheap, but so worth it. The hotel is very close to the major Shibuya metro and JR lines and the famous Shibuya intersection is a thing to experience. Thousands of people cross it at every light cycle—amazing. There are also a lot of upscale stores and department stores in the immediate vicinity. Overall an amazing hotel in a great location. I would most certainly stay there again.","Boston, Massachusetts",57,5.0

Secondly, the staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful but, and this leads on to the first negative, the standard of English spoken is very poor. Any problems which would not be covered by a standard phrasebook are beyond them and this can lead to a difficult stay at this hotel. Also, although the rooms have internet ports for laptops, there are only two computers at the hotel available for guests. They are located in the business centre and have to be paid for - that's if you can get on them. The room was also a disappointment.

It was our first time in Tokyo and we chose this hotel based on the reviews here at TA. We really enjoyed the comfortable room, great bathroom with japanese style shower/bath enclosure. The room itself was spacious and well appointed, no discrepancy between what has been reported by other travellers. We did not experience any of the inconveniences of other reviewers : ie we asked housekeeping for our pillows to be changed to hypo-allergenic and it was done within 15 minutes. The room was immaculate, and daily housekeeping very good. The staff was most helpful, especially the concierge desk helping out with dinner reservations (in places a tourist wanderoing the streets would NEVER find!) and with train reservations (the young lady at the concierge desk made sure we booked the proper seats on the Shinkansen to Kyoto because we had luggage... she suggested we request seats at the back of the train car where there is room behind the seats for large suitcase. She then wrote all this in japanese to make it easy for us at the ticket purchase office... small details but very helpful). Not all staff speak fluent English, as acurately reported by others, but hey, if you want everyone to speak English... don't go to Japan. That is the joys of travel. We found the overall level of the staff very high.The Shibuya location is fabulous. A short 3 minute walk from the station makes JR train and subway access to all of Tokyo a breeze. Plus, compared to other hotels (we stayed at the Park Hotel at the tail end of our holiday) the Shibuya location is great, it is actually a NEIGHBORHOOD, and not just an office complex with only overhead walkways. You actually find LIFE right outside the hotel doors.Our 33rd floor room afforded great views to Roppongi and the Tokyo Tower.All in all, the Cerulean was a perfect choice, and a great home base to explore all of Tokyo.",Montreal,49,5.0

I stayed here as a single female traveller for 2 nights in February 2007. I booked via the hotel website direct. After I made a booking using the email I called them and they didn't speak English when they picked up the phone and the person I spoke to had difficulties understanding what I was asking. Eventually they transferred me to someone who spoke English to deal with my enquiry.I stayed in a standard single room. It was roomy, clean and very comfortable, but not quite 5 star standard furnishing that you would expect to see in a 5 star hotel.All the hotel staff spoke English and were very attentive. Service at the reception/room service/housekeeping/concierge level was mostly impeccable except in the restaurants. I called their Italian restaurant to reserve a table for myself. When I got there the waiter at the entrance looked at the booking and argued with me alleging I booked for 2 persons. Why would you argue with a customer about that, it wasn't like they were fully booked that night. When I ordered my meal almost every other dish was ""sold out"". I arrived at the restaurant at around 8pm so it wasn't that late in the evening. The food was nonetheless very good and reasonably priced.The hotel was around 10 minutes walk to Shibuya station, very conveniently located as a good base for exploring Tokyo. But it was an uphill walk from the station so if you were carrying heavy luggages or travelling with young kids, take the airport shuttle (which provides literally door to door service) instead of the railway. If it's your first time navigating around Shibuya station, it's a big station and you could easily get lost trying to find the correct exit to the hotel.As some other reviewers have said, the lobby is always very busy and full of people. If you are looking for a quiet relaxing stay and like to spend time in and around the hotel, go somewhere else. If you only stay in your room mostly or go out sightseeing a lot, this is a comfortable hotel to stay in.","Sydney, Australia",27,4.0

We were on the 25th floor and had an excellent view of Shinjuku and Shibuya- we could even see Fuji on one clear day! The room was very nice and well furnished, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The service was also excellent, and the staff were only too willing to help with anything. The bathroom was large, and the shower excellent. But I should stress that it was expensive. You get what you pay for though, and the Cerulean Tower was certainly worth the money. It's located only 5 mins walk from Shibuya station, and the central Shibuya area in general, but it's quiet (up on the 25th floor at least!).I'd definitely recommend taking the airport bus there, not the train though, as we found that lugging large suitcase through Shibuya station at 5.30pm is not the greatest idea. The one are where the hotel was a little disappointing was taking the airport bus back- the organisation was a bit lacking and it seemed more luck than judgement that we even got on the bus in the end. Also, there is a charge to use the internet every day, I can't remember exactly how much but it wasn't hugely expensive.

However, Capitol Tokyu is now being rebuilt so this time I stayed at one of their other hotels in the much more hip area of Shibuya. Capitol Tokyu was a very old and well established hotel, so everyone knows where it was. This time, I had trouble with the taxi guy at the bullet train station who had never heard of Cerulean. The name is not so familiar yet and Shibuya is so big and busy that if they have not heard of it, it would be very hard to find, with so many tall buildings in the area. The taxi arrived at the hotel after being stuck in Shibuya traffic for quite a long time (taxis are not cheap in Tokyo, let me remind you, so being stuck in bad traffic will cost you the price of flying with a low cost airline in another country). And when we got to the front, there was no-one there to welcome us or help us with our luggage. I had to run inside and ask someone at the reception to come out and take our luggage inside. Not a good first impression. Check in was ok good and the room itself was nice. The view from the bedroom was absolutely AMAZING, looking down to see all of the craziness of Shibuya from the 30th floor, and looking out to see all the buildings, parks and streets of Tokyo in the distance, you can even see the Tokyo Tower from your room! I doubt if the view from any other hotel room in Tokyo can be as good as this. Truly Truly amazing. However, here's the worst thing about this place: the Internet connection. I was there for business and need to use internet and email constantly. First of all, Internet in the room here is not free, which I think if you are paying this kind of price for a business hotel in a modern city like Tokyo you really should be getting complimentary internet access. Second of all, the connection itself was very shoddy, constantly getting disconnected and timed-out, not the fastest connection to begin with. This is a very frustrating thing to have happen when you are supposed to be communicating with people back home and writing emails all night. Can't download any large file because once your connection is cut you have to start it up again from the beginning. If the hotel is slowing your work progress down, that is not a major problem for business travellers who already don't have enough time in the office. Being right in Shibuya has its good and bad, but it's still a cool place to be in Tokyo, everything is here, shops, department stores, restaurants, bars, subway and JR lines. But Shibuya is pretty much at the left corner of the map at the end of the line so it's also quite far from other areas like Ginza. When I used to stay at Capitol Tokyo at Kokkai-Gijido Mae it was not in a hip area like Shibuya but it was in the middle of many places like Roppongi, Ginza, Shinjuku, Harajuku and even Shibuya so it was a good central base to be in. Breakfast here is served in 3 different restaurants for 3 different styles/ cuisines so you have to make a choice of what cuisine you want before you sit down. This means that you can't be having western breakfast while your colleague has Japanese. I tried both and was more impressed with the Japanese breakfast eventhough that restaurant was totally empty. Try the Croissant in the western breakfast buffet though, one of the best I've ever had. Room service was very good, although very very expensive. A bowl of Unagi and Rice will set you back about 4300 yen! No complimentary water in the room either. Again, with this kind of room rate, what's a little thing like bottled water for guests? Seems like they're forgetting the small details that make a difference.  Overall, has the potential to be really excellent, with good location and a great view. All the basics are there, management just needs a little fine tuning.","Bangkok, Thailand",170,3.0

The hotel was relatively average by Tokyo standards. The best feature is that it is within easy walking distance to Shibuya station (5 minute walk) and reasonably close to shopping and restaurants in Shibuya.The restaraunts in the hotel are exhorbitantly priced (even by Tokyo standards), and the hotel charges are NOT as advertised. In addition to the room charge, there was a service charge, a consumption tax, and an accommoation tax added to the bill... all of which, according to the hotel staff are ""customary charges"". Interestingly, the other three hotels I've stayed in Tokyo in the past two months charged NONE of these. Unless you book through a 3rd party that charges you up front, expect to pay approximately 20% more than the advertised price. Also expect to pay 1,000 yen for each day of internet service and 3,500 yen for each day of gym/pool use.The room (a superior queen bed with sky view) was reasonably sized, was similar to an average Westin hotel in the states, and the view (from my corner room on the 30th floor) was unexpectedly rather mediocre. Unlike other Tokyo hotels, there wasn't too much interesting in the room (no heated toilet seats, no automatic shades, etc.).

But what you get, in Tokyo, is truly outstanding. In the past my wife and I have stayed in Tokyo business hotels, which are several times cheaper. But they are also several times smaller, and frankly after a long day immersed in the hustle and bustle of central Tokyo they were not very relaxing to come home to. The Cerulean Tower, on the other hand, makes an ideal ""base of operations"" - after a long day of whatever you are doing in Tokyo (sightseeing, business, etc.) you can come home to a place that is truly well planned, relaxing, and more than large enough for American standards.The service, typical for Japan, is a cut above normal expectations. From the moment we entered the lobby (after walking from the nearby train station) porters and greeters came, took our luggage, and escorted us to the check-in. All the staff spoke excellent English. Whenever we needed it, someone was there to help us. They also arranged for our return to Narita, they have shuttle bus (for a fee).Our room, on the 26th floor, was what I believe their web site lists as a ""deluxe corner king"". The room was roughly 500 square feet. There was a small entryway, with a dresser and a place to put luggage. There was a full closet (with motion sensitive lights!). The room has a doorbell and electric ""do not disturb"" sign. The room is one large main room, with a California King, a love seat, chair, and a panoramic picture window. There was also a smalll desk with internet connection ($10/day), with another picture window. There was a widescreen tv, and a mini-bar fridge. We stocked it with soft drinks from the convenience store. The bathroom was jaw-dropping - the spacious tub (although not a 2-person model) also has a panoramic picture window overlooking Tokyo. There is a glass shower, the usual heated, computerized toilet, and polished stone floor to ceiling. All tastefully decorated - I applaud whoever designed these rooms - for once someone got it right, as opposed to just pasting expensive stuff on the walls.The hotel itself is conveniently located about a block from the Shibuya station - it is a short walk with overhead walkways over the street intersections. Note that the main overhead walkway near the station has stairs both up and down, but the one on the north of the hotel sports an elevator and there are escalators on the east from street level, which may an issue for some. It is also only a block or two from the Shibuya shopping madness - there is plenty going on here all the time. There is a 7-11 in the hotel itself, and a Lawson's down the block, which should fulfill most of your minor shopping and late-night snack needs. We never used the pricey room service, but we did eat in Chinese Restauraunt ""Chen"" (yes, the Iron Chef). The food was good.All in all, a truly fine hotel and for those with the means it is more than worth it. We will certainly stay there again the next time we are in Tokyo.","Pasadena, CA",78,5.0

We stayed in a Deluxe King Room (44 sq. meters) on the 35th floor (executive floor).We picked this hotel based on passed tripadvisor reviews. We were a little unsure of the location at first, due to the long ride from the airport. Also, the Shibuya area is known as a “young persons” area.Well let me tell you, the airport limousine bus could not be more convenient. It is literally door to door service. Most people get off and carry on to another part of the city, but if you are staying at the hotel, your luggage will be picked up from the bus and delivered directly to your room (very convenient). Don’t be fooled, the “little girls” that handle your luggage are more than capable to carry them.Check in was quick and efficient. Key-card was in your hands within a couple of minutes. The elevator to the 35th floor was as fast as it gets. The room was larger then expected for Tokyo, and the bathroom was large, by anyone’s standards. The workmanship of construction in the room was not to be believed. Everything fit like a glove. I only wish that my house had the same workmanship! The view from the room was breathtaking. I’m not sure that you need to spend $$$ on the view of Mt. Fuji. We could only see it for a day and a half due to fog (haze).The money spent for the executive floor is a must. Breakfast in the 40th floor dining room was fabulous. Great service and a lovely meal. Also included was use of the 35th floor executive lounge including teas, coffee and cold drinks all day, with snacks and alcoholic beverages for a few hours in the evening. Also free in room internet on the executive floors. Service from the executive lounge people was marvelous. They were extremely helpful and had a genuine need to satisfy you. They were a pleasure.The location is indeed very convenient. Lots of great shopping and subway, JR line and Keio(sp) lines are all within a seven minute walk. Be prepared to see a chiropractor when you return home. The amount of people there to greet you and help you will keep you bowing 50 times a day.

It also had the fastest lift I've ever been in.Based on what I had heard about Tokyo I was expecting a small room but the room was a reasonable size by UK standards, very clean and nicely decorated. What took my breath away was the view from the window. We were on the 26 floor looking towards Mt Fuji and at sunset the views were stunning.The other great thing about this hotel was the bathroom which was huge with a separate walk in shower & bath room, and the most technologically advanced toilet (complete with heated seat) I've ever seen. Certainly one of the best hotel bathrooms I've ever experienced.The location is good. It's a short walk from Shibuya where there is plenty going on, and is close to the station where the Ginza metro line provides cheap and easy access to the rest of the city. We were on a room only basis so didn't have breakfast in the hotel, but we were quite happy to grab a croissant from the excellent bakery at the station on our way into town.Getting here from Narita is a doddle as the limousine bus company run a bus every hour or so that will drop you at the door. As I recall this was quite cheap but took around 1h 30min.My only criticisms would be that our room seemed a little hot at night even with the a/c on full, and the hotel bar is comically expensive.

This is not one of them. This is a four star hotel masquerading as a five star hotel. The difference between a club room here on a Saturday night and a room at the Park Hyatt was about $50-100 and there is no comparison. The room is not in same class as the Park Hyatt and was frankly a disappointment for the money. It was on the small side and in terms of style; more department store catalogue rather than a designer experience.The staff at the Cerulean are obviously trained to be attentive, however, it can become a bit too much. They were all lovely but such enthusiasm at breakfast! The club breakfast was served in the signature dining room with a sensational view and it was very good. But a formally served five course breakfast is a bit like the enthusiasm, a bit much first thing in the morning. Wonderful coffee was a big plus. You can opt for a continental breakfast at the club, but the selection is ridiculously meagre.The club cocktail hour was very light on too, the club area was small and the standard range of hors d'oeuvre was so poor as to be laughable. It is not comparable to the normal Club lounge scenario, however again the view is wonderful.The location is good for this side of Tokyo so if you really want to stay in Shibuya then I suggest you take a standard room and skip the extra expense of a Club Room.. I suspect all rooms are identical to the club rooms but others are on a lower level of the hotel.. The lobby was full on, always full and bustling. Some people may like that, but it felt like the rest of Shibuya, packed and trendy. It was no retreat from the outside world.Yep, after three days the Cerulean made me finally feel my age. I probably resent that but what I resent more is paying for 5 stars and getting a good solid four star experience with a few flourishes around the edges.The Cerulean is a hotel that really tries to be more than it is.The Park Hyatt or Mandarin Oriental are in a different class.","Sydney, Australia",222,3.0

The Cerulean is nicely located in the Shibuya area of Tokyo, but not in the busy, crazy, noisy area of Shibuya. Walking distance to all the shopping and good restaurants! The hotel has a nice modern design, very clean, uncluttered and by any standard (not just Japanese), the rooms are quite spacious and quiet. Wonderful bedding, rich, fluffy towels, robes, slippers, easily rivaling the Westin's, Ritz Carlton's, and W's! The service is amazing! The staff truly anticipates your every move everything from pushing the elevator button before you get to it, to bringing you water to your table before you even think about it! They are very polite and cheerful, they seem to like working there. Bottom line, I highly recommend it if you're looking to get the most out of your $$, yes, it's not that cheap (I paid $250 a night) but worth every penny especially in Tokyo!","Seattle, Washington USA",112,5.0

The bathrooms, with their polished marbled walls and vanity tops were lovely too. In addition, we find the hotel very well-located. It is just 5 minutes walk away from the Shibuya station, from which you could easily reach most places in Tokyo. For alternatives from the hotel food, one can easily find a wide plethora of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. We had tasty noodle soup breakfasts at this little noodle shop just a couple of minutes' walk from the hotel! Last but not least, the service at this hotel is excellent!

I've tried a hotels, but for the money the Cerulean is my favorite. It's very conveniently located with respect to dining/shopping, and the Narita-Express gives you direct transportation to/from Narita. The decor is modern, which suites my preferences, the staff have always been very attentive to my needs. When I have breakfast there, the help literally anticipates my needs based on what I'm doing. I remember once taking a bowl of cereal to my table from the buffet, only to find a waiter 1 step behind me with the cereal spoon I'd neglected to take! I like all the restaurants in the Hotel, but there are many good ones within a 10 minute walk. People who complain about a lack of cable channels need to spend more time out and about and less in front of the tube. I often am lucky enough to get a room from which you can see Mt.

I agree that the $10 charge for internet and $20 for the gym seem like nickle and diming you ... but compare it to the $120 more a night you pay for the Westin in Ebisu Garden...For $220 (what I normally pay), it's a bargain in Tokyo.",New England,16,5.0

As a single woman traveler spending 4 days in Tokyo on business/vacation I thoroughly enjoyed this property. Although its right in the heart of crazy, trendy Shibuya (entertaining to watch the teen trends there), the location was great for subway and Japan Rail access (20 minute ride on the JR Yamanote line to Tokyo station and the Shinkansen). Hotel itself was a quiet oasis from crowded, busy Tokyo. I ordered room service twice and both times it was fast, tasty, and servers were polite. Lots of help and attention from bellhops and staff. In-room internet access worked well - just had to keep logging back in to the hotel's site. The best part was the room itself. Got upgraded from a small twin room to a corner King on the 23rd floor, no extra charge and such a nice surprise after the long trip from the US East coast. Not only wonderul view towards Shinjuku but bathroom was large and had a deep bathtub plus separate shower. All marble and all the amenities one could want. Room itself was good sized with a nice workdesk and closet. Clean overall. Comfy bed and choice of pillows was a nice touch: choices are 1) traditional Japanese rice husk-filled; 2) tempur-pedic foam; 3) feather. I did not eat in the hotel restaurants but instead explored the local yakitori and other treats around the area - there are lots of them - and the Tokyu and Mark City Department stores within a 10 minute walk had some fun and interesting supermarkets to explore with tasty to-go food for less than 1000 Yen. I did not use the fitness center or pool or the hotel bars. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a comfortable, quiet, clean, friendly, and modern hotel in Tokyo. It's not the Mandarin Oriental, but more of a sleek, well-run, very cushy and attractive business hotel, with affordable (read: under $200 a night off season or on a government budget) rooms. Another added bonus is the express bus to/from Narita Airport stops right at the hotel entrance. This is much more convenient than taking the subway to/from Narita. I will stay here when again in Tokyo and would recommend this to friends.

As the name suggests, the hotel is a gigantic tower block - not overly appealing on the eye, but very handy for locating when you come out of one of the station's many exits and need to know which way to head!The porters at the hotel will probably be your first experience - they are so eager to help and overly polite. Be prepared to be bowed down to at every opportunity! The porters are mainly young girls who are TINY, which was quite amusing, as I had no idea how on earth they would manage to lift my heavy case on to the trolley - but somehow they did. Any offer to help was deemed highly offensive, so best just to let them get on with it. The vast and spacious lobby is a real hub of activity with constant toing and froing, and there was usually a small (but orderly) manned queue at the check-in desks, although the process is quite smooth and hassle-free. There are a huge number of staff milling around - some of whom's sole purpose seemd to be to greet people and bow! However, everyone was more than willing to help and answer any questions, which was great. Free area maps were also available - and a god-send, as Tokyo is a NIGHTMARE to find your way around!Our room was on the 22nd floor and it was great. It was quite big (but not MASSIVE) and perfectly comfortable. The ""king-size"" bed wasn't as big as other king-size beds I have stayed in in other countries, but then again the Japanese are all so tiny it's hardly surprising! The beds were SO comfy and the special pillows made sleeping pure heaven. The air-conditioning was easy to use, and our internet access was problem-free throughout. There was a small desk and chair, plus a comfy chair and small table. There was also a large walk-in wardrobe area with a rail and hangers plus a ledge for suitcases. The TV was fine, although the remote control was a bit of a minefield - and mainly in Japanese. Thankfully some of the programmes are in both English and Japanese, but you have to locate the button on the remote to allow you to switch to English. Watch out for accidentally pressing the Pay-TV button by mistake - VILE! Not pleasant! The overall choice of programmes wasn't overwhelming - mainly CNN, Fox and BBC World 24 (which started to grate after a while!!), but it's better than nothing. The minibar was stocked mainly with soft drinks, water and beer, but the prices were astronomical. Much cheaper to pop to the shop next door! Free robes and slippers are provided, which was great. The bathroom was really nice and clean, with plenty of marble and shiny chrome fittings. There was a bath with an overhead shower, which could be detached so used whilst in the bath. Sadly our bathroom didn't have a window, but I believe corner rooms have bathrooms with views over the city, which would be wonderful - although I am sure they come at a premium! There were a selection of free toilettries and a hairdryer. There was also a very hi-tech toilet, with all mod-cons (built in washer and bidet - be prepared - it is quite a shock at first - believe you me ... brace yourselves!!). Undoubtedly the most FABULOUS thing is the view from the bedroom over Shibuya - it is SPECTACULAR! I don't normally get overly excited about views but this one was incredible - I spent hours looking out of the window watching the world go by. I felt just like Scarlett Johannson in Lost in Translation - it is almost overwhelming!The rooms were very clean and the chaimbermaids were very efficient and polite. Most of the ones I saw were actually men, and they always knock (well, actually - ring your personal doorbell!) before entering. If you fancy a lie-in you can always switch on your electronic DO NOT DISTURB sign!!!There are several restauarnts in the hotel, but we only ate in three. We had an amazing meal in the Italian restaurant on the Second Floor, but it's not cheap and the portion sizes aren't massive. Drinks are also REALLY expenisve, and last orders are at 22.00 - so Europeans used to eating late could be in trouble.We also had a snack in the lobby restaurant (I think it is called the Garden Restaurant), which was nice enough, but rather overily fussy (and expensive!) for just a quick snack, which was what we wanted! There was a good choice on the menu, and I believe it was open until midnight, which was useful as the other restaurants all shut at 22.00. On the last night we decided to treat ourselves by eating in the spectacular Tower Restaurant on the 40th floor. It is very high-brow and exclusive - and the prices reflect this! It was exceedingly expensive, and although the food was very good, it was quite fussy and again the portion sizes were small, so despite a 6 course (set) meal we still didn't feel overly full. It is very pretentious, and formal dress is expected. They lent my partner a suit jacket to wear (although he was already really smart in shirt, trousers and posh shoes) - and I was surprised to see a Japanese girl getting away with wearing jeans - albeit smart designer jeans! Similarly, we took 2 photos with a flash, before the waiter rushed over and urged us not to use a camera with a flash as we would be ""disturbing the other guests"". It made me smile how, only moments later, another waiter was actually taking a photo of a Japanese couple with their camera with a flash! One rule for one, and one for the others, it would seem! Anyway, the food was good, and the wine was great too (although again far too over-priced!) and although it was an amazing experience it was rather overbearing, as the waiters prowl around and attend to your every need constantly, so it wasn't overly relaxing! They even insist on accompanying you to the entrance to the bathroom (sorry - ""washroom"" as they always say) - even though it was only a 10 metre walk from our table!! The main feature of the restaurant is the fabulous view, which stretches out all over Tokyo, and it was worth the money, and it was definitely a memorable experience! It was just a shame we don't have more photos to remember it by!!!Next door is the intimate Tower Piano Bar, which again has excellent views, and a real atmosphere that oozes class and sophistication. I would advise that you get there early, or book in advance, as there was usually a queue. Champagne or cocktails are the order of the day - and be prepared to pay through the nose. I dread to think how much we spent here - probably best not to dwell on it, but it just has to be done! I really felt that this was how it should be - all glammed up, sipping Bellinis and sitting in a sleek hotel bar overlooking the glitz and lights of the biggest city in the world ... surely this was how it was meant to be!?!The other restaurants all looked great, and they were always busy which was a good sign. In particular, the Chinese restaurant looked great fun and very popular - the chefs are positioned for all to see, and it seemed quite relaxed. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as it was HIDEOUSLY expensive, and really not worth the money. Instead we tended to grab something from the local shop next door for a fraction of the price. We did use the pool and jacuzzi once - and I knew that there was an extra charge, but was quite horrified to learn that it was JPY 2100 per person per day - which is about £11 - ouch! This was a total rip off, although the pool was amazing and the jacuzzi was fab (albeit VERY hot!). We were the only people there for the whole time (probably as it was so damn expensive!), so it did feel quite exclusive, which helped to justify the expense. The changing rooms were very posh with everything you could ever possibly need, and best of all were the massage chairs which were FANTASTIC and highly recommended! Bliss! If you do go swimming, be prepared to be forced to wear a hideous BRIGHT PINK swimming cap. I wish I were joking, but I'm not - it was quite a sight - awful, and so NOT sexy! The Japanese are very hot on hygiene, and a shower blasts you before you even get near the pool to remove all impurities!! One thing that I did noticre (although it didn't affect us) was that anyone with tattoos is not allowed to use the pool - which seemed particularly harsh!! To sum up, this is a great hotel - particularly for business people, and is very well located - just a 5 minute walk from Shibuya station (over a big footbridge that crosses the hugely busy highway just in front of the hotel). The area was very safe, although Shibuya is a hive of activity at all times of the day (and night)! The service at the hotel is impeccable and the rooms are great. Just be prepared to spend, spend, spend - Tokyo is ridiculously expensive. But nothing can beat the views from the Cerulean Tower, which are simply staggering,. You will be transfixed!

The room, closet, and bathroom were large, nicely appointed, and clean. The service was quite good, though the lobby can sometimes get sufficiently crowded with non-hotel guests (the hotel occupies the top floors of a business tower) that you might get lost in the shuffle to some extent. The hotel's location, a 3-minute walk from the Shibuya train station, is good, though the immediate area in front of the hotel is marred by an elevated highway. The area behind the hotel feels almost European, with its small streets and many tiny restuarants. In contrast, on the other side of the hotel and across the highway is the heart of Shibuya, an area that is most definitely Tokyo all the way. The hotel is close to Aoyama, a really nice shopping and strolling area, and close to Shinjuku as well.

It's just a 10 min walk from the Shibuya train station and surrounding bars/restaurants. Also, the hotel itself is part of the Cerulean Tower Office building as well so it's very convenient to stay there on a business trip to one of the companies in that tower.

They sent someone up to the room to help us but after 40+ min, it still didn't work. They finally just faxed our documents for us on their own machines.

The pillows and beds seemed as if they were made for my back-- they have temper-pedic and buckwheat pillows -- the only two types of pillows I'll rest my head on! Be sure to request a corner room because the corner rooms have view from the bathtub-- which is just exquisite after a long day and you want to soak in the tub. The location is unbeatable-- just a two minute walk from the Shibuya train station or a hotel shuttle bus ride away. The limosine bus from the airport also stops at the hotel.

The Cerulean is a very nice hotel located near the Shibuya train station. The room I had was a comfortable size, with nice contemporary furniture. The bathroom was great and the toilet had heated seats which was a nice touch. However, their customer service/front desk has a lot to learn about how to treat hotel guests.Upon checking in, I had reserved a superior, non-smoking room on a high floor. However, I was given a smaller standard room on the lower floor at the same rate as the superior room. When I complained, I was told the hotel was full and that I had to take that room at the higher rate. Upon entering the room I noted that is was a ""smoking"" room and it smelled of smoke. I again complained and was upgraded to an Executive Floor room because that was the only location with non-smoking rooms available. With the Executive Floor comes free internet and free access to the gym.However, upon checkout, I was shocked to see that my bill contained a charge for the gym and the internet. When I inquired about this, I was told that even though I was upgraded, they were not going to allow me to enjoy the benefits associated with the Executive Floor. I couldn't believe that the hotel would actually do this. I paid the $50 extra that was on my bill for those services and immediately told my company that the hotel should not be put on our preferred vendor list. I am surprised that a luxury hotel would do something like that. So for $40, they lost thousands of dollars in business. This proved to me that they have no class and don't deserve the four stars that they have.The hotel is nice, but they have no sense of customer service or making customers feel welcome. The upgrade really wasn't an upgrade and coupled with the fact that they tried to charge me the same rate for a standard room that was smoking as the superior non-smoking room that I had originally requested warrants the low rating I gave them. I have stayed in many luxury hotels around the world and have never received this type of treatment. I wouldn't recommend this hotel.","New York City, New York",23,2.0

This is more of a business hotel, very cold but it is incredible. Its very modern and new. The beds are the most comfortable ive slept in...maybe at par with banyan tree bangkok's beds. But it is very comfortable. The view from my room is amazing. Looks like the deathstar in starwars. You get a glimpse of mt. fuji with amazing sunsets. Bathroom is very spacious with a separate shower and bathtub encase in clear glass. Toilets have those bidet systems. I used the gym and the pool, its not free...i think it was $30-$50 per use. Hey, its japan...you're gonna be spending money here. But its a nice pool that's indoor...theres also a big jaccuzi area... they like their jaccuzi's really hot in tokyo... ive been to a hotspring resort in shuzenji, and its super hot. anyways....i was the only one there so it was awesome.I ate at the lobby restaurant and the italian place in the same hotel. Its ok... i think their desserts are better.The service in this hotel is exceptional...the manager, and basically everyone here was very polite, helpful, profesional and very friendly. The best thing i like about this hotel is that it is very new...it doesnt have that old hotel smell...or the hint of nicotine cigarette smoke smell back from the 60's or 70's. I hate that.... its just brand spanking new. the location is also very close to shibuyas commercial center and it is conviniently in the route of the narita busline.... i will definitely return to this hotel if i get another chance to go to japan.","Santa Monica, California",102,5.0

We have a coroporate rate at this hotel and most of our executives stay here (this trip was my 7th stay.)The rooms are great in every respect. Nicely appointed, comfortble double bed, enough closet spacem great bathroom. Views are out of this world. The rooms are perfect I feel.The hotel has many other features that I love. The executive level gives you free broadband and access to the health club which is quite nice. It also has expresso machines so you can get a cappucino anytime you like.The Chinese resturant is off of the charts. Its created by Iron Chef Chen. Sit at the counter. I go there everytime I can. The food is worth coming to the hotel for and a respit if you have been in Japan for an extended stay. Lobster in Chen's chili sauce..mmm...well you get the point.The French Iron Chef has his resturant across the street for that special business dinner if your Chen'ed out.I am not a huge fan of the lobby resturant. No soul to the food, not that its bad but its just stiff as board. Lighten up people.The bar on the 40th is fabulous, especially to watch sunset. The manager once he gets to know you is just great.JZ Brat is a classy jazz club in the building. Its quite nice with interesting artists and great service.Concierge is very resourceful and allways seems to be able to get me a reservation.Last stop on the bus ride to Narita makes that the best way to get out of town. I love this hotel and would reccomend it to anyone.","Marin County, California",116,5.0

We had a corner room with an amazing panoramic view from the bathtub! The room was very spacious by any standards and well equipped. The concierge was also very helpful. By tokyo standards, it was great value for money. On the downside, there is a pool and health club in the hotel but is is not free and very expensive to use.",,59,5.0

So you can easily visit all other districts quickly. Shibuya is oine of the best spots for shopping and dining. The hotel has a very modern lobby, friedly staff and the views from the top-floor rooms are excellent. Health club, indoor pool and fine restaurants complet my impression.
