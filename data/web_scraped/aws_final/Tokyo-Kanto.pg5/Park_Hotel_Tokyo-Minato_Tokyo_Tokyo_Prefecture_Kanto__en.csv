The views were incredible, including Mount Fuji on clear days. Bed was huge and room was spotless. The hotel itself is very stylish and the staff were extremely polite and helpful. The location is very good. The hotel is just above Shiodome St. which is very convenient for getting to Odaiba in particular. For access to the JR lines, Shimbashi St. is only a few minutes walk. The area directly around the hotel is quiet, but if you're looking for more eateries, bars etc., there's plenty around Shimbashi St. Will definitely stay in this hotel again and highly recommend.",Ireland,0,5.0

We really liked the convenience of the train stations beneath the hotel. The location is in a non-touristy area so it was really neat to see the regular activity of Tokyo. The hotel had a nice breakfast - we paid for it only once though as it was a bit pricey. We couldn't pass up the convenience of the restaurant in the hotel at night though - after a long day of touring we really appreciated the good food. The bed was comfortable. The view from the room was nice - really cool to see the city buzzing down below. We could hear the trains go by - but it wasn't too disturbing. The room was perfect for what we needed. The staff was amazing - they were ready to help with any requests (extra towel, question on the area). We would stay here again if we get back to Tokyo!","Madison, Alabama",26,4.0

Although they do not assign rooms ahead of time we gave them a list of preferable rooms (if they were available) and got the geisha goldfish, which was incredible. The view of the Tokyo Tower made it even better.Staff was polite and helpful. They booked a few restaurant reservations we asked about beforehand and even gave us a map for how to locate them. The only slight downside is at one of the high end steak restaurants (Satou) they required you to book ahead of time certain meals, which we weren't aware of, so my husband was unable to get his meal of choice. On the English speaking websites we didn't see anything about this and can't blame the concierge, but just a note in the future would be helpful for the concierge to follow up with the restaurant if any additional reservations are required.All in all would recommend! Great location (close to subways) and was the perfect choice for our honeymoon and fit within our budget. The front desk was even kind enough to give us champagne and there were decorations as well in our room. Thank you for making our four days in Tokyo for our honeymoon a wonderful time.

Our room was very nice, with a good bathroom and had a view of the river. They do a very nice buffet breakfast. We also ate in their Japanese restaurant one night (where they made some vegetarian ramen for me) and in their main restaurant with a more European flavour and it was all really good. It is very easy to get around with Shiadome and Shimbashi stations accessible from the subway if you take the lift down to the basement.

Very unique indeed. Had its own galleries on several floors and worth an hour or two just to look at all this within the hotel. Our regular room , albeit a bit small and with a very standard hotel interior, nonetheless had a great view of Tokyo Tower and this was especially breathtaking at night. There were some rooms decorated and painted by individual artists and each was unique and a work of art in itself literally, but we did not stay in one of these special rooms but took a regular one which was decent enough. All in all, this was quite a lovely stay during a sunny winter’s day in Tokyo and I would highly recommend this charming hotel to anyone who wants to try a hotel that is just a little different from the usual norm. Especially recommended for those artsy and creative types.....","Singapore, Singapore",5,4.0

While part of a business tower, the hotel has a stylish aesthetic and stunning views. Our room had a fantastic view of the bay. The bed was ultra comfortable. While the bathroom felt a bit dated, the room was otherwise modern and well appointed. We really liked the hotel location. It’s very close to Ginza, which is an excellent neighborhood for great bars (eg Star Bar), restaurants, cafes (eg cafe de l’ambre) and shopping. Once we got oriented, we usually took the Park Hotel elevator to the subway level and walked through the underground from Shiodome station area to Shimbashi station to exit for our Ginza outings. Shimbashi station is also notable because of the Yamonote line. Since we had a JR pass, we could ride that line with our pass so it was convenient for getting around to key areas of the city like Shibuya and Shinjuku. The staff at the hotel were all incredibly friendly and helpful, especially as we had to receive a package to the hotel. The fitness centre is very tiny and can only be used by reservation. If you’re a fitness enthusiast, this might be a drawback. I never had issues with the booking system, though I didn’t always get my first choice. Considering a lot of hotels in Tokyo don’t have fitness centres at all or charge for them, I was satisfied with what this hotel offered. This was our second hotel in Tokyo. For the comfort, style, service, reasonable cost and proximity to Ginza, we’d stay here again in a heartbeat. ","Brisbane, Australia",48,4.0

Headed to Shinbashi station late night searching for food, there are many office workers around who seem to have had drinks after work. Once I understand more about walking around, it is still convenient to get to transportation. So overall had mixed feeling to its location. Enjoyed a room with Tokyo Tower view, which is great. Since the traffic is busy down the streets, so even though my room is on 30th floor, I am able to hear the traffic noise in my sleep, which is weird.

Great unique artwork in the room and a little ""lounge"" on the floor with baked goods and coffee in the morning and wine in the evening (great view).A couple very little things that were challenging. We are finding Tokyo hard to navigate (English speaking with no Japanese) and getting to the hotel from the airport was tough. Google maps led us astray a few times and because the hotel is on the 25 floor it is not obvious (signage is small and discreet). We took the train from the airport and came above ground to find it.

The room itself was nice enough if a little small, clean and comfortable, but the smell as soon as you entered was of dampness or more like ""sweaty bodies"". This was exactly the same when I was there 2 years ago. Every time I entered the room, the lingering smell was pervasive. This is not typical of hotels in Japan, as during my visit this time for the rugby World Cup I stayed in both Kakegawa and Yokohama. In both places the rooms were prefect.

When i relayed this to the staff, they immediately apologized, and sent me and my husband a bottle of champagne. They also made sure that someone who make sure the lounge was adequately stocked & erviced the following evening. Breakfast was great, there was enough variety for most palettes, and I especially appreciated the lovely early-morning breakfast the staff set up for us for our early departure. If I had any criticism it would be that coffee came out of a simple automated machine, hopefully they consider making fresh-brewed coffee in the future.

Staff are welcoming and helpful. The hotel boasts not only one of the best Japanese restaurants in Tokyo (according to a very discerning Japanese friend of mine and we ate there with him one night endorsing this rating). There is also a branch of the Scotch Whisky Society (equally good and bad news for me since I spent a lot of money in there during our stay). Also a French style restaurant we did not try. The central lobby bar and breakfast area is also really good and one of the best caipirinhas in Tokyo is available there. Our 34th floor room was modestly sized, well equipped and had a fantastic view over Shimbashi and the surrounding area. This 34th floor vantage also vibrated, shuddered and swayed when a category 3 typhoon (actually one of the strongest to hit the Tokyo area in recent times) hit on the second night of our stay. Lashing rain and driving winds pummelled the building and it was disconcerting. The only thing I would say is staff should have put a notice round saying the building is built to withstand severe earthquakes and will sway slightly and judder as a number of guests were quite alarmed.

There are many ways but it’s the easiest if you have large suitcases.We choose an artist room 3101 with south facing view with the hopes of seeing Mt Fuji...unfortunately it was cloudy all four days. I also choose an artist room since it gave us the privilege of their special room offering juices, pastry and hot beverages in morning and during evening red & wine. This was a very nice perk since after a long day of playing tourist you could enjoy a glass of wine. We found the hotel staff extremely accommodating and always smiling. I used the laundry facilities once b/c it was so humid and we change clothes frequently. I appreciate the hotel having this facility since many do not and you are stuck with paying hotel laundry prices. The only issue I had was that these two washers are washer & dryer combo. So wash and dry for a small load was $4-5 but they provided detergent. They washed and dried but they didn’t wring out enough liquid so the clothes was still wet. So if you are thinking of using washer plan to pay another 400 yen (30 mins per 100 yen) to dry.We also paid extra ~$25 pp for breakfast.

The location of the hotel is actually not that great as it's a good 5-10 min walk to a train stop (and normally it's < 5 mins at other hotels) plus the entrance is INSIDE another building so you're going up TWO elevators to get to your room.The room itself was clean but not too big and has all the basics. It's definitely ""boutique"" though since there's a lounge on our floor that offers free breakfast (opens very late at 8am I think) and free drinks! Great to-go and especially looking for bottled water to-go for the day. I loved the view outside the breakfast lounge. Everyone's english was top notch! Loved how all the staff always asked if we needed help (we didn't but thanks!). The concierge was very knowledgeable though.We stayed here for 3 nights and I thought it was decent; given the price and location. I probably won't be coming back as the walk to the train was a pain but the local streets and food were a good experience.

The BEST thing about this hotel was we arrived on an early morning flight and arrived at hotel at 9am and were able to check in to our room immediately. This is very unusual for Japan, we stayed in another 6 hotels and even though rooms were clearly ready they waited until 3 pm then had a mass of people queuing up at the same time, ridiculous, so to Park Hotel.Location is also excellent with multiple transport connections that will take you anywhere in the city, took 30 minutes to travel with no changes from Haneda Airport.

The area is safe, with lots of restaurants near by, I suggest to go to the Shiodome where you can find nice restaurants, we had diner Bacio di Guilietta, an Italian Trattoria for a descent price. Hotel is also at a walking distance (about 15 min) from the old fish market (Tsuki-ji) which is a must do when you are in Tokyo.Hotel: Lobby at the 25th floor with a nice view on Tokyo Tower.

Somewhat spacious for a downtown area, coffee machine, HDTV (if you don't mind watching Japanese channels), air conditioning, a little bar with liquor and soft drinks. I found the bed a little hard as well as the pillows, I am not sure if this ti s a Japanese standard or just the hotel as this was our first hotel in Japan.Breakfast: We had breakfast included with our room. The hotel gives you vouchers that you exchange. The breakfast is served on the 25th floor in the lobby and has everything you can expect and more (local Japanese food). Everything is tasteful and fresh. Price: A little expensive but you are in Tokyo.

Hopefully my review this time is a bit more helpful in explaining why you should select this as your hotel.The Hotel itself takes up floors 25-34 of a high-rise structure, with 34 being artist rooms. There is art throughout the hotel and even projected onto a 10 story inside wall of the hotel atrium, it’s really nice. The lobby is great and offers incredible views and has nice bars and restaurants. It’s a nice place to enjoy people watching and relaxing. It is a very welcoming area, but to me the price of food is a bit much. At 9 USD a coffee I had to decline even though I was sitting with family. The Whiskey Bar has an amazing selection and a nice atmosphere to unwind after a long flight or day. It has a really unbelievable selection of craft beers and local whiskey. The food selection was good as well.The corner view king is a great way to go for more space and a nice view. There are four very large windows with a full view of the Tokyo Tower and other buildings. I think some queen Tokyo tower views have even better views due to buildings blocking out the tower base, but corner king is very large. The room has all the essentials, razor, shaving cream, toothbrush, etc. It’s very functional and nice.The location is 5-10-minute walk to Shimbashi and the Tokyo Loop, you can buy 1 day passes there for about 6 USD and enjoy full use of the subway until midnight the same day. Shiodome station and taxis are plentiful on the first floor and basement level. There is also a Family Mart, which has everything you might need and is very similar to a US 7/11 – water, beer, snacks, everything you need for the room at very affordable prices. Also, there are dozens of nice restaurants in the Shidome City Center, a short 5-minute walk with dozens and dozens of bars etc. It’s a bit corporate but is a nice introduction to the area.

It was a lovely way to end our trip. The check in staff were very pleasant and the process was quick and easy. Our room was room 7 on the 32nd floor. The room was small but no smaller than a Premier Inn type room here in the UK. But what was better was the view. We were on the Tokyo Tower side and the views from morning to night were spectacular. Th room itself was clean and had a small fridge and a TV, and a wardrobe and room safe. Everything you'd need really, if you're spending your whole trip here. As we were staying only 3 nights, we didn't make use of any services such as room service and laundry, so cannot comment on those. We also didn't have breakfast in the hotel as we found the price a little steep for our budget, especially at the end of our holiday, but I'm sure it was delicious and to the high standard of the rest of the hotel. If like us, you won't be having the breakfast in the hotel, there are plenty of Lawson/Family Mart/7Elevens in the very close vicinity, as well as plenty of restaurants for all your meals. We found the area over the road under the railway was the best and closest place for cheap food. Ramen Hokuta was a favourite of mine. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here, as did my boyfriend.

The house wine is pleasant but expensive especially when it comes in rather small quantities and you have to order a second one! Service was prompt and pleasant.The buffet breakfasts are heroic in both quantity and variety but the dining area is quite small so at peak times when the hôtel is full (as it was) people often have to queue for a table.

The 31st floor had an art concierge in situ every day to assist artist-room guests and each morning there were complimentary pastries and hot drinks for those guests. There were three art exhibitions (31st, 32nd and 35th floors) with work for sale and also a large video installation stretching upwards from the reception lobby into the central space which could be viewed from all floors. On the reception level there were some excellent ceramics and other items for sale. Staff were courteous and attentive. I'd booked a queen-sized room and it was spacious with a comfortable bed, choice of pillows, window seat, easy chair, footrest, table and desk. The red curtains and other decor complimented the art. Adjustable lights (I liked that they could be very bright, not always the case in Japan) and air conditioning. Lots of storage and hanging space, safe, fridge (with mini bar), decent-sized tv (with the first thing that comes on being evacuation info - admirable), full-sized mirror, cups & glasses. Adjoining powerpoints spaced so both could hold transformers at the same time (yay). Yakata and in-house slippers. Bathroom was a good size too with ample bench space for cosmetics etc, and complimentary toiletries were provided. Apart from the joy of the castle, there were great views of Tokyo in several directions and I enjoyed watching the trains coming and going. The hotel's location is excellent, next to Shiodome Station and with Shimbashi Station across the way, so easy access to most Tokyo destinations. There's a wide range of shops and eateries in the vincinity. Taxi rank outside and staff arranged for me to travel to the airport via reasonably-priced limousine (shuttle) which only stopped at about four places. I definitely hope to return.","Sydney, Australia",57,5.0

Right at Shimbashi Station which is on the direct train line from both airports and hence easy to access all parts of Tokyo . Also next to metro line. It is in the middle of office blocks We arrived in Golden week( 10 days of public holidays celebrating change of Emperors ) so the area was really quiet as no one was at work so it felt a bit weird. On the plus side the area didn’t have the massive crowds that were everywhere else The hotel was a bit tricky to find as GPS didn’t work underground. We actually went to the wrong hotel at first - The Park Royal which is just across the road On the negative there was not much around the hotel which was open at night.The hotel was fine and staff helpful and friendly. Our room was an OK size by Japanese standards ( we have stayed in tiny tiny rooms) Shower was above bath. Dinner in the lobby restaurant was truly awful - worst pizza I have ever had ) plus expensive.

Our room was spacious and the breakfast was really good, we especially enjoyed the Japanese breakfast options. We didn’t eat at the hotel, but had cocktails in the evening at the bar, which were really good, unusual cocktail options, which we really enjoyed. The cocktails were quite expensive – but it’s Tokyo, it is expensive!The location of the hotel was great, near to Shimbashi station, so easy to get out and about in the city. It’s also not far from Tsukiji fish market (highly recommended for a morning out and sushi lunch) and if you’re staying here and are looking for a nearby beer, I’d recommend the craft beer bar in Shimbashi station, or the Dry Dock bar nearby.We hope to return to Tokyo, and would definitely consider staying at the Park Hotel again.","Huddersfield, United Kingdom",15,5.0

The hotel rooms and hallways sorely need to be gutted and refurbished. The lady at reception was most apologetic about the room and said she would look into it. She ended up upgrading us to a much nicer room, but I still don’t feel that it was cleaned properly each day.

The check-in and arrival experience is all extremely proper and polite.The King Artist room was a reasonable size with a great view and all the facilities you'd expect. The only thing missing was an iron and ironing board in the room which when you ask for from housekeeping you will receive a miniature ironing board about 2 foot long with 6 inch legs that sits on the table (or on the floor) and is entirely impractical. Although entertaining to your other half as you sit on the floor attempting to iron 6 shirts.All rooms on the 31st floor - artist rooms - come with a free breakfast of pastries or toast in the gallery room which was really nice. And you can also pop in there to get a half decent coffee when you like too.I stayed in a regular room on the last night and it was interesting to compare, it is a little bit smaller, with slightly less room around the bed. It's also far less glamorous and looks a little more tired. I got the feeling that the artist rooms were a great excuse to give some old rooms a fresh lick of paint which these regular rooms are in need of. The shower in the regular room also left a lot to be desired and could do with a refurb.The only other real negatives for me was that I wanted to have a business meeting / chat with a customer I'd arranged to meet at my hotel and was told that to hire a meeting room would cost me 17500 yen per hour. This came as a shock when most hotels I've been in elsewhere will often find you a room for free, or at most £50 for a couple of hours. The receptionist really couldn't give a hoot when I said this seemed high. I guess that's just their rate they have to charge, maybe this is normal in Tokyo? The porter helpfully told me to just use one of the sofas and tables in the lobby which I did for free arriving 30 mins before my meeting to secure a good one!I was also surprised to find out on leaving the hotel that 3 coffees I'd bought in the lobby bar had cost me over 2700 yen. But again maybe this is normal for hotels, the receptionist seemed to surprised I cared.It left a bit of a negative impression on an otherwise perfectly good hotel. I'd probably come back just to stay and make sure I go elsewhere for anything else.","Yorkshire, United Kingdom",10,3.0

Upon looking at some of the photos of the rooms, my husband wanted the Mount Fuji room but it was booked. The person that was checking us in suggested that we take the Wabi Sabi room. She wasn't sure we would like it because it is dark. Well the room wasn't dark, but the painting was dark colors. As it turned out, it was perfect. It gave you the feeling of calm, especially with the snow falling outside. In the morning, we got a wonderful surprise, Mount Fuji in the distance. The artists rooms also come with a Gallery Room, which is available only to guests staying on this floor. So coffee, tea, juices during the day and in the morning a danish. It was relaxing to come to this Gallery Room to relax and recharge before heading out for the day. There are other art exhibits on other floors. All the staff was helpful and friendly.

The room is small, but that is standard for Japanese hotel rooms. Also, there usually isn't a lot of room for storage of luggage in Japanese hotel rooms and that goes for this one as well.

As opposed to the wonderful craziness of Shinjuku, this location is quiet and convenient -- which is a plus for me. The hotel itself is modern, and the staff very courteous and helpful. The hotel is known as the ""artists hotel"" so named because several rooms are uniquely and colorfully decorated by artists; this design feature also added to the attraction of the hotel. Although I did not have an artist room, I did have a great room (#3409) on the top floor with an entrancing city view, centered by the Tokyo Tower; in the daytime I was able to see Fuji-yama in the distance.

You can easily get there on the airport limousine bus. We used the underground walkway to go to Shimbashi station every day, the map provided by the hotel was very useful. There are 3 Family Mart convenience stores between Shimbashi station and the hotel. We didn’t use Shiodome station as Shimbashi has so many train lines. The foyer/atrium area of the hotel is beautiful with gorgeous artwork. However, I agree with previous reviewers that the hallways and rooms could do with updating. We requested and received Mt Fuiji and Tokyo Tower views, a spectacular view (same view from reception desk). There was a wide window seat to sit on to admire the view. Our city view room was a reasonable size for Tokyo. The bathroom was small, usual for Tokyo, with a shower curtain over a bath tub. Plenty of bathroom amenities provided (shampoo, conditioner, foldable hairbrush, cotton buds, shower cap and hair tie, toothbrushes, toothpaste, razor and so on). There was a small mini bar, kettle and tea/coffee provided but no milk. I bought milk from Family Mart. The beds are very comfortable: firm mattress with both a soft Western pillow and a firmer Japanese pillow (only one side of the Japanese pillow had beans so, if you don’t like the beans, you can just turn it over).There is a coin laundry on 26th floor but we didn’t use it. We also didn’t use the gym or Thann spa. I am coeliac and I find Japan a difficult place to find gluten free food. So I was pleased to see that the Western food at breakfast had allergy labels for a variety of allergies. It wasn’t the most extensive breakfast buffet but included eggs cooked in several ways, bacon, sausages, vegetables, salad, yoghurt, fruit, cereals, pastries and cold meats. The Japanese breakfast unfortunately didn’t include allergy labels (except for the miso soup) and I would suggest that the hotel provides these in future. We ate dinner in the hotel once. Again not an extensive menu but there were 2 types of gluten free pasta. For non coeliacs, there were Western and Japanese options for dinner. The staff were all very professional and helpful, they are an asset to the hotel. We had a couple questions and they were promptly and thoroughly answered. I speak Japanese so had no language problems. We travelled with friends who don’t speak Japanese and they said that the staff spoke excellent English.I would recommend this hotel for its excellent service and location.

Breakfast buffet was good, ambience is great, quiet jazz in a beautiful enclosed atrium with extensive art collection. Service level is outstanding. People know english and are exceedingly polite and helpful. On the food side, it was the tale of two extremes. Very good and poorly executed. Overall selection was excellent. Warm, cold, American, European, Japanese and other selections all of high quality except somethings were not fully cooked. Specifically the first day the chicken sausage was atone cold. After pointing this out to the chef, he was very apologetic and thoroughly cooked the saunas again and brought it to our table. The next couple days he brought me well cooked sausage (this was a buffet). So they handled the issue well for me. Though not sure if temp was properly maintained. Other issue was the scrambled eggs: if 0= raw and 10 = well done, they were a 0.5 every morning. Disgusting. Luckily they had delicious well cooked frittatas and hard boiled eggs, so we were ok. But just looking at a huge tray of mushy eggs was revoltingly. Having said that, everything else was excellent including the wide selection and quality. The hotel is beautiful in every way except the hallway carpeting. Clearly the room carpet had been replaced, the flooring is very nice everywhere except beyond the elevator foyer on the room floor levels. After the beautiful wood floor outside the elevators, the carpeting is very very old and stained.

This is because there are very few crossings on ground level which means you have to walk up the stairs to cross the road via the pedestrian bypasses in order to get to the entrance of the main building entrance on level 1/ground level.The hotel is located right next to Shiodome station (Oedo and Yurikamome lines), but is also a short 5 minute walk away from the main Shimbashi station which has access to JR, Ginza, Asakusa and Yurikamome lines.

Hotel was in a great location just 2 minutes from the nearest subway station and only a 10 minute walk to major subway and JR station at Shimbashi. Staying on the 32nd floor with a wonderful view across the city for 5 nights and on our last night we moved one floor to an artists room on the 31st floor. Due to length of stay we received 1 free breakfast coupon which I used. To be honest as in most places on our trip this was one thing we would not recommend. To my mind heavily overpriced (if paying) to sit in a vast space which is the bottom of the atrium and the choices were okay but not very exciting. Far better to walk a few minutes to a local cafe or similar - in our case we went to the Excelsior Cafe every day just across the first walkway outside at 3rd floor exit. The rooms were spacious and the beds comfortable with amazing views - and we were lucky enough on our last morning that the weather particularly good and off in the distance we could see Mount Fuji. The artist room was interesting but not sure would pay the extra for more than one night although as a resident on that floor had access to a small lounge there where free wine and hot drinks throughout the day. They also serve pastries there free in morning but the night we stayed our departure from Tokyo was earlier than time this started.Staff on reception level all very good welcoming and helpful at all times.

We are both retired and have been to Tokyo a number of times . Thought this hotel was good value , make sure you use the various price comparison sites as big variation in prices ( surprisingly I found the hotels own site was the cheapest).We stayed in a city queen room . You can pay extra for the 'artist' queen room . Might be ok for a couple of nights , but only same size as non artist room so we didn't think it worth all the extra money for two week stay. We found the room size adequate , wardrobe quite big so after putting most of our stuff in wardrobe , just put our cases in corner by window and quite happy with amount of space . We could see Hamarikyu Gardens from window . Only ten minutes away so make it one of your first visits . Beautiful park.Takes a little while to orientate yourself to the area . We used our first morning doing that, couple of hours checking out Shimbashi area.We mostly used Shiodome station . My tip for finding hotel when arriving at Shiodome station is .. follow signs that have 'exit 7-10' on . (or 7-8) .After couple of minutes and a couple of escalators later you will see a large raised flower bed .Keep to right and take diagonal across to door with Park Hotel sign on ( just ask if you get lost , everyone very helpful)Before going it is well worth getting a Pasmo card , it's like the London Oyster card , makes things so much easier .I think you can prepay for one before your holiday otherwise you can get one at airport station .Re getting around , we are a couple of pensioners yet have found it very easy because we use HyperDia , just put in departure station , arrival station and it comes up with all the info you need ( what platform , where to change etc The hotel has a loyalty scheme . Worth joining as there are a couple of freebies depending on your length of stay . We got 4 complimentary breakfasts . You also get English language paper pushed under door every day .To join loyalty scheme go to the FAQ page on hotel website, scroll down to Amenities and Services then click the link .The breakfast is good but about £20 .Also it is served in the large atrium that the rooms are built around . You are surrounded by art but we found it a bit too formal and quiet ,like having breakfast in a cathedral . If you just want something cheap and a bit noisier then there is a Tullys nearby , about a fiver for breakfast set .(Lift to 3rd floor then turn right through corridor with lots of local art in , turn right at exit , Tullys is by station entrance .)Just one more thing re food , if you are vegetarian/vegan then there is an excellent restaurant nearby called Chaya . When you come out of 3rd floor exit you will see the famous Ghibli clock on your left . Go down stairs next to it , you will see Rose and Crown pub (overpriced , seek out one of the Hub bars nearby in Shimbashi)Opposite pub in right hand corner is Chaya restaurant.We will stay at Park Hotel again .","St Helens, United Kingdom",38,5.0

If possible, book an ""artist room,"" on special floors where each room has been decorated by a different artist with a different theme. Those floors have a lounge where a continental breakfast is available, and coffee, juice and other beverages are on hand throughout the day.

The room was large and very comfortable. The bed was a large King Size, and the room also had a sofa and armchair, as well as desk/dressing table and roomy wardrobe. The artist’s paintings on the Washi paper on the walls were very beautiful and a great introduction to Japanese painting. We loved it!The Artists Floor has its own Concierge, and a small lounge with free drinks available (not open 24 hours a day though).The room was clean and very quiet, with great views towards the Tokyo Tower, and the bathroom was spotless with plenty of toiletries.On arrival, it wasn’t really very clear where to go – the hotel occupies floors 25 to 34 of the Shiodome Media Tower, and so we knew reception was on the 25th floor, but there were no big signs pointing you towards the lifts when you stepped out of a taxi at ground level. We did find them though, and later learnt that you took one of these lifts to get to the underground level that led to Shimbashi station (oh, what a warren that underground area is ... be warned!!!). The staff on Reception were helpful, though check-in took quite a long time, and were great in assisting us organise our luggage transfer to our next destination. The Concierge girls were particularly helpful when we finally left with all our luggage to catch our return flight.Breakfast was buffet style, and good, with plenty of choice of Western or Japanese food.We ate in their Hanasanshou (Japanese) restaurant on our first and last nights in Japan. We had a sushi platter and mixed tempura both times. The first night it was very good and the service prompt, but unfortunately our second visit wasn’t as good – the service was slow and our waitress seemed not to be at all engaged in serving us, and the food itself also suffered as the tempura certainly wasn’t as hot as it should have been. We did mention our disappointment to a manager, but no compensation was offered.Other evenings, we ate in the basement level of the next-door Caretta Shiodome, finding some interesting and inexpensive places to eat, and quite often being the only non-Japanese in the restaurant (which we were very happy about!).All in all, with its location near Shimbashi station, and the lovely room that we had, we would heartily recommend staying at the Park Hotel in Tokyo.","Richmond, Surrey",78,5.0

You either have to ask for one or use the one in the laundry room. We had drinks in the bar on a few occasions. This wasn’t cheap but it felt posh and had an amazing view by the window, so worth it for a treat. The hotel is a little hard to find from the station as it is in a new complex in an area which is a maze of underpasses, steps, different levels etc. This is quite a businessey, corporate area of Japan.

It’s also near the Shimbashi station (on JR line) and a couple of different subway stations, all of which are reachable by underground passages—pretty nice when it’s raining. The bar at the hotel was very nice, with great views and great cocktails. We ate one dinner at the Japanese restaurant at the hotel, Hanasanshou, only because there was a typhoon that night.

My mom was happy with it and she can be hard to please because she is so use to North American hotel room standards. We liked the view too. We could see Tokyo Tower from it. We felt safe and it was a home to come back to at the end of the day. We made the right choice to stay here. There were many subway lines underneath the Shiodome Media Tower so we could easily get to any site. There were plenty of eateries too. This included Family Marts and a 7-11. There is also a post office nearby. Staff was always friendly and they dealt with our needs and concerns. It was too bad that we didn't get a chance to enjoy a drink at the lounge. Lastly, if you have luggage or will travel with an aging parent, take a taxi from Tokyo Station after you get off the Narita Express.

While searching for hotels my top priorities were on that was closed to my meetings in Toyosu, a reasonable sized room, free WiFi, proximity to a Narita Express stop, Tsukiji fish market and dive restaurants/bars, a lovely view of the city and supports the needs of foreigners for our 6 night stay. Yes, that was a laundry list. I did find all that in the Park Hotel Tokyo.Arrival via taxi was typical. No doorman at the ground level which was fine for this price level of hotel. There are 3 standard hotel size elevators which take you to the 25th floor for check-in. Although only one takes you to B2 to access the underground passage way to the Shiodome stations (Oedo line & Yurikamome) Shimbashi station, and the Tokyo Shiodome Building which houses the global headquarters of Softbank as well as some good western style breakfast café options. If you prefer to walk outdoors, take the elevator to level 3 for the elevated walkway for access to the same. By the way, being situated near the start of the Yurikamome line gives you a good chance of getting one of the 3 seats out the front of the train giving you wonderful views of the Rainbow Bridge, Odaiba and the 2020 Olympic village under construction. Check-in was smooth and a friendly staff member helped take our bags as he directed us to our room. We were welcomed to a clean well-prepared Tokyo Tower view room with a something little extra which I had requested for my spouse. The room’s A/C unit was struggling a bit the first day under what I was told record 37C temperature / 43C heat index. (My colleague from Tampa, FL mentioned it was hotter than home.) Although it regained control as the outside temperature returned to summer norms over the next few days. The window seat bench and the accompanying seat cushion is a nice touch although you may not sit for long if you are afraid of heights. There is enough room between the desk/vanity and the drapes to fit our 30” Samsonite suitcase. There is a modest size closet with in-room safe. The queen size bed is a bit on the firmer side. The sound insulation was generally very good. I never heard my neighbors, guests in the hallways or water flowing through the pipes, although you can hear the muffle of the trains to/from the Shimbashi station. Perhaps because our room is west facing, the winds from Typhoon Jongdari (38mph sustained / 50mph gusts as measured at nearby Haneda) were not perceptible from our room other than the calming noise of a few raindrops hitting the window and what sounded like a metal window sash. A local friend of ours helped pick up a local SIM card at a store on the other side of the Shimbashi station where there are many dive bars and restaurants available. There are a few Irish pubs in the neighborhood. The hotel offers a nice brochure of the best restaurants in the area for the various types of Japanese cuisine, Ramen, Teppenyaki (think Benihana but better food quality and typically 2x the cost), Izakaya, and Sushi.The English fluent front desk is staffed 24 hours a day which suffering from jet lag was welcome as I found myself working most effectively in the very early morning hours from the business center situated right next to the check-in desk. I spent several hours over the six days and found the two desks very comfortable with extra plugs for your laptop. I was able to fit my 2 laptops comfortably on the desk even with the large iMac present on each desk. Most of the plugs in the hotel & all plugs in the room are the US style 2-prong. I found only one US 3-prong electrical outlet in the business center. I recommend bringing an adapter if you plan on using a device with a 3-prong plug just in case. The desk chairs are really comfortable and the lower lumbar cushion is a very nice feature on the chairs. I wish I had the same chair at my desk in the office.The 2 coin operated laundry machines were a bonus. While the modes are limited, I threw in some t-shirts, undershirts and our undies even mixing (gasp) colors with whites without issue. I went with the 1.5kg wash mode which includes laundry detergent and a damp dry mode. This was good experience marred only by finding the front loading washer a bit dirty and I had to clean some left over junk from inside of the tub. The damp dry mode is fine. I hung our clothes using the over bathtub clothes line and the hangers in the closet. After about 4 hours in our air conditioned room my clothes were dry and my cotton undershirts were just as soft as if I had thrown a sheet of fabric softener with them in the dryer at home. Clothes that I laid flat on the bed or on the chair did not fare as well. Check-out was smooth and the front desk staff was kind enough to ask where we were headed next and prepared a card in Japanese for me to present to the Taxi driver. We had a great stay and I look forward to my next visit. I'll try the on premises restaurants next time.","San Jose, California",48,5.0

The room was clean with a great view and there is also a cushioned window sill so you can sit and admire the skyline from your room! Our room was fairly small so having big cases provided a challenge. There is a room safe but bizarely, this was sat on top of a very small shoe rack which was not attached to the wall or floor so could be physically picked up and moved........There are a number of restaurants in the hotel (which closed at 21.00) but we did not eat here, instead we ventured out to Shimibashi which is a 10 minute walk from the hotel main lobby. This is a vibrant and bustling area full of street bars, noodle shops and eateries crammed with locals. A bowl of ramen plus a beer for 2 people cost around 2,800 yen which is very cheap and thoroughly recommended if you want to attempt some sort of authentice Japanese eating experience.

On my lengthy 23 day trip to Tokyo I saved this experience to the very end. Traveling solo I did not need a king sized bed so I opted for a queen size bed/room. I got the Cherry Blossom Room on the 31st floor! I love art and really appreciated the theme and this artists unique take on cherry blossoms. Nothing says transformation more than a butterfly!!! For this particular room, the westerly facing view was spectacular. Room had a partial view of the Tokyo Tower. At night, the view was even more amazing. Room had a window bench which was awesome!!! I must have sat and view the night sky for a few hours while enjoying some hot green tea. I found the room accommodations to be excellent for this class of hotel. The staff at the hotel were very kind and helpful even with my broken Japanese. Many people did speak enough English so we were able to communicate. The staff also made sure, with an envelop under my door, to note extra amenities that were occurring during my stay. This extra note, blew my mind, I mean this little extra touch was unexpected and raised my experience to a whole new level. The hotel did not want me to miss out on any part of what their hotel had to offer. As a result, I made every effort to experience every offering! I was lucky enough to stay during a open art gallery exhibit at the hotel which also enhanced my stay. I mean having a free art gallery in the same hotel was so incredible. I love art so this was super fun. I dined in 3 of the 5 restaurants and each had their own style and service. The ""kaiseki"" or traditional Japanese multi-course meal was the better meal I had at the hotel. Although, I also loved the Asian style buffet which offered Chinese style dumplings which I am a big fan. All the food was fresh enough which was expected for Japan and any hotel of this 4 star caliber. Don't hesitate to ask for the best food experience or recommendations. I did have better food on my trip outside of this hotel but that is not to say the food was terrible. I am just saying it was good just not over the top mind blowing. I did walk away from all of my dining experiences full and satisfied just not mind blown, I hope this makes sense.

Well located by two metro stations (Shiodome and Shimbashi) which is important for getting around. The area has some reasonable restaurants nearby plus the usual family marts useful for those essentials when travelling. The breakfast was mostly western focused buffet style some nice pastries but coffee was filter out of a jug. Service was ok at the front desk and they organised taxis, restaurant reservations and the onward delivery of our luggage rather than taking it on the bullet train very efficiently. Rooms are a reasonable size with a large comfortable bed. The Wi-fi can be very variable in Tokyo so a good tip is to hire a portable Wi-fi router from Japan wireless. They deliver it to your hotel and bingo, permanent Wi-fi as you travel around Tokyo. We’ve rented it for our whole 2 week trip. ",UK,49,4.0

Paid for the Tokyo Tower view which I would recommend. The service from time of arrival to time of departure was great and staff made me feel welcomed. Views from the room was nice and relaxing. The location was great as it offered many options, multiple subway stations and walking distance to several sights like Ginza district. As previous TA posts suggested head for Exit 7 in the underground for the Subway for the Hotel exit. In the underground (Basement), there is a convenience store and easy access to the multiple subway stations. If you take the Pedestrian bridge (Floor 3 on Elevator) across the street, there is a few restaurants, Starbucks and Tulley's Coffee and English Pub as alternative to hotel restaurant. The hotel breakfast buffet would be my one negative comment, it was just ok, the offerings was minimum compared to other hotels I've stayed. Other recommendations would be to try the coffe shops, bars and restaurants near the train station along the track bridge which is about 5 minute walk. Arriving from NRT airport, took the Narita Express train to Tokyo Central, then took taxi to hotel, which cost about 170 JPY. Overall enjoyed the stay at this hotel and would recommend to others traveling to Tokyo.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",282,5.0

The hotel is on the Shiodome station of the Yurikamome line, and a short walk to the Shimbashi station of the Tokyo subway system and the JR Yamanote loop line.We got excellent assistance from the hotel concierge on several occasions. They were helpful booking restaurant tables for us (strongly adviced if you are a larger group like we were). Our 17 year old daughter injured her knee on the trip to Japan, and the concierge went out of their way lending us crutches and phoning ahead to find out if our next hotel in Osaka would have crutches. When this hotel didn’t they continued to make phonecalls to try and find crutches for sale in Tokyo. After about 20 phonecalls and a lot of internet searching they concluded that a doctor’s appointment was needed to buy crutches. Our travel insurance also suggested a visit to a doctor. Concierge was again very understanding and helpful and booked an appointment for us with an knee orthopaedic specialist. They also arranged for us to keep our room 3 extra hours on checkout day so we could stay in her room until the doctor’s appointment in the afternoon.Park hotel Tokyo was the perfect place to stay to see as much of Tokyo as possible in 3 days. We walked to the fish market, to Ginza and to the Hamarikyu garden, and had easy access to areas like Harajuju, Akihabara, Odaiba and Ueno by way of the monorail, subway and Yamanote.

We were looking for one that was close to shopping areas, near Haneda Airport, and walking ease from hotel to other areas.This hotel's lobby is on the 25th floor. We used coordinated transportation from the cruise port to the hotel Cost was 16,000yen. We had a private car to carry 4 large suite cases. Many taxis are not capable of handling this amount of luggage. This pricing from the hotel was reasonable. I check other sources, and having this booked to the room was easy so there was no monies exchanges. All charged to my credit card.......more points for me :):)Personnel was awaiting our arrival to the hotel and coordinate our luggage to the check in floor. Personnel were extremely friendly and spoke very good English. We were checking into the 30th floor - we reserved a Queen bed room with city view. Best decision made. At night with the lights out in the room, we could view the lights of the city with a glass of wine in our hands.The rooms are small. Just enough room to place on the floor 2 large suit cases. More or less the same size of a balcony cabin on a cruise ship. Bathroom has a very deep tub. Great water pressure and plenty of hot water. There is no shower spout. there is a hand held shower unit that hangs. Only item I found not favorable. The toilet has a warming unit plus other items to wash one self . Plenty of amenities plus extra razor, brush, tooth brush / paste, Room has a Frig and safe. Plus coffee / tea supplies. The hotel is walking distance to the luxury shopping area. In the basement you can get subway transportation to all areas in Tokyo. We took the train to the Asakusa area. Was 200 yen per person each way. Took 15 minutes. In addition there are eating areas approx 300 feet from the hotel exit door. Note many places do not open until 7:00 or till 7:30am in morning. Places open later on weekends. So coffee not available until 7:30am........including Big Mac. There are Family Stores for general items needed in case you forgot something plus other places for limited shopping.The hotel does have a western breakfast. Cost is around 2300 yen........while a breakfast Mac meal goes for 600-800yen.......Internet was great in the hotel.........no trouble using.We coordinate with the hotel for air port shuttle to Haneda - cost for 2 around 1800 yen. This was on a normal touring bus. Allow 4 hours from hotel - pick ups, etc, and getting to international terminal. Bus hits 2 other places prior to this terminal. We allowed 3 hrs and were lucky in checking in and by passed a long waiting line. We had just 45 minutes to get a small meal and a drink. If we had to wait in the long line we would have just made the plane.........Traffic to the airport can get very heavy so allow more time then expected...........Most taxi drivers do not speak English. Or very limited. So have printed data on where you want to go........We did find it interesting that there is no trash cans. You are expected to take your own trash with you for disposal.

The Park Hotel has larger rooms available. Instead of booking their standard room, I suggest moving up a notch to their deluxe rooms. They are larger and though a little more expensive, worth the extra money. If you look on the hotel's website, I think they tell you how big the rooms are.They have a Japanese restaurant, Hanasanshou. It's small so you might want to make a reservation.

I read many of the review and agree with most. It is an exceptional hotel for what you pay. But when people rate it 5 Stars, do not expect the same elegance you would get at a Four Seasons or other hotel whose name alone is sufficient to deserve a 5 Star rating. But at the Park, you can expect 5 Star service. Everyone was friendly, helpful, considerate, and did their best to accommodate us. The concierges were great. Most of the staff knew English and we always felt very comfortable. The Park is a really a wonderful compromise between the very pricy hotels and the very inexpensive ones.

When in the room, I want it to be comfortable. If you are not looking for the world, you should be, as we were, very happy when you choose the Park Hotel.

On our previous trips, we have stayed in Akihabara (my husband is a shameless tech nut, so loooooves the Electric Town), Kanda (for its proximity to Akihabara) and Shinjuku. On our most recent trip, we decided to stay in Ginza, and found a great combination airfare/hotel stay at the Park Hotel Tokyo. We thoroughly enjoyed our 13-night stay, and would definitely return to the hotel.  Room: We stayed in what I'm guessing was the cheapest of the rooms at the hotel. Billed simply as ""Room"" on Expedia, it had a queen bed, a soaking tub, a decent-sized cupboard, and a huge picture window with a window seat. We were on the 32nd floor, and looked over the surrounding buildings and a park, which, even in February, was filled with gorgeous flowers and a few early cherry and plum blossoms. Having stayed in a number of small rooms in Tokyo in the past, I was very pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. It didn't feel cramped or crowded, even with two tall adults, lots of shopping and a plethora of winter coats/hats/scarves etc hanging around. The room was also really quiet, which I appreciated in such a busy city. Location: The hotel was so handy for getting to Ginza on foot -- it was a 5-10 minute walk right into the centre of the shopping district. Shimbashi Station (which is filled with, and surrounded by lots of very reasonable little restaurants serving some seriously tasty food) was also really close, and easy to access via the underground passage between the station and the hotel -- that passage was a BIG plus on the colder nights of our stay.

If you are a business person and have to work in the neighbourhood then this hotel may be ok. In my opinion for a tourist it is not a good option. My first room had a view of a rail yard, my second room had a good view.The Not So Good: The hotel is in the middle of a massive office complex with a ring of highway, rail, subway and monorail. To get around by foot you have to use a complex network of overpasses. It is impossible to easily walk around the area or figure out where you are. The signage to the hotel is poor. My first room was noisy from the trains, and I was on the 32nd floor. I asked to be moved which the front desk did without question. The second room was much quieter. The hall carpet was stained in many areas. The room was basic, furnished much like a generic Hilton or Hampton Inn. A small 21' TV rounded out the room (the remote did not work). The bathroom was clean and the shower consisted of a very basic hand held facet in an old fashion bathtub, The shower head was tiny, similar to what you would find in the clearance bin at Home Depot.Location: As I said for connections to HND it is good but you are a very limited, there are no restaurants or other retail, other than a Family Mart. The restaurants in the office complex were closed in the evening. There are restaurants in the hotel and nearby hotels but they tend to be costly.

But it's also right on top of the Shiodome station, which sits on the Oedo line that and provides very quick access to the many attractions in Roppongi, Shibuya, etc. Family Mart in the same building, and just adjacent to a McDonalds and Taco Bell if you need fast food.View/rooms - To die for. I'll never forget falling asleep to a gorgeous, night lit Tokyo, and waking up to a sea of buildings bathed in golden sunrise and a great view of Mount Fuji. I only wished I spent more time in the room. Room was scrupulously clean, and I'm a clean freak.Service - Faultless. Despite the sheer volume of guests, you feel like you're getting one-to-one service.

Unfortunately it is likely the hotel guest services are set up with a ""robotic"" response which I assume their new Japanese ""hospitality technology"" as I kept receiving the same response from different names despite what I have tried to explain my needs. Even worse than ever I have seen in my traveling life, I requested the hotel a baby cot for my 23 months old, the first response they told the cot sizes that the hotel can accommodate and asked for my baby age, the second email another robot came in and said the cot is not able to accommodate my 23 months old, so that I should share the bed with her because they won't hold any responsibility for any problem could happen???

The location is fine - very close to Shimbashi railway station, and an easy underground connection to the Shiodome subway (no need to go outdoors). A short subway ride from Haneda, as well as a longer (but no changes required) subway ride to Narita. The rooms are on the small size (but that's to be expected in Japan). The furnishings were in good shape, the bed comfortable, the bathroom entirely adequate. $300 per night seemed excessive given that they then charged another 2800 yen for breakfast, and the buffet selection was modest (I have had better, for less, at several other Japanese hotels). I had wanted to get a breakfast-included rate, but none was available. Some guests seem to have been provided with breakfast vouchers but I don't know where they came from. The front desk staff is very nice and helpful, and their English is very good. Dining area staff at breakfast are OK (again, I've experienced better elsewhere).The odor problem that I experienced (same as reviewer Linzerbain) as far as I could tell came from the bathroom amenities provided. The brand name on all of them is ""Aromatherapy"", and they all have a scent similar to the sort of essential oils used in the practice of aroma therapy. In particular the scent seemed similar to ylang-ylang. Given that all the bath amenities are scented with this, it's not hard to imagine that over time the whole room has gotten permeated with the scent. I don't mind the scent when used occasionally, but having to breathe it continuously meant that after a while I felt somewhat queasy. Thereafter, as long as I was in the room, I felt unwell to queasy. By the third night, it was very unpleasant. Personally, I would book elsewhere.

Check in was easy and welcoming. Our room was on the 32nd floor and as soon as you got in you could immediatley smell a musty odour, almost a slightly sour body odour. I put this down to dampness as the weather was particularly humid. A de-oderizing spray left in the room helped and we thought that it would go away (more later).The room size itself was slightly smaller than expected though OK for the 3 days we were here. We had a Tokyo Tower view room and it was simply amazing at night. All amenities were available and the room itself, although slightly tired was clean and comfortable. As we were jet lagged and went straight to bed after dinner we woke to find the room still had the musty smell. After breakfast we complained and told that it would be sorted out by the time we came back. A full day in Tokyo beckoned.Breakfast itself was not cheap but was well prepared and plenty of it. The selection was a bit on the small side with both Japanese and Western styles catered for.Coming back to our room late at night we still noticed the body odour smell (night No2 of our stay. Another spray of the room helped alleviate the problem, but left a sour taste in our mouths (if you pardon the pun).Another plus point.... we asked the concierge to book us a table for a restaurant we wanted to visit and they sent us an e mail to confirm our reservation while we were out at the Sumo Wrestling. Great service Park Hotel !! Day 3 and the problem with the smell in our room still had not been resolved. Although not a ""show stopper"", this put a real negative aspect to our stay here.Wi-fi was good and the staff very helpful in making sure we got the right bus to our next destination. If it wasn't for the smell in our room I would have given this hotel 5 stars.Travel tip - buy a Suica card and use it for contactless payments on the transportation system. Just top it up as you need. It will save you buying a ticket for every trip.","Falkirk, United Kingdom",102,3.0

The reason why I chose this hotel is because of the location and the artistic come-on. First, location is just 20 mins from Haneda Airport. You can take the train from Haneda airport to Shimbashi via the Keikyo Airport Line. It costs around 570 JPY. Then you can walk to the hotel within 10 mins. You can also take the monorail from Haneda and alight at Hamamatsucho Station then take a taxi to the hotel. It will cost around 1400 JPY in total. On a daily basis, the train station is just 7 mins away by foot. Its very easy access to Yamamoto line. Around the hotel premises are shops and restaurants, family mart and plenty of spaces to lounge around i open air. The hotel is not easily visible so if you take a cab, you have to look well on the street as the hotel is actually in a building up on the 25th floor inside an office building. 2nd, for the rooms, I loved the fact that the rooms are design with wall art, Not all rooms but the art rooms are really a feast. Although we didn't get the room that we really like, the paintings on the wall offer a difference in the usual hotel stays. Staying in these privileged rooms allow one to have breakfast and refreshments in the lounge for free. IN the lobby, there are several art pieces on exhibit and for sale as well. Its truly a feast for the eyes. The Tokyo tower is just out there when you look through the window.

The rooms are a little outdated however, and could do with a new touch of paint, some dark patches on the ceilings and the bathrooms.Pros: nice hotel, good staff, few mins walk from shimbashi station which will get you to where u want to go, and a few mins walk from GinzaCons: a little outdated on the rooms, could do with a bit of sprucing up, breakfast is expensive for what it is, although convenient","London, United Kingdom",73,4.0

As soon as you arrive in the lobby (25th floor of the building) you can already have a taste of what awaits in your rooms, a great view of Tokyo, featuring the Tokyo Tower. ( you should book a room with a view of the Tower, the other sides of the building are not that great, as you will be pretty close to other towers).We asked a room at the highest floor possible, we receive it: 34th floor and it was a treat seeing Tokyo by night and day.(+ good; +/- in between ; - bad)+ : excellent room, with everything one may need, although a little bit disappointing in comparison with other 4 star hotels I've been in Japan. But if you look at the price and location, it's still good value + : location, location, location. the hotel it's located very close to some of the major metro/train lines in Tokyo, you will get anywhere very quickly. Also, pretty close to the fish market or Ginza. If you want to eat, I recommend going to the neighborhood next to Shimbashi station, you'll have a hard time deciding where to eat, the choice is overwhelming. + : the usual Japanese check-in, quick, professional, they take the bags into the room, etc+ : the staff is very helpful, they will help you with everything you need. also, very good English spoken by most of the staff.+/- : the breakfast is OK but largely overpriced for what it is at ~2800 yen/person.

The view of Tokyo tower is amazing but found the location to be a bit too quiet. We'd stayed in Shibuya and Shinjuku before and both these areas are much more exciting if that's what you want. The Shiodome station is below the hotel and you can get a train easily over to Odaiba (this was very busy). This line is not covered by a JR pass though and you need to walk to Shimbashi station to use the Yamamote line. This isn't far and is still convenient.The hotel does have an art theme and there's interesting work around. The room itself was a bit tired; the bathroom was basic and not like others we had during our trip. Complementary bottled water was not provided and we'd got used to that in other hotels we paid much less for. Coffee was not always replenished in rooms either. We were a bit disappointed as we'd paid much more to stay here than he had in our other hotels and we didn't get the 'wow' factor other than the view. We thought breakfast was pricey so we opted to use the Family Mart in the basement of the hotel. The NewsArt Cafe was closed the whole time we were there. The hotel is within media buildings and we saw lots of filming going on. The Studio Ghibli clock was also good to see. Overall it was an ok sort of stay.

In both stations, you can also take the Yurikamone line to Odaiba Island.I liked the location because is very well communicated (only 2 stops from Tokyo station if yo come by train, and 1 stop away from the Monorail to Haneda Airport).Additionally, it's quiet because it's in the heart of the financial district, but only a 10-15 minute walk to Ginza, a very popular neighbourhood.The rooms are quute big compared to Japanese standards.The only thing I would improve is breakfast. It's quite expensive (2.800Y/person/day) and it hasn't a ""wow effect"". It's first quality food, but the variety is scarce.Conveniently, you have some cafeterias and supermarkets nearby, so it's easy to have a breakfast. But I was surprised by the price. We tried it the last day just to see, thinking that it should be amazing since the price, and we were quite dissapointed.

Our room however was tired but perfectly comfortable. We opted for a corner room to get more space (as Tokyo rooms can be tiny) and we had plenty of room to unpack and still have space to wander. Breakfasts are varied and good, both Western and Japanese. Dinner one night was expensive but not fantastic.

It was a really great experience. The hotel is on the upper floors (25-~34) of a new tower in the Shiodome/Shimbashi area. Views from all rooms are fantastic as can be imagined.We'd arrived very early for our check in and rooms were not ready but we were made very welcome and we were able to find a couple of things to do locally until lunchtime when our rooms were free. Rooms themselves are quite small by European standards but nicely decorated and very clean. In common with other places we visited there is not a lot of closet hanging space or drawers. Perhaps , Japanese torists prefer to live out of suitcases on holiday? The staff were really excellent. Pleasant, well informed and polite of course but also not too formal. It made for a very relaxing stay. The breakfast buffet was the best of all of our Japanese hotels. The concierge was also very good, organising a private tour by metro for us on the first day (something I'd recommend as a good way to gain some orientation on the metro) and advice throughout. The hotel is also connected via an underground labyrinth to 2 subway stations (Shiodome, Shimbashi) so it's easy to get pretty much anywhere direct from the hotel. Haneda airport is also just a 20 minute taxi journey away.Highly recommended.","Great Missenden, United Kingdom",149,5.0

Its logo of three skinny coloured flags helps you find the right one. It is a four star establishment, an easy walk from Shinbashi Station, in the south-east area of the city. A difficulty for tourists in much of central Tokyo, including this site, is that they use multiple levels for walkways, shops, restaurants, etc, and what you need might be three floors up or down six flights of escalators. The Park Hotel is no exception, and it was three days before we were reasonably confident of finding one of the front doors after an outing.The actual Reception and dining room are on the 25th floor and the guest bedrooms above that. We had no idea what went on in floors 1 - 24 or the various levels of basement. However, the place is clean (after all, this is Japan) and bright, with bedrooms and bathrooms of a pretty good size for this country. The bed was comfortable, and everything worked well in the rooms. However, as first time visitors to Japan we were taken by surprise by the heated loo seats and hygienic washing mechanism. Supplies of toiletries, hot drink ingredients (including good filter coffee), and useful items like toothbrushes razors and hairbrushes, slippers and kimonos were excellent, although they had no soap, only washing gel.The staff were all efficient and very friendly, but we found the constant Japanese bowing a bit disconcerting until we got used to it.

The only negative about the hotel is that it is a bit hard to find and a bit farther from Shimbashi station than I thought. If you are staying there and plan to walk from Shimbashi, go to the hotel website under Location and download and print the Walking Map. Using the underground passage, you go down an escalator and then walk for awhile. Then you go down another escalator which looks like you are going into a subway station. Soon you come up an escalator to see a flower bed. The hotel is just a bit beyond that through some doors at the right. Once we got the hang of getting to and from the station, it was easy.

The hotel rooms are clean and a good size. Staff was helpful, courteous and most spoke English. Complimentary coffee and tea was provided. Bottled water was not available (mentioned by another reviewer). They also asked us to pay for our rooms half way thru our stay (as mentioned by another reviewer) due to our ""long stay"". They give you to option of paying in JY or USD. For me paying in JY provided a better exchange rate. My only complaint was the limited number of outlets for all of our electronic devices.The views from the hotel lobby and our rooms was fantastic. Great view of Tokyo Tower every day. Even got to see Mt. Fuji one morning. We were on the 28th floor, but I suspect every room in hotel has great city views. The location of the hotel was great for exploring Tokyo. Located above the Shiodome subway station and a 15 minute walk to the Shimbashi station (via the underground mall, on B2 or elevated walkway on the 3rd floor). Being so close to transit was a welcomed relief at the end of a long day of sightseeing. The hotel lobby is just an elevator ride from the subway and a 15 minute walk from Shimbashi via a well lit mall that was still active late at night (so you felt safe). Ginza and the Tsukiji Fish Market are also a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel. We did not eat at the daily breakfast buffett. We hit the Family Mart (multiple locations in the underground mall below the hotel) and stocked up on snacks to eat while sightseeing before a sit down meal for lunch. There are multiple restaurants (20+) in the mall with different price points. On our last day we ate at Marugame Seimen in the Caretta building after checking out of the hotel. They serve tempura and udon cafeteria style and cater mostly to business people. Fortunately, they have an English menu - just ask. . Service is fast. Starbucks, McDonalds. and 711 stores are common in the Caretta building.Narita Airport Limo Bus will pick you up from the hotel and take you to the airport from the first floor of the Shiodome Media Tower (name of building hotel is located in).

Great 4* hotel, I would definitely stay again and recommend to others.Positives:- Did I mention the view? The hotel lobby starts on the 25th floor, so all rooms would be guaranteed some kind of view. We paid extra for a corner room (Sky Tower view), on the 29th floor and were not disappointed! Almost floor to ceiling, panoramic views looking towards Mount Fuji, from the bed! Incredible.- Comfortable and fairly spacious room, with huge bed. - Good bathroom, toiletries etc.- Very quiet, we slept very well every night.- Despite arriving early, we were able to check-in at 10:00, some 5 hours before official check-in (which was handy due to some serious jet-lag).- Location, fairly quiet, commercial type of area with lots of nearby offices, but very handy for public transport, being right on 2 subway and 1 railway lines. If you don't mind a bit of a walk, you can easily wander up the main '5th Avenue' style shopping streets which we did several times - on your way to 'Tokyo' main station. Also you are very near to the fish market - a must when visiting Tokyo.- The staff were great and couldn't do enough for us, with plenty of available advice on how to get to places.- Prices around the hotel (e.g. the minibar) were fairly sensible.- There is a convenience store in the basement of the building where you can stock up on snacks, if required.Negatives (TBH, not many):- The communal areas of the hotel were fairly small, with not much choice of dining options.- The restaurant closed fairly early (by UK standards, anyway). On a particular Saturday night, after 21:30 there was only room service food available to eat in the bar. On the night when we did get to the restaurant early, the service felt very rushed as they hurried to clear everyone out. - Being that the area was very commercial, at the weekend, it felt very quiet and again, nearby restaurants were closed early.Summary:As long as you are not expecting a 5* hotel (although this came very close, in my opinion) and are not scared of heights - then this could be the ideal resting place for you! Just plan your day to make sure that you either eat out or have plenty of time left in the evening to have your evening meal at the hotel. Getting to all the attractions that Tokyo has to offer was easy by using the nearby subway and train links. Tips:- A taxi from Haneda airport came in at around $45US, although it would have been possible to take the monorail to a nearby station, with just a single change and then short walk.- Getting to Narita airport was achieved by using the Narita Express (included on your JR Pass, btw), to Tokyo station then a quick change and a few local stops to get to the hotel. As it's much further out, I think a taxi to Narita would be expensive.","Leighton Buzzard, United Kingdom",85,4.0

It's a nice hotel but caters more to foreign travelers than local Japanese tourists. They serve a morning breakfast which we didn't sign up for the package. The place touts itself as part museum so you see lots of art pieces in the lobby which is nice but has a sterile feel where you don't quite feel comfortable like in a museum. The staff is polite but feels guarded. The strange thing is that 2 days into our stay, they asked for partial payment on the rooms because we were ""staying a long time"". Most hotels settle the bill at the conclusion of the stay. So either they have fiscal problems or have gotten stiffed on the bill in the past. There is a small laundromat on the 26th floor as well as a gym. Use of the gym requires booking an appointment.

The hotel has access to small Japanese restaurants in the basement which were frequented by business folks. It is walking distance to a mall with Starbucks, Japanese restaurants and the metro. There are a couple of nearby Family Marts to pick up food, Japanese snacks and water. We were able to purchase tickets from the hotel for the bus to pick us up from the hotel lobby and take us to the airport for our flight home, recommend you book 2 days ahead to guarantee a seat. The rooms are clean and they give you complimentary drip coffee, tea and a large bottle of water. I would stay at the hotel due to location near the metro and JR lines which we took daily but didn't really like the stiff feel of the lobby and the strange policy of paying for part of your room bill halfway thru your stay.

The property is close to the Ginza area, and about a 2 minute walk from the Shiodome Station on the Yurikamome Line or the Shimbashi Station with access from a number of major train lines including the Yamamote, Tokyo Metro Ginza, Tokaido and Asakusa (Airport Limited Express) lines.The hotel was reasonably priced for the Minato/Ginza area, with reasonably good sized rooms and a great view of the city and Tokyo Tower if you get a room on that side of the building. The lobby is on the 25th floor, with the rooms above. You won't have to go to Tokyo Tower's lower observation deck if you stay here. Our room on the 33rd out of 35 floors was at about the same level as the tower's first observation deck. This is a medium-to-higher-end property that is clean and well cared for. The buffet breakfast was quite good. I would rate it 7-8 out of 10 compared to other hotels that I have stayed at in Asia, with a number of quality items to choose from. The only thing lacking was some of the made-to-order options often available at some properties, and the variety was at the lower end for higher-end hotels. But still quite good. The hotel staff was terrific and very helpful.I would highly recommend the hotel for those looking for a quality property at a reasonable price (for Tokyo!). While this is more of a 3.5-4-star hotel rather than 5-star property, I give it a 5-star rating due to the reasonable cost, location cleanliness (even by Japan standards) and above average quality rooms.","Salt Lake City, Utah",67,5.0

No complaints there.I got excellent support from the concierge on several requests for dinner reservations.But there were odd lapses too. I had a great Italian pasta dish for lunch, delicious in every respect, except for the canned Kraft ""parmesan"" on top. In another lapse, the scrambled eggs on the breakfast buffet were significantly underdone two days in a row. Intelligent people can argue about the correct doneness of scrambled eggs. However, ""pourable liquid"" is generally not a favored option. I tried to print out a single page in the business center and came away stymied after forty minutes without my page. I couldn't get the computers to do anything I wanted to do seemingly because of a lot of firewall protections blocking fairly normal websites.I also disagree with other reviews about the hotel's ""great location."" Every hotel in Tokyo is convenient to a subway station. For the Tsukuji fish market, it's convenient.  maybe. If I wanted to do ""shop until you drop"" shopping in the Ginza, I'd stay at a hotel more conveniently located in the Ginza. This hotel is a good 30 minute walk from Ginza 7, the first real shopping street. This is also not a great area for restaurants. They do exist at the top of office towers, but most things in the neighborhood are pedestrian and close up after the office workers have gone home. I'm finding I'm spending $50-60 round trip on taxis every night to go to Roppongi to eat in the restaurants I want to explore.As a tourist, I'd stay in Roppongi the next time I'm here.",Iraq,44,4.0

We arrived at 9am (the check-in is from 2pm) but they gave us one of the rooms immediately because it was available and they sped up the cleaning of the second one so they can enable us to rest as early as possible - I really appreciated that after a 14h flight. - If you are staying in an artist room you will have a complimentary breakfast in a small room on the 31st floor - again with an amazing view on Tokyo Bay.

The room can only be opened by the hotel gym key, which is handed out upon reservation and returned when complete. There is no excuse for this hotel to skimp in this amenity considering dozens of other hotels around this area having better facilities.- Room service ends early in the evening.

The hotel is 1 mile away from the Imperial Palace which made it is easy to go for early morning scenic runs. The artist rooms at the hotel are beautiful and I very much enjoyed mine.

We've never stayed anywhere else.The regular rooms are slightly bigger than what you'd expect for a Japan hotel room. Amenities are complete, beds are comfortable, housekeeping is also great! Since hotel starts on the 25th floor, the views from the room are always very good (the rooms facing Tokyo Tower cost a bit more). Oh, and the wifi signal is consistent and strong.Staff service is always above par. English is widely spoken by Reception, Concierge and Bell Service so arrangements can easily be made with them. On our last day in Tokyo last 04March 2017, our flight was very late at night and our Airport Limousine Bus was at 9:25pm. Since check-out is standard at 12noon, we had our bags stored at Bell Service. At 9pm, we claimed our bags, intending to go down to the first floor entrance to wait for the bus. Bell Service told us to stay comfortable at the Lobby and at 9:15pm, he accompanied us with our bags to the first floor entrance, waited with us for the bus to arrive and saw us off. That's service!Breakfast is not fantastic, tho (for us at least) but there's a Family Mart in the Basement. The area is quiet at night, away from the bustle of places like Shibuya and Shinjuku, but getting around is not a problem. The Oedo Line's Shiodome subway station is right under the hotel. The Yurikamome line has a station just outside the 3rd floor walkway. Shimbashi Station is 8-10 leisurely minutes away, via the Yukikamome Line walkway, if you want to catch the JR Yamanote. And Ginza is a very short walk from the hotel! Location, location, location!And the view from the Lobby's wide windows? Tokyo Tower lit up at night is always beautiful; the lighting changes every couple of days so it's always a treat to see it. And on the morning of 03March, Mount Fuji could be seen crisp and clear beyond the Tokyo Tower.I recommend making your booking directly with the hotel on their website, where they offer promos. It's always easier if you need to make changes to your arrangement when you deal directly with the hotel; rather than booking thru one of the online hotel booking sites.I always tell my friends about Park Hotel Tokyo. It may be bit pricey for someone on a budget but, let me tell you, it is all worth it!Do I want to try another hotel?

Located within a stone's throw of the JR loop line's Shimbashi Stn and practically right on top of the Oedo subway Stn which also loops through the city, this palace is very convenient. Most of my business over the years was in Shinjuku so I frequented the Hilton, Hyatt and Keio hotels. Now my business is in the Toranomon/Roppongi area. I last stayed at the Okura. Lovely old hotel which brought back many memories, one of my old boss and professor who took me and my girl friend to lunch there in the 80's. First time I had gazpacho. The Okura is great, big rooms, great staff, great restaurants and literally a 5 minute walk from my company's Tokyo office. It's pricey and after decades of visiting and living in Japan, I wanted to branch out. What caught my attention about the Park Hotel is its art rooms. Why stay in a regular hotel when you can get uniquely designed and painted rooms done by individual artists? The room size is a little narrower than ""western"" standards but ample by Japanese standards. I live in a McMansion at home and have no problem with the Park Hotel's room size. Great view of Shimbashi Stn and the Shinkansen. A central atrium gives a sense of expanse and openness. It's distinctively decorated from the lobby on the 25th floor on up. I love it here. Even though it's a 25 minute walk from my office, I prefer this to the Okura and plan to make it my go-to hotel from now on. The only other hotel in the city that interests me like this is the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku which is 2-3 times the price without the individual art.","Reno, Nevada",21,5.0

Ok, as I am at the hotel for sleeping purposes, it does not play that important role. But as the first view of the day there are nicer alternatives. One should also mention that around 5 am the trains start there daily operation (which stops again round midnight). So from that moment on you will hear the trains getting in and out the station, or the Shinkansen passing by. It is not so loud so that you wouldn't be able to sleep any more (windows are well protecting from noise). But when stay awake due to jet lag, you will notice that. However, it did not disturb too much.Again I would like to spend some words on the breakfast. This is getting more and more annyoing. Every year and every morning the same things to eat. Costing 2.400 Yen one would expect more variations. One sort of cheese and sausage, the same every day. And still this old toaster which needs 5 minutes or more to bring some brown colour on the bread. Why can't they invest in a newer, more powerful one? And one toaster only! That might take 15 minuets before you have your bread toasted. Another point: although at least 5 waiters run around, they never notice you when you want to have new coffee. Maybe I should dance on the table next time.My recommendation: if breakfast is important for you, go to the Royal Park Shiodome which is just on the other side of the street. Or have breakfast outside. But apart from that, the hotel is still worth a high recommendation.","Gladbeck, Germany",5,4.0

For such a large city, it is hard to say what is and isn't a convenient location - but Park hotel is above the Shiodome station and near to Shimbashi. If you take Narita express from the airport to Tokyo station it is an inexpensive taxi ride or 2 subway stops away; they also have an airport bus but we did not use it. It is very near to the Ginza district which has some of the best shops and restaurants. It is also near to the Tsukiji fish market. Before our arrival the concierge booked us several dinner reservations at high end restaurants, most of which were lovely. Upon arrival we chose to upgrade to the Tokyo Tower view. Worth it! Our floor had a lounge with breakfast offerings and a floor specific concierge service which was a nice touch. The staff are incredible. Room service was great. Room was large (we had the regular size one) and spotlessly clean. Wifi worked perfectly. The art around the lobby and lounge were a nice touch.

Also, a little stroll down a few blocks will get you to Ginza.We arrived pretty early after a 2ish hours trip on the Shinkansen. The staffs are really helpful with checking in, and much to my surprise they even have prepared 1 room out of the 2 we reserved to be available early before checking-in time. This was a really sweet gesture as we could freshen up and all.The room is decent-sized, not too small, and very comfortable. Beds and pillows are just perfect, and bathroom amenities are also amazing. What's more was that the hotel is currently showcasing very lovely artworks, and they even offer an upgrade to artist rooms.

Every time in Tokyo we always got headaches using the train system. So this time we elected to pick a hotel that was serviced by the Limousine bus directly to/from the airport. The hotel is located in a quiet business district. Not much directly around the hotel but if you walk a few blocks you will be in Ginza. The hotel is suited for business travelers. We noticed every guest in the hotel was there for business. During breakfast we were the only ones eating not in business suits taking about electronic brands. The fish market is walking distance from this hotel. However lacking in sense of direction we took ubers everywhere. Uber to Fish Market, Tokyo Tower, Ginza was roughly $10USD each trip each way. The lobby has a breathtaking view of entire Tokyo. We originally had a standard room but the lobby view sold us to upgrade our room to the tower view. It was an extra $15 a night and well worth it. The rooms are standard Asian size small . Which I am not sure why people complain in other reviews. That is the standard in all of Asia, it must be their first time here. Small but efficient and very modern, all toiletries included so leave your razor at home. Also has the standard Japanese modern butt warmer, sprayer toilet. Breakfast is 25$ USD per person every morning . You can pay at check in or just bill it to your room . The breakfast selection was tiny and highly over priced. I understand $25 for breakfast if the buffet is extensive. However there was a little of fresh fruit, breads, and some eggs, salad, and soup. Since the hotel doesn't have many close restaurants nearby we just sucked it up and ate at the hotel. There is a pastry/coffee shop on the first floor of the building. So if you are a light breakfast eater that can be an option. Another perk was we were able to book our limo bus tickets back to the airport with the hotel concierge.

Don't confuse it with the nearby Royal Park Hotel which is slightly more upscale with at least one star more of facilities. Many hotels design their shop front to be their best feature and this is no different. The lobby and (presumably) the artists rooms look great. But the hotel is flawed despite it's great views starting at the 25th floor of the media tower. It really is a budget hotel dressed up.We found:- the rooms to be small (even for Tokyo) - although not uncomfortably small.- the bathrooms to be at least one or two grades below the room. The towels were mini sized.- the pillows were lumpy and crackled a bit when you moved which was off-putting to say the least.- the noise in one room (we had 3) to be intolerable. Surprisingly the noise from the train station directly below came straight into one room making it VERY NOISY. So much so that the occupants of that room had to use headphones to get to sleep! Of the 3 rooms only the room facing the train station directly suffered.- check in was slow (not helped by the fact that the booking was messed up by them)- the rooms to be overpriced by comparison with other similar hotels (and that is without staying in the artist rooms)The two best features of this hotel are the views and the location.

Bathrooms are probably the only let down, just a little bit tired and need an overhaul. You can pay extra for what they call an 'art room'. Same as the others but is finished in murals by local artists. If that is something that excites you, then go for it. However personally wouldn't spend the extra. The buffet was about 2000 per person and food was great, plenty of variety and constantly refilled.

I chose this hotel for its proximity to Tokyo Station (where we arrived from Kyoto) and for the Airport Limo bus to Narita. But other aspects of the hotel surprised us and exceeded our expectations.It was a bit tricky finding the correct exit from Shimbashi station, in spite of the hotel's detailed directions on its website, but once we did, we reached the hotel quickly and easily. The walkway there amid the skyscrapers with the gardens and unusual clock was quite interesting. Then you take the elevator to the hotel's amazing lobby--be sure to wander around and investigate the art displayed around the lobby and lounge (much of it is for sale!). Like many Japanese hotel rooms, our rooms were compact but well-organized twin rooms, with incredible city views overlooking the Tokyo Tower and Mount Fuji! We could also watch commuter and bullet trains on the tracks far below. All the usual amenities (although we only discovered the robes in a drawer the next morning). We made reservations for dinner in the hotel's French bistro restaurant, which was stellar. One of the best meals during our two weeks in Japan. Highly recommend the venison and Wagyu beef. Slight mixup over breakfast. I didn't think breakfast was included in our room rate, yet we were given three vouchers for breakfast, so I thought perhaps breakfast was included after all. Two of us had breakfast. When we checked out, we were charged for three breakfasts. Don't know why we received vouchers if we had to pay for breakfast, or why we were charged for my son, who didn't have breakfast. We were short on time at checkout so I opted not to pursue it. But if you unexpectedly receive vouchers, do ask how they work. The breakfast buffet was very good, by the way.The staff took our bags down to the airport bus for us and made sure we and the bags got on the bus. Easy ride (past Disney Tokyo) to Narita. The location near Shimbashi Station was easy for getting to Shibuya and the sumo wrestling hall. The art work in the hotel (even in its smoking room) is outstanding.

It was not the Narita express as that only goes to Tokyo station and you would need to change trains. That was something was wasn't looking forward to after a long flight and arriving at night.

When you arrive you take a lift up to the lobby on a much higher floor. The lobby itself is very impressive and well decorated with excellent views of Tokyo. Before reading the rest - this hotel is pretty expensive and when I pay more I expect more in terms of service etc. As such, I felt let down by the Park Hotel Toyko several times throughout our trip. Check-in: We arrived fairly late (9:30pm) due to flight delays and the check-in process took quite a long time, however this was ok as we were amazed at the views behind the reception desk. We asked if there was anywhere we could get any food but were told no as the restaurants were now closed. There was no mention of the bar still being open and serving food, room service or suggestion of any of the nearby restaurants (in the basement and just outside the hotel. We were left to discover this ourselves on a quest for dinner. Rooms; Large with absolutely incredible views of the Kyoto Tower/Tokyo/Mount Fuji. Our room did smell a little bit musty. The bathroom was fine - a bit dated. We had one normal pillow and one beanbag style pillow which was very strange. Free wifi was good. Breakfast: There was a large buffet with a lot of choice of both western and Japanese food although a number of hot dishes were luke warm at best (and we came at different times on all 3 days). Getting attention to have more than one hot drink was quite difficultBar food: We ate here the first night and the food is expensive (standard bar food all £20-£30) but is very tasty. Service was excellent. Japanese restaurant: The food in this restaurant was very good but it is incredibly expensive and the a la carte menu portions are tiny. We left still hungry. Check-out - We had previously advised the hotel that we were four people with four large suitcases and we needed to go to the train station and asked if we needed to book a taxi and told no. On the morning, we were told no big taxis would be available for over an hour so we would need to take two taxis. The doorman who then helped with our bags then told the taxi driver to take us to the airport. Luckily we confirmed and corrected this. I don't know if this was a language barrier but this process was frustrating and left us annoyed at the hotel when leaving. Location: We thought this was a good location to explore Tokyo, however as mentioned above it would have been helpful for the hotel to provide maps/more details about the local area/restaurants to help guests.Overall this hotel could be excellent but we were left a bit disappointed.","Edwalton, United Kingdom",102,3.0

The only thing I'd suggest for management to consider is to have a directional sign on the first floor big enough for a tired and weary traveler could see immediately. It took me a while to figure out where to go when I entered Shiodome Media Tower. It was 11 pm and the ground floor lobby was poorly lit. Although I loved the room, the bed and pillows could be better. The pillows felt like sleeping on a bag of pebbles and the mattress felt old. If you want to splurge, the hotel has great restaurants.

There is a ""limo bus"" from Narita to the hotel that offers convenient and fairly quick access even with a few stops at major hotels along the way. But with baggage, much easier than trying a local train and subways, which would also be an option, because this hotel has quick access via connected tunnels to the subways and Shimbashi JR Train Station. This was a huge plus. I never had to fight traffic or crowds, other than those in the tunnels and on the subways. Needless to say, I could get anywhere in Tokyo after a short walk thru tunnels to the subway station. The hotel is simply beautiful. The lobby is located on the 19th floor and the rooms are on floors above that - I think up to floor 33. I had a deluxe room on the 25th floor with a stunning view of Tokyo Tower. Photo ops right out of my room window. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed exceedingly comfortable. The room was furnighed in modern and tasteful furniture and the bed was exceedingly comfortable. The bathroom was large and equipped with a combo shower/tub. I was fully expecting cramped quarters based on everything I heard about hotels in downtown Tokyo. Again, I had a deluxe room, so I imagine it was larger than standard rooms. The hotel had a great lounge on the lobby 19th floor and in addition to a well stocked bar (some very good Sake's BTW) offered great views of the city. There were also two very good restaurants on this floor and I had dinner in both of them. One was traditional Japanese fare and the other French cuisine. Both were excellent, although very pricey. Like all Japanese hotels, the staff were friendly and made me feel like an honored guest. In addition to normal concierge services, and they were extensive, they also offered baggage transfer services so I could avoid lugging baggage thru the tunnels and onto a train when traveling to my next destination.

The hotel starts at around the 25th floor of its building, and goes up from there.We got one of their rooms with a view of the Tokyo Tower, and the view was absolutely sensational. At night, the tower is lit up beautifully, and it's really nice to just sit there and admire the view. On one particularly clear morning, we could see Mt. Fuji in the distance as well!The room was on the smaller side, which we expected, but felt cozy instead of cramped. We still had enough space to move around, put our things, etc. The bathroom was nice, and had a great feature - a heated area on the mirror that wouldn't fog up when you take a shower. The bed was comfortable, if a bit firm.Breakfast was buffet style, and had both Japanese and western style food. The smoked salmon was fantastic, and the sausage stood out as well.

One night, we came back early and got room service - I ordered a bento-type meal. The food was absolutely beautifully presented - I almost didn't want to eat it (but am glad I did - because it was fantastic).We didn't deal with the staff too much, but the one time we had the concierge make a restaurant reservation for us was a great, smooth experience.

There's tons of shopping and food nearby in the various skyscrapers; Shiodome City Center next door has a huge set of restaurants inside (I recommend the top floor's restaurant En) as does nearby Caretta Shiodome Center, and there is a Family Mart conveniently located on the B2 level of the hotel's building. The room was a reasonable size and had lovely modern decor and comfortable bedding. The shower had awesome water pressure, and the bath products smelled lovely. Love how generous Japanese hotels are with supplies! The views as others have noted are amazing, since the hotel starts at the 25th floor and up. Everything is hushed and quiet in the hotel (in most Japanese hotels I stayed at, so I slept well.) Service was always helpful and kind. We got the breakfast buffet twice, for $25 per person, and it had a nice array of both Japanese and Western items. Love the beautiful artwork and art theme of the hotel as well.

We did, and the view is pretty stunning -- but it's about the only great thing we can say about this hotel. Everything else was just fine. The lobby and restaurant area were welcoming and modern, and the service was good, but the room itself was very ""budget,"" small, outdated and not particularly clean or well-appointed.

If you take a taxi anywhere, beware that many will try to drop you off at the wrong hotel as there is a Royal Park hotel nearby and the drivers will get confused.

Also, the Shimbashi station is about a 10 min walk and provides access to just about everywhere else in Tokyo. There's also a lot of great restaurants around Shimbashi station.

Over the course of 6 nights, I got past the size of the room and appreciated both its cleanliness and the large window with a fantastic view of the city, facing Tokyo Tower.

The food in the hotel is also good. I will likely be returning soon to Tokyo, again on business, and will consider staying at the Park Hotel again.My two suggestions to the staff: 1.) your lobby is on the 25th floor. Walking into a large business building is confusing and carrying a lot of luggage by oneself while trying to figure out where to go is difficult and inconvenient. Other hotels like the Conrad next door have staff at the entrance to welcome and direct guests, and assist with their luggage. It would be much appreciated if your hotel did this as well. 2.)

Now when we used the shuttle limo bus from the airport, we saw that at every hotel we stopped, staff would come out and greet the bus driver and then take the customers to the concierge and I guess assist them with check-in.With Park Hotel Tokyo, the bus driver took our bag down and we had to make our own way there. When we were at check-in the service staff were excellent of course as all Japanese culture is. We were asked if we wanted to upgrade for $xxxx (can't recall the exact price) a night however we said no thank you, we would like to use the money to enjoy ourselves in Japan. Just want to let the managers of this hotel know that both in Hong Kong and Beijing (which we were prior to our last stop in Tokyo), we were offered a upgrade for a fee and when we said no as we wanted to have fun outside the hotel, they said because it was our first time in their hotel, they upgraded us anyways for free. P.S the hotel (I AM CERTAIN) was not fully booked.After finally checking in, we got to our room. Looking at the artwork in the hotel lobby, we could only imagine how nice our room was. When we got in... it was a shock. The room was very very very small. Yes, I have stayed at several hotels in my life for both Business and Leisure and both in Australia and outside Australia, but this hotel was small.There was an artwork on the wall but that is about it! I would have much rather not put the very hi-tech toilet and spent (assuming) $5,000aud and perhaps made the room slightly more comfortable.Furthermore to find that I had to shower in a Bathtub where I had to use the shower curtains as a method to stop the water from going out.... I was willing to ask the concierge to find us another hotel room but wife convinced me not to.The hotel is known for it's artwork, having shower curtains is not very artistic.The beds are not very comfortable either. Unsure if this is Japanese technology or the secret of sleeping comfort however they were not.On a much brighter note - the hotel is situated perfectly within 2 minute walk to the train station and over 50 restaurants and bars including small grocery stores.The hotel staff are extremely friendly and a pleasure to deal with as are all people in Japan.The buffet breakfast we had was delicious however I would make a small note to management, I understand the location of the restaurant is quite tight, however it would have been good not to sit so very close to each other.In Summary:If you don't care about your hotel as you are planning to enjoy Tokyo outside the hotel, then definitely stay here as it's location is prime!If they change the bedding style and build proper shower that has a shower head and shower glass door, then I would stay in this hotel again, otherwise, if they gave me $200AUD discount each night, I still don't think I would stay here.","Sydney, Australia",78,3.0

The queen room was comfortable, well organized and impeccably serviced daily and had a very good view through a large window (which also had a padded seating ledge) towards the Sumida river and the Hama Rikyu Gardens, including other high rise buildings close by. Others rooms face toward Tokyo Tower, but you can get this view in reception. This is an art hotel with some individual rooms painted by artists; but the splendid atrium (which starts at Reception and the comfortably furnished foyer on floor 25 and goes to level 34) abounds with art exhibits which guests and the public can enjoy. There was a beautiful temporary exhibition during our stay which included night time light projections on the atrium wall. Tokyo is confusing for a first time visitor, but concierge staff here offered invaluable advice that made everything achievable, including personalised maps with detailed instructions on how to access the subway and different lines, as well as making excellent recommendations for dining. It was like having a personal guide to the city and we greatly appreciate this skilled local knowledge.","Sydney, Australia",21,5.0

Advised on places to eat and how to get around. My daughter unfortunately came down with a high fever and the quickly arranged for a taxi as well as called ahead to the hospital and provided all the relevant information we would need. The hotel is in a very convenient location, walking distance to Ginza the Tsukiji fish market and close to major train stations Shiodome and Shimbashi just below. The Hamarikyu gardens very nearby are worth a visit. For those with kids, they will really appreciate a visit to the Hakuhinkan toy shop also short walking distance away. In the hotel if you go to basement 2, there is a family mini mart open I think 24hrs which is good for snacks. From there you can also access the train stations. And you can access the Caretta building which has numerous restaurants. Instead of going to the first floor if you go to the third floor then you can get around the immediate vicinity using overhead walkways. Sound like a small thing but I appreciated the free filter coffee in the rooms, staying at another hotel at present that costs twice as much and no coffee and stayed at one which was 3 times the price and only provided cheap instant coffee. The kids also liked the free sweets at the reception. Didn't eat in the hotel as food options nearby were so convenient including breakfast at the Tsukiji market which you should make time for.I would almost give the hotel 5 stars, the service, cleanliness and value is 5 stars.

We did not try the restaurant inside the hotel, however with all the amazing food in Tokyo, I am not sure why one would.

We were allocated a top floor room overlooking Tokyo tower which left us slack-jawed as we entered. Try to stay on the top floor, it's stunning. Although with rooms starting on (I think) floor 25, you can't really get a bad view. The room itself was more spacious than we anticipated and easily on par with standard London hotel rooms. We had space for 2 stupidly large suitcases open on the floor, walking room around the bed even with our things escaping the cases, a chair and table by the window and a clear path to the bathroom. The bathroom was great and I was amazed by the little steam free area on the mirror which is just at face height - what a touch! The service we encountered was top notch and I even got a half bottle of champagne as a birthday gift which set my birthday celebrations off with a bang. Everyone was so polite, helpful and calming in their manner. We returned to the hotel bar for some post-birthday-dinner drinks and met the most wonderful chatty bar manager who talked us through a world of whisky, even offering up some tasters from his very own collection. We tried his favourite which was a crazy super-burning batch made in total limited quantities. Very lucky!As amazing as the views are during the day, the city always comes alive at night and I could have sat on the windowsill seat for the rest of my days, watching the teeny tiny cars and trains below making their way to new towns. The bullet trains are so quiet as they pass and we could barely hear them through the toughened windows. Upon leaving, we chose to forward our baggage on to the next city and when I enquired as to how it would work when we arrived at the next hotel, the bell porter informed me she had already called ahead to confirm everything so we just needed to check in and the bags would be delivered to the room. A system so efficient I feel like it could never work anywhere else in the world, despite how convenient it would be.All in all an amazing stay for my 30th birthday and every bit what I had imagined. Thank you to the park hotel for making it so special! Arigatou gozaimasu! ","Greater London, United Kingdom",12,5.0

The views are stellar. The room was extremely comfortable, clean, and had amenities beyond what most places have. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My only ""suggestion"" is that I didn't really know how to get there from the Shimbashi train station -- the hotel's website wasn't very informative, and navigating it was a bit problematic technologically. (Also, when I confirmed the room, I couldn't get a clear PDF from the confirmation page -- it captured some of it but not all of it. I've never had this problem before or since, so I assume it has something to do with how their webpage is set up.) The price was a bit high for my usual standards -- but the place is great. The restaurant options were all way above anything I'd spend money on (e.g., $15 for a glass of wine), so I didn't try any of them. I'm attaching photos of the local map the hotel provided once I arrived - I wish I had this info before I arrived (but didn't find this info on their website).

Bathrooms, while of a typical modular design, are very well put together and very well designed. A case in point, lots of small bathrooms in tokyo hotels with poor lighting makes showering feel like you are doing it in a cave. Park hotel puts lighting fixture above the bath tub giving the bathroom an airy feel.Location-wise, it is 6 to 10 mins away from metro and train stations. The closest train station is Shimbashi.

Check-in was smooth and pleasant, but our stay experience made a turn for the worse when we arrived at our room.

The design of the room itself was fine, although on the small side, slightly dated and bland - think business hotel - despite the futuristic location in the Shiodome district. As some other reviewers have mentioned, the interior could definitely benefit from a refresh. Meanwhile, our poor experience with the hotel's service continued the next morning, when we called the front desk for help with our luggage and had to wait for quite a long time for the bellhop to show up, so we ended up having to call again. Of note, this was around 10AM, not exactly the peak checkout time for the hotel (which has a 12PM checkout policy). Finally, after checking out and coming back later in the day to collect our luggage, we found the bell desk empty and had to wait until someone showed up 5 minutes later.

Besides, Ginza area is located 10 muinutes from the hotel by walk.Another aspect we would like to highlight is the staff friendliness and hospitality.

When I saw the very limited options, and didn't like the eggs they served, I was told if I needed to get poached eggs, that would be an extra charge of 10 dollars. I had served myself only a miso soup and a bread roll, and ordered a capuccino. When I asked to be served a la carte, the capuccino and eggs were included and so was the single piece of bread that the head waiter was trying to figure out in the transaction. This is when we are paying 386 US dollars a night per room for the very tiny rooms, which we had to get 2 of because we couldn't possibly fit in one room with our 2 girls.In the end, I was told that the miso soup would be complimentary because it wasn't in the a la carte menu, but my 2 poached eggs, single bread and capuccino came out to 20 us dollars.

The rooms were reasonably sized for a capital city (although the children's double was a little tight) with good amenities in the bathroom. Some of the rooms have rather funky art -- including the one I stayed in -- which was fun. Other facilities included a communal washing-machine/dryer, a tiny gym (for one person/small group use at a time, bookable in 45min slots -- I never had any difficulty getting in whenever I wanted so suspect not used that much); and vending machines with ice on I think all floors. The Tokyo tower view rooms are above the railway tracks and while a little noisy during the day it wasn't a problem at night; but if you're very sensitive to noise worth bearing in mind.There is a large atrium where breakfast is served along with light evening meals and drinks, and a couple of restaurants and a bars off it. The bar makes good cocktails, priced at upmarket hotel levels. We ate in the French restaurant a couple of times (excellent food, very swiftly served -- they had a special multi-course set menu for guests which was good value). We were less impressed with the breakfast buffet -- all fine but not standout, worth buying as a package rather than pay-as-you go if you can and want a large breakfast).Service was, as might be expected, punctilious and very high quality.

You really can't beat the location. For the price, this hotel is really great value. The rooms are well-appointed and clean, although a bit small (like most Tokyo hotel rooms). The staff is incredible. We booked several dinner reservations through the concierge, who emailed us when the reservations were made.To get to the Park Hotel, I would suggest taking a taxi from Tokyo station when you arrive. It's only about $10. Also, try to upgrade to a larger room if you can, since they are a bit small. We had a corner twin, which had an incredible view of the bay.

Right from beginning of making a room reservation, it seemed that the staff accommodated our requests to the greatest possible extent. We felt welcome and cared for. Even when the queues were long, a staff member would approach those waiting in life to inquire if they could help.Our room was sufficient in size, even for a couple travelling with a toddler.

The location is excellent, right beside Shimbashi station so it's easy to get out and about, and lots of good eateries on the other side of the station (including good old Starbucks and Subway if you're struggling with Japanese food).The reason it doesn't get a five star rating is that even though we are up 32 floors, we can hear the trains passing by pretty loudly through the window. The bathroom shower is also angled quite horizontally, spraying the entire bathtub and onto the floor (luckily there's a drainage thing next to the bathtub, seems to have been designed this way) which cannot be changed.

The itinerary from JAL was first class and we got exactly what we had asked for which was detailed support at every transfer and full guidance in EnglishWe were quite nervous about a country with a very different culture, language and script but the reality is that Japan is trying hard to welcome tourists with English signage at train, bus stations and tourist hot spots, indeed it was obvious that additional signage had been added recently. On top of which the people are very welcoming, like to practise their English and respond well to sign language. That said we might not have ventured into some restaurants and local areas without the support of our guides who enabled us to experience the real Japan. Once in a restaurant they really want to help you and most have English and / or pictorial menusThe food was an adventure but there were plenty of Western options if wanted with the ubiquitous MacDonalds, Burger King, KFC and Starbucks in all the cities, plus generic Italian, Thai, Chinese and American restaurants. All our hotels had Western Breakfast options.Smoking was not an issue as it is banned on most city streets and the locals gather obediently to smoke at designated shelters. It is allowed in some small bars and eateries but nearly all bigger ones and those in the stations, where there was a huge choice, were non smoking. Similarly the trains have closed smoking rooms and most carriages are non smoking.The sights are a feast for the imagination with high tec modern buildings and ancient temples side by side. We took long journeys by bus and train but this enabled us to see some spectacular scenery and acres of paddy fields.As the journey progressed we got bolder and took ourselves by train to Osaka and Fushimi from Kyoto, plus twice in and out of Tokyo with just the help of a map. The Tourist Information Offices at many stations have them in English and most tourist spots have leaflets in several languages.All that you have to get your head round is that the stations can be huge with many platforms, department stores, shopping and restaurant malls. The trains run to time and carriages stop on exact markers for each car, staff at the ticket barriers are friendly and helpful.We felt very safe walking around and on all public transport, saw no evidence of crime on the streets and only a very few street sleepers in just a couple of areas although we didn't stay out late because of the time differenceOne of the highlights had to be the many gardens, we had missed the Cherry Blossom but the summer trees and flowers were glorious and, from the pictures that we saw, Autumn must be similarly stunning. I would highly recommend Japan, we would definitely go again and would be confident that we could find our own way around nowAll the hotels had good wifi and there were many free wifi areas in shopping malls as well as in StarbucksJapan isn't expensive if you avoid eating in the hotels and follow the locals who eat mainly in and around the stations and top floors of Department Stores before heading home. Entry fees are reasonable and many smaller temples and shrines are freeThe weather in May/early June was lovely, warm and dry apart from 2 wet days. It had been wet before we arrived and the rainy season starts mid-June however they are well set up for rain and umbrella storage.

The rooms were small but are not considered small byTokyo standards. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was so friendly, courteous, and kind. The hotel is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The hotel is located in the Shiodome Media Tower. The lobby/reception desk is located on floor 25. Our first room looked into the many skyscrapers located in the Shiodome complex. Our second room faced East with a view of the Sumida River, Tsukiji Market, and the Hama-Rikyu Gardens. The hotel provided everything needed while traveling, including, shower caps, Q-tips, hair bands, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, loofah washcloth, toothbrush/paste, shaver/shaving cream, hairbrush, drinking glasses, and a hairdryer. The small refrigerator could be used to keep your drinks/food cool. This hotel has a very relaxing lobby, shaped like an atrium, with ample seating, and a buffet restaurant offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This became important since our return flight was at 1 a.m. and we checked out of the hotel at noon. We were able to relax comfortably before leaving for the airport. We found the easiest way to exit/enter the hotel was on the 3rd floor by the pedestrian deck. To walk to Ginza you walk towards the Shimbashi station (in the direction of the clock), take exit 1C, a stairway leading down to the street, and then turn right. There is an excellent supermarket located underneath the highway/railway overpass on the right side of the street. Here are the hotel's instructions from the Shinbashi station/JR Line: • Take the Karasumori Exit and turn left out of the ticket gate.• Across from you, go UP the stairs under “Shimbashi Station” sign.• Follow the pedestrian deck until you see a small walkway on the right (this is between two large buildings).• Take the walkway between the buildings. You will see a large clock on the right side building.• Follow the walkway to the large building between the two large buildings, you will find the 3rd floor entrance to Shiodome Media Tower.• Walk through the door and continue along until the elevator of the Park Hotel Tokyo. The other hotel exits include level B1 where the Family Mart is located, offering the best selection of yogurts.The hotel entrance on this level has a small sign in English with the hotel name written over the door in Japanese. There is access to the train/metro station on Level B1 but we found this route very confusing. Level 1/ground floor, the main building lobby, where you are dropped off/picked up by the Limousine Bus. I am including this information since we were unable to determine our direction and spent a lot of time wandering around aimlessly. Also, the Shinbashi station is very large, with several metro/train lines, and its' very crowded. The buildings have no names on them (unless written in Japanese). The TV offered 2 channels in English; CNN and an second channel which showed evening movies. Areas of interest nearby, include, the Panasonic Showroom and the Caretta, a shopping and dining complex, There is an another area if you turn right from the JR Line/Shimbashi station via the Karasumori Exit. I believe this is an older area of Shinbashi with clubs, restaurants, and convenience stores. We found this area rather seedy, but at night, it looked like the set of Blade Runner. This hotel is centrally located; 1 metro stop from Ginza, and 2 train stops from the Tokyo station. The only negative point is the difficulty in reaching the hotel due to the multiple levels and entrances. We landed at the Haneda Airport, took the Hamamatsucho monorail, then the Daimon metro 1 stop to the Shiodome station. This decision was a mistake since it was late at night, after a 14 hour flight, and the stations reguire walking down/up multiple staircases while carrying luggage. Suggestions for the hotel: 1) place a larger sign in English by the B1 hotel entrance 2) add to your Shiodome map the shapes of the buildings if distinguishable. 3) offer the NHK news channel on TV in English. Lastly, upon check out, a very nice young woman inquired about our travel arrangements to the airport. She made reservations for the last Limousine Bus to Haneda Airport, gave us directions, and held our luggage. I love traveling to Japan, mainly, because the people are so courteous, kind, and helpful; the service you receive in Japan is exceptional and unmatched anywhere in the world. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Park Hotel and look forward to staying there again.","Los Angeles, California",70,5.0

Beautifully designed, it offers plants, artwork and comfortable seating areas, a splendid bar and restaurant and plenty to enjoy as you savor being in this magnificent, exciting city, We stayed on the art floor, a unique concept in the hotel business. Painters from throughout Japan have been commissioned to create a tableau in each room. It's a wonderful, creative idea. We wrote about it at whereiscookie, and can't say enough about the hotel's unique encouragement of local and regional artists. You can sleep with the fishes, dream with the stars, go back in Japanese history to shogun days, or take a fairy tale ride into Japanese myth. We stayed five nights, and wish it had been ten. Video images of the artwork are projected on the beautiful walls. The hotel hosts receptions and revolving art shows! Rooms look out over Tokyo's bustling streets and soothing parks. And you are staying a few days in a ""painting"" -- breathtaking. The breakfast, included in the room, is splendid, too, a wonderful blend of east-meets-west. You can have beautiful miso soup, pickles and veggies, smoked salmon or bacon and eggs with gorgeous fruit and healthy cereals, juices and breads. An elegant restaurant offers beautifully presented meals. The bar is welcoming and our bartender was Italian, perfect for an international gathering place.

I did have a nice view from my room though.The Concierge staff was terrible! They weren't very helpful and numerous times gave me incorrect information. The other problem was they didn't speak very good English. For that type of position, you would think a requirement would be an understanding of the English language since you have Americans, Australians, UK and others that speak English. Trying to get accurate information and suggestions, was so frustrating! There aren't restaurants or shopping really nearby; it's better to take a cab or public transportation.Breakfasts lacked. Limited selections and very, very few options for non Japanese guests. Very disappointing. I got stuck eating cereal every morning.There was free Wi-Fi but many times I couldn't connect or it took a while to connect. They need a better system.Although I used the subway all the time, if you do want a cab, one has to be called for you.

A rare slip-up in Japanese efficiency.The hotel reception area is on the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower which is fine and dandy except that the number of lifts is inadequate and they are quite slow. Once on the 25th, another lift needs to be caught to your room floor after a walk from one side of the floor to the other. Just makes for a slightly long winded access.The hotel building is a triangular prism shape, and given the central atrium space and height, rooms on any side have spectacular views.The nearby Shiodome and Shimbashi stations can be reached by a maze of underground walkways. The hotel does provide a walking map to help overcome initial confusion, but we found wandering around and following (sometimes) contradictory signage was the best guide. Luckily this is a new complex and all signs have English as well as Japanese information.Once outside the towers and stations, it was a 10 minute walk to the Tsukiji fish market and nearby gardens. This is a far better option than taking the train for just a stop or two, especially during the commuter rush hours.

We had a room with a view and it was lovely. The hotel starts from the 25th floor so my only small gripe would be that you have to go to the 25th floor and then change elevators for your room. The room service is a very limited menu but there are a heap of restaurants connected via a walk way to the complex which are well priced as well as a mini mart down stairs.THe staff are excellent.

The building and the ones surrounding it are very modern and not as busy as other parts of Tokyo. This worked great for me as I don't like crowds but could still get anywhere I wanted to go because there are multiple Metro/Subway lines nearby, easily taking us anywhere we wanted to go. If you are flying into Haneda, you can get to this hotel without having to make any changes on the train.Check-in was easy and very friendly. As with most places in Japan, the service is quick, efficient, and extremely polite. The staff at the Park Hotel speak English well and communication was not a problem. I noticed a lot of American tour groups going in and out of the hotel so no worries here if you fear a language barrier. I upgraded to a corner twin room for about $20 USD a night and it had a side view of the Tokyo Tower. The rooms are all on high floors and I enjoyed the views and it was a great place to relax and soak in the city. It was so relaxing that we ordered room service one night versus going out. It was pricey but pretty good!The rooms are very simple and have everything you need. The corner twin was big enough for two people and the beds were comfortable enough. The selection of toiletries in the bathroom was impressive and there was doubles of everything. Things were replaced by the attentive housekeeping staff. And when you are in Japan....there's the toilets...the wonderful, amazing toilets! I wish I could have taken it home with me. If you've never been to Japan and experienced a Japanese style toilet, it will be a real treat.You are able to get a late check out for about $15 USD an hour (through 3 or 4pm). This came in handy as our flight didn't leave for LA until after midnight. One tip that the person who brought up my luggage gave us was invaluable. There is a Family Mart 24-hour convenience store on the B2 level of the building. We made several trips there during our stay. They have just about anything you need!The only complaint I have about the hotel is that I'm still dealing with a billing issue. I had pre-paid the entire hotel through American Express Travel. When checking out, instead of charging me the $150 I had spent throughout my stay, I was re-charged the entire room rate of $800 for three night. I'm sure it'll work out but annoying none the less. My only other minor gripe is the lobby. There is a GORGEOUS view of the Tokyo tower from the lobby, but it is obscured by the check-in desk. Why not move the registration desk somewhere and make the area by the windows a lobby bar/lounge so people can hang out and enjoy the view. The sitting areas in the lobby are oddly placed although they have uncomfortable furniture. Move the check-in desks and put some chairs by the window so people can enjoy the view. Add drink/food service and they'll make a lot of money! Overall, a great stay at the Park Hotel. I would stay here again simply for the location and easy transit access to the major Subway/Metro lines.","San Diego, California",174,4.0

In particular, the Tokyo Tower, World Trade Centre and even closer by, the famous fish market and the amazing pedestrian friendly Shiodome Sio-Site. You can actually get to the Shiodome site without going out to the street. The hotel is also accessible to the subway. Whilst Tokyo is extremely safe, as is their subway, it is a little bit isolating walking underground as far as the hotel if you were on your own (it is very well lit and very modern though). The entrance is via an elevator taking you to the 23rd (I think) floor where the very nice lobby is located. We paid for a Tokyo Tower view rooms which I think was worth it - nice to see the skyline, the tower and traffic etc. at night. Don't count on seeing Mt. Fuji as it is often clouded over.

Almost all main visitors attractions in Tokyo can be reached using the JR Yamanote Line (green) from Shimbashi. This was a distinct benefit to us as first time visitors.We found the reception staff to be personable, knowledgeable, efficient, and anticipated our needs. They spoke good English and that was how we asked for directions to use the metro to visitors attractions, arranged to have our luggage forwarded to Kyoto or stored at the hotel, and confirmed transfer to Haneda Airport (incidentally, only 20 minutes by taxi).We consider the room we had on the 32nd floor as average to small but comfortable. It accommodated 2 open suitcases with enough space to sit and move around. Bathroom is small with adequate room for one person as that legendary Japanese institution (the heated toilet seat and accessories!) is centrally located. The room is spotlessly clean and facilities for making the British cuppa is provided. Our room faced the Shimbashi Station and it was fascinating watching the trains (local and Shinkansen) snaking their way through the station.The self-service breakfast is a mix of Japanese and western food and caters for most tastes.

I had been planning our Japan trip for about a year and I was able to book our room at the hotel six months before our stay via the hotel website. This is quite significant if you are planning a trip so far in advance. Since we were booking in the very busy cherry blossom season, I was unable to find many hotels that would let you book so far out. After booking the hotel and even before arriving in Japan, I had been in contact with the hotel concierge about three months prior to our stay. I tried calling the hotel at first but then was directed to just communicate through email (which made things much easier). The concierge was able to book several dinner reservations for us (including one of Tokyo's 3 Michelin star restaurants). Where I was impressed was that after sending them a list of my restaurant requests they replied back within several hours saying when each restaurant opened their reservation process, as well as the days that the restaurants would be closed. Since I sent my original request about three months out, most of the restaurants wouldn't accept reservations for another month. The concierge kept in contact with me and let me know as soon as they booked the reservations. In addition to the restaurant reservations, they also purchased the hard to acquire Ghibli Museum tickets for me on my desired day (just make sure you ask them to purchase over a month out before your arrival). Needless to say, I was extremely happy with our choice of hotel well in advance of our stay.When we finally arrived in Tokyo we were able to easily find our way to the hotel. They provide excellent directions on their website. One thing to note is that the hotel was a little farther from the station than we had expected. Usually I choose hotels that are within a 5 minute walking radius from a public transportation hub. This hotel was a good 10 minute walk from the JR Shimbashi station. Although the walk was a little further than I was used to, the area is extremely pleasant, with far fewer crowds than other areas of Tokyo, lots of signs and maps everywhere, and is surrounded by beautiful skyscrapers. So at least the 10 minute walk is a pleasant one. I had emailed the hotel several days before hand letting them know that we would be arriving before their check-in time of 2pm and that we would need to store our luggage at the hotel while we went out. When we arrived we were surprised to find that our rooms were ready and that we could do an early check-in. I was also presented with the Ghibli Museum tickets that they had purchased, as well as detailed directions to all of the restaurants they had booked.The room itself was quite spacious for a Japan hotel (still small by western standards). There was ample space for our luggage and we did not feel boxed in or claustrophobic. The bathroom was also a good size, with more than enough counter space for both of our belongings. Although the shampoo / conditioner / body wash were provided in small bottles vs the large pump bottles that we got at every other hotel in Japan, they restocked the bottles daily so supply was never an issue. The great benefit to the room was the incredible view of Tokyo tower and Mount Fuji (on clear days). Waking up to a view of Tokyo Tower + Mt. Fuji was a special treat that I won't soon forget. One thing to note is that you will need to book a room with a Tokyo Tower view in order to enjoy this. There was a small increase in the room price, but it was well worth it. If you don't book a room with a view, then the Tokyo tower is still visible from the hotel lobby on the 25th floor.The breakfast started at 7:00am and was buffet style with Japanese and Western choices. We found the food to be well prepared and of ample variety to never get tired of the hotel breakfast throughout our six night stay. One thing to note is that they have croissants kept warm under a heat lamp. There is no better start to the day than with a warm, flaky, croissant and I always enjoy hotel breakfasts that do this properly.As a base of operations, we found the location to be very convenient. As stated above, the hotel is a 10 minute walk from the JR Shimbashi station which can get you to anywhere in Tokyo within a 30 minute subway ride. Additionally, the hotel is a 10 minute walk from the Tokyo metro Ginza and Asakusa lines. It is also three minute walk to the Tokyo metro Oedo line. If you are planning to go to Odaiba during your stay then the hotel is extremely convenient, being literally right next to one of the Yurikamome train stations. One last thing to note about the location is that the hotel is a one minute walk to the Hayao Miyazaki Steam-punk clock. This is a giant clock that looks a lot like Howl's Moving Castle. The clock puts on a little show every day at 10am/12pm/3pm/6pm/8pm. It is amazing to see and especially magical for Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli fans. Having this so close to our hotel was a special bonus for us.We never had lunch or dinner at the hotel, and never used any of the other services so I cant comment on those. One thing to note is that they do have laundry machines that you can use if you need to. This makes things convenient on long stays. In Kyoto we had to drag a suitcase full of dirty clothes to a laundromat in order to do our laundry. That wouldn't have been a problem here at this hotel.Overally we were extremely happy with the hotel. The service from the concierge, the superb view, and the convenient location will make this our hotel for any future stops in Tokyo.","Austin, Texas",73,5.0

There are ones that feel as if they have small marbles in them, that can be hard when collected and pliable when separated. As I reiterate, a curious thing. However I always ask for feather/down pillows, wherever I go, and They were delivered before I could put my suitcase down in my room.WiFi, another curious thing. I travel with a phone and iPad. So does my husband. When we had all four devices WiFi switched on, we found the WiFi did not work for us. Using one or two devices at a time, we had no problems at all.The location directly adjacent to Shiodome Exit 7 & 8 is ideal. Also very close and via the amazing subterranean network, Shimbashi station is just a short walk away, most, if not all, of which can be accessed via escalator or elevator if carrying/rolling along suitcases. You do have to look for the elevators however. If you do not over think the process and follow the signage one step at a time, it becomes simpler with use.There is a convene stor on level B2, the basement. level 1 is the street level to the road outside. However reception is via lift access to the 25thnfloor. Only certain lifts go all the way from 25th level to B4, the lowest level, which is the carpark. Shiodome exits 7&8 come out to the third level where there is an exit to the elevator bank for access to the hotel. One takes a second lift from the 25th level to rooms above up to level 34.Tokyo accommodation is generally compact and this is no exception, the accommodation does hav a high level of functionality.The bathroom products by Thann are very nice too.

It's in a brilliant location, next to Shimbashi and Shiodome Station and easy walking distance to all the shops and restaurants in Ginza. I booked online and discussed room options via email. The hotel staff were very helpful and gave me a better rate than the big online booking services. I loved the look of the artist rooms that they have: rooms entirely hand painted by many contemporary Japanese artists in varying media and styles. The Park Hotel has a great policy of promoting and supporting contemporary Japanese artists.My first preference was for the Geisha Goldfish room, but this had been booked out. I got my second choice ""Festival"" and we loved that room. The hotel offered us a special rate to change to another artist room rather than to the normal room we had booked for the rest of our stay and it was too good to refuse. The second room was called ""Otafuku Face"" and had a lovely, big happy Japanese face with beautiful, lush, painted cherry blossoms across the entire room, walls and ceiling. Apparently this room is a favourite, probably because it also has an amazing view of the Tokyo Tower.There was something really special about staying in the artist rooms and I definitely thought it was worth the small extra cost. The rooms themselves are a good size, with very comfortable beds, good air con, quiet and great lighting. Huge picture windows give lots of natural daylight. The bathrooms are very nice with the multi functional Japanese toilets, deep soaker bath and shower. I loved the retractable line for drying small handwashed items. The toiletries were gorgeous, all lovely botanicals by Thann. My favourite was the shower gel. Apart from a very nice toothbrush and folding comb/brush, the hotel also supplied a great washing and scruffing cloth and I'll confess to hoarding a few of these. They last quite a lot of washes and are just textured enough to bring a glow to your skin without rasping. I'm still using the one from the hotel 4 weeks later. Wish I'd bought more of the Thann products in Omotesando to remind me of our trip.Everything about the Park Hotel was above our expectations. Great rooms, fast lifts, beautiful and interesting art displays, delightful staff and service. The staff were wonderful; always saying hello and smiling as we went past. The reception/concierge helped us out with directions, maps, airport shuttles and booking a special restaurant that was notoriously hard to get into. Everything was easily and calmly achieved. In a busy city like Tokyo, the Park Hotel was a blissful quiet haven to come back to each evening. Another bonus of this hotel's location is its proximity to the huge Ghibli clock that animates and the inexpensive restaurants in the Shiodome buildings. It's a 10 minute amble up to the Ginza shopping strip.There's a good local market/supermarket on the way to Ginza (about 5 minutes from the hotel) that has everything you might want: milk, snacks, fruit and drinks. It caters to locals and has an amazing array of fresh and frozen seafood. Everything is in Japanese, not English so learn some key words or use a translation tool like Google Translate to translate images of text from products. Or just try your luck since just about everything in Japan tastes good.I highly recommend this hotel to any type of traveller, but especially to those with a love of modern art. We will definitely be staying here again.",Sydney,33,5.0

I paid 270 / night (total, with tax). In Tokyo prices (especially during cherry blossom festival time), this was a good deal. We stayed at more centrally located hotels at first, but paid upwards of 750/night and dealt with sometimes overwhelmed staff/crowds. I have traveled the world extensively and I was extremely pleased with this hotel. Although my room was on the smaller side - I never felt it at all. Why ? Because the design of it was incredible. Everything was placed logically and there was even a desk and a chair to watch tv. The bathroom was superclean and, while not spacious, was not missing anything at all. Shower was perfect temperature and strong. Sink and toilet (although I don't need or want all that TOTO Japan stuff) were good. Staff was awesome, never overwhelmed, and always helpful. The hotel was quiet because it's in the middle of a massive office park. Yes, you can actually walk outside and go to a few nearby shops and restaurants that are fun and not ""skanky"". But the true gem of this hotel is that it is in the middle of ""nowhere"". The key is that it is quiet when you sleep. But, when you are ready to embrace Tokyo for all that it offers - the extremely close train (and subway if you need it) service is available immediately. You can get to Tokyo station faster than the regular subway. You can go to Harajuku and other off the grid places. Will definitely return.","Chicago, Illinois",22,5.0

We had booked a corner king room. We had a glorious and clear view that spanned across the Tokyo tower, a landscape garden and tall business buildings. We preferred the Shiodome station (Oeda line) as it was easier to navigate and get to with a stroller. In the mornings we walked past salarymen to get to Caretta mall where we had McDonald's and really good coffee at Tully's. The mall itself had a good selection of restaurants but they didn't open until at least 11am. From the Park hotel we made our trips to Disneyland and Sunshine city for the aquarium. The surrounding business district area was quiet and easy to navigate.  I had booked this hotel almost six months before our trip and the communication via email was easy and helpful. Our stay too was extremely comfortable. The cleaning staff maintained our room very well and all amenities were provided.

The food in the lounge bar is fantastic (though quite expensive for what it was). That said, the minibars are the cheapest I've found anywhere, so that makes up for it.Breakfast was the best of any hotel we stayed in during our trip. Plentiful, quick to be seated, lots of variety.Slight snag is the location. It's not the best in the world - it takes 10 minutes to get there from Shimbashi/Shiodome station.

We asked for our room to be changed, which seemed like a little bit of a hassle for the hotel staff, but eventually were moved to the 33rd floor facing the bay. This was much better, quiet and no smell. The view from there was also fantastic. Other than the smelly room and staff a bit clumsy on how to handle this, the rest of the stay was great and staff was excellent.

Room 3303 was quieter and had unobstructed views. Hotel has pretty much direct access to Shindome station and Shimbashi stations so really convenient .

We ate at the Japanese and also had a light snack and afternoon tea at the lounge bar. All very pleasant. Breakfast had a good selection of Western and Japanese style food, my only complaint would be that there were very view suitably high tables and often we had to sit on very low armchairs designed more for comfort than for eating. The overflow room is not as pleasant so try to have your breakfast in the lounge. Service was a little slow at times but always very charming. The rooms are quite small and we initially thought this was because of being in Tokyo but due to a last minute change of itinerary we stayed one night at Villa Fontaine next to the hotel in a twin room ( but not single beds ) and this was almost double in size ( room 404 ).

In one respect that's a little bit of a risk because if you're not satisfied at the beginning you're kind of stuck with the second reservation. However, we were so glad that we did - the location and stay were both excellent. We selected a 'high room with Tokyo tower view', which was worth every penny. The rooms are not especially large, but very comfortable. Bathrooms are fine, if a little dated compared to some of the other hotels we stayed in. Any small shortcomings of the room itself are completely overcome by the views over Tokyo. We stayed on the 32nd and 33rd floors during our two stays and we spent a great deal of time just looking out of the window, comparing what we saw to our maps of Tokyo and taking in the excellent view from above. You're not only treated to a Tokyo tower view, but also a cracking vista of Mount Fuji on clear days. Fantastic. My one minor disappointment with the stay was the price of breakfast, however I must say that I have that feedback of all four hotels we stayed in during our Japan trip. Costs approaching £20 per person for breakfast that, while of excellent quality, I have enjoyed for free in many European hotels. Well, OK, maybe not the dried fish, pickles and miso soup (all of which exceptionally tasty, if you can entertain those foods for breakfast.) very good cappuccino and espresso available upon request and included in the price of breakfast. The staff were very good indeed, with all of the attentiveness and politeness it is too easy to become accustomed to whilst staying in Japan. With the very few requests that we had for them they were excellent. Oh, almost forgot - 'The Society' bar in the lobby offered a dizzying array of outstanding whiskies, albeit almost 100% Scottish. Japan has so many wonderful whiskies (many now rated far better than their scotch counterparts) that I had expected a far better array. So, note to the hotel - please embrace your domestic whiskies more and offer the visitor more tastes of Japan. Lastly - while the bartenders are very good and make a mean cocktail (mean in terms of both quality but also size, I'm afraid) and are able to provide some good recommendations good grief the drinks are expensive. Add to that a per person 'cover charge' then popping in for a drink or two became prohibitively expensive.

This hotel does not have many restaurants, but you can find many nearby the hotel. The room is clean and comfortable, not very big, but already larger than many other hotels in Tokyo.

LOCATION: A few minutes walk from Shinbashi station, so it's really centrally located, just 20 minutes by train to pretty much anywhere in the city. A 10 minute walk to the main part of Chuo Dori street in Ginza. Once youve worked out how to get there from the station, (bit confusing because of the many raised pedestrian walkways etc) it's so easy (walk past the crazy Miyazaki Steam-Punk Clock & you are close... look for the street maps). There are great restaurants nearby in the Shiodome Centre building; at the station and further, at Ginza, plus a Family Mart etc for snacks.LOBBY: On the 25th Floor, beautifully laid out, great view of the city, really interesting artwork (which changes regularly)STAFF: Friendly, efficient and extremely helpful: making bookings for us, helping us with directions etcROOMS: Large by Japanese standards; well laid out; extremely clean; lovely amenities; Artist rooms are a nice touch (even if you dont like the art, how terrific that a modern hotel is trying something different? Full marks from me for that alone) Rooms with a view of Tokyo Tower are stunning.Overall, this is a modern, international standard hotel that has taken an extra step in reaching beyond being a standard bland business hotel.

We feel we treated as a special guest when the lady whispered me to ask when the cake should be send to the room. She informed me, that they will send a compliment champagne for us as well. When we backed to get our second key, the front office whispered whether it was the right time to send cake to the room. Finally, we got cake which has manicured as we request as written ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM, WE LOVE YOU"" with small candle, and champagne. Thank you guys, you are awesome! Arigato! The rooms were adequate size, modern setting and has magnificent Tokyo Tower view. We were lucky since we had a blue sky weather on on our trip.

I have held off on writing this review as it is a fairly big but and one that keeps coming back. At ~0400 one morning a fire alarm sounded, stating 'a fire has started on the ground floor, evacuate', after a couple of minutes it was still going so we had no option to evacuate, no easy thing from 30-odd floors up. We started our descent and the alarm kept going, only after ~20 mins and when we were at the 12th floor did it change to 'this has been a false alarm'. On reaching the ground floor in a dark foyer we found a single security guard who didn't speak English and a lady who had no ID and told us to get in a lift back up. Funny but people refused initially. The various explanations that we were given didn't work logically.

The concierge was very helpful. 4. Free wi fi in room. Cons 1. Location - although it is connected by several train lines, 3 of the lines are quite a walk away via underground - in Shimbashi station - not shiodome itself. There are 2 Family mart convenience stores downstairs - and many restaurants , but it's not the most convenient base for shopping. 2. Noise - we were on the 32nd floor, but it was really noisy (till late night) from the trains and for some reason, there were regular sirens going off every night of our 3 night stay - not sure if the hotel is situated near a fire dept or police station...perhaps we were just not given the 'right' rooms with the views that everyone was raving about...3. Comfort - pillows and bed were too soft. Even with 2 pillows (1 of them buckwheat) it didn't make for a comfortable night's sleep4. Facilities / amenities : there is a gym - which you can only use if you make a reservation in advance. We tried to get a slot on the same day but slots were full.5. Last but not least, we asked for a 1 hour extension to the standard check out time of 12 pm and was told immediately that we would be charged for every hour we extend. They would not even grant us a 30 min courtesy extension. To be fair, the staff were all pleasant, just that the hotel policy is not. In conclusion - there were more cons than pros for our stay at this hotel.

There is also a 24 hours Family Mart convenience store with hot food too and alcoholic drinks including beers, wines and Japanese whisky if you crave for something in the middle of the night.

We had a problem at Ueno station finding the footbridge to get over the tracks to the park and museums. Answer: stations have a policeman who manages English and can tell you which way to go. For westerners there is a bakery shop on the 1st floor of the Shiodome Media Tower (where the hotel is located starting on the 25th floor) where you can get goodies for breakfast.

The staff were exceptionally friendly, and while there really isn't any tipping in Japan, someone will escort you to your room whether you want them to or not, and the lingering suggested that a tip was expected. This might have just been our experience, but it seemed fairly common place.","Ottawa, Canada",4,4.0

Fuji on a good day. The lobby is on the 25th floor and the hotel has about 10 floors and the front desk lady was kind enough to give us a top floor room, the second morning we were able to see mt.Fuji clearly for a brief moment and I am grateful. Getting around is simple, it's located at the Shiodome subway station and 7 mins walk to the Shimbashi train station via a sky walk between business buildings. across the street from the hotel you'll find Tokyo's biggest salary men's area, tons of small restaurants/bars/clubs and if you go the ""brighter"" side there's the famous Ginza, where most expensive shops reside. And it is it's very easy to transfer to Tokyo station for day trips or Hamamatsucho for Haneda airport monorail.The breakfast buffet was very good, plus you have the option to have breakfast at a popular shushi restaurant at Tsukiji fish market, one stop from the shiodome station. You each get a set worth about 2,000 yen which is quite filling, not as good as those famous ones such as Sushi Dai but much better than any sushi place outside of Japan...the fish is fresh and that's a given, but the Japanese rice is the one that made the difference, you almost cannot buy Japanese rice outside of Japan because they just grow enough for domestic consumption, only a small quantity is exported if you are lucky to find them at home. Most ""Japanese rice"" you see in the supermarket is from California and they are not the same grade, so be careful.","Toronto, Canada",69,4.0

There were a few good things but a few slips that make me question its high ranking.Location - very good. Good access to Haneda Airport and in fact everywhere, by metro and JR. You can also walk to Shimbashi and Ginza at late night for food and shopping, it was safe and convenient.Views - the view from the lobby is going to take your breath away. First you notice Tokyo Tower literally a bit too close, then in the background is the gorgeous Mount Fuji. No wonder people just stop moving as they walk into the reception area.Check in - efficient and reception spoke English at a much higher level than the average Japanese hotel receptionist. However flat out denied requests rather than the standard 'try to arrange, no guarantees', but maybe this is a cultural difference.Now the problems:i stayed in a single room. It was a bit compact. And the views were less stunning than what you thought it would be; it faced the Conrad next door. The biggest problem was the problem I had with the wifi. There was no wifi in the room. I don't know if that's a design fault, but the staff member sent up with a router seemed to suggest that it was pretty common that these rooms couldn't get wifi. But even with a router plugged in, the internet was painfully slow. If i had serious business to do online, I would be very frustrated. This hotel charges 24,000 JPY a night, 3-4 times higher than a lot of other hotels where speedy wifi is a pretty default amenity provided without misses. When I questioned this further, the staff didn't seem bothered to deal with this issue and just shrugged their shoulders.I think the room would be worth 16-17,000 JPY a night, but not at a 20,000+ premium where I can get a lot of hotels with the similar calibre.But yet still the location was too good so I might have a second stay, or in a nearby property instead next time.",Hong Kong,24,3.0

On arrival people were overly helpful and offered to help us with our luggage (one large backpack, 2 snowboard bags, a suitcase each and a backpack hand luggage size each) so it was so nice to have the offer there after lugging it all from the airport.. Check in was easy and straight forward and once we got up to our rooms the first thing I noticed was the amazing view!! We were on the 2nd highest floor and had a clear view of the Tokyo tower and my Fuji right next to it with the rest of tokyo's high rise building around it.. It was a one queen bed room with sufficient space for our luggage around the bed and still able to walk around.. There was a ledge to sit on and admire the view and decent blinds to shut out the after noon sun that was quite hot in the room - aircon was obedient so that was nice on the cool nights.. The mini bar was stocked well for my unwell partner to have some cool water on arrival and snack later in the night.. Bathroom was spotless with an assortment of offerings such as shampoo conditioner toothbrushes etc... The only downfall was we often got the train to shin bashi as that was the most convenient for us but once we realised toei shiodome was closer and half the walk then we used that a little more.. Hotel was a little hard to find initially but once he had found it it was easy!! Most of the things we did required a bit of travel however it was quite lively only a couple of streets away for an easy feed on our first night :) we didn't have meals included but u figured that was made up for with the amazing view!! Staff were always very helpful and welcoming - no problems with English and if they did they could refer us to someone who's English was better..

There were lots of very good restaurants and cafes in the immediate area but it did take a little while and quite a bit of walking to work out where the majority of them were. The hotel itself is very nice and well run, the rooms are quite small but the size in workable. The whole hotel including rooms is very clean and comfortable. and all the staff are extremely helpful. They stored our luggage on our last day until our evening flight and were very obliging when we needed to access bags to repack for some shopping. We booked airport bus transfer through the hotel and they delivered our luggage to the front of the hotel and had it loaded on the bus, fabulous service. The only meal we had there was breakfast and for 2400yen was just average. The coin laundry for me (travelling with 2 teenagers) was a plus when deciding a hotel, unfortunately this was not a good experience, they have 2 washer dryer combos, the wash cycle was fine but the clothes were still damp after 8 hours of pumping coins into the machine, we were leaving on the bullet train next morning so had to hang all the heavy clothes around the rooms and turn the heating up to get them dry, not good. I did report this to staff but they didn't seem to think it was an issue or that we had spent almost 3000yen in the dryers, wish I'd looked for a coin laundry. Apart from this I'd certainly recommend this hotel as it was a very pleasant stay. We stayed at this hotel twice during our trip to Japan and the first time paid more for Tokyo Tower view, which was excellent, on our return we had standard rooms and the view was over the gardens and down to the water, beautiful view, I think I'd just recommend standard and you can see Tokyo Tower from the foyer.","Wollongong, Australia",15,4.0

It is a less busy tower of the otherwise busy Shiodome area. You can't be more central: there is a metro stop in the same building, which takes you anywhere you want. It is also a good place to stay if you attend a fair in Tokyo Big Sight/Ariake, as it is on the private Yurikamome line which takes you there in 30 min.Reception and restaurants make one floor, everything is elegant, quiet and efficient. Staff speaks ok English -not all of them, but there is always somebody on hand to help the less anglophile ones. All front office issues are sorted out well, a bit slow maybe, but generally good. Yes, I also had wrong bill compositions and credit card issues, and yes it took a bit of time to sort out, so my hint is to do it the evening before check-out.There is many different room types to choose from from the reservation menue -not sure if they are really different and what the differences really are. Most room names sound like gift packages. I took a standard corner room. It was indeed small but at the end all I needed. Bathroom small as well but sufficient if you are not over 100kg. There are good amenities, coffee/tea making facilities and everything is spotlessly clean. As it is a tower hotel, all rooms have great views. I am not sure if it is worth paying more for 'Tokyo tower view'...Breakfast is the traditionally weird choice of 'western' and 'japanese' -the western option being good but still with all the strange mixes of western items that only Japanese chefs can produce. The Japanese option remained a mystery as most food for non-Japanese was not to be identified, but it looked all fresh and delicous. Both breakfast options are reasonably priced for Tokyo standards.Staff in general friendly, courteous and efficient -smooth operators as everywhere in Japan. The complete package of this hotel I liked very much. It is not one of those large chains, but still offers service similar, and people there are nice and friendly. Location is most perfect if you are attending the fairs, or if you are ok with being close to Ginza, Ebisu, Shinagawa and Southern parts.I do recommend this hotel very much, I simply like it and I enjoy coming back.","Berlin, Germany",22,5.0

What impressed me the most, however, (apart from how beautiful Japan is), was the ease of communication with the concierge. They were prompt in answering my queries and requests before and after our trip. Worth mentioning is a particularly funny incident wherein I inquired whether I accidentally left behind the ID cards of my children in the safe when we were already back home. Ms. Asuka Shiraki, the concierge, emailed back promptly saying no IDs were found, but rather a pair of socks left behind by my son. I was so impressed when the hotel offered to send it back to me!

Being close to a station served by the Yamanote Line would be one of my key recommendations for staying in Tokyo because it does a loop of most major districts on the to-do list for tourists. So this hotel worked for us for this reason, however I would maybe suggest it better to stay over towards the Shinjuku / Shibuya side of town which feels to have more of the 'bustling electric Tokyo' big city feel you might be going to experience.

Most impressive was the concierge, a young woman who was raised in Sri Lanka, schooled in Canada and spoke English better than me. You won't get lost in translation here.

Although we did have about a 20 minute walk from the far end of Shimbashi Station to the hotel. But it is right above Shiodome Station, which is very convenient. Coming from Shimbashi Station, we followed the maps and finally found a side entrance to the hotel. We took the elevator up to the 25th floor and were able to check in a bit early. We booked the Tokyo Tower view as it wasn't too much more than a regular view room and we wanted our last view days in Japan to be memorable. The view was awesome, especially at night when the tower was lighted. We also enjoyed watching the subway cars and shinkansen going to and from Shimbashi Station on the tracks below. The room was an okay size, not the smallest but not the largest, of all the hotels we stayed at in Japan. But it was comfortable, clean, and cozy. There is also a good entrance to the hotel on the 3rd floor which we found after coming back from breakfast. We didn't eat any meals at the hotel so I can't comment on that. There's a Family Mart near the entrance on the way to Shiodome station.

But I also like hotels to function, smoothly and efficiently. The Park Hotel certainly has style and an impressive reception area on the 25th floor with great city views - but it is far from perfect. I checked in on a Sunday at 4pm to be told the restaurant was full for the evening and the bar could only start serving a range of foods (beyond olives or a sandwich) from 5.30pm. Indeed the listless afternoon bar staff certainly looked like more training was needed to provide the more customary attentive Japanese customer service. Salvation, however, lies in the comfortable and spacious rooms - but which side of the building you are on is also important - views of Tokyo Tower and Mount Fuji on one side; office blocks, roads and trains on the other. It's worth asking! For dinner I recommend the Sky 47 restaurant in the Caretta Shiodome less than 5 mins walk away - very welcoming and food is readily served! One more tip - Don't rely on airport bus transfers from the hotel for early flights - the first pick-ups are after 8am. Quickest route to Haneda is a 12 minute walk to Hamamatsucho and then 20 minutes on the Monorail (490 yen), or if you have luggage you can join at Shimbashi next to the hotel for a 2 minute ride on the JR Yamanote line to Hamamatsucho before changing to the monorail (one ticket will connect all the way to the airport).","London, United Kingdom",1,3.0

Compared to the great service that Japanese generally provide, it was a cold minimal service.The breakfast is good but it is in the lobby/atrium, with a limited number of tables and the multi use as bar and breakfast makes that the space does not serve perfectly any of the two purposes: not a real chill our bar not a restaurant/ breakfast space.We did not see much of the ""art"" that is used to advertise the hotel, rooms are just standard and confortable hotel rooms, there is no particular design or artistic decoration.

There is a lovely sitting area within the lobby and off in separate rooms are a bar area and a restaurant, we tried both the bar and the restaurant and the buffet breakfast - all of which I could not praise enough. The bar is apart of some sort of whisky association and they have some top quality drinks to try and possibly the most delicious peach bellini I've ever drunk before. The restaurant next door is a fusion of French/Japanese and whilst the portions seem small they are definitely fulfilling and delicious. The breakfast buffet also boasts an impressive spread - there are both Japanese and western options and everything tastes really fresh and nothing seemed dry or old. The breakfast seating can fill up quickly so I'd advise to go down as soon as possible to ensure you snag a seat.We booked one of the corner rooms with a view of the Tokyo Tower and I can't say much more then wow. The room was spacious and luxurious - the bathroom for Japanese standards was quite large and impeccably stocked. The bed, by Australian standards they'd basically pushed two huge king sized beds together - no complaints here it made for the most comfortable sleep I've ever had. During the day the heat from the sun can be quite strong against the windows but there is A/C in the rooms so you won't suffer. If you're lucky enough you might even be able to catch a glimpse of the mountains in the skyline, this is one of the most amazing sights I have ever seen.

The reviews looked phenomenal. Seemed pretty central and easy to access many places. And on top of that, this just looked like a hotel you would see in high rise Tokyo. This place was fantastic. It was really fancy as corny as that sounds. I guess for me when I am used to Hampton Inn's and that sort of hotel this seems like a whole different level. Honestly the food there was overpriced for our budgets. The juice was around 700-800 yen for a glass. We ended up eating elsewhere as there was a lot to see and do in a short walking distance. Just downstairs from the hotel was a little place called MOMI's and TOY's which was fabulous for a quick cheaper breakfast. Otherwise the subway and the Family Mart in the basement are always great quick stop spots. The rooms here are a bit condensed. But not to be unexpected. The views from every room are extraordinary. I loved looking out the window and when not raining, being able to see the sprawl of Tokyo. All of the rooms are the 26th floor or higher. I think up till 32. But not sure. They seemed to have really nice amenities in the bathroom and the hotel staff were exceptionally helpful. When you do go, be sure to go to the right hotel.

The bathroom was also in the same condition (clean and organized). The breakfast buffet starts at 7am. A good assortment of Western and Japanese food. The only minor suggestion I have for the Hotel would be to start the buffet at 6:30am instead of 7am. The hotel is connected to the subway underground path which made it extremely convenient to explore the city. There is also restaurants within walking distance (about a 10 minute leisurely walk - the hotel is also connected to an outside pedestrian bridge, which made crossing the street safe and simple). You can also walk to the Ginza area too for more restaurant options and shopping (about a 15 - 20 minute leisurely walk). There's a Family Mart convenience store and a couple of restaurants in the basement of the hotel. We didn't use room service because of the restaurant options. Apparently there is also a coin-operated washing machine on the 26th for the guests to use. Check-out was the same as the check-in process (very efficient and professional). We took the airport limo (a bus from the hotel to the airport - cost was approximately 1000 yen/person). The airport limo tickets can be purchased at the concierge. We probably would have taken the airport limo from Haneda to the hotel if we knew about it (will definitely use this option when we visit Tokyo and stay at the Park Hotel again). The concierge offered to mail the wi-fi package back to the rental company, Japan Wireless, this is without me even asking (he saw that I was carrying a package which needed to be mailed)!And finally...Neither my wife nor I can speak Japanese (my wife can read some very basic Japanese words), and it was very appreciated that the staff took their time to patiently speak to us in English.

It is above Shiodome station, which via the Oedo line gets you to Shinjuku or the fishmarket in the other direction, among many other destinations obviously. The new driverless Yurikamone Line head over to Obeida district, (which is well worth a trip. You go over the Rainbow bridge and there is some amazing architecture there not to mention a Venetian themed shopping mall) and the entrance to that is right outside the hotel on the 3rd floor. Otherwise Shimbashi station is close which we used a lot for the Ginza line, or the JR lines for places like Tokyo station (for a trip to Tokyo Disney), or for the fast train to Kamakura, also highly recommended. Bring your swimwear in the summer and check out Kamakura beach. We arrived via the Narida Express and then took the Yamanote line to Shimbashi from Tokyo station and walked from there. Beware, there are lot of steps and in the heat of the summer (not to mention the humidity) it was a bit of a slog with luggage, so taxi is an option I guess. Once we wandered in the underground area of Shimbashi/Shiodome once or twice, generally we found our way around quite easily. There are also great above ground walk ways which help (level 3 from hotel). The reception is on level 25 of the Shiodome Media tower, which is a distinct triangular building. Note, do not confuse the Park hotel with the Royal Park hotel Shiodome, which is confusingly just next door in the Shiodome complex. The room was great as we stayed in an artist room on the 31st floor (Zodiac room), and we had amazing views towards the city and Tokyo Tower as well as Mt Fuji (only visibly as a barely there outline due to haze during the whole 9 days we were there). The room is snug, but enough room to happily spend the evenings there after a whole day walking about Tokyo. The window seat is a treat. The bathroom is perhaps best described as cozy, but features a Japanese toilet (heated seat, discreet noises to mask, uhm, naturally occurring ones. Rinse, lather, repeat anyone?), which we got used to very quickly and now miss. Also plenty of toiletries and also some coffee/tea making facilities and a mini fridge in the room. The mattress was relatively hard, but we both slept well every night, so no complaints there. It is also very quiet and the trains don't run all night so we had no problems. To keep within budget we ate lunch out and about most days and got dinner from one of two Family Marts (convenience stores) which are downstairs in the subway area of the building. They serve very tasty ready meals and they will heat them up for you as well. Not to be confused with any convenience store food I’ve come across in the rest of the world, this stuff ranges from fresh salads and fruit to ramen, udon, sushi, chicken, pork dishes and also some western food such as spaghetti carbonara or pasta with tomato sauce. They also have a great selection of cold beers and wines, as well as sake and juices, water etc. And they have desserts, and no trip to Japan is complete without sampling the sweets here (just make sure you don’t need fillings as they really like it sweet!). So we loved the Family Marts and were regulars quickly.We ate once at the hotel itself at their Japanese restaurant (see separate review) and did not have breakfast other than room service on my birthday, which was plentiful and yummy. We usually had breakfast at the Tulleys café reached via the subway level of the hotel (only the far right elevator goes to that level!) and walk until you get to the Kinkos/Family Mart. The café is outside across from there. There is also a way to get there from the above ground walkways. They have great hotdogs, buns, pancakes and very good coffee. There is a funky and rather large clock which looks like it ought to be in Alice in Wonderland that does a display (it toots, honks and blows steam) every hour on the hour, which is a couple of levels up from café and also reached from the level 3 walkways. We used the concierge twice and her English is impeccable, thanks to some schooling in Canada. She was very helpful and found us a great and affordable Kaiseki, as well as other bookings. The free in-room Wi-Fi was fast and a great amenity to have, in fact it was one of the reasons we booked this hotel. Oddly, Japan isn’t as much of a paradise for internet surfing or telephony as one might think unless you have a Japanese contract/SIM, so it was very helpful. The welcome sake was much appreciated and if I am ever lucky enough to return to Tokyo, I would definitely stay there again. Even a (false) early morning fire alarm didn’t spoil things and made for an interesting experience.","Auckland, New Zealand",24,5.0

I mainly picked this hotel because it was reasonably priced (compared to other places in Tokyo) and the views. I got a room on the 33rd floor which had a pretty nice view over the train tracks and if you stepped right up to the window you could see the harbour. So pretty satisfying but maybe just a bit sad compared to the amazing pictures on their website. I guess you need to pay for the pricier rooms. The room was fairly small but with a few furniture moves, it was quite comfortable. Provided amenities are very good.The location has positives and negatives. If you're staying in Shiodome because you want to see Shiodome, then you're set. Anywhere else you want to go is fine unless you're good with walking - even if you're getting the train. You'll do more walking than you think because everything underground seems quite spread out but mainly because unless you're a local or some kind of genius, you will get lost a lot. Despite doing it three times, I didn't once successfully navigate my way from Shinigawa station to the hotel. There was a lot of walking around, back-tracking, staring at station maps, pouring over google maps, crazed rambling through shopping centres... None of this is the hotel's fault and it's actually quite well signposted and close from the local Shiodome subway station. If you master getting to and from trains, it's well connected to lots of the cool things to do in Tokyo. When in the area, I definitely recommend walking around on the 3rd floor walkway which connects the major hotels, offices and shopping centres. If you get lost, get up there as it's easy to see and they have directions. It's a straightforward 15 minute walk to the fish markets.I didn't eat in the hotel but strongly recommend heading down to the Family Mart in the basement level of the building for breakfast or other meals and snacks. It's a convenience store but way better than you would get in Australia or many other parts of Asia.I had a late flight and asked whether late check-out would be possible. Whenever I've asked this previously, I've always been offered at least one hour free of charge. In this case, he immediately told me an hourly rate of 1500 yen per hour for a maximum of 4 hours. I thought this charge was a little steep but I guess it's not totally unreasonable.There was an earthquake which could definitely be felt but the hotel didn't fall down, so that's good.","Sydney, Australia",29,4.0

The hotel location is awesome and you can get to anywhere in Tokyo from either the station connected to the hotel 3rd floor or from shinbashi about 10mins walk. Ginza is 10-15mins walk. We arrived on a Sunday and took the train from the airport to Nippori station and JR to shinbashi. Here we got confused a little, so instead of dragging out suitcases around took a taxi to the hotel (730JPY). I would recommend the train route for weekends, but not for weekdays as JR can be crazy busy. We took the direct shuttle on the way back, and was much more convenient. Just make sure to book your shuttle much in advance as it sells out quickly. They say it takes 2hrs, but for us on a Saturday return, it took just 75 minutes. The hotel main lobby is on 25th, so took the elevator there. Check in was smooth, staff spoke decent English, and we were given a nice room on the 31st floor with zodiac art and a lovely Tokyo tower view.The room was nice, a bit on the smaller side, but efficient. It was well stocked and comfortable/cozy. All standard accessories were provided. We do have to ask for an iron, but also saw a laundry facility with ironing board on the 26th floor. Did I mention the view was awesome. I am sure in nicer weather with less haze Mt Fuji could be seen from the room. The room is quiet, except for a light hum from the trains. Not disturbing in any way, but just something we noticed as we live in quiet rural setting. I actually enjoyed watching many kinds of trains passing by. (My secret fun thing to do was to go up from 1st to 25th floor using the corner accessible elevator, which gave an amazing perspective of Tokyo). The staff was very polite and courteous. We tried the breakfast on a couple of days, and found it to be satisfactory. Nothing memorable though, besides good service and am interesting lobby area that opens up to the top of the building. We also tried the Thaan spa for a massage. It was quite relaxing, and nicely done. The hotel is connected at the 3rd floor to other buildings. There was kind of a street festival going on when we visited, so it was fun to see some jpop etc. The only bit of a let down was that there is no swimming pool. Not a deal breaker, but having enjoyed some awesome highfloor pools in HK, it would have been icing on the cake. Also, tripadvisor lists one of the area for the hotel as odaiba, while odaiba is reachable from here by a 15/20 minute train ride, the hotel is in shinbashi/shiseido not odaiba.

There was a lingering smell of cologne and body odour and the carpet was filthy. I called down to the desk and asked about switching rooms. They sent someone up and he showed us three other rooms, all for a slightly higher cost per night but it was like night and day. Our new room, which was about $50 more per night (a savings from about $80 normally), was fantastic. It was huge with a massive bay window and amazing views from the 27th floor. The Thann Casa suite was very clean and had a nice big bathroom with good quality toiletries. There was a projector on the ceiling that you could turn on that had a fish pond video playing out on the top of the bedding (this is seriously hard to explain but was very cool). We could see the Tokyo Skytree from our room along so night time was great with all the lights. Overall the hotel is pretty good, the staff were a little weird at times and I wasn't crazy about the location so I would most likely never stay here again but the room was very nice for the last part of our Japan trip. I would recommend staying closer to main stations while in Tokyo and this hotel is a bit of a walk from Shinbashi station but it took another 5-10 minutes to wait for two different elevators to get to our room. As others mentioned, the lobby is on the 25th floor so you need to get up to there first with only one elevator operating.

We liked our room with bay view on the 30st floor (in my eyes, there's no need to pay extra for tokyo tower/city view, to look across the river to the bay and down to the nearby garden is very nice, just make sure you book a floor above 29th so that no other office building blocks your view. the lobby is in 25th floor, from 26th floor upwards are the guest rooms). Rooms are well equipped with safety box, water cooker plus tea and coffee making facilities, chairs, desk etc. and they provide very nice, high quality toiletries. We didn't try the (expensive) breakfast, there is a Family store in the (under)ground floor of the building where you can get food etc. Staff is very friendly and helpful, e.g. when it comes to make bookings at restaurants or help with directions.Only small things: As usual in modern high-rise buildings, there's no possiblity to open the window and let some air in (not even the option to open a window for some inches, as you sometimes can even on high floors). The bathroom/toilet had a little smell, which must have come from the drainage system, and I guess there is not much the hotel can do about it. The toilets (washlet style) are comparatiely old with not so many features, but that didn't bother us.The location is very good, as the hotel close to the railway and subway line, it is also close to the fishmarket. but the impression on the map is still a bit missleading, as this is a very urban area with flyovers and highways, so you have to walk up and down quite a bit to the to the railway platforms. also, you cannot just cross the road (in some places it is not even clear how to get to the otherside of a crossing and you have to walk quite some detours).

We stayed 3 days and this attitude never changed, it was all about what can we do for you? Starting on the 25th floor the views from our room were stunning. One morning at breakfast I was lucky enough to be enjoying the sumptuous buffet, looking out with Mt Fuji as a distant backdrop, this is rare as I was told it is normally a shy mountain that hides in the clouds.

We actually had two separate stays , each of one night, at the beginning and end of our trip and hence stayed in two different rooms . The rooms are not huge but perfectly adequate for short stays, and the Art rooms certainly make what would otherwise be a fairly in exciting room more interesting . We stayed in Cherry Blossom and it was lovely. We were offered complimentary Sake in our room which was a nice touch , and yukata style robes and slippers were provided. It was easy to get to the hotel from Narita airport- the so called Airport Limousine service ( actually a coach) serves this hotel amongst others in the city centre and takes about 90 mins in traffic. The hotel is also close to underground stations, and is ideally located for the shopping in Ginza just a few minutes walk away (Apple, Uniqlo, Chanel, Prada etc etc). The Japanese Restaurant in the lobby was good but expensive- I think there is a European restaurant too but didn't eat there. The bar is excellent-an offshoot of the Scottish Malt Whisky Society with a good selection of Japanese and Scottish whiskies , and the barman chisels ice impressively too!As everywhere in Japan the customer service was excellent. Although not luxurious by some standards I thought this hotel represented good value for money, in a good location and great service. I would definitely stay here again.

The impact on walking in is stunning - beautifully hand painted and very relaxing. the attention to detail was stunning, including a painting of Mt Fuji on the bathroom mirror. The hotel also sent us a bottle of sake as a thank you for booking the room - very appreciated after a long shinkansen journey! The queen rooms are compact, but we had plenty of room for our 2 huge cases and ridiculous amounts of other baggage we had accumulated.

The hotel itself is very lovely, our artist room was absolutely beautiful, and the views of Tokyo Tower from our room breathtaking, especially at night. We also were treated to complimentary sake upon arrival, a great touch! As elsewhere in Japan, everything was spotless. All that said, we felt a little less welcome here than in other locations in Japan. The staff were perfectly professional, but just not as warm and friendly as in other places we had visited over the prior week. I don't know if it was just because their usual clientele are business people or what, but it was a distinctly different vibe from other hotels/ryokans in which we had stayed. Breakfast buffet is solid, though small. Was surprised by the very Western dinner menu, including room service, but man, those BLTs were tasty! During our stay we also happened to meet one of the artists who was having an exhibition on our floor - what a fantastic guy, with beautiful work! Having local artists featured throughout the hotel was really nice. I also have to say that because this is a little more of a business/financial district, there wasn't QUITE as much right out the front door to explore as in other locations, and a little harder to find the convenience stores and such. However, it's still a short walk to the Hamrikyu Gardens and only about 15 minutes' walk to the Tsujiki Fish Market. I don't know that I'd stay here again, partly because it was a little further from what felt like the heart of all the city, and partly because of the strange, slightly uncomfortable vibe. But it was a beautiful place and a good stay. Oh and P.S. Free wifi in the rooms seems the norm in Japan - not so in the Western world, but what a great perk.","Glastonbury, Connecticut",9,4.0

The hotel is conveniently located (once you've managed to find it) with plenty of transport and food options in the immediate vicinity.The rooms are very small and the one we stayed in was very tired having a ragged carpet that was covered in stains and walls that were covered in scrape marks. Furniture was cheap and nasty although the bed was perfectly comfortable. There was little in the way of storage room and the safe was not the biggest we've ever come across. Wi-fi worked well in the room as did the air-conditioning. The bathroom was also tiny and again felt old and tired compared to most of the other places we stayed. This was sold to us as a ""First Class"" hotel but the room felt in desperate need of some refurbishment.The included breakfast was decent enough with a reasonable amount of choice but is just served in the lobby area which isn't particularly classy. The restaurants looked expensive and un-inspiring (both in terms of menu and ambience) so we gave them a miss and ate in some of the huge array of restaurants around the Ginza area. One evening we used the hotels cosy looking little bar but again it was a bit lifeless and lacking in atmosphere.Service was a bit mixed with some good and some not so good. For example, I went to reception to get some help to change our transfer arrangements back to Haneda but I was told that I should be doing stuff like that using the bedroom telephone. When the staff member finally agreed to help she made it clear that the phone call would be billed to our room. Not the sort of service we had to worry about at other places we stayed and rather poor for a ""First Class"" hotel.Overall this hotel is in a reasonably good location but with the poor state of the bedroom and the mixed service I'm sure there are better places to stay if you're in the Ginza area.","High Wycombe, United Kingdom",100,3.0

Located on the top floors of an office building in a business district, most rooms seem to offer fantastic views, but the Tokyo Tower rooms, with an unblocked view of the tower as well as Mount Fuji, probably offer some of the more compelling city views in Asia and can't be recommended highly enough. Room size is adequate...indeed quite reasonable by Tokyo standards. The bathroom, while simple enough, is extremely clean and offers all of the necessary amenities. Service is very efficient and friendly, and we were offered a free bottle of wine simply for signing up for the hotel's loyalty programme. Special mention to the very pleasant concierge who worked hard to accommodate a last-minute, relatively specific restaurant request and came through with flying colours, even going to the trouble of creating a customised map for us. The lobby sports a Michelin-listed French restaurant which offers very reasonable and high quality set meals for lunch, but be warned that you may feel a bit underdressed in tourist attire in comparison to the business lunch clientele on weekdays. On the whole, a very good value for money option at around sgd250/night in Tokyo that is surprisingly well located for tourists yet is not subjected to the ever-present crowds of some of the more well-known districts. random tip...Ramen counter around the corner on the way to Shimbashi station (ground level...the name is in Japanese but it says 'want garlic?' underneath for some reason) was a nice find, with a massive bowl of high quality ramen running about 700 yen.","Singapore, Singapore",49,5.0

Shiodome literally means “halt the tides”The Park hotel with its vaulted atrium and achingly cool bars, houses art exhibitions regularly in its public spaces but it also has some very special hotel rooms indeed.One entire floor of the hotel has been given over to the Artist in Hotel project which began in December 2012. Each room on the 31st floor is being decorated with a work of art by a Japanese artist. This project is well underway and we were treated to a view of some of the amazing rooms.Broadly themed on ""Japanese aesthetics,"" artists draw on the walls and decorate the rooms with their original paintings and art objects. A finished Artist Room is a pure art form encapsulating the creator's passion and views.Themes for the rooms include the Dragon room where a great fiery beast curls around the walls, and the Zen room which is very spiritual and peaceful. One artwork is inspired by the might of the Sumo wrestler, one by the beauty of the Cherry Blossom season. Another room becomes a forest of bamboo and one a colorful public bathhouse complete with views of Mount Fuji and comic characters taking a dip in the waters.My personal favourite was the most recently completed artist’s room ‘Geisha goldfish’ which took the artist Aki Narita seven months to complete. It is a beautiful series of murals which cover the walls of the entire room. The colourful Geisha keep watch over the bed in the centre of the room and the bright red goldfish swim all over the walls, the ceiling and even off into the bathroom!Ms Narita said “When I looked out of the window, I felt like I was inside an aquarium.”The fish give the feeling of floating and in ancient times a dream of being in a room surrounded by goldfish that are lucky charms would bring good luck to the customers who stayed there. It is stunning.Another favourite was the Zodiac room where painter Ryosuke Yasumoto decorated a room themed on the 12 signs of the Zodiac, while staying at the hotel for 11 days last year. ""I will be happy if the guests can sense the world of the humorous, old folk tale of the 12 signs of the Zodiac,"" said Yasumoto about the room filled with lively images of the animals.The cat and weasel, which are not included in the 12 signs but appeared in the folk tale about how they missed out on being chosen, are included in the room decoration. Yasumoto makes the most of the three-dimensional canvas and visitors lying on the bed can make eye contact with the tiger painted on the back wall through a mirror or spot a monkey hiding behind the curtain.Every room in the Park Hotel has its own fabulous view out over this unique city. Right outside the hotel is a first class view of the famous Tokyo tower which is modelled on the Eiffel tower in Paris. The tower has its own impressive illuminations at night and it stands out among the stunning space age skyline. At 333m high it is 13m taller than the French tower and is a symbol of the city’s post WWII re birth. It looks rather retro among the other ultra-modern buildings.The hotel is in a great location close to the world renowned shopping district of Ginza with lots of up market stores (including the biggest Uniqlo in japan) and there are also lots of art galleries and theatres nearby including the Kabuki-za Theatre.By contrast, just around the corner under the railway tracks near Shimbasi station is a network of little alleyways with tiny stand up bars and restaurants where crowds of office workers descend to eat drink and talk. Another fascinating snapshot of alternative Japanese culture.The staff at the Park Hotel make you feel very welcome indeed. They are super attentive, have very good English and are actually quite charming. One lady on the desk even apologised for our recent earthquake experience! If you are going to the Far East I cannot recommend this fabulous hotel highly enough for your very own lost in translation experience.Check out my blog at Eccentric England for some gorgeous pics of the rooms","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",1,5.0

The Conrad next door, has the lounge area with the top view. Their designer made the better choice I would say. The sun umbrella's in the lobby, what they are doing there is a mystery.

The room was great except for bedside lights that cannot be turned on or off when in bed!! Smart designing.The restaurant in the lobby is an over designed disaster. The chairs for most of it are between Japanese seating and western type seating - so you sit about 12"" off the floor. This makes eating totally uncomfortable.

Food is overpriced but so are 99% of other hotels.

Getting sidetracked here lol. The quality of room service was very good and the breakfast buffet also was good quality. I spent quite a few hours in the cocktail bar which has an awesome view of Tokyo's business & shopping district. The prices for drinks was cheap when compared to my city of Melbourne ($25AUD for an Appletini??). My room was a Queen with a view of the Tokyo Skytree and it looked amazing at night, so very happy with that and the quality of the bed and fittings in my room. WiFi also in every room with very good speeds.I also think it's great that the hotel is supporting local artists with their work displayed throughout the hotel and in peoples rooms (higher price) and in the smoking room.

We actually have the good fortune of unknowingly ran into Yoshiaki Hayashi San, Director and General Manager of the hotel, when we asked him for directions to the Zojoji Temple.

First off, the staff is so amazing! As soon as we walked in, they welcomed us and took our bags. They even held our bags for 2 days while we went to kyoto even though we were not checking in until we got back. They were focused on their guests and providing them with the best service. The only downfall for us is that the dinner was over priced for the amount of food we received. But there are SO MANY restaurants nearby to compensate for that one little downfall. We walked to Imperial Palace, The Fish Market, Ginza District (which has tons of food), Hibaya Park, and the Himaruku Gardens. The subway is very close by. But why this made our stay incredible is because of the VIEW from the rooms. Pay a little extra and that the view of the tokyo tower. TRUST ME!!! this isn't an average view. ITs an amazing view because the rooms start from the 26th floor so you are high up and also there is a windowsill in the room and you can read or just relax near the window with an amazing view of the tokyo tower. Even though the room is smaller than we are used to, it just didnt matter. The rooms are so cozy and the hotel itself is very modern and very conveniently located. Keep in mind that to go to the fish market, you have to be there by 4 am or earlier and there are no subways running at that time. So you pretty much have to stay at a hotel that is walking distance (like this one) or take a taxi. Also, this hotel is near a ton of malls, and highrise buildings which have plenty of food options if you don't want to take a 15 minute walk to Ginza. Really Really recommend this hotel and for the price, the view is just unbeatable. Free Wifi too!","San Francisco, California",3,5.0

Sorry but I can't remember his name. He was friendly and spoke good English.The transfer took around 30 minutes. Narrita is further. We pulled up and hotel staff promptly offloaded our bags while our guide took us to check-in which was done quickly and by friendly staff. We ate breakfast there each day. It is served buffet style with a range of Japanese and western food on offer. A good chance to try something new.The hotel is located around a 10 minute walk from the Tokyo version of Bond Street. So lots of shopping and dining options within easy reach. Public transport to explore the city and further are easy to get to.Our room was small by UK standards but I gather Tokyo land prices are very high.

The amenities were everything I would expect from a hotel of this calibre and the location is prime. 5-7 minute walk to the subway/JR trains via the means of a covered walkway which helps when its snowing/raining out. The reception staff were welcoming and happy to help with directions if we needed them. The bed was just amazing... not sure if it's because we had been staying traditional prior to our stay at this hotel, so any mattress would have been splendid, but this one was pretty perfect.

We had some trouble buying train tickets from the JR ticket station since they don't take US credit cards so the concierge at the hotel did buy it for us and charged to the hotel.

Or was there a change in management? In any case, the experience was different. During my first visit, the staff sought solutions like the best hotels (and businesses in general) of the world do. They went the extra mile to do so. This time, they just recited policy. There were 3 of us in our troop, arriving in Tokyo at different times. Many days in advance I asked the hotel to arrange an early check-in for my colleague. All I received in return was an explanation of policy and the recommendation of a non-option... to change the reservation to check in a day earlier earlier, thus buying an additional room-night. The morning of his arrival, I inquired about the status of the early check-in. They had no record of it and proceeded to recite policy again. The room I had was extremely small. Not worth the price I paid. But the really BIG turn-off was this... Our meeting schedule changed and we had to overnight in Nagoya. We had to change our reservation from 5 days straight to 4 days with a 1-day gap in the middle. They took advantage of this and charged a higher rate for the rooms after the re-checkin. One of the keys to maintaining a long-term business relationship is this:In any and every negotiation, never go for the last coin on the table. Leave it. They went for the last coin and thereby lost our trust. They chose greed over partnership. Nobody even asked if we would often be in Tokyo in the future. On a positive note, The views are great.

One thing to be aware of is that the hotel is on the 25th floor of the ?Media Tower and if you are dropped off by taxi/shuttle is that you will have to carry your cases up in the lift on your own so might be worthwhile if you have a stack of cases for one of you to go up in the lift and get one of the porters to come down with a Hotel Trolley.We arrived early but the Hotel asked us to come back at 12:00pm (and to leave our luggage there whilst room was being finalised) and we simply took a short walk to Hama Rikyu Gardens which was no hardship!Room was too small for us - we were on the end of a four week tour of New Zealand and had two cases and three bags. Room we had would be ideal for someone with modest luggage or using the luggage forwarding service NAME and just taking a small bag to this Hotel.

It is situated right above Shiodome Station (Oedo Line) with direct access from the elevators and Shinbashi (Ginza & Asakusa Lines) is easily accessible through the pedestrian underpass (just beyond Shiodome). Tsukiji Market was just one stop on the Oedo line from Shiodome and we found it very easy to get everywhere else mainly using Shinbashi.

We had a City twin room which wasn't huge although that seems to be the case throughout Japan with some exceptions. The bed was comfortable (although the pillows were a bit hard for our tastes). We didn't sleep terribly well but I think that was due to jet lag rather than the room or bed. It seemed quiet enough although you could hear the trains passing through the station which is adjacent to the hotel but this wasn't enough to prevent us getting off to sleep. The hotel is labelled as an ""art hotel"" and there were various installations/exhibitions in the lobby while we were there.Restaurants included a French restaurant (which we tried and found that to be very good although purists might nitpick about whether the menu was entirely French. We had a decent bottle of red wine which, thankfully, was not served chilled as everywhere else we ate served red wine VERY chilled unless you specifically ask for it not to be. We found prices reasonable for a large hotel. There is also a Japanese restaurant which we had planned to eat in but this was full on the evening we tried to get a table, so it may be better to book if you are keen to try this restaurant. There is also a cafe area in the lobby where light meals and drinks are available. It took us a while to find the bar which is through an entrance at the back of the lobby area. However, the bar staff made excellent cocktails and there are floor to ceiling windows offering great views over the Tokyo skyline. The only real negative aspect was the service in the cafe area. There seemed to be quite a few waiting staff standing around but without any direction and it seemed a little chaotic. All the staff were pleasant and helpful but communication can be difficult as few people speak much English (I put my hand up - my Japanese is virtually non-existent) even in the hospitality business.Breakfast is served buffet-style in the lobby area with a good choice of different dishes available.All in all we had a very good experience at this hotel.",east midlands,76,4.0

Ginza is also close by - so very convenient for shopping. The area around the hotel has not much to recommend, other than the wonderful Humarikyu Gardens and the interesting fish Market. One of the recommended trips is actually to reach the Gardens from Asakusa- your ticket will include access to the Gardens. The hotel is pretty average starting from floor 25 of Shiodome, As in many Japanese hotels the rooms are quite small - we did not have space for our luggage, but the bathrooms well proportioned. You pay extra if you have a room with a Tower view but there is really no need to do this. In fact these rooms are more noisy as they are exposed to the trains at the station.  The hotel does not have any real facilities other than a restaurant and a bar. The latter is well stocked but terribly expensive. There is a variety of options for drinking around Shiodome so you do not really need to use the hotel bar. The breakfast is a nice mix of Western and Japanese food and what I liked most was the fact that the buffet changed daily. The quality of the produce was excellent. The staff are very helpful, with excellent English, especially the Nepali concierge. In conclusion this is a middle of the range hotel with small rooms and in general with little to offer. It is conveniently located and very clean.","Edinburgh, UK",653,3.0

We stayed at the Park Hotel Tokyo 4 nights. Before our arrival, I emailed the Hotel Concierge asking for information, direction, restaurant recommendation, etc... They always quickly responded back to all of my questions in very detail. Upon arrival to the hotel, all of the staffs were greeting us with a smile and very politely with a bow. Checking in was very quick and easy. The front desk staff also provided printout of map and direction from Hotel Concierge of places that I inquired in emails to Hotel Concierge. They were so well prepared everything for us already. The young lady helped us with our luggages to our room. She showed us our room, and explained features and amenities. She then came back with a bottle of Champagne, a compliment from hotel for our anniversary. The room size is big in Japanese standard. It is actually bigger than 4-star hotel that we rented in Time Square, New York. The room was very clean and smelled good. Room amenities includes everything you need: razor and shaving cream, dental kit, hair brush, and so much more. In room, we has a kettle to boil water for coffee and tea, a small refrigerator for mini bar. The bathroom is good size. The bathroom has things that we don't have in the US: a defrosted mirror, a control panel for toilet seat warmer, water spray, and flush. The hotel location is excellent, especially for us to walk 40 minutes at 3:00 AM to see the Tuna Auction at Tsukiji Fish Market. At 3:00 AM, there is no subway available and taxi would cost too much. The Shimbashi Station is ten minutes walk connecting to the hotel's basement. The Shiodome Station is right below the hotel basement. From these two stations, you can take different subway lines to anywhere in Tokyo. It is very convenient, cost saving, time saving, and most efficient ways for transportation in Tokyo. The hotel has currency exchange machine in the lobby on 25th floor. It has a great view of Tokyo Tower from the lobby as well. The hotel has free wi-fi which was great for us to stay connected with our children at home. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was excellent with variety of both Japanese and American food choices. We tried almost everything and all tasted very, very good. There is a convenient Family Mart right below the hotel to get some snacks and drink. During our stay, all hotel staffs were so excellent, very polite, and extremely helpful with anything we need. They all can speak English very well. One thing that make this hotel so excellent than the other two hotels that we stayed in Kyoto and Osaka is the Park Hotel Tokyo has ready made map with directions of all popular attractions. This is our first trip to Japan. The Park Hotel Tokyo has made our trip so wonderful and memorial. Thank you so much to ALL of your staffs, especially thank you Ms. Nozomi Shimose and Ms. Mana Yoshihara. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone who plan to visit Tokyo. We will definitely stay at this hotel again whenever we can come back for vacation.",Texas,19,5.0

Well, to be honnest... because there are four hotels in Shiodome and I already tried the other three. I wanted to complete the set. Also: the Shiodome area is a very strategic place to stay. It is very well connected to big stations and it's on walking distance from Ginza (shopping area). But after staying I certainly appreciate this hotel. Of the four hotels in Shiodome, it offers the best product for the price.The lobby looks a bit odd. It is jam packed with furniture, making it hard to see what is part of the lobby or one of the in-house restaurants. The result: it is empty most of the time due to general confusion by the public. Check-in was quick and easy and the service like a 5 star hotel. Such hospitality! The rooms are fairly spacious and have a modern, Japanese / Scandinavian decor.Wifi is free and rather quick. I paid a bit extra for a ""city view room"" and indeed the view was jaw dropping! Tokyo Tower was right in front with Mount Fuji in the background on clear days. My camera was so happy with this room!Some things I did not like were the bathroom with a stand in the tub shower at breast height. I know the Japanese are not as tall as the Europeans, but why can't they build a European size bathroom in a hotel for foreign guests? Also, the safe deposit box is too small for the average laptop.","Tokyo, Japan",291,4.0

The Hotel is located nearby the Ginza area which is great to explore, plus being so close to numerous metro lines this hotel is well located to explore the city.Room – we stayed in a standard room. The room was well priced, very comfortable, clean and included great amenities. All round a very high quality room for the rate we payed.Amenities – the lobby is very nice with great views over Tokyo incluing the Tokyo tower. We didn’t dine at the restaurant or use any other amenities as we were only there for two nights. We decided not to select breakfast with the room as it was expensive at the time of booking (USD $50pp) compared to what you can find at cafes nearby.Staff – the staff at the hotel were VERY helpful, polite and treated us very well.

An incredible view you will struggle to beat anywhere, particularly at night with the tower lit up.All floors of the hotel are higher than the 25th level, so you are guaranteed a view of some sort. If you stay here, you will have the option of paying a bit more for a room that looks out over Tokyo Tower - I would recommend taking them up on this. You only live once and the memories of waking up to the tower and possibly Mount Fuji behind it will last forever. Seeing Mount Fuji will depend on the weather.The rooms are comfortable, modern, and reasonably sized. They contain all of the amenities you would expect and a sound bathroom. Until arriving I did not know a toilet could do so many things, though I won't go into the details.There are a few dining options on the lobby floor. We ate there a couple of times and honestly found the food to be on the average side. I think the Park Hotel has missed a trick by not putting a top class restaurant on one of the higher floors utilising that unforgettable view. Other hotels we stayed in offered better dining in better settings.The location is another good point - ideally placed for Ginza, Odaiba, the Tsukiji Fish Market and of course Tokyo Tower. This may be the absolutely perfect location for you and it may not - it all depends on what things you are mainly interested in. However, you can get on the Metro without leaving the building so nothing is really that far away. It is worth noting that the hotel is part of a mammoth complex and it can be quite hard to actually find your way in or out. Do your homework on the mapping of the area beforehand if you can.I would have to recommend the Park Hotel. It is far from a budget option, but in return for your yen you will get a slick, modern base for your adventure in this wonderful city.","Neath Port Talbot, United Kingdom",46,4.0

There you begin to see the different artwork. If you're not a fan of art, or appreciate art in any form then I don't think you'd care for the displays, etc. Anyways, our room had rose petals painted on the walls as its design.

Reading some reviews, I was worried that smoking smell might be an issue. It turns out that they will only have non-smoking rooms from April 2015 so they're transitioning to a more non-smoker-friendly hotel I guess. I didn't smell any smoke during my stay there. Since our visit was quite short, we needed some help in getting dinner reservations and not wasting time waiting in line for a table or, worse, getting turned away. Ms. Yoshihara and Ms. Shimose were excellent at arranging dinner reservations and replying to our emails. We specifically asked for bars/restaurants where they do not allow any smoking. Whether or not a restaurant allows smoking is hard to figure out on the internet for an outsider. (At least it was for us.) They were immensely helpful in that aspect and suggested very lovely and fitting places. They also looked at some of the places we wanted to go to and told us which ones were non-smoking. If you're worried about your dinner or drinks getting ruined by cigarette smoke, it's very nice to know that that won't happen. Also, I stupidly forced one of my chargers into the weird/curvy outlet behind the TV and it turns out it was a locking outlet. (Now I know what a locking outlet is! Sorry!) So when it was time to check out, I couldn't get my charger out. They sent someone up to get it out right away and it looked like it was quite an ordeal. Of course, the employee apologized profusely and put in an adapter so it won't happen to the next guests. :)Room was squeaky clean. Everyone working at the hotel spoke great English.

The lobby is terribly cluttered with dated looking furniture, obscure art exhibits, and leftover Christmas decorations. Rooms are for the most part very small for a hotel in this price range. They lack any finesse or charm. Furniture is simple and somewhat worn. Beds are still in good shape, and the room was sufficiently clean. But generally, business hotels in Tokyo costing half as much are built to higher standards. The hotel’s location is good if your business is nearby, with quick access to Haneda. Otherwise the Shiodome area - built up in the early 2000’s - is rather sterile, particularly at night. If it’s a view you’re after, you might want to consider the nearby Mitsui Garden Ginza Premier.

It is only about 3 mins walk to Ginza as well. It is THE perfect location without the crowds you'd find at Shibuya, Ueno or Shinjuku, etc.The views from our room (Tokyo Tower Queen Room, i think that's what it's called) was just stunning that we didn't bother with any observatories or sky bars. You will never want to leave the room just for that view (try to get the city view room facing Tokyo Tower). The room is very clean and well-equipped with hair dryer and Thann brand toiletries. While the room was not huge, it was good size for two people.The concierge was just amazing with all our various requests such as helping us book restaurants, calling our next hotel for pick-up from the train station. Not only that they are very helpful, they are very quick in responding to our requests e.g. we were informed of gift items without having to ask(we got a free, small bottle of wine for 3 nights stay), the iron and board were brought to the room within 5-10 mins of calling the front desk. We also went to the bar there (good views of the city from there too) and I had the best green tea to go with my o-sake. There is also a discount for the hotel guests for the french restaurant, Tateru Yoshino. I thought I'd never say this about a bowl of carrot soup but it was just out of the world!!The only small compliant I have is the pillows. They are a bit small and not comfy enough. but we experienced the same thing in another hotel too. Maybe it's a cultural thing?Totally recommend this hotel. If you happen to choose this hotel for your stay, take these walking directions from Shimbashi station especially if you have a lot of luggage with you. This route will be the fastest and have lift access from the station to the hotel.- Assuming that you have arrived at Shimbashi station on Yamanote Line ( as most tourists will take Narita Express from the Airport to Tokyo Station), take the Ginza exit and walk diagonally to the right for about 10 seconds until you see the old Shimbashi station. - Take the escalator going up and walk straight. You will walk past Starbucks if you have taken the right-hand path. - after 10 seconds, you will see a connecting bridge on the right hand side to a tall building. Walk along the bridge and at the end of the bridge, you see a big clock and another overhead bridge / pedestrian deck ( above the intersection below) connecting to Shiodome Media Tower where Park Hotel is located. The overhead bridge will take you to the level 3 of that building where you can take the lift to the lobby level of the hotel. if you are looking to have a quick, inexpensive bite, there's a ramen shop that serves up big portions of delicious Tonkatsu ramen for 600-700 yen. From the hotel, go down to level 3, take pedestrian deck and walk down the stairs instead of walking towards to the big clock. Walk for about 100 meters and you will be able to see the shop diagonally to your right. It's still on the way to Shimbashi station and you will see it if you don't take the elevated way.","Singapore, Singapore",32,5.0

Good, clean hotel, efficient, helpful staff. Convenient location for train access etc. We were offered a room upgrade on checking in, a Tower view room for 2000 Yen per night, which we took. So glad we did as we were treated to fabulous views of Mount Fuji on most of our 7 night stay. Lots of photos, sunrise, sunset and everything inbetween! The complimentary tea and coffee provided in the room were surprisingly good, although not too keen on powdered milk to go with it. Lots of good quality toiletries and other useful items in the bathroom, even a spare hairbrush! One criticism we would have is that the hotel bar is not a non-smoking area, something we did not realise until we were settled at the window with our drinks and a gentleman arrived and lit up a particularly strong smelling cigarette. Haven't downed a glass of wine so fast before! For the rest of our stay we bought a very reasonably priced bottle of wine from the convenience store in the basement each eveving and enjoyed it in our room, looking at the view. We had booked a room only deal so did not try the breakfast, however, there is a wonderful bakery down in the underground station walkway complex where we got fresh pastries and good coffee each morning, served by lovely, friendly ladies. On our last morning, laden with our suitcases and heading for the train to the airport we stopped by for our final breakfast. The serving lady popped out and came up to us as we were looking at the shelves and said that she recognised us from previous mornings and apologised that they did not have the pastries she had noticed that we usually took.

The Japanese very cleverly use some of these buildings for hotels and restaurants by employing the top floors and thus boasting wonderful views of Tokyo. The Park Hotel is one of the better attempts to apply this strategy. The lobby is on the 25th floor with rooms located on floors 26-34. Views are terrific with either Tokyo Tower or Mt. Fuji (on a very clear day) visible according to the room's location. The rooms themselves are comfortable and sufficiently roomy (though placed within the context of Tokyo). In the same way that one doesn't expect large hotel rooms in London and New York, only the overly optimistic or wealthy expect expansive rooms in Tokyo.Cleanliness and service is quite high as is expected at a Japanese hotel. Most of the staff seems to have either fairly good or even excellent English and will go out of their way to assist. The area in which the hotel is situated is sort of curious. As Gertrude Stein said of Oakland California, 'There is no there, there."" Meaning that you will not want to spend too much time in the immediate area although there are numerous restaurants ranging in price within a five minute walk so there is no necessity to travel. However both Ginza and the fish market are short walks away from the hotel. Another short walk will take you to Hama-rikyu Gardens which are well worth exploring. Moreover, the hotel are within short walks of a number of train and subway lines making the hotel an ideal starting point to explore Tokyo.From either airport the hotel can be reached directly by limousine bus. If you arrive or have to depart at times when the buses are not running the hotel is fairly easy to reach via the trains running from both airports. However some care needs to be taken when one arrives at the hotel's vicinity. The area is served by a maze of overpasses and subterranean routes. It is easy to become confused when traveling these routes with sign posting less than obvious. Be sure to get explicit directions from the hotel's website.I simply got a particularly good deal on my hotel room With value for money I was not expecting to be disappointed.

The staff is polite and friendly, although a bit cumbersome sometimes, specially when English is involved, and that can be tricky sometimes. They let us do an early check in with no trouble and with the most courteous manners.The room was a bit on the small side but cozy and comfortable. The bathroom was small but manageable.This is a smart hotel, makes you feel at ease, where you can rest and enjoy Tokyo. Maybe a bit expensive.Breakfast is served in a large airy space, and it's good and not overpriced.","Mexico City, Mexico",84,4.0

The hotel is well located within a business (towers) area, so there is restaurants and some shops in the bottom of the towers. Also the Shiodome have additional small shops. The hotel is within 2 minutes of subway and train stations. I used the JR Yamanote that is making a circle connecting the major quarters in Tokyo. Using a day pass (approx 8 dollars) to can reach key location easy without complications. Also this one is also in English so easier to understand with limited Japanese skills. Taxis are ok for the airport (Haneda) but a bit expensive, I think it's simple for arrival and departure but that's it, the train is excellent, I really liked the Yamanote. The personnel was very nice on my arrival on 15 December especially after a 13hrs flight from Canada. I had a corner room on the 29 floor and had a very nice view of the Sky three and building area with lights at night. The room was very spacious even in North American standards. Nice bed and everything very clean. The wireless internet was fast and TV had typical Japanese channels, interesting to look at a bit. The breakfast was too expensive for my taste and after one day I decided to buy some items at the 7eleven below the hotel and eat close to the main shops around train stations. There is also a little bakery at the bottom of the hotel but close on weekends. You are in walking distance to the Fish market, Tokyo tower, Ginza stores and a Zojoji temple. If you want to shop, I liked the Shimbashi, Yurakucha (close to Ginza and have movie theatre in case of a rainy day, subtitled. ) and the Akihabara. Shibuya could be nice, but not on weekend and evening as it's very crowded. Historic locations are a must; especially the Imperial Palace and different temples.","Ottawa, Canada",52,5.0

Check-in and check-out was a breeze (maybe I just missed the rush) but do expect the process to take a little longer than what we're used to in North America.The room itself was large in size by Japan standard and small to average by North American standard. We opted for the Premier king (two twins joined together) with a wonderful view of the Tokyo Tower and Mount Fuji in the morning. It was quite something waking up to the view of both in bed. Only downsides were the somewhat dirty carpet and the room had the smallest hint of cigarette smoke but not noticable after the first night.With so many places to explore in Tokyo, we didn't utilize any of the restaurants or lounges. For breakfast, we saved some money by heading down to the convenience store (Family Mart) at the basement level and picked up some food there instead.

The hotel is located in the Shiodome where it is a complex of offices. It can be quiet in the evening but It is super convenient.

This hotel is close to the Shiodome and Shinbashi metro stations on the Yamanote Line which makes Sibuya and Ebisu and Shinjuku a subway ride away. All attractions will typically be a subway ride away, but the hotel is effectively connected to the Shiodome station. The Trsukiji fish market is walking distance from the hotel. The lobby was quite nice although there were not too many places to take advantage of the view. The room was typically small for Japan, and I had a room overlooking the station. This was my first time in Tokyo, so the concept of a hotel in the middle of a skyscraper is a bit new, but kinda cool and definitely common in Japan. The Shinbashi district is within walking distance, but that's not specifically a tourist area but you can get a good amount of cultural immersion along with the business-folk blowing off some steam after work.

This is good location, walking distance to the Ginza shopping district and the fish market, and subway rides to everywhere else. The hotel is in the top floors of a business tower, and is located among other business buildings for the most part. But everything you need will be in the subway walkways if not above ground. You will walk a lot in this city, even for subways. Conveniently, this hotel is right above the Shiodome station, but it isn't a major station, so you will need to transfer when you venture out most days. The hotel itself seemed to be mostly business travelers with a good share of tourists. The staff is very polite and the service is excellent. There is a bar with city views and smoking, so you might get an occasional waft of it if that bothers you. I brought small children and we had no issues.

The lobby of the hotel is not on the ground floor. It is on the 25th floor. The way to the lifts is through the bright, airy lobby of the Shiodome Media Tower in which there were 2 interesting exhibits: 1 on political cartoons, the other on the history-making events of the post war world as recorded by the cameras of the news agency housed in the tower. Both are fascinating. Several sensory surprises await you 25 floors up. I will not spoil them by describing them here. I'll just put it this way... It's a lobby one looks forward to spending time in. The staff is lovely and helpful. Most speak English well enough to be helpful. But, the main thing is the sincerity. During my 5 days there, I never encountered that politeness-as-a-duty behavior that I experienced in every other hotel in Japan. They must have some special recruiting technique to hire those who are helpful and polite just because they want to be. My room was one of the ""artist rooms"". Again, I will not ruin the surprise for you. I will just say that I smiled every time I entered the room. It was a joy just to sit there admiring the walls as well as the view of Tokyo from 31 floors above the action. Breakfast is quite good.

Fuji (which is usually an elusive presence). Rooms are medium-sized and have the usual 4-5 star hotel amenities: slippers, in-room coffee and tea, safe, mini-bar, sleeping kimono, free Wi-Fi. The bathroom is small but includes an all-service toilet that turns out to be standard in many Japanese facilities. Fortunately the buttons for flushing and more intimate cleansing activities are easily de-codable. There's a small but functional business center that meets basic needs (Macs, not PCs). Ground floor and basement of the building have a daytime café and a 24-hour mini-mart; the metro/train station complexes have many little shops selling food, clothing and other items. Compared to the coldly impersonal Conrad, Royal Park, Intercontinental (Roppongi) and Imperial Hotel lobbies we visited, the Park Hotel is warmly welcoming, almost cozy by Tokyo standards. Staff are very helpful, polite and gracious. Breakfast and light dinners in the lounge are very good, with a sufficient selection of western and Asian food. In fact, the croissants and Danish pastries are so yummy that I saw guests every morning standing by the bread baskets wolfing down the ones with chocolate chips without bothering to go to their tables. The two on-site restaurants - Tatero Yoshino (TY) Bis (fairly cutting edge French cuisine) and Hanasanshou (kaiseki-style Japanese) - are excellent. Food quality and presentation at both are worth the prices and if you're a Casablanca fan you'll be able to lipsync ""Play it Sam,"" with Ingrid Bergman and ""Here's looking at you kid,"" with Humphrey Bogart while the film plays silently on one of the walls in TY Bis.For touring, the hotel is well located right above the Shiodome Japan Rail station which goes directly to the Oeno circular city line that stops at Tokyo Station; an easy walk through the sky-scraper complex of Shiodome takes you to Shimbashi station where multiple metro and private train lines connect. You could walk to the Tsukiji Fish market for the early morning tuna auction (hotel recommends leaving at 4:00 am to get one of the 120 spots available to tourist viewing) or skip the auction, wait until the metro starts running and ride up to the market's entrance, one stop away. Worthwhile visit, by the way, to see what it takes to put that piece of sashimi or sushi on your plate.For visitors who take Sunrise Tours of Mt. Fuji and other places, the good news is that the company picks you up at the hotel. The airport bus does too. Driving may be a bit of a challenge because we did have one or two cab drivers who needed to resort to their GPS to find the hotel entrance. It's in the Media Tower on floors 29-34.We were delighted with our stay and glad we chose this hotel over some of the better known similarly priced places.","Los Angeles, California",52,5.0

The fitness center was outstanding with the equipment on both sides of the pool on the 47th floor. We ate at the Japanese restaurant which was very good.

Breakfast included a good range of 'Western' and Asian foods.Staff at the hotel were friendly and efficient and helped make our stay there a delightful experience.Nearby, there is 'label' shopping and also a lovely park. Really good signage, in English, is a great aid in finding your way around, as too is the very friendly and helpful nature of the Japanese people we met.

We stayed in room 2901 - Corner King with Tokyo Tower and Skyline view. Honestly, I think this was the least exciting corner king room they had available and was not as glamourous looking as the photos on the website. If you're going to stay here and get a corner king, get one on the other side of the hotel. I think the skyline on that side is ""better"" and more ""glamourous"".Let's start with the PROs:Breathtaking views of the Tokyo skyline, including Tokyo TowerConveniently located right by three (3!!!) train stations - Shimbashi, Shiodome, and YurikamomeSurprisingly delish candy dish in the lobbyGorgeous lobbySpacious room (well, by Japanese standards)For the most part, the staff were super friendly - exactly what you'd expect from a property that bills itself as a ""luxury hotel""Free Wifi that worked GREAT!!CONs:The guy who checked us in did not represent the hotel well or display typical Japanese hospitality. He seemed genuinely disengaged. I know this probably seems trivial and had we been at an American hotel, I would have been like ""whatever"" about it, but that's cause service in America sucks compared to Japan...so basically, I expected more.We had a room with million dollar views, but unfortunately, the room itself did not reflect that. It's outdated and the carpet along the wall with the windows were torn up and the caulking around the bathtub (top) was not done properly. Again, little details, but when you're paying a premium, you notice those things.The hallways smell of an ""old"" hotel...basically, all I kept thinking was ""this is an outdated hotel with an updated facade and lobby"". I'm sure their suites are much nicer than the room I stayed in, but given that we were in an upgraded room, I can't imagine the hotel has THAT many ""fancy, schmancy"" rooms...does that make sense?So, in conclusion -- while the over all stay wasn't horrible, it is not worth the $300+ price tag to have a ""room with a view"" when the rooms are outdated and you can get equally delicious views and a more updated room in an EVEN MORE conveniently located area (like Shibuya or Shinjuku) for about $50 more (average)...like at the Cerulean Tokyu Tower.","Washington, District of Columbia, United States",19,3.0

So we thought that location was everything. When we looked at prices and reviews, we thought this hotel looked good value. Then we realised that the rooms start on the 25th floor with some amazing views.We paid extra for a Tokyo Tower facing corner room (about £40/$60 a night more?) and it was worth it. We were on the 33rd floor and every time we went back to the room, we just went ""wow"". The room was spacious with an enormous (king+) bed plus four wall to ceiling windows. Smart bathroom, safe and mini-bar (why?). All very good.We had the buffet breakfast once - it was pretty good, lots of variety and a relaxed atmosphere.The only downside is actually the location. Despite it being on top of one subway line and only 5 minutes from about three others, it really means that you have to work out the complicated subway system to get anywhere. Once we'd worked out the Suica card system (touch-in / out, e-card) cost between £1-2 ($2-3) and location was ok. The biggest problem we had was our last evening in the Ginza area (just on the edge of the hotel) which is clearly a business district. We found it hard to find a restaurant - lots there but full of business people and quite a lot of them are on the 4/5/6th floors making it hard to choose one without having to go into a lift etc etc.Overall, a lovely hotel and we would definitely re-visit and recommend","Aylesbury, United Kingdom",62,4.0

For breakfast you can choose between Japanese food and the normal croissant / bread. I think that the breakfast is where you can see that this is a 4 start hotel and not a 5 start, it's a bit poor, but I think it has more to do with the space available.

It was great to see the Shinkansen travelling through Shimbashi station which runs practically under the hotel, at all times of day and night. The hotel was silent though- no noise from anywhere, except the odd rumble of thunder from an overhead thunderstorm! Amazing to watch the frequent lightening strikes from our window. If views are your thing, the reception has pretty cool view of the Tokyo Tower and we did see Mount Fuji to the right of it in the haze.There were lots of pluses and a few minuses to this hotel. Room was great, as was the reception service. In particular we needed to forward our luggage to a hotel Hiroshima- 3 huge cases- and this was done with no fuss for an amazing 12 pounds or so. Breakfast was pretty good, though can get busy and we ended up in a side room, which obviously hadn't been cleaned from dinners the night before- table clothes were grubby for example. Staff in the breakfast /bar area a bit miserable- and getting service for a drink in the early evening was a bit tricky. Happy hour drinks were pretty good value- about 800 yen for big beer. Drinks prices later in the evening were astronomical- but it is a hotel after all. Don't even ask what two single G&Ts cost.

Upon Check in we were told that the two rooms we had booked were on two completely different floors. When we asked if we could have that changed we were told 'no'- that was until we asked for a Tower view room which came at an extra 2000 Yen per room/night which then surprisingly meant they could accommodate us on the same floor... The Tower View room was very nice with a great view especially at night, although for some reason the Tower lights turned off at 22:00 and came back on at 22:30. The rooms although small were kept clean and tidy and had all the necessary amenities one might require. The only minor point in the room was that there were no complimentary water bottles.Breakfast at the hotel was satisfactory. The selection was ok for Western and Asian tastes however on hindsight I feel that possibly having breakfast in one of the cafes outside might have been cheaper and better quality. The biggest problem at breakfast was the lack of staff cleaning the tables, meaning dirty plates were left for over 10 minutes on people's tables, whilst the senior staff stood at the entrance to Breakfast looking at their watches. One thing I was not happy about was eating breakfast in the hotel lobby/atrium as whilst eating, many people would walk in and out of the hotel. Also, there was no view of the city which is one of the biggest selling points of the hotel!!The hotel's location above Shiodome Station and under a 10 minute walk from Shimbashi station makes it an ideal base for touring Tokyo as a tourist or for Business.","London, United Kingdom",40,4.0

We had the Tower view King room - which was small but with wall to wall glass & view it felt big enough. The bed was very comfortable, the location was great and the staff couldn't have been more helpful or better! There was 1 area the Hotel could certainly improve upon - meal service. The Western breakfast buffet was weak in variety didn't offer an egg station.- frankly, the poorest of the 4 hotels we stayed in . AND meal service in the Japanese restaurant ended earlier, even though they publish 9 pm - leaving the only alternative heavy dishes in the French eatery. After a day touring we'd often get back to the hotel about 8, shower and have to leave the hotel to dine - not a bad idea either! Lots of spots in the nearby Ginza.","Aventura, Florida",3,4.0

I booked the room direct with the hotel and received a better rate than hotel search engines at a very good price of only 19000+ yen a night.I found the hotel an excellent base to explore Tokyo. This hotel has a subway line next door and the main Shimbashi JR(Yamanote Line) station just 5 mins walk away which is a really cheap way to get round the city and see the sites for only 160 -200 yen one way. The JR stations are one of the few places that have maps and instructions in English. The area has many shops, bars, restaurants, to choose from, all a short walk away. I found the Shimbashi area around the hotel a bit more chilled than Shinjuku or Shibuya.I booked a twin corner room and the city views were breath taking from the 33 rd floor. Reception is on the 25 floor in this hotel and is located on top of an office block. The room had everything you could want and the beds were comfy, wi-fi worked well in the room and reception. The bathroom was a decent size for Tokyo and the beds comfortable for a good night sleep, and you could hear nothing being on such a high floor.I found all hotel staff in Japan to be very helpfull, but when i could not extend my stay at the Park Hotel due to it being fully booked the girl on reception really did go that extra mile for the customer. The young lady rang round hotels and managed to reserve me a room in their sister hotel, they got staff to carry my bags down to reception where they proceeded to get me a taxi and give him instructions for where to take me ...

The reception is on the 25th floor with stunning views of the city. The staff and service was excellent. The room was on the small side, but clean and fine. We had a corner room and loved watching the trains run. The weather was hazy the whole time, so visibility was only about 10 miles.

From the station it was a 1400 Yen (EUR 10/USD 14) taxi ride to the hotel. Because the entrance is not that prominent because the lobby of the hotel is on the 25th floor and the area around the hotel has a lot of corridors, we found it money well spent to have a taxi take us from the station to the entrance of the hotel.Check-in went smooth and although a lot of hotels in Japan have a strict policy about check-in times, the Park hotel was really accommodating even when we arrived rather early. The front desk was also helpful with tips about getting around the city. We had a triple room which was exceptionally spacious for Tokyo/Japanese standards. View over the city was nice. Room was clean and although design was a little bland, the room was good. Wifi was ok.We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but at Felt's on the basement floor of the Shiodome City Center building, enter the building from the outside left from the cooking studios. (In previous reviews reference was made to Vie de France, but we have not been able to find it and think it is possible that is has been taken over by Felt's). Breakfast at this bakery was delicious with fine croissants, pastries and bread,The best thing about the park hotel is the location. Within walking distance are Tsukiji fishmarket (10-15 minutes) and Ginza (15-20 minutes). Ask the front desk for directions.Furthermore It is is a 7 minute walk to the Shimbashi train station which is only a few minutes by local train away from two major Shinkansen stations in Tokyo, Tokyo station (for north bound Shinkansen trains) and Shinagawa station (for south bound Shinkansen trains). This station is also on the Yamamoto circular line which brings you in around 20 25 minutes to Shibuya and Shinjuku. Besides that both the Shiodome subway station (at the entrance of the hotel) and the Shimbashi subway station provide easy access to the major sightseeing points in town. It takes a little getting used to to get around the hotel because there are walkways on different levels. However, when you get used to it, it is really not that hard.To summarize it: this is a good quality hotel but what would make us return is the excellent location close to many transport options which makes it easy to get around Tokyo and beyond Tokyo.","Almere, The Netherlands",236,4.0

Hotel location is really great, about 10-15mins from Haneda Airport by cab or approx 35mins by subway. Also, it is next to NTV tower and Shiodome station, and 5mins away from Shimbashi Station (linked by underpass and overpass). I love japanese tv, so really enjoyed walking past the glass studio each morning where they were filming PON! ^^ As for food, there are many restaurants or eateries nearby. For those who are not too adventurous when it comes to food, there is Subway and Mcdonalds nearby at Caretta Shiodome and Shiodome station. There's a Family Mart at the basement of the hotel building too. One thing that they could probably improve on is the aircon... it took very long for my room to become cool.

There is a metro station in the basement and a JR station 5 minutes walk away at Shimbashi so it's very easy to travel anywhere in the city that you'd like to go. The Limousine bus also stops here. Many reasonably priced restaurants in the several shopping complexes that are in the downstairs Shiodome area.

I have struggled with the choice of staying at the ubiquitous 'mainline' hotels (Hilton, Starwood, etc) with their 'predictable' but western-friendly environment, vs. staying 'local' at a more traditional Japanese hotel (where I sometimes miss the usual 'amenities' like the 'Western breakfast'. There is only so much Miso soup I can handle at 7AM) and the occasional communication challenges with the front desk. The Park Hotel seems to have positioned itself very nicely with the best of both. For example, the staff is extraordinarily pleasant yet not confused when you 'wave off' the bell desk staff at check-in , indicating that you are fine with taking your luggage with you, on your own, to the room. The rooms are 'large' for Tokyo standards, the bathroom amenities are plentiful and of high quality, and there are actually face cloths (which is often not the case in Japan). Beds are really comfortable with a selection of pillows. Coffee and tea in the room. No mini-bar, but excellent restaurant choices (French and Japanese) on the lobby level. One of the restaurants has a fantastic selection of Scotch Whiskeys. Speaking of - the lobby is on the 25th floor with spectacular views of Tokyo Tower and (on the clear days) all the way to Mt Fuji.Location is fantastic, with easy walking underground to Shimbashi Station.

Since we didn't look into lodging earlier, we missed many of the promotion deals for many hotels. The rate for this hotel was not inexpensive but we felt we got what we paid for.We're somewhat familiar with the small room size in major cities and not many hotels have rooms for a family of 4 (including two kids aged 11 & 13). This hotel has a room that allows 3 adults and 1 kid (11 and under). The room was quite spacious and well appointed including the bathroom for a big city. With our luggage and family size, we didn't feel cramped and we're able to comfortably move around. With the jet lag, we spent many hours being awake in the room too.Location - it is attached to a few plazas like office buildings and one - with also restaurants, convenient store, coffee shops and retail stores. Close and safe enough for our kids to go there to grab a snack or drink. The best part is that it's very close to the Fish Market - Tsukiji. It opens early enough for our jetlagged state to go check it out. We did miss the 4 am 'fish auction'. However, the market was bustling at about 4 or 5 am. Little stalls and stands were open including food and souvenirs when we walked there at 5. A few of the well known sushi restaurants (they're tiny - almost like diners) have lines already starting before the day breaks. Some lines take a few hours. We went to one of the diners at the last day 5 am ... we didn't go to the 'famous' ones as we didn't want to stand in lines but it was still amazing! The one we went to were like many with a counter seating about a dozen. After you placed the order, you watched the chef preparing your bowls. Beside Tsukiji, it's also about 20 min walk to Ginza. It is also at a subway stop. We used public transportation only while we were there. The system was not as easily navigated as other systems so if it is new, take the time to figure it out. Atmosphere - the hotel started on 25th floor. It sounded strange but once you arrived there, it seemed quite 'normal'. The lobby was quite trendy and modern and open. They had a buffet there that looked delicious. However, we decided to try out all the local foods instead. Staff - very courteous, polite and friendly. At the last day of check out, we left our luggage behind as our flight was in the evening. When we went to pick up our luggage, the staff told us we left a few belongings behind (and they were quite important). Thanks to the honesty of the staff, nothing was missing. Travel to/from airport - there is a shuttle that conveniently takes you from the airport to the hotel at a very reasonable cost. It is very comfortable, clean, air conditioned, not like some of the airport shuttles in US. Much cheaper than a cab. The hotel will book the shuttle for you as requested on the way out. We at first wanted to stay in Shinjuku. We're happy to stay here instead as it was a bit more quiet. If you look for a night life, this may not be the best location. For us, it has worked out quite well.","Washington, DC",41,5.0

This hotel has all the amenities of the large, soul-less chains, but far more intimate.Convenient to both Shiodome and Shimbashi stations, plenty of eateries around to cater for all tastes, an all night super market downstairs, and not far from Ginza if one seeks more liveliness (Shinjuku not that far away on direct Oedo line from Shiodome if one wishes even more fun). The Narita airport to hotel bus service (if timed correctly) works well and is inexpensive, and even if that doesn't work so well, just change at Tcat station in Tokyo for cheap cab ride to and/or from hotel.This writer would not stay anywhere else in Tokyo (I am in the hotel business so see my fair share of hotels).","Long Jetty, Australia",79,5.0

(8,9 & 10 June, 2014)Hotel is difficult to find if you come via subway. Getting off at Shimbashi Subway station and trying to find any signs that point to the hotel is difficult. Follow the signs towards Shio Dome and keep your eyes open for two small signs that point to Park Hotel. It's a long walk underground through the mostly deserted subway, up and down escalators and stairs, to the basement entrance which is a revolving door which takes you into what appears to be a tradesman's area, a narrow underground corridor where you eventually find a door marked ""Park Hotel"" Take the single lift to the 25th Floor to reception. It should be much better sign posted.If you want a room ""With a view"" be prepared to pay extra and if the cloud lifts you may get to see Mt Fuji in the distance. (Unfortunately it was cloud covered for our 3 nights).Rooms are well appointed, clean and comfortable, however when the room was made up during the day staff failed to remove 3 empty soap, shampoo & conditioner containers from the bathroom, even though they placed new ones on the vanity unit.The buffet breakfast, both western and Japanese style was okay but it appears even here they cant get a toaster which actually works. (2 domestic toasters & 1 domestic pie warmer type oven, multiple guests still having problems getting bread to toast).The main restaurant has a ""Guests Only Casual Dinner"" which was a multi course Japanese meal and was reasonable value for money, but book early. We arrived at 6 pm and couldn't get a table till 8 pm.Overall, despite these couple of minor issues the hotel is well located and staff were helpful and courteous.

First of all, I have to say that we were blown away by Japanese customer service. Everyone there was showed a level of kindness and professionalism that I rarely see in American hotels. With that said, here are the pros and cons:PROS:-Great view. We paid for the Tokyo Tower view and it didn't disappoint. It was a great way to wake up in the morning, and a fantastic thing to see before going to bed.-Easy access to the Tokyo subway. It's right off the Oedo line at the Shiodome station and a block or two from Shimbashi station, so it was easy to navigate the city from one of those stops.-Convenient to the Tsukiji fish market and Hamarikyu Gardens. The gardens were a nice break, especially when the Tokyo humidity got to be too much.-Nice breakfast. With the hotel discount, the breakfast came to 22 yen/person. A nice mix of western breakfast items (scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage, croissants) with traditional Japanese food like miso soup, noodles and fish.CONS:-No English language TV. They had CNN and the BBC, but both stations were dubbed in Japanese. It would have been nice to have at least one station in English.-A little too far away from Shinjuku and Shibuya. The Tokyo subway system basically shuts down at 12:30 am, so if you're planning a late dinner, and want to check out some Tokyo nightlife, then you'll have to cab it back to the hotel. We did that a couple of times and from Shinjuku, a cab ride was about 50 yen. Also, even with the directions provided by the hotel, the cab drivers could never find the hotel. We were taken to the Park Hyatt at one point. -The hotel did have kind of a weird smell of smoke. We noticed it when we first arrived and didn't later on in the trip. Which makes me think we just got used to it.When we go back to Tokyo, we'll probably stay closer to the Shinjuku/Shibuya area. But this was a decent hotel for the price.","Los Angeles, CA",19,4.0

That was the selling point for me, room rate booked directly from hotel webpage was 19200 yen/night (first night was more expensive and second cheaper but this was average of two nights) standard room for 4 people with baby cot :)Breakfast was not included and we bought it separetly at the hotel. I remember the price was about 2500 jen/person, and our age children were free. Of course you can get much cheaper and same level breakfast from the street cafes if you want to save some money.Room was quite small which I guess is normal in Tokyo, enough for 4 people no problems.

Tokyo can be overwhelming to a first time visitor, but the gracious staff will help you with anything you need, from directions and help with the Metro to restaurant reservations or suggestions. It can be hard to find at first (we were looking befuddled and a Japanese businessman on his way home from work stopped, called the hotel and then insisted on walking us to the front door, very kind) but once you figure it out you realize the location is really convenient, with a Metro stop right nearby.

We slept very well and never heard another guest.The food is high end so we only ate breakfast at the hotel, and had lunch and dinner when we were out. The room service menu isn't extensive but you can get something if you're desperate. In the local City Centre tower and also just along the walkway towards Shimbashi there are lots of local cafés plus more international coffee shops for informal food. In 15 minutes you can walk to Ginza for good restaurants too.My only gripe is the sometimes snooty staff at breakfast who were happy to stand back and watch while we made countless trips to the breakfast buffet to get glasses of water and all the food required for a family of four for breakfast, particularly on one occasion when we arrived just before they were closing. But that seems to be the style of this hotel, and timings in Japan seem to run like clockwork.We would stay here again and recommend this hotel.",Dubai,38,5.0

As we'd come to expect in Japan the hotel staff we extremely courteous and throughout our stay the service was impeccable.The hotel is well placed being close to a number of rail and metro stations all accessible via the underground walkways so it's relatively easy to get to other parts of the city. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Ginza too which was worth a visit for the great shops.At the reception level there are two restaurants; one French and one Japanese although we didn't eat in either. We did eat in the lounge area though and the food was fine. A very tasty wagyu beef stew is to be recommended.There are innumerable restaurants close to the hotel but I feel they're more intended towards feeding locals rather than visitors and that is fair enough; it's their city. I does mean that unless you can read Japanese then you have no idea what you're ordering which made it exciting! Even the pictures that a few of the restaurants had on their menus didn't really help. However we enjoyed our food, whatever it might have been, on the two evenings we were there.The view of the Tokyo tower from the bedroom in the evening was a real treat and we could just have gazed out over that cityscape forever. You might think that one high rise city skyline is much like another but they each has its uniqueness in my view.The room was perfectly adequate in size and the bed very comfortable (a relief for my wife who didn't get on too well with the hard beds in Hakuba).I would without a second thought stay at the Park hotel again if I ever go back to that wonderful city.","Jackson, Wyoming",71,5.0

It's centrally located, with subway and lightrail stations within walking distance. They have very interesting exhibitions at the lobby (AWARE: it's not on the ground floor. Read the instructions on the lift) and apparently every now and then they would project some short films onto their giant white wall for ones to watch. The room was rather spacious, and the view was very good; we could see the Tokyo Tower from our room. However, there are two thing that you need to be aware of (nothing about the hotel facility tho):1. Unless you are on a business trip that requires you to stay near Ginza, this area may not be a bit boring for it's kinda far away from all the fun places. Except that there is a giant clock opposite the road (on your way to the subway station) influenced by Howl's Moving Castle which chimes every now and then. It's definitely worth checking out if you are nearby. 2. I find that many luxury hotels in Tokyo have a distinctive feature: they occupy only the top floors of high-rises. This can for sure provide you a good view, however for one that can't stand a rapid lift due to the air compression like me or one with claustrophobia, it may not be an enjoyable experience.

Not much wardrobe space and a desk that is also a TV stand. The internet is super fast but there aren't any English TV channels and only limited to less than 10 channels. Where are the standard international channels?The hotel is very much on top of a subway line, a monorail and a short 5 minutes walk from the JR station which has many connections. So as far as getting around, it is convenient, but that said, there really isn't that much around. It is all office buildings in the immediate area, hardly any pedestrians once it gets dark and many restaurants don't open on the weekends. So if you want a quick proper meal late at night, you will have to go to Shimbashi station.The hotel has a shuttle going to and from both Narita and Haneda airport, check the times on the hotel website.Another thing I liked about the hotel is that it does have coin operated laundry for those on a budget. This can be very useful for those travelling more than a week.I was happy with the hotel given the price we paid and it was a very good hotel, but for holiday, you will want to be a bit closer to the action, e.g. Shibuya, Shinjuku or Ebisu, for you to really feel like you are in Tokyo.","Singapore, Singapore",100,4.0

Very important, Don't take a taxi from Narita airport to the hotel. It was a very expensive lesson and next time we are definitely taking the airport shuttle. JR (Japan Rail) and subway would be too inconvenient with five pieces of luggage. If you are arriving or leaving from Haneda airport than taxi would be doable. Front entrance of building is not the entrance of hotel but the entrance to the Shiodome Media business Tower. You must go through the revolving doors to get to the elevators which will take you up to the hotel lobby on the 25th floor. Don't expect any hotel staff to help you upon arriving at the tower entrance but once you're in the lobby staff are quick to help with your bags and take you to front desk. As other reviewers mentioned, staff are helpful and friendly but not very personable. They are more than happy to help with any questions or issues but won't go out of their way to assist. Rooms are small for American standards but average to large in Japan. Our queen tower view room was much roomier than the double at the Washinton Hotel I've stayed in ten years ago. The view from our room was as advertised. We were lucky to have good weather during our stay and could see snow capped Mt.Fuji during the day. Tokyo night lights were stunning as well. Location couldn't be beat. There were subway, metro, and JR all within the 3rd floor walkway or escalator to B2 away. If possible opt for subway, TOIE or Tokyo Metro, easier to understand imo. Going to Disneyland takes two TOIE transfers and a JR to resort entrance. The concierge will gladly show you on the subway map. Near the Shiodome building are many local eateries and drinking establishments as well as western chains and pubs. Hotel has a nice dining area for breakfast which we tried on day of check-out. Average to expensive for what they offered but convenient if you're short on time. Checking out was quick and staff are very efficient with bags and had a taxi ready for us at building entrance. Tipping are not required and some will even refuse politely. We left gratuity for housekeeping the day we left so they couldn't refuse. Hotel has everything you would need but not over the top. Great for business travelers. Between average to above average but everyone's standards are different. My s/o gives it very good to excellent.","La Palma, California",27,4.0

We have read many reviews where the guests were upgraded but we were not that fortunate during out 6-night stay in the hotel. Although, I was expecting the hotel will consider an upgrade the fact that we're long stayers or maybe its also because the staff in the receptionist who helped us to check-in was not as friendly as his colleagues. The hotel location has good access to Shimbashi station, either through the outdoor pedestrian sky bridge or indoor underpass; this was proven to be good during our winter visit since the evening temperature might be too cold for some people.

Some more signs would help travelers coming from Shimbashi station, and there were some staircases with no escalator or elevator (at least not within obvious reach). Prepare for a little bit of a walk, especially challenging if you have many heavy suitcases. Another minor quibble: our room had a very slight body odor smell, but the room had a deodorizing fabric spray that helped.If traveling solely by public transit, this location is likely more suitable for those who can do a lot of walking, though that may be the case for Tokyo in general.

This hotel is conveniently located in the shiodome neighborhood which is rather quiet but is virtually a 10-15 minute walk to Ginza.This time I flew into Haneda airport which was superbly convenient to travel into Tokyo compared with Narita.If you do fly into Haneda international airport take the Monorail and wait for the Haneda express which will cost you 470 yen ( about USD 5 ) and take it to the final one stop to Hamamatsucho station. Then get a taxi to the hotel, which is literarily 5 mins away and cost about 710 yen. So convenient, fast and cheap.Now back to the hotel, the rooms are comfortable if not on the smallish side, my partner and I still find it cosy nevertheless. The amenities are abundant and I have to say the bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are quiet.Breakfast is served everyday at 7am, you may choose to purchase this as a package when booking your room or choose to add that to your bill. Breakfast is a huge array of continental and Asian fare, and will cost you around USD 52 for 2 persons, not cheap but if you eat a hearty breakfast you may choose to have a snack for lunch. On another positive note, the concierge is very knowledgable and is always willing to suggest good places to eat or make any reservations for you.

It is walking distance to some attractions and multiple metro lines and the JR rail system -= it is only 2/3 metro stops to many things. Don't expect a posh 5 star lobby or room and the beds are hard (like most Japanese beds we found) and room on the small side (we had a twin bed as was told this was bigger than a double and the hotel was full at the time so we could not upgrade), however you are not paying 5 star prices either. (On this same trip we spent our last 2 nights in the Hilton Tokyo and paid more for more inconvenience and expense in every way and would go back to the Park over the Hilton). The inhouse Japanese restaurant was very good and reasonable price (approx $130 for a set course menu of 4/5 dishes and a bottle of wine) although there are plenty of restaurants in the Shiodome area both at skyscraper heights and in the extensive underground or office complex areas. We did not have a bad meal on any night (it would be preferable if you like Japanese food), all served wine and the choice was extensive - usual cost was approx $70ish. We ate out for breakfast at Starbucks or other breakfast establishments again all around the Shiodome/Carretta area (although did get a free breakfast for 2 because we stayed 6 nights and joined the Park Hotel club (for free) - thank you to a Tripadvisor tip off before we left - this buffet was very good with a view over the gardens which was pleasant. The only downside for us (which was not a problem but could be for others was our room was on the 26th floor overlooking the train station which made for interesting viewing but there was a slight train noise for all but a few hours in the middle of the night. A major plus was a DYI inhouse laundry (Y200 per load including washing powder) which meant no bathroom washing - which for me puts a damper on my holiday. The concierge was excellent with help to get around, booked our bus trip to Shirakawago which could not be booked until we were in country and provided great maps and the 10 top sights to see (how best to get there, how much on the metro, etc). A transport tip for travellers arriving in Tokyo late (that is around 8pm when the Jetstar flight comes in from Cairns) the direct Park Hotel airport limo bus has stopped so you need to catch the bus to Tokyo Central Station and then a taxi which was not a problem but not expected. As for arriving at this hotel for the first time by train with luggage, I think this would be fairly challenging to find the hotel entrance which although clearly marked needs a bit of experience to negotiate your way through the subway alleys and know how the signage ""thinks"" and the walk is approximately 1km. Another great plus was a Familymart (aka 7/11) in the basement of the hotel with plenty of choice for snacks, drinks, sushi, sandwiches, toilettry necessities, etc , Chilean wine ($7/bottle and excellent), beer (Japanese and imported - $3 per can).",Melbourne,257,4.0

The view was amazing from the room, but a pity the cloud was on the ground for most of the stay. We paid a bit extra for a slightly larger room and Tokyo Tower view, and very glad we did. Staff are friendly, with good English. Location is very convenient for rail access to other parts of Tokyo, particularly Line E that's right next to the hotel. Also only 10 or so minutes walk from the Ginza shopping area. My only criticism is the gym is subject to payment, and you must book in advance... which is a tad inconvenient, and I feel should be included in the room price.","Sydney, Australia",27,5.0

Hotel rooms are high enough (levels 25 and up) that no street-noise will wake you up at wee hours. Breakfast is rich and diverse. This is where the good part ends. There is a gym. postage-stamp sized, and locked at all times. In theory if you make a reservation ( for one hour only) you room key should open the gym door when time comes. In practice you have to parade through the lobby , fetch an assistant - who then needs to check the records- maybe you are a dangerous imposter, after all- upon witch you may get access to the gym, 15 minutes later. The experience is either needlessly-grotesque or funny, depending on your mood. Then there is the stench. Rooms stink. Badly, How on earth is this possible in this class of hotels, god knows.

But the (quite small) room itself had a slightly tired feel, the arms of the chair being grubby and one or two marks were on the carpet. Much the same can be said for the lobby area. Some train noise can be heard. The view was great.But the service was poor. We wanted a drink after a long journey, but no-one noticed us come to sit in the lobby area and ask us what we would like, and after 10 minutes I got up and walked to the pay-desk and asked if anyone was actually serving. In that time we watched the waiters chatting together but not actually serving anyone.And then the whole process was repeated around 9.30pm. We wanted a drink and, yet again, no-one saw us and, again, I went to ask if anyone was actually serving. Only then did we get our drink.The only (quite small) restaurant was booked-up and this reveals the greatest weakness-it's a long walk through the maze of tunnels and walkways until you find a restaurant, and then they are mediocre railway-station-type places, some of which did not open in the evenings. Failing this it's the (very) expensive restaurants high in the nearby tower blocks or a metro journey to find better quality establishments. The hotel desperately needs another all day restaurant without leaving the building, such as in Sheraton Hiroshima.However, in its favour, one member of staff needs great praise. On receiving our luggage from the courier, we found a lock to have been broken and the case part-open. With a flight to the UK first thing next morning, buying a replacement at that time in the evening or next morning was out of the question. At first fazed by my request for help, the night manager, with little English, was only concerned about how it got broken. But then, as we began to panic about the possibility of loading a broken suitcase on to an aircraft, he sent one of his staff out into the night to buy some straps. When the fellow returned, he had two very strong suitcase straps with number code locks. The night-manager would accept no payment, 2000yen each (around £25 total) and was only concerned that they would be up to the job of securing the case, which they did admirably. I can only thank him most sincerely.","Congleton, United Kingdom",58,4.0

The hotel is designed for more of a business traveler and not particularly for a family or group of college guys (which was my case). Nevertheless, the concierge was tremendously helpful in planning our tour and journey around Tokyo. He directed us to interesting (age appropriate) destinations around the city, was fluent in both English (as he was originally from the UK) and Japanese and even helped me translate medication that I purchased for my traveler’s stomach. He also pointed us towards the interesting clubs in Roppongi and told us to avoid certain areas as they were notorious for haggling tourists. Since the hotel is located in a business area (surrounded by office buildings), many of the restaurants around are more of the mall restaurants you would find in the US. It is not the ideal Japanese experience I was looking for however, there was an abundant selection of places to eat within 2 min walking distance. We used the subway for most of our day travels and our journeys (which were long an extensive) cost no more than $10/day. We used the taxis to travel around at night (especially to the Roppongi area) and they cost around $20-30 for a one way journey. We had breakfast twice at the hotel. The breakfast provided at Park Tokyo was two steps higher than a continental breakfast yet it cost around $20/person. We were shocked at how expensive the breakfast was but came to realize later on that it was worth the price due to the convenience and the fact that it was all you can eat, helping us to skip on a meal or two in between. The best part by far: the breathtaking views of Tokyo! Upon arriving and seeing the view from the reception desk at the Lobby, we decided to upgrade to a room with the view of the Tokyo tower and I must say, it was the best thing about the room (apart from the great bathrooms and the beds).

The hotel is comparable to a Hilton in the US, but keep in mind our space standards are a bit different than what I found in hotels in Japan. The room is small and the bathroom very small, but it was clean and for the most part comfortable. I found the beds in Japan to be a lot firmer than in the US, but that could be just me. The lobby was modern and the check-in very easy. Behind the front desk is a great panoramic view of the city. Access to the subway was pretty good from the hotel which made it very convenient to get around. The hotel lobby is on the 25th floor which means that you take a elevator to the lobby and then separate hotel to the floors with the rooms.

There are other breakfast places nearby (Momi & Toys Creperie, Starbucks, Tullys, etc.) so we were covered. (Although the best breakfast is a sushi breakfast at the fish market.)

Thanks to TA I found that only Park Hotel's own website offers this special deal. There were no double rooms available but I gambled hoping to get a double at check-in. This turned out to be a smart move because I ended up getting a double room on the top floor with Tokyo tower view!Room: 5/5The view towards the Tokyo tower is just awesome and you can even see Fujisan on a clear day. You also get a good view of Shinkansens running below your feet! They have a bay window with a comfy cushion so you can read/chill out feeling you are on top of Tokyo. The room is spacious by Tokyo standard and the bed is very comfortable. The Wifi connection is fantastic and it's quick and easy to hook up. Everything is nicely laid out and really there's nothing much to complain about. Service: 5/5We wanted to check in some large suitcases a couple of days before check-in date and the hotel duly obliged. In fact they moved them into our rooms before we even arrived. What's more impressive is that we requested a switch from twin to a double room. They told us all the rooms that were available and we ended up trying 2 of the Double room with Tokyo view. We were told these are smoking rooms but they don't smell and suggested we check them out. They are right, the only thing that smells was the corridor, so if you can get past that the room is perfectly fine. They moved our suitcases from the initial room and I just had to tip the guy for their entire service.Convenience 4.5/5The hotel actually sits 1 min walk from Shiodome metro/monorail and 7min walk to Shimbashi metro/JR. The 7min walk is pretty painless as it has a very busy underpass that is fully sheltered with aircon. These stations gives you direct/short journeys to most places in Tokyo and even places further out such as Narita Airport, Gotemba (Outlet mall) and Kamakura/Yokohama. Most tourists will find this hotel a perfect base to explore all parts of Tokyo without the noise in the heart of Tokyo. Japan's google transit is awesome and accurate to the minute for trains/metro. So use that to guage whether this is the right area for you. You got a convenience store at basement level and plenty of local restaurants/shops at Shimbashi station. In fact you can reach the heart of Ginza or Tsukiji Fish Market in less than 20min on foot! (save taxi money if you are going for the tuna auction)Value 5/5With the 40% deal you are looking at around 16000yen for a double room (+2000 for Tower View). In my opinion this is a real steal for such a modern luxurious hotel strategically located near Shimbashi.

It was a great location for going to Tsukiji Market, and some nearby department stores. It was fairly close to a Metro station which helped with going around Tokyo, however, since we didn't stay here for very long, I can't say much in terms of getting around to a lot of the different central hubs. It was a great location for us at the start of our trip however, since we were still jetlagged and woke up early, so we were able to eat sushi at Tsukiji Market when it opened and not have to wait in a ridiculously long line.The hotel itself is extremely thoughtful in service and design. The staff was extremely polite and helpful. When my parents called the hotel just as we were arriving, they told us and held the call, before transferring to our room until they had made sure we had gotten into our rooms. The hotel staff had no problem shipping our luggage to Kyoto when we asked them to, and we received our luggage in Kyoto on time with no complications. We received our phone sim card rental from them with no trouble for using their mailing system. The rooms themselves were fairly spacious for a Tokyo hotel room, with a nice window seat for city viewing. The bed thankfully was a King bed, not two split up twin size beds separated by a bed frame, the latter of which was common outside of Tokyo. The mirrors were completely heated so when you step out of the shower you can see yourself and get ready, as opposed to having steam filled mirrors. The toilet had a dizzying number of options which were fun to try out. All in all, the hotel made for a pleasant and convenient stay for the first leg of our trip.","Laguna Niguel, California",19,5.0

We had a triple room for two adults and two kids--decent set up that has a sofa bed that was already made up on arrival. Room size was good--no need to squeeze--and it was so wonderfully quiet! The views from the room were amazing--Tokyo Sky Tree in the distance and the Shiodome area with its raised pedestrian walkways down below. The hotel is also convenient to food options at the nearby Carretta mall, which has several floors of restaurants, as well as the basement-level pedestrian walkway eateries. Breakfast at the hotel is very nice, with good, crusty breads, hot Western and Japanese options. The whole place has a subdued hush to it, interesting art exhibits, those awesome silent, speedy elevators.

I assume, based on my reading and planning, that I would be in a location with reasonable restaurants and walking distance from things. I was walking distance from the expansive underground system - and it's a big underground. Basically, by the time I was done sightseeing, and wanting to go out - I'm into alternative clubbing and Tokyo is great for that - I was too worn out and urm, lazy, to want to get on the subway, or get a cab, all the way to the other side of town for clubs and bars. So, each night I either ate at the hotel or, at a nearby hotel. For that very reason, I would stay else where next time I am in Tokyo. Now, if you are working in the Shiodome region, or you're a family or you are prone to turning in early, then it's a great place for your stay. Beautiful interior, helpful staff, many speak good English (I was greeted by a European at reception, in fact). The contemporary art throughout the property is awesome, and the hotel view gives you that ""Lost in Translation"" feel without the price of staying at the Hyatt. The bar is cool, but, if you're desiring that view with a drink, visit the Conrad next door. The hotel has a bar that has a view, but, it's staring directly at an office building more than anything else, so check out the Conrad. I ate in the Japanese restaurant the hotel - very contemporary and very formal, but, it was delicious and a great chance to experience contemporary classic Japanese. The courtyard restaurant had OK service but the food left much for me to be desiring. So, the hotel is beautiful, staff is attentive, view is nice, but, the location wasn't compatible with what I was looking for.

It is very stylish, clear, and hopefully without sounding overused metaphor... a ""zen"" refuge.... Little hints: join the hotel membership... you can get automatic benefits (small bottle of champagne, free breakfast, etc.) depending on the number of nights you are staying. The location is great, with plenty of food in the Shiodome area as well as the local restaurants, shopping, nightlife, etc in Ginza or Shinbashi. Fish market, water taxi to Asakusa, and a nice jog along the river (behind the fish market) is all nearby. It is also very well connected with the Tokyo JR and Metro (get a Suica pass at any convenience store to avoid constantly shelling out change for tickets...). The 7-Eleven in the Shiodome shopping area has a Cash Machine that is ""friendly"" to foreign credit cards (Citibank in Ginza is the only other).

With this special we found the hotel to be a good value. But here's are the most important tips in booking this hotel: (1) Book through the hotel's website, as it is the only way to get the special deals. (2) Be sure to scroll down the entire list of rooms available and read carefully what each has to offer. Further down the list , we found FREE BREAKFAST for 2 included with our room and 40% off for the same price as the 40% offer without breakfast! Rooms were small, yes, but not tiny. Most importantly, they were quiet, with what seems to be good insulated walls. The rooms had new clean carpeting, nice wood furniture, good lighting, and blackout curtains. Bathrooms had a great powerful shower, a nice variety of amenities, and a fancy toilet that Japan is so famous for- heated, etc., although without music. (The last time I was in Japan my hotel toilet played Beethovan's 9th symphony every time I sat down!) The hall carpeting seemed shabby in comparison to the room.If internet hook-up is important to you, then you might have found your hotel. I am giving The Park Hotel the award for the fastest, strongest internet hook-up I have ever experienced in any hotel in the world! Perhaps this is because it's in a building that houses offices and a tv station?The breakfast that is included is adequate. I did not love it, so I can't rave about it. I found enough to eat, but the menu didn't vary during the 4 days we were there. The hotel has a 1 star Michelin rated restaurant, but it only seats about 20 persons and was full every night without reservations. The concierge is an Austalian, so English speaking persons will find this very helpful. Location: Hotel is in a quiet area near Ginza, but more in ""central Tokyo"" than the other areas. The subway is attached to the hotel, so convienent to all of Tokyo. Don't expect to walk outside the hotel and find a variety of restaurants unless you take a cab, one stop on subway or walk to close-by Ginza district. Each hotel room has a safe in the room- a feature that some of the recommended 3 star hotels in Tokyo did not.View: WOW! If you ask for the view of Mt. Fuji and Tokyo Tower, you will get an added bonus. One can see the same view from the hotel's 25th floor lobby, but why not have the same view from your room, too?","Long Island, NY",176,5.0

Second, the room was very clean and comfortable, and the size was surprisingly spacious, and the view was stunning! We could see Tokyo skytree from our room, and the Tokyo tower from lobby. The vicinity has multiple cafes and restaurants, but my favourites are the Japanese eateries in the train station! Mins walk to the Ginza line which is probably one of the most useful lines for tourists. Great location if you're taking shinkansen, or going to Disneyland. The helpful staff deserves special mention. The moment we stepped into the lobby, someone was there to greet us and help with check-in. If you stay three nights and/or if you are a member (not sure which because I had both), you can choose one of the gifts on offer ( one of which is a Pasmo card worth 1000 yen, great for train travels!), and we were given early check-in due to early arrival time at Narita. I highly recommend this hotel. I suggest studying google map & youtube for this area before arrival if you plan to walk from Shimbashi in order to get your bearings. The hotel provides excellent map on its website, but I feel doing extra homework helps a lot for first-timer. Both above-ground walkway and underground network to/from station are easy to navigate, but I recommend taking the surface route when coming in for first time, then you can explore the underground after check-in.

Let's start off with before even getting to Japan...GETTING TO THE HOTEL: I'm originally from Chicago, but I was visiting Manila in the Philippines before going to Tokyo. Unlike in the Philippines, English speakers are a a bit harder to find in Tokyo (with the exception of hotel staff in my humble opinion). With this in mind I wanted to make sure my husband and I knew exactly where to go, what to do and how to get to the Park Hotel Tokyo the moment we stepped foot off the plane in Tokyo. So we did our research before hand. There are three ways to get to the hotel:1) Taxi: The obvious and most common way to get from an airport to a hotel for someone who is not familiar with an area is to take a taxi, and we could have. Except, after quite a bit of research to figure out how much the taxi trip would be we found out it would be a little over 30,000 Yen!!!! (Roughly $300 USD at the time). There was NO way we were going to pay that much. So we explored our other options. 2) Train: We could have taken a train but it would have required transefering trains and walking the rest of the way by foot to the hotel. Overall it would have taken roughly under 2 hours of transit time. Overall price would have been between $40-$60 USD. Definitely better than ~$300 USD for a taxi ride. But after a 5 hour plane ride from Manila, and also because we didn't want to lug our luggage around in a city that we were unfamilar with for 2 hours we decided to see if there were any other options. 3) ""Airport Limosuine"": Finally, the last option we stumbled upon was also the best option for us. There is a service called ""Airport Limosuine"". Essentially this is a shuttle bus from the Narita airport that will take you from the airport to the doorstep of the hotel for 3,000 Yen/$30 USD in under an hour and a half. I believe you can buy tickets online (just google Airport Limosuine, Tokyo), but you can also buy it right at the Narita Airport (Or Haneda Airport) right after baggage claim, before you exit the airport. You cannot miss it. The way it works is that you pay $3000 Yen per person and the shuttle will take you (and any other customers) to the doorstep of the Park Hotel Tokyo, and will possibly make a couple other hotel stops along the way (depending on where the other customers on the bus are staying). When my husband and I went we had one other stop before Park Hotel Tokyo, and it was at the Conrad in Tokyo. All of these hotels are within a 2 minute walking distance from each other so really it was no big deal at all. Overall we chose the ""airport limosuine"" to take us to the hotel as it was the cheapest, pretty quick and most stress-free option. The shuttle bus was comfortable, AC-ed, and had recliining seats so we could sleep the hour and a half away. This is jumping ahead, but two things to note: (A) you can also pay/arrange to have the Airport Limosuine/shuttle bus drop you back off at the airport whenever you depart. (B) Using this service from the Haneda airport is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than Narita-- don't quote me on this (make sure you look it up online), but if I remember correctly it was under 1000 Yen( ~$10 USD) to and from Haneda.AT THE HOTEL: Ok so what you need to know (that tends to confuse most people) is that the hotel itself is between the 25-32nd floors of the Shiodome Media Tower. So, when you get dropped off at the hotel, you may think at first that there was some mistake since as soon as you walk in it looks like a business buliding with no sign of a hotel anywhere. I already knew this walking into the building so I knew what to expect and how to get the hotel. Basically this is how you get to the hotel, its actually quite simple if you read this review first ;): 1) As soon as you walk through the main doors (where your luggage gets dropped off and you get off the bus) take a look to the front and to the right. You will see a florist shop. To the right of the florist shop you'll see glass doors and a sign to the left of it on the floor that says ""Park Hotel Tokyo"". 2) Go through those glass doors and take any of the elevators up to the 25th floor. This is the main lobby of the Hotel. As soon as you get out of the elevator you should be able to see the check in desk to check into your room :).CHECKING IN THE ROOM: Many other reviewers on Trip advisor suggested asking for an upgrade of room to be able to see Mt. Fiji and Tokyo Tower. We wanted to opt for it but we didnt want to pay the extra 1,000 Yen ($10 USD) for a room that we were basically going to just be sleeping in. We had a standard queen room, and it was a good size for a hotel in Tokyo, but overall small by most standards. It was a comfortable sized room, though my husband felt that the bathroom was quite small. The beds are a little firm. But this is more of a standard find in Asia (It was the same in all of the hotels I was at in the Philippines). There was a mini-bar which we didn't use but emptied out all the beverages so we could use it as a fridge. English was a little bit of a hinderance, but managable in comparison to the rest of Tokyo. Food was expensive at the hotel and portions are already tiny in Tokyo (in comparison to the USA haha), so we only ate at the hotel once. It was for the breakfast buffet in the main lobby that is about 2,100 Yen (~$20 USD) that had a few continental items, and lots of japanese items.A few things to note that I enjoyed: 1) the hotel provides free razors, shavign cream, hair brushes and wash cloths in addition to the standard toothbrushes, toothpaste, soaps, shampoos, conditiors, etc etc. These are replenlished everyday :). 2) REALLY good shower pressure. 3) Their toilets. I LOVED them, as I did most toilets in Tokyo. Each toilet has a seat warmer with adjustable temperatures and bidets/'shower' with adjustable water pressure.4) Take the elevators down to the ""Subway"" level and walk out and follow the hallways (it doesn't matter if you take the right or left path, they merge anyways). Go through the revolving doors and to your right you will see a ""Family Mart"". This is a convience store that is very helpful and economical when you don't want to spend $25 for a small room service pizza.GETTING AROUND TOKYO/THE AREA: As mentioned before, English speakers are not that easy to come by in Tokyo, and for the most part, its not too big of an issue so long as you are willing to do a little research on your part before hand. You can ALWAYS ask concierge in the main lobby if you have any questions. They have really helpful maps that are in english (like the train station line). A few things to note:1) if you chose to walk to Ginza (an upscale part of Tokyo that can be compared to Michgan Ave. in Chicago/Magnificent Mile) then take the RIGHT elevator down to the Yurikamome level (3rd). and take the 1C exit down the stairs and walk to your right. This is the main street for the Ginza district and you will find stores llike Burberry, Louis Vuitton, Shiseido. You'll also find stores like H&M and Zara. There are also bakeries and pastry shops that can be found along the way. Sometimes we would get lucky and find some items in these places written in english on the placcards but most of the time we would just point at what we wanted, hold up the number of fingers that was equivalent to how many we wanted of something, and then shortly after an employee would show us a calculator with the total we needed to pay in Yen (helpful note, not all these places take credit card, so always have Yen on you).2) Tax is built into prices. So if something says its 1,000 yen. It's a 1,000 yen. No need to add some sales tax. Also, tipping is not a practice that is normally done in Tokyo. 3) Because a good majority of the places don't have english menus, my husband and I tended to eat a lot at Roppongi area. Specifically Roppongi Hills (Consider it the Rodeo Drive of Tokyo). We didn't plan it on purpose, it just ended up being every restaurant we searched for online that we liked and that had an english menu was in Roppongi Hills. Lots of foreigners tend to go here, and for good reason. You can get all sorts of cuisines here (Italian, French, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Latin, American, Burgers, Steakhouses, Crepes, Pastries, Pizza, Indian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, etc etc) and they pretty much always offer two menus-- one in Japanese and one in English. Roppongi Hills is surrounded by the Metro Hat, Mori Tower and a few other buildings that have english menu restaurants. I'm pretty sure you can find all of the restaurants/stores within the area in english online-- google is your friend!4) The subways. Your BEST friend. There are mulitiple subway lines that are owned here that owned by different companies (as opposed to Chicago, in which the government owns the train line). As a result of the competition, trains are clean, comfortable, AC-ed, always on time (if not early), and run every 10 minutes MAX. Most everything is within the area, and a one way train ride is anywhere between 160-210 yen (~$1.60-$2.10 USD). They offer one day and two day passes that allows for unlimited rides within the time frame for the train/busses on certain lines (I think it may be 1,000 yen for 1 day? Not sure, make sure you double check!)I think I covered everything I needed to. If not feel free to message me.","Chicago, Illinois",37,4.0

I asked him to leave since I was annoyed by the episode. I called to speak With the duty manager, who wasn't at his desk. I never got a call back either. Within 10 minutes however, a new menu was slipped under the door.The bar is excellent although expensive. Didn't eat at the hotel since the surrounding options are phenomenal.

This was balanced by the amazing views from the 32nd floor. Simply stunning, especially by night. The room was always made up well and completely clean. The bed was comfortable and the shower was powerful.The staff were helpful, polite and always there to assist; typical of Japanese hotel staff.The location is good as it offers nearby transportation (at the Shiodome station or a five minute walk from Shinbashi station) and also a short (twenty minute) walk into the heart of the Ginza area, at the same time as being quiet. The area is quiet at night due to being more of a business area. It was very safe and well lit, no issues with coming or going. It is worth noting that the ‘airport limousine’ service from Narita airport stops at the hotel. This was around 3,500 yen per person and worked out to be a better option than catching the train. I would recommend this hotel as an alternative to a Shibuya / Shinjuku location which we preferred. These areas were easily accessible by the transport available.I did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment although it is worth nothing that due the hotel’s location, there are no food options in the immediate vicinity. This may or may not be an issue depending on the guest’s preference. The hotel had a pleasant large lobby which offered somewhere to relax, have a drink or check e-mail.The hotel has complimentary wifi throughout. There was no swimming pool but a very small gym which was only big enough for one person. I feel that a four star rating is a good representation of this class of hotel. Clean, practical and modern.

We were amazed at the view and the solicitous staff.Park Hotel is in the Shiodome Media Tower, on the 25th floor. You may have a hard time finding it if you are an American accustomed to American hotels. From Shimbashi Station take the Shiodome exit (there are signs reading ""To Shiodome"") and follow signs. You will be able to take a cab from the station but the roads are kind of roundabout and you'll end up paying around 1000 Yen (ten dollars) to get a quarter mile. We had a lot of bags so we opted for this, but if you are traveling light it is an easy walk. Inside the Shiodome Media Tower, take an elevator to the 25th Floor and you'll walk out into the Park Hotel's lobby.Almost all of the staff, including the trainees (they wear trainee nametags), speak excellent English. Several are native speakers for whom Japanese is a second language. We arrived at nine in the evening and were welcomed by four staff members at the desk. They delivered our luggage to our room, which was a very nice room with a gorgeous view of Tokyo (see pictures).This is truly a world class hotel, and you will be treated accordingly. Every question we had for the staff as to area attractions was answered immediately, thoroughly, and with a map to go along with it. They can tell you where to eat, what to do, what time shops close, anything you need during your stay.The breakfast buffet is well stocked and tasty, though at around 4000 Yen (forty dollars) per person you definitely feel that you're in a hotel for the well-off. Be sure to ask at the desk for any discounts, we were able to save ten dollars per person with ""discount coupons."" Of course everything can be charged to the room. We only had breakfast at the hotel once, but it was a delicious (if expensive) one. Room service is likewise very expensive and we only did this once as well. I had a bit of an America Attack and wanted a pizza, which at 23 dollars for a cheese pizza the size of a dinner plate I regretted. It was good, but not worth the price. There is a well stocked mini bar in the fridge, with a number of drinks available, though we did not partake of the supplies very often. A vending machine will sell you the same beer for the same price, so the mini bar is not over priced, just superfluous to our needs. You're better off going to a local grocery store and stocking the fridge yourself.TV service is Japanese of course, which was quite entertaining for our being unable to understand it. We caught one game show where contestants make ugly faces for money, and a panel of six judges discussed at length which was the uglier. Japanese TV is inexplicable to American audiences, and not just because of the language barrier. Another game show where a man hides inside of things and jumps out at people was on, but we only caught the end of it. You likely won't be doing much with the TV anyway: get out in Tokyo!The room itself was very nice. The rooms are Western style, so don't expect futons and tatami mats. We had a very comfortable double bed with pajamas provided. One entire wall of the room was a picture window overlooking Tokyo Tower. The room was so nice that we literally called the front desk to make sure we had done the math right on how much the room cost. We called them twice, actually.They will do laundry for you at exorbitant prices, or you can use the laundry machine on site for substantially less. About ten dollars will wash and dry a full load. The machines are all in one: they wash, dry, and add detergent, so you won't need to provide anything but 100 Yen coins.We truly enjoyed our stay at the Park Hotel. We were sad (but ready) to go home at the end of our stay. They provide a shuttle service to the airport with numerous departure times, which at 3000 Yen (thirty dollars) was less than the cost of taking trains and far more comfortable. I don't know that we'll be back in Japan, but if we go back we would definitely stay at the Park Hotel.","Pittsboro, North Carolina",86,5.0

The room is pretty small but this is Tokyo and you really shouldn't quibble given the value for money. In the Shiodome media tower, a short walk from Ginza, reception is on the 25th floor and rooms above that - it's certainly quiet enough to sleep, there's plenty of water pressure in the bathroom (although the tub is tiny) and eventually (if you ask about the mysteries of the TV remote) you can find some English language stations on the TV. Chris, the British concierge is a wonderful resource - he knows his way around Tokyo, where to get good food and coffee. Very kindly, he arranged for a half bottle of a lovely champagne to be delivered to our room on my birthday during the stay.

It's connected to the Shiodome station, but you don't need to pay the extra money to take the train from Shimbashi because you can just walk along the elevated sidewalks directly to the hotel. Shiodome is a very quiet and lovely section of town filled with shiny skyscrapers. The hotel restaurants were too expensive, so we didn't eat in them. My friend loved the spa and got a massage. Glad we didn't pay twice as much to stay in a different area since the trains are so easy to just hop on and go wherever you want.

We did have a view of the tower and the views of the lights at night were great. However it was beige everywhere and just felt a bit tired with a stained table and snagged carpet.

The bathroom was spotless however. Breakfast was included in our rate but this was nothing special. Fruit was ok, prepared pineapple and strawberries but a chopped in half banana was not visually appealing and guests looking forward to an English breakfast would not find the offerings well cooked or appetising either. Croissants and coffee were the best choices by a long way unless you are happy with Japanese. Do not understand why breakfast is in the lobby. Why not make use of the dining room? The lobby is utterly impersonal and, as it is completely self service, if you have a table near the service counters there are a lot of people walking past your table all the time.We used the luggage forwarding service to our next hotel and this is efficient.

The same area converts to the lobby bar after breakfast time (which is not really convenient), and when a late night we came back around 10 asking for something to eat (even a cold dish understanding that the kitchen was maybe already closed) we have been told that only drinks were avaialble. From a 4 stars hotel you at least expect to be served some cold dishes even after 10 pm!!! They are also rated as a Design hotel, but a part from few Floss and Artemide lamps, honestly there is not more than a traditional, minimal Japanese design in it, which we liked, but very common to find in other spots in Tokyo.","Hong Kong, China",24,3.0

We duly arrived at our room and thought well this is Tokyo and everything is expensive and space is at a premium.Well within 15 minutes of settling in we were phoned by the tour operator who informed us that the Hotel had allocated the wrong corner rooms.... gee how strange that all 6 rooms were wrong!Subsequently we were reallocated the correct rooms. Sure this is not a big deal but the service in the bar area is slow, the staff seem to be in a tranice.

The over head walkway is the easiest and quickest for those arriving from Narita and using a JR pass. Catch the Nartia express to Tokyo and then jump on any train heading south, Shimbashi is a major station. The walk was only about five minutes and the elevator to the lobby on the 25th floor was quick.We arrived at the hotel 5 hours before check-in so we couldn't proceed to our rooms. The staff were happy to hold our bags while we explored the area, so we left them behind and went and explored Hama Rikyu Garden which was a short walk away. We visited during the cherry blossom season so the park was beautifully covered in trees of pink, white and purple.The hotel itself is conveniently located in a business park. This means that outside of work hours its quite quiet compared to the rest of Tokyo which can be a welcomed thing given its a city that's always moving. The rooms themselves were very nice, we had rooms that were looking over Tokyo Tower and in the direction of Mt Fuji, however the weather whilst we were staying was cloudy on every day so we didn't get to see the peak from there.Ginza is a short stroll from the hotel, as is the famous Tsukiji Fish Market. The subway to Rappongi is pretty much at the hotel door, as is the elevated bus that goes to Odaiba. Shimbashi itself on a friday night comes alive with Japanese business men who go out and enjoy finishing the working week, lots of restaurants, bars, pubs just on the other side of Shimbashi station made it an interesting place to explore at night.The Food in the lobby did look quite expensive so we never ate there, however being a business hotel its to be expected. There is a Convenience store in the basement as well as a big Hyper Market Chain near by called Don.K. The wireless in the rooms on the first two nights didn't work properly and we had to use the free wireless in the reception, however on subsequent nights it worked fine so not sure if there was something wrong with the signal on our floor or what.Bathrooms where nice, big enough for a week or so stay. Being japan the beds were a bit small but a 6ft tall person can have a comfy sleep. The window sill has a cushion so that you can sit and enjoy the view. Only downside is there are no english tv channels provided, and the intriguing style of Japanese TV can be a bit much for someone who is not used to it. The staff were more than happy to organize our bags to be sent ahead to Kyoto and they were waiting for us at our hotel when we arrived. Overall I highly rate this hotel and will definitely use it again on my next trip which I'm planning for next year.","London, United Kingdom",4,5.0

Breakfast is mediocre and expensive. Definitely worst breakfast we had in our 2 week trip. We didn't eat at the hotel or drink in the bar as there are many other better options. Transport connections are good although it took a while to find the right exit from the subway which takes you to the hotel. The area itself is not very interesting and on a short trip to Tokyo I am not sure why anyone would want to explore it.

The hotel itself is very comfortable for what it is. Comfortable bed and compact clean bathroom in the rooms. We stayed in two different rooms (with a sidetrip to Hakone in between). The first room on the 32nd floor was facing the bay with a glimpse of the Hama Rikyu Gardens. The second room on the same floor, but on the opposite side of the building faced Ginza and overlooked Shimbashi station and train tracks. You can hear the faint sound of the trains from the room - noticeable for a light sleeper like myself but my wife comfortably slept through it. We also had very weak wifi signal in this room. It must be a known problem as within 5 minutes of us calling staff, they delivered a mini-router. Very handy if you have urgent work to do in your room.Shiodome isn't the most lively of areas but you'll find all you need at the convenience store downstairs and food is plentiful closeby in the Caretta building next door.Location:Tsukiji Fish Market is a pleasant 10 minute walk away as is Shimbashi Station and the Ginza shopping district. You can even walk to Tokyo station / Marunouchi in about 35 minutes. Shiodome station is right under the hotel.One con is the lack of a gym. Apparently they have a ""Fitness Room"" with 2 exercise machines that you need to book. The weather and traffic outside wasn't the most welcoming for an outdoor run so that was quite disappointing.Another minor incident that happened was the staff revealing the surprise meal I had the concierge book for my wife's birthday. They gave a very handy print out of the restaurant details and map for us - but handed it to me right in front of my wife. Nothing major (it was funny, even), but you have a feeling a more prestigious hotel wouldn't make the same mistake.In summary, I would definitely recommend the Park Hotel Tokyo.

The only double was on a smoking floor and they tried to deodorise the room for us, but after one night we had to move and we were transferred to another room without a problem. Staff most helpful.The open foyer area served as the breakfast area also. Sometimes it was extremely crowded and they had to overflow into a restaurant area. Also most of the seating was designed for relaxing with a drink in the evening and it was not always comfortable to sit at these tables for breakfast. There was plenty of choice for breakfast and more than enough to eat. The hotel has a couple of restaurants and we tried the French one - excellent. The foyer area served as the bar area at night and the prices were fairly expensive and the Japanese idea of non smoking areas just doesn't work.

It is still quite a walk away but quite enjoyable especially in the cold weather, making it a kind of adventure for the curious tourists who would like to see the real Tokyo.The hotel goes out of their way to entertain customer requests which in my case was an early check-in after a 10 hour journey. When i wanted to borrow their ironing board, the staff said that the iron was 'out of order' and that i could use the one in the laundry room. Even with the language barrier and improper use of wordings, the staff offered alternatives to try and give acceptable service to the customer.Cons:There does not seem to be a concierge service. Upon my arrival, my wife and i had a number of bags and none of the staff actually came to help but they just stood and smiled. Nothing wrong with that, but some help to hold the elevator door open when we were getting to the elevator and at least holding the door so we could bring in our big bags would've been great. I could have always asked for them to help but seeing how friendly and helpful the people are in Japan, the lack of thoughtfulness from hotel staff actually surprised me.Simple touches need to be done namely -A simple area map in english, locations of the nearest family mart, access to the subway on the 3rd floor and to the Oedo line could be placed in rooms for the convenience of the guests. It took us a couple of days, and a lot of walking to actually realize that the Oedo Line stopped right below the hotel.Non-speaking guests could be provided with small business cards which they can carry around and show to the people and taxis in order to get directions in case they get lost like we did on one night.Summary:A lovely hotel that just needs some simple tweaks and english speaking ready staff available at all times. I would definitely stay there again the next time i go to Japan and hope that the small areas are improved by then.","Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam",10,5.0

The room was beautiful, light and well laid out, with a window seat so that you can enjoy the view of Tokyo Tower, and if you're lucky, Mt Fuji. For the train enthusiast, you can look down and see the shinkansen running on the tracks below. If you are a very light sleeper, you may have a problem with the distant sound of the trains, but they didn't bother us in the slightest.We didn't eat in the hotel as it was expensive, but there are several options nearby. The concierge gave us directions to a street full of izakaya next to Shimbashi station, which were quite complicated, so take the map offered. There are several cafes nearby for breakfast.We found the staff to be very helpful, particularly the younger ones who all seemed to have completed their university education in New Zealand or Australia. We don't expect Japanese people to use anything but their own tongue, but English skills shown by the staff were exemplary.NB: The Park Hotel is not a long walk from Shimbashi station. With luggage though, I would recommend arriving via Shiodome monorail, as the exit from the station goes straight past the entrance of the hotel, which is very easy. The neighbourhood was a little confusing to navigate at first.","Adelaide, Australia",8,4.0

There was not enough storage space for clothes - and not enough drawers to put stuff in really. but there was tea and really nice coffee in the room. A mini bar stocked with drinks, but no snacks or food. The service was really great with a very helpful concierge, and polite, but not overly in your face waiters and bell boys. I was here for business and would certainly come here again. the only complaint is the fact that people were smoking in the bar - but that applies to every hotel so i cannot hold it against the Park!

The Assistant Manger went out of his way to give us directions, make dinner reservations and insure we knew where to go and how to get there!! The hotel's location is perfect - walking distance to the Pokemon store (we have 3 kids and THIS was important!), right next door to the train and directly on top of the metro. The price is so much more affordable than most other hotels of this caliber.My only negative comment would be about the breakfast. While the food was very good and the staff attentive, the price is high. We found the dining in Tokyo to be fairly reasonable overall, and were disappointed at the price the hotel charged for a basic, buffet breakfast.",Texas,2,4.0

At the time, service, rooms and cleanliness were excellent. As such, on my next trip to Tokyo I decided to stay here again. However, this was certainly a mistake. We booked a premium room and upon entering, the smell of urine which had permeated from the bathroom hit our noses. We then asked to change rooms and were put in a new room. Although this room did not smell, the toilet seat had droplets of blood! It seems that the cleaners do not properly clean the rooms, and the bed covers are quite worn.In terms of service, this hotel is a mixed bag. The younger staff all seem very polite and helpful. The front counter staff always seem happy to help and always greet you with a smile. However, older staff are less friendly and less inclined to help. E.g. I tried to book the airport limousine, and when I asked the staff at the desk about what time I should depart from the hotel, I was told that he did not know my flight departure time when I clearly showed him my departure itinerary and also showed him the time of my international departure flight. Perhaps this had to do with the language barrier, however his demeanor was that he did not seem like he wanted to help at all.

We had a double room on the 33rd floor and when we walked into our room, absolutely exhausted, at 1am we certainly got it! The enormous window looks out over Tokyo with Tokyo Tower at its centre, beautifully illuminated - a truly awesome view that was even better the next morning when we opened the curtains to see the elusive Mt Fuji just to the right of the tower - perfect photo op from the comfort of our bed! The room itself was comfortable, a good size for a Tokyo hotel, with all the amenities you could need. Breakfast is in the atrium lobby and is a good mix of Western and Japanese buffet. FYI, for smokers, the lobby is the smoking area in the evening, but in the day you will need to go down to the designated area at the subway station. You can take the lift straight from the hotel to the subway - look for the lifts on the right that go to B2 as well as the ground floor - and you will walk out into the enormous Shidome/Shinbashi station complex. It's a bit confusing for the newbie in Tokyo, but look for the big maps on the wall - they have English directions, and once you know what station/line you're after, just follow the signs and you'll be fine. Once of the nice things about this area is that you can catch the subway to Asakusa, then take the boat cruise back to Hama Rikyu gardens - well worth doing, and you can see the hotel from the garden. The area around the hotel is not exactly a wander around and admire area, but it is full of skyscrapers and many shops - for resturants, try the Shidome City Centre building (follow the signs in the subway complex) and go for either the uber-luxurious Sky View places at the top, or the cheerful and good value resturants at the bottom. It's maybe 10 minutes from the hotel, so perfect for when you've already been out all day and just want a quick meal and a couple of drinks. The view from the Sky Bars was, to be honest, less impressive than the view from our very own room!Location tip: the hotel is directly connected to the subway Shidome station - look to the sides as you walk through the pedestrain area, look for the Park Hotel logo (3 tree or plant looking things, look it up on their website) on a board by a doorway and you'll find the lift tucked away. If you have big suitcases though, Shinbashi station is a better bet, and is only a ten minute walk away and there are plenty of taxis if you can't walk anymore - suitcases on the subway is not a good idea, as there are not many lifts but many escalators!","Cardiff, United Kingdom",23,4.0

The staff is as good as any staff at Four Seasons or at similar top-notch luxury brand hotels would be. They are extremely courteous yet professional, and as accommodating! Perfect in my opinion!The view from the lobby is stunning! You can see the snow-capped Mt Fuji though the panoramic window during the day time, and at night time, you can see the majestically lit up Tokyo Tower. The view from my room was good as well...didnt have the direct view of Tokyo Tower or Mt Fuji except for the tall buildings of Tokyo and Shinbashi station.This hotel is one of the best kept secrets in entire Tokyo in terms of location for business travelers or for leisure seekers. Only a 10min walking distance from the famous Ginza district. In my opinion, the location is superbly convenient (Shiodome station for Yamanote Line and JR Trains is right under neath the hotel), shopping, restaurants, and post office all within easy walking/stroll distance.So - why a 4-star not a 5 star?The room is very functional, clean, with a full queen bed and a closet, a desk space, a lounger, and a wet bar completes the room. By Tokyo standards, the room is larger than most 4 or 3 star hotels. But the room still felt like utilitarian to me. I would rate the room a 4-star.The 3 star comes from my room's vantage point (Room 3117). I heard every train, metro subway, the bullet train, loud speakers, and other city noises until very late into the night. For some, the noise level might bother them quite a bit. I had ear plugs, which let me sleep soundly, but I still heard the street and subway/train noise. Ironically, I did not hear any noise coming from my next door neighbors.Other than the noise and with some upgraded amenities, this hotel might be a 4.5 star hotel. Then again, I dont love the high rate of 4.5 or 5 star hotel. That's why I will stay at this hotel.","Ladera Ranch, California",14,4.0

I had never been to Japan before (except on my connecting flight to Guam), so needless to say I was excited but also nervous for my adventure.I chose the Park Hotel Tokyo based on a recommendation and some online research and I was not disappointed. The lobby is on the 25th floor of the Shidome Media Tower and as you approach the front desk, you are treated to an amazing view of Tokyo and Mt. Fuji compliments of a wall of windows directly behind the front desk.I was greeted with a warm smile by a friendly member of their staff who spoke English which was a very big relief for me since the only words I know in Japanese are konichiwa and arigato. Everything was perfect with my reservation and within minutes I was at the elevator heading up to my Queen City View room on the 29th floor. I was amazed at the speed and quietness of the elevator as I headed upstairs.Entering my room, the first thing I noticed was how clean it was....and then my eyes were quickly diverted to the amazing view of the city that I had out of my window.The room was small compared to comparably priced hotel rooms in the U.S., however, it was very comfortable and had everything that I needed for my one night stay in Tokyo. The highlights of the room were the very comfortable bed/pillows and the Grohe shower with incredibly good water pressure and temperature control.Breakfast was a buffet in the lobby atrium and was above average. I say that only because the selection of items was smaller than I am used to...the food that was offered was very good, with both traditional Japanese offerings and American options.Next stop was the Concierge desk to plan my day. There I spoke with another very friendly woman who also spoke very good english and not only helped me plan my day, but also walked through the currency with me and reviewed the store hours with me so I could strategically plan my morning. At this time I also purchased my bus ticket to the airport....which as a side note I highly recommend using Airport Limosine to/from the airport. Don't be fooled by the name though....it is a bus service that uses very nice coach-style buses with bathrooms on board. They are very clean and prohibit cell phone use which is fantastic!The only negatives that I can offer regarding the hotel are as follows....1. Since I only had one day in Tokyo, I asked for a late check out....2:00 instead of the standard 12:00 check out time. They agreed to my request but at a charge of 3000 yen....or roughly 35 American dollars based on the exchange rate while I was there. Not a big deal but I it would have been nice to get the extra 2 hours at no charge.2. The hotel has a restaurant/lounge in the lobby area that I wanted to go have a beer at before heading to bed. As I started to enter, I was greeted by a sign that said a 1500 yen cover charge would be added to all bills in the lounge...even for hotel guests. If my intent was to spend the evening in the lounge with friends or meeting people, I would have paid it without any hesitation but my intent was to sit for just long enough to have a beer or two by myself and enjoy the view. Instead I ended up walking the equivalent of a few blocks to get my beer at a local pub.Bottom line....the Park Hotel Tokyo is definitely a hotel that I would stay at again.","Kenosha, Wisconsin",4,5.0

Let me break it down for you.Location. Park Hotel Tokyo is in the Shimbashi area near Ginza, THE shopping destination. We heard Ginza was a few minutes walk from the hotel but we always took a cab for roughly 900Yen which isn’t a lot. Park Hotel Tokyo is connected to the Shinbashi Train Station where you can catch the JR Train that takes you to Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku, Akihabara, or the Tokyo Station- the drop off point if you want to walk to The Imperial Palace. From the basement of Park Hotel Tokyo, it’s a 300- meter walk to the train station. The underground/basement connection is particularly comforting during winter. Convenience. Whenever a pang of hunger hit, we would just go to Basement 2 of the hotel that houses two restaurants and a sake bar that’s open ‘till the wee hours. A Family Mart sits just outside the revolving door. A machine that converts your dollars to yen is just beside the reception area and is easy to use.Room. We booked late and couldn’t get a double room so we settled for a twin room. Each single bed is adequate, not tiny. I’m 5’2” and my husband is 5’10” and we snuggled in one bed comfortably. The standard twin room is 22 square meters, enough space for two people with a huge suitcase and an extra bag. I’m obsessive about cleanliness and the room passed the test, the heated toilet seats and the toiletries that get replenished daily a huge plus. Housekeeping kept everything neat every single day without the staff moving your personal things.Service. Check-In and Check-Out were efficient. We were early for the 2PM Check-In so we left our bags at the concierge. When we came back, we were ushered to our room where our bags were waiting. Sweet. Before we left, the staff arranged for an early schedule for the Narita Express. The staff was businesslike. It’s a business hotel, after all. They gave us space and were not overly solicitous which we appreciated because we’d rather be left alone. But once approached, the staff members go out of their way to help. In fact, the quick-thinking Japanese manager with a Richard Gere demeanor and looks (in a Japanese way) helped us find my husband’s misplaced wallet so fast we never had time to worry. It’s the kind of service that makes an indelible mark.Park Hotel Tokyo is in a quiet area, far from the madness of the shopping crowd but accessible enough thanks to the underground walkway to the train station. We thought of staying in a hotel in the shopping district of Shibuya but congratulated ourselves for choosing to stay here because we could retreat to a quiet place after the sensory overload that is Tokyo.The hotel rooms begin on the 26th Floor and the reception area is on the 25th Floor. An elevator takes you directly to the 25th Floor with a breathtaking view as you go up. The View. The most stunning thing about Park Hotel Tokyo is the view. A morning treat is having a steaming cup of coffee while staring at snow-capped Mt. Fuji and the arresting presence of Tokyo Tower. The view is even more magnificent at night as the whole city lights up. You drift off to sleep with a night light like no other.To me, the hotel is not just a place to sleep. It’s part of the vacation.",Manila,34,5.0

Booking the room over the internet with the hotel was quite easy. But changing the room type on the advice of the reservations team was a bit of a hassle as I had to cancel and rebook on my end. In any case, with more time to think, we re-arranged our travel plans to make use of their special internet promotion.We arrived after midnight by cab from Haneda international airport. [Cab drivers are quite familiar with the Park Hotel Tokyo and/or Shiodome Media Centre] Check in was quick and breezy. We then rolled our 2 suitcases and 2 roll-on bags into our room. Our first lot of 4 nights was spent on the 31st floor. Our subsequent 5 nights [after spending 4 nights in Niigata prefecture] was on the 34th floor. Room view was the same, but still mind-blowing to be up so high. In the morning, the view across Tokyo [in the direction of Ginza] was fantastic. I stayed up one night reading and watching the night scene from my bed.The room is quite compact, particularly after the sofa bed was laid open. However, we could still fit in our luggage and by the end of the trip, an extra duffel bag. Rooms come with an attached modern bathroom with a bath-tub. The toiletries are from Haan & Thaan. These are replenished everyday. The shower has good water pressure and certainly helps one to relax after a hard day of sightseeing or shopping.There is a good quality hairdryer provided. However, we had to be careful to not use the hairdryer and kettle at the same time - it trips the power to the room.We found the room to be warm and cosy, more than adequate to for our needs. The room has a large screen TV, WIFI internet connect, the usual tea/coffee making facility, fridge, and an air-purifier. The air purifier helps to filter any of the food, smoke or unsavory smells from the room. There are local and some satellite stations on TV. The mini-laundry room was particularly useful to us. Situated in a corner on the 26th floor, there are 2 washing machines with dryer function. It does a good job of washing and drying most of our clothes.The concierge team are also very helpful, knowledgeable and efficient. We made use of their local knowledge to plan trips around Tokyo and to get another booking with Sukiyabashi Jiro. This is truly an asset to the hotel.Another plus is that the hotel is quite centrally located to the JR and Oedo Metro lines, and in the Shiodome business area. There are plenty of food outlets and mini-marts in the area. Food choice is not an issue. Once we had our bearings to the train stations, we found walking to the trains very easy. The concierge also advised us to use more of the JR lines as it usually takes us to the heart of the area. In this case, we were headed to Shibuya and Shinjuku.Bearings to the train station - We found this the easiest route to the JR line: Walk out of the hotel on the 3rd floor, head towards the feature clock tower in a westerly direction, take the escalators down 2 floors to the basement, hang a left and walk towards the JR lines - this is easier than negotiating the underground from the hotel's basement-2.If you do get the opportunity to join the hotel's in-house loyalty program, please do so. As a reward for staying 5 nights, I received a breakfast coupon. You can choose a whole array of rewards from their program. We were very comfortable at Park Hotel Tokyo. No real complaints here. The staff are friendly and helpful, the room is good value, and the extras like the laundry, good concierge and central location make this hotel a winner in our books. We will certainly stay here again when we are back in Tokyo.","Singapore, Singapore",203,4.0

I called reception to ask if a mistake was made but they said I was on the non-smoking level and eventually after 10 minutes of speaking they sent someone up to check. They agreed and changed my room. I had the unfortunate pleasure of being in the hotel on the 31st floor when the recent 7.4 earthquake struck. After the tremors cooled off I tried to reach reception to find out what was going on, I went outside and all the lifts were out of order, the emergency exit nearest my room was locked, doors labelled emergency exit were not actually doors and the signs on the ceilings pointed you in a loop. I managed to find the 2nd emergency door on the floor and went down to reception and the flight of stairs were filled with trays that had the remains of meals left over by other customers. I complained to the hotel manager 'Atsushi Ono' and he said that the emergency doors only unlocked in an emergency and I replied, so a 7.4 earthquake isn't an emegency - to this he had no reply. I also said why is one emergency door open and the other isn't, and why the only that's working is littered with trays - again no response. I find it disgusting that a hotel in this day and age takes the wellbeing and safety of it's customers so apathetically. If you care about your safety, I would advise you to stay clear of this hotel. On checking out of the hotel they tried to charge me for 2 breakfasts when in fact I only had 1. I asked for the receipts as they get you to sign it when you eat. After 20 minutes they said they found 1 but couldn't find the other. All in all, a really bad and disappointing experience that really affected my stay in Tokyo.

Our room was a non-smoking double room had one double bed with Tokyo Tower view on high floor per our request. All staff were attentive and their English skills had no problem. The hotel was no more new hotel, but it's carefully maintained and kept clean.My partner is Italian American was very impressed by the beautiful view from the concierge and our room and that the hotel had international atmosphere which was simple & modern was a kind of like it's a not typical Japanese hotel.First, as an Design Hotels, the hotel's architecture is a beautiful and sophisticated has an international atmosphere. Their facilities and the staff's uniform are simple but stylish and practical.Our room was a little small which was like a hotel in New York City or Paris, but also it's a stylish and practical. We could relax as if we were living there as our own apartment of Tokyo. :)We didn’t use spa, but the Thann’s room amenity was same as their spa was great aromatic smell! Breakfast buffet also looked so good!In addition, we also enjoyed their pillow fitters service. The service is provided for the hotel's guests can sleep peacefully while we stay there, it's not for their sales of merchandise. We liked our borrowed pillows were fitted with us, and we bought them at the department store and took to our home in New York City.Second, this hotel is very easy access for both sightseeing and business.If we can book this hotel earlier and stay longer, the cost is lower than the other hotels in the heart of Tokyo. Also this hotel is a very affordable price comparing with the other Design Hotels over the world.Even double rooms, they are a little smaller than the other big hotels in the city of Tokyo, thus you might be prefer to choose the corner twin room if you're a couple and want to stay in a big room.In contrast, I read other reviews that “the bathroom smells like urine.” “difficult to find the hotel entrance.” I also felt a similar smell in our bathroom when I just checked in the room, however, we didn't smell anything after starting to use shower. This hotel is in Kyodo News company’s building 25-34th Fl. Easily understanding entrance is underground or 2nd Fl. Ground floor entrance is better to access by cab for visitor. Underground Entrance is next to Family mart (convenience store - Japanese style convenience deli for 24 hrs) easy access from subway stations or walking underground from JR Shimbashi Station. The 2nd Floor entrance faces on Shiodome Sta. of Yurikamome line. When we can walk from JR Shimbashi Sta. to the 2nd floor entrance, walk upstairs to 2nd Floor has wood deck board walk from street level around Shimbashi Sta. Yurikamome Line, so easily access to 2nd Floor entrance. Sounds like complicated, but you’ll get used to be soon if you stay there.For comparison, after this hotel, we stayed another expensive hotel of big Japanese airline company's group in Odaiba, Tokyo for two nights. But, the hotel's atmosphere was an ordinal Japanese old school style. Many staff were everywhere in the hotel and polite. However, they were a little too much for us. We were not comfortable as same as Park Hotel Tokyo. Despite our room was best view room in the hotel, Park Hotel Tokyo’s view was more impressed for us. Therefore, we definitely stay at Park Hotel Tokyo again when we go to Tokyo.As a result, I highly recommend this hotel for the people emphasize the enjoyment of relaxing of private time like living our own house in stylish atmosphere, luxury & services like hotel but not too much, and view of beautiful the center of Tokyo from high floor in the center of Tokyo.","New York City, New York",11,5.0

It was a wonderfull experience! The lobby is located on the 25th floor. The floors below are offices. Personnel was very nice and spoke English perfectly. We thought the view from the lobby was great, but when we got to our Corner Twin Room on the 33rd floor we where blown away! The view of the Tokyo Skyline is absolutely breathtaking. It offers great views of the city and its inhabitants. Shinbashi Station is directly below the hotel, lots of subways pass through as well as lots of Shinkansen trains. The roomsize is average, not to big, not to small. The room was clean and came with all sorts of amenities. We booked well in advance so the roomprice was affordable enough.The location of the hotel is maybe not as vibrant as one would expect (mainly officebuildings) but Ginza and Shinbashi are within walking distance. The fismarket is a 20 min walk (I think it will be a bit shorter once the roadwork is completed) Also the subway offers great connections to other parts of the city. The unmanned train-station Shiodome is right next to the hotel and connects to Shinbashi Station and more important the artificial island Odaiba with lots of shopping malls, movie theaters and Gundam shop!The hotelbar was expensive, 10 euro for a beer is ridiculous....","Alkmaar, The Netherlands",39,5.0

The staff is friendly and helpful Unfortunately, the hotel entrances are hidden in a maze of underpasses, overpasses, up and down escalators, and tunnels. Even after three nights there we found it hard to locate the way back from Shinbashi Sation, and it didn't help that there are two other Park Hotels in the vicinity plus a Shiodome Tower that is not the Shiodome Media Tower. There is no surrounding neighborhood, just a confluence of expressways. (Despite some claims, it is not really near the Ginza).

Stayed with family for 4 nights at the Park Hotel (2 adults, 2 girls). Good value and size by Tokyo standards with a location that can't be beat.Top 10 things that we liked about the Park Hotel Tokyo:-Views galore: Located on the top floors of the Shiodome media tower, hotel views couldn't get better. Tokyo tower and Mt Fuji on one side of the hotel and Tokyo bay on the other. Unbeatable, especially Tokyo tower at night. With its iconic red color, it beats the Eiffel tower IMHO. -Location, location, location: Ginza is a 5 minute walk. Shiodome and the very connected JR Shimbashi Station are steps away. This station can take you anywhere in Tokyo. Tsukiji fish market is a hop, skip and jump away.-Our corner room: A little bigger for our family, and with Tokyo Tower bidding us sweet dreams every night, a veritable treat for the eyes.-Staff: Japan is known for its service, and this hotel definitely did not disappoint. We were met everywhere with smiles and a can-do attitude from the check in staff, the bellhops, to the Japanese and English speaking concierge staff. English speaking Chris was a bit off his element during our trip (we were a bit disappointed given the previous rave reviews) but the Japanese staff was incredible.-Cleanliness: Spotless. Everywhere. -Art: Whimsical and interesting. Even the photojournalistic exhibit of the adjoining Kyodo News office on the lower floor was a nice welcome back home.-Vending machine that changes foreign currency in the lobby. Enough said.-Airport bus from Narita goes directly to the hotel. Take the direct bus and don't try taking the trains from the airport unless you know the area very well. The tunnels and walkways will take some getting used to.-The 7-11 convenience store located in the basement of the hotel. I can't tell you how may trips a day we made to get rice balls, green tea kitkat, ice coffee, water, japanese beer and more. Extremely reasonable prices in expensive Tokyo.-Finally, the Ghibli clock show right outside the hotel on the NTV building is an amazing experience. OK, not technically part of the hotel, but so close that we linked it to our stay. This clock was designed by the famous Japanese animator Miyazaki and there are several showings a day. We sometimes timed out trips to and from the hotel to see this free clock show. Incredible.Things that the hotel could work on:-More comfortable beds. We slept well, but could be a tad more comfortable.-Ice machines. Could be more robust. We had to research several floors before we were able to find our favorite (one with a reliable supply of ice).-WiFi: Weak signal in the rooms. Free in the lobby but experience would be vastly improved with room access (especially considering this is the ""media"" tower).-Gym: Should be free (rather than cost $) especially since it is just a shoebox of a room. But on the bright side, this forced me to run outdoors and explore the interesting areas off the beaten path.-Room furniture: Just showing a little wear now with scratches and such. All in all, we would come back to the Park Hotel as a family. Also cool that Tablet Hotels features this hotel as well.",San Francisco,82,4.0

There is a coffee shop on the bottom floor, along with a 7/11, and small restaurants. The metro is downstairs in the building, so the location can't get any better. Ginza is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel, and right outside across the street is a fantastic nightlife area with great food, bars, pachinko, and anything else an adult in Japan would enjoy.

Can't fault the view from the room we had which was room# 3304 and facing Tokyo Tower. The desk service was mixed with some staff pleasant and others quite grumpy. The reception area bar was pleasant enough but confounds me why they have the reception desk and bar area set up with the reception desk having the views of the Tower and the bar area parked at the rear of the room with no views. Surely the Tower view is what you'd want to be looking at when you are paying the prices they charge for a drink ?

But that's great - it lifts you up and out of the Mecca that is Tokyo and opens up excellent bar-level views on to Tokyo Tower and the city, while the rooms - which are yet further up - also offer sublime views of the city right towards the waterfront. Location-wise there's the morning fish market a short walk away, a waterfront park also a short walk away, while Shinbashi is a major hub that's essential to getting around the city. The whole Shiodome media park also has various fun things going on depending on what time of year you're out there. For a four star hotel there was nothing missing. Ok, so there's no swimming pool, but we knew that in advance so it wasn't a problem. On the first night, suffering from massive jetlag, a short walk around was all we could manage before falling back to the hotel to grab some easy food. The burgers with avocado that we had, while a little pricey, were seriously good. Just what we needed. Although the rooms aren't necessarily going to blow you away, they're a lot larger than you'd find in most Tokyo hotels. That's a huge bonus. They're not ""American sized"", but ""European sized"" is probably the best way to explain it. The staff were really good to us too. After a strange insect bite at Fuji they were very good in getting us to see a doctor at a hospital for further advice. This had impacted further excursion plans, so the Japanese concierge was able to phone up various venues and explain in Japanese what had happened in order to cancel on our behalf. Was very useful. Then after a magnitude seven earthquake offshore the staff were equally chilled out and unfazed by something that had really shook us up! Very reassuring in their explanations.The bar was a frequent hangout for us too. The Japanese, at least at this place, chill their port. Not sure why, but it tasted good enough to see me back in the bar pretty much every night and the barman was always great to chat to as he was trying to improve his English skills. It's really hard to find much to moan about. An exceptional property.","London, United Kingdom",104,5.0

Our room was on the 27th floor with a view of the Sumida River You can find good rates for this hotel on their website that don't seem to differ much from the major booking websites. I did learn that when my first flight was cancelled that I needed to call the booking agency to change my reservation rather than calling the hotel directly. Rooms are small, as is normal in Tokyo, so leave your largest suitcases at home and travel light. Bathrooms are clean and functional. I was worried that the room might be too warm in light of the push to save energy but that wasn't a problem. You have full control of in room temperature and they have the quietest cooling system I have ever experienced in a hotel (usually, the noise keeps me awake the first night). Furnishings are nice and the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. They speak enough English to help with most of your needs. Housekeeping is unobtrusive and thorough. The hotel can be reached via a long, confusing underground walk from Shimbashi Station (follow the overhead signs for Shiodome) and a shorter underground walk from Shiodome Station (use the maps of the area on the wall to find Shiodome Media Tower). If you have heavy luggage, or are too jet-lagged to follow directions, I would recommend taking the Airport Limousine Bus that delivers you from the airport to the front door. You can also take a taxi from Tokyo Station if that's where your train or bus leads you after arriving in Japan. All the buildings in the Shiodome area seem to be connected via the tunnels with shops and restaurants galore. There are bilingual maps along the way when you get lost. Make sure that you are navigating to Shiodome Media Tower. The lobby is very attractive and a comfortable place for a drunk or light meal.

It was our first trip to Tokyo and I booked the hotel after doing ample research on Expedia and Trip Advisor. From those sites, the hotel appeared to be very modern and clean, situated in a great central location and at a very reasonable price. A huge plus was the ability to have 3 persons stay in one room. We booked a Premium Twin room which gave us a 2 beds and a sofa bed AND an amazing view of the Tokyo skyline with the new Tokyo Skytree off to the North! The views at the hotel are amazing due to the fact that the hotel is situated atop the Shiodome Media Tower.We thoroughly enjoyed our room and felt it was a good size for the 3 of us. We definitely enjoyed waking to the beautiful views of the city and ending our day overlooking the city lights below. I truly believe this room/hotel helped in making our trip to Tokyo that more special. The staff is incredibly friendly, polite and willing to help -- always greeting us with a smile as we came back to our home away from home.As for location... some reviewers on trip advisor had been critical of the location. We, however, found it to be ideal. In a nice and modern part of town, it is within easy walking distance of many local attractions as well as several train and subway stations. Heck, even the train to Odaiba has a station just steps from the entrance to the hotel. Head out there if you're looking for some shopping, dining or just for fun! We did... it was great. We also enjoyed easy walks to Ginza and the areas around Shinbashi in the evenings especially to watch all the activity after work hours and people flooded the streets. Great photo opportunities! My wife and I are photographers and Tokyo did not disappoint!There is so much more to say about this great hotel and it's great staff, but I think I've gone on enough. I'm sure I'm missing great stuff as well. I'll add it if I remember more! I HAD to write a review so this hotel would get the praise it definitely deserved. PLUS, we already have plans to return to Tokyo next spring and will be staying at the Park Hotel for our entire stay... Hopefully in a Premium Twin room again.

If you're looking for a new, modern hotel with easy access to the subway (Shiodome station was literally just downstairs and Shimbashi station was a 7-minute walk away), a convenience store and close proximity to good food and major attractions, this hotel is a winner. What's more, if you manage to secure a room with a view of the Tokyo Tower, the night view is nothing short of spectacular.What elevated our experience from great to amazing was the service we enjoyed. During our stay, not only were our needs promptly accommodated on every score, we felt that the staff really went the extra mile to build a relationship with us, and to fulfill with every request to the utmost. For instance, when we asked for recommendations to karaoke lounges nearby, Lettow, a young gentleman with immaculate manners, came up to our room with specially printed maps to three lounges, and proceeded to explain the pros and cons of each establishment, give clear directions and even provide us with discount coupons. When we missed our flight home because of a mix-up between Narita and Haneda airports, Mr. Yasuhiro Kodaka, one of assistant managers, as well as his colleague in the next shift, tried for more than three hours to contact the airline by phone on our behalf. He was so sympathetic and helpful that we felt almost glad to be staying for an additional night. He arranged for us to have a room with a direct view of the Tokyo Tower at a fantastic rate, and kindly said that he hoped the view would cheer us up! One of the bellboys, whose name I'm sorry I didn't get, took charge of our luggage while the Mr, Kodaka was still trying unsuccessfully to reach the airline, and did his best to soothe us by making sure we were waiting comfortably on roomy couches with glasses of iced water. He actually stayed almost half an hour past the end of his shift for our sake, only leaving when we finally let him know that we would probably be checking back into the hotel.My husband and I were really touched and gratified by the efforts of the hotel staff to help us make the most of a bad situation, and at how genuinely glad they seemed to be for us when we managed to get seats on a flight the next morning.

Ask for a room the faces the Tokyo Tower when booking.The hotel is near lots of public transport, although the immediate area lacks the vibrancy of other areas in Tokyo. Smoking is permitted in parts of the Lobby, which can impact on the various food and drink options available. The bar lacked life and the drinks were expensive - the nearby Conrad Hotel bar, while also expensive, has a much better vibe.The bed, bathroom and internet access (free) were all fine.The staff were polite and attentive - with the tour desk going an extra step to help us with booking tickets for the Baseball.

Upon informing the front desk, they said they would clean the room, though when I returned the smell had not improved. After bringing it to their attention again, I was moved to a second room where the same smell, albeit weaker, was still present. This however is NOTHING compared to the lack of air conditioning here. Turned to the lowest temperature on full blast, the a/c is barely a trickle and the room soon heats up to unbearable temperatures. You are in a skyscraper so the windows cannot open, and so you are essentially in a sauna for the duration of the trip. This was an issue in both rooms, and after speaking to the manager, he informed me the room could not be made any cooler.

The carpet is stained and the walls in bad shape. Same, the bathroom looks like it was 15 years old. I arrived to the hotel at 10am and they said their policy is not allow check in before 2PM. I had to negotiate for an earlier check in and got 12pm. The first room they gave me was facing a railway and trains were passing every other minute, with lots of noise. The were kind to change my room instantly (and not surprised at all, they should be used to this) however one should note that half of the rooms are extremely noisy because of this.The hotel website mentions that they have a gym. They charge 500Yen for gym access and the gym is a 10m2 room with very limited, poor and old equipment, that you need to book 45mn in advance.

This time around the reception staff weren’t friendly and I was made to feel that I was an inconvenience when asking a few simple requests (cancelling a restaurant reservation due to the Typhoon and storing of bags when we were checking back in). On our final departure from this hotel - we received no thanks for staying and no assistance with our baggage to the lifts - instead they simply processed the bill and that was it. Also on asking a question about Disneyland and if it would be busy on the day we were thinking about going - we were told it would be quiet and not busy - to arrive there and find waiting times for rides were 4 hours due to it being school holidays!!!!We experienced great customer service everywhere else on our travels - so it was a shame not to have been able to experience this at the Park Hotel Tokyo also.

Small differences in favor of Park Hotel Tokyo: a slightly larger lobby and lounge area, better restaurants, and a more convenient road access, making it in my opinion a marginally better product.

The hotel is situated on top of the train/subway station Shinbashi/Shiodome, and while that's supposed to be convenient and all, the complicated tunnels and walkways take some time to get used to. The hotel didn't have a gym at that time, but as I was checking out they mentioned they were working on a simple workout facility. Next to the hotel there are restaurants in the office buildings, and Ginza is about 10 minutes walk away. Shiodome is an interesting area filled with office buildings and bridges that take you across main roadways and connecting some of the newer buildings. My room at the hotel is quite basic, and not big by any means. The view was facing the opposite side of Tokyo Tower so I got an interestingly distorted reflection of the tower at night thanks to the Conrad Tokyo that's across the street. From Haneda airport, the hotel was only 15-20 mins away by taxi, and the airport limousine bus makes a stop right in front of the hotel. There is free wifi, and the toiletries are Thann from Thailand. Nothing much else to say - the bed was not particularly comfortable compared to those at the Hilton or Hyatt tokyo, but nothing to complain about. All in all, if you're travelling for business and your meetings are in Ginza or Shiodome, this is a good hotel to stay at. If you're looking for a base in tokyo so you can shop around shibuya, Shinjuku, etc, it is about 30-40 mins away - not exactly convenient.

It is very close (well literally on top of one Metro station) and is a few seconds walk from the elevated railway that goes to Odiaba, you can also access Shimbashi Station which is a 5 min walk through a series of walkways, some elevated, mostly underground that have shops and cafe's/restaurants. You are also a few mins walk from the Caretta Shiodome building which has a fairly extensive food court. The tube stations nearby provide close access to whichever direction you might be heading in to the centre of Tokyo.Worth noting also, the Hotel is 10 mins to Tsukiji Fish Market, we made the most of our jet lag and got up early to see the tuna auctions, a great experience.The Hotel itself is welcoming, staff very polite and helpful, the room was small (but average sized by Tokyo standards, I'm told) but was well designed, not claustrophobic and had amazing views over the harbour and Odiaba (from the 29th floor.) Service was very good, laundry was taken care of very efficiently, our luggage was couriered onto Kyoto by the staff with no problems or hassles. Everybody was polite and friendly.I had a strong, free wifi signal in my room, which was a pleasant surprise, I had assumed that the wifi was centred around the Reception area, but there was an alternative router entitled something like 'Park Hotel Games' which was great. Breakfasts were plentiful, both European and Japanese style, the European style breakfast was not quite like you would find in a European Hotel (the way the bacon, eggs and sausage were made up etc:) but that is to be expected I think and it tasted just fine to me.The main thing for me was the Hotel's location. For a first timer, Tokyo is a mildly confusing place and even though you don't walk out right in the middle of the action, it's right by Ginza, Odiaba and Tsukiji, having the Metro in such close proximity made travel around the city very easy and pleasurable.","London, United Kingdom",8,4.0

Wow!). There are English-language channels on the television, a couple of good restaurants, a laundry room with a couple of washer-dryers (which is a real boon!

English is no problem. I stayed for five nights and really enjoyed myself.**Another word on the location: Shiodome is a business area. To really get your bearings, you'll need to undertake a little trial and error with the various walkways and bridges. There are nearby restaurants beneath the office blocks, but the streets don't offer much to tourists and you'll need to walk to the train to access most Tokyo attractions.

It was intoxicating. The rooms were large and decorated with a great deal of taste, possibly with European leanings. The staff were nothing but friendly. Neither of us having any real idea on where to go, we ended up just having a chat with the concierge about our interests and he booked us up on two fantastic trips; a day trip to Mount Fuji and the volcanic lake, as well as a smaller scale (but equally enchanting) guided foot tour to the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka. In a country that is famed for it's unfailing politeness, the staff at Park Hotel were no exception. The main criticism I'd offer is that there isn't a great deal in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. There is a small shopping centre which can be accessed by the sky walkways, and it's a short walk into Shimbashi or Ginza, neither of which I personally felt offered the quintessentially Japanese experiences that can be found in Shibuya, Shinjuku or Asakusa.

I would be ashamed to have anything to do with this property. Park Hotel Tokyo is at most a 3 star property by international standards, with no facilities (pool, gym etc). Service was just as basic, and who ever is in charge of their F&B dept needs to rethink their career choice. I have NEVER seen such a poor room service menu, even at limited service properties. To give you an example, my wife & I checked in at 11pm, and were very hungry after a long flight. Park Hotel's late night menu has only 4 items available, we had the worst spaghetti & pizza we have experience in a very long time, and when I asked for a bottle of wine, was told they couldn't do that, but when I went down to the lobby, I had to ask the restaurant for a bottle & glasses. If I can buy a bottle in the lobby, why can't Room Service do the same? On a subsequent night I tried to order a hot chocolate, but amazingly, even something as simnple as this was beyond them!!!!The rooms are very basic, yes, they are clean, but looking pretty worn with frayed carpets, and if this is a ""business"" hotel, why do they put a hard wooden chair at the desk. For some reason, the hotel management has chosen the most complicated TV remote control in the world, but if you are a non-japanese speaker, your options are very very limited.The one highlight in the rooms were the Thann toiletries, which are very nice.The lobby is a dead area compared to what they could do with it. Yes it has an atrium, but there is no sense of a relaxing communal area, no music, and I had to chase for service. Dressing your staff in formal wear doesn't constitute high quality, just a lack of imagination.In summary, there are a lot of much better hotels in the area, or close by with much higher quality for around the same price. I would NEVER willing return to Park Hotel Tokyo, and will be steering any friends & colleagues travelling to Tokyo to go elsewhere","Singapore, Singapore",12,2.0

We had previously stayed in the Conrad opposite in 2008 but the exchange rates were much better then. The hotel itself was very good and staff were friendly and helpful. We had a triple room with Tokyo Tower views and it was small by normal standards but completely adequate. The electronic toilet and shower were very good and toiletries were brilliant - they even supplied free razors which is a first for me. Coffee and tea was provided in the room and free internet was available, although wifi reception was disappointing in the rooms. However, I got good speeds using the ethernet line provided. Food and drinks in the hotel was very expensive as expected. We chose to have meals outside which was the right choice in this recession climate! There were plenty of noodle and teppanyakki restaurants surrounding the Shimbashi area, and also Subway, etc. The only downside was the lack of a pool.Overall, I would definitely come back to Tokyo and stay in this hotel again as it was perfect as a base to explore the city from. The Toyko Metro system has to be one of the cheapest and best underground systems in the world. We never struggled at all in getting around the city with two small boys in tow.

I traveled with my wife and two small children ages 5 and 8. I picked the Park Hotel because of its location and reputation. I was pleased with the room size. Not quite ""US Sized"" but a Premium Twin was just big enough, had a 32 inch Panasonic with a HDMI input that allowed me to tranquilize the kids with dozens of .mkv movie files. The internet connection (I brought my own LAN to WAN adapter but they will loan you one) was good enough to allow me to make voip phone calls, stream some movies from my Sling Box and download a free game from Steam (Yes, we left the room occasionally).The location is, to my mind perfect. Not as much hustle and bustle and after 1830 hrs, quiet. If you want the silliness, it's a 500 meter walk to Shimbashi JR station and Square and the Ginza is just beyond. Literately attached to the building (Level 3) is the Yurikamome Shiodome Station (You're in Shiodome, dummy) which can take you pilotlessly to Odaiba for some shopping, museums and plenty of room for two kids to run around. In the basement is the Family Mart convenience store (where you will be eating if you try traveling with two bottomless pits) and the subway station. Both the Anpanman and Pokemon stores are within walking distance to further wear out the young 'uns.The much discussed vie de France is located in the Shiodome City Center building (Level three, across the bridge, turn left, down 2 escalators, straight ahead through a pair of really cool rotating doors, viola! You in France!)We understand that there are many luxury amenities that are available to you here at the Park. I'm sure they are quite nice. However, we chose to hustle ourselves through the lobby with a minimum of fanfare and disturbance. There's a bunch of Tokyo out there to be seen.

Actually, it was very easy to visit Roppongi and Tsukiji Market using Oedo Line. (The station Located basement level of the hotel. So, you don't have to go outside.) We had a chance to experience Tsukiji Market, Ginza, Roppongi Hills and Tokyo Midtown all in one day and still had time to enjoy a great dinner and drinks in Marunouchi after a long nap.We visited the Conrad Hotel next door with our friends and we had a terrific time. In the lounge, they had a live Brazilian band who played Bossa Nova. Obrigada! The room our friends stayed in was much bigger (Premium Twin?) however, they paid a lesser room rate. But, our room had a better view and was closer to the elevator. Over all, our experience at this hotel was great.

I booked the 5 night special online, so got the room for a very good price. This time we chose a corner twin room - they are more spacious. So if you can afford it, this is a good option. We got a view of Tokyo Tower, which was brilliant. One clear evening we watched the sun set over Mt Fuji and the city lights slowly come on - magic!The hotel is located in a business area, but is a very short walk from Shimbashi and Ginza. So there is no shortage of good places to eat, be it cheap and cheerful or wonderfully indulgent and expensive. And there are plenty of coffee shops for breakfast thanks to the businesses in the area. The hotel does serve breakfast, but like all hotels of this calibre, it appears to be extremely generous and thus not cheap. As we don't eat much for breakfast, so couldn't justify the expense, so can't really comment on its quality.It is an easy walk to Tsukiji Fish Markets (where you can get a fabulous breakfast or in our case, brunch), and then stroll to Hamarikyu park, where you can jump on a boat for a trip up the Sumida River to Asakusa.By using the underground access from the hotel you can walk to either Shimbashi Station (which is on the Yamanote line,) or to the subway. There's also a convenience store in the basement, very handy for those little things you need. Go above ground and you can get on the driverless train to Odaiba.It is not a busy area at night, like Shinjuku or Shibuya, so if that's what you're after, don't bother staying here. We actually like the fact that the streets are quiet at night, just to get a break from the mayhem of Tokyo during the day. In any case, there is very easy access to any of these places by a short rail ride. The room was very comfortable and clean, with a great contemporary design. What is even better is the foyer with its massive atrium that runs right to the top of the building. (Do note that the hotel only starts from level 25 - below that are offices) It's also great in the evening when there's live music playing in the foyer, as there was during our visit.The bathroom is well stocked with goodies. In fact I love the products and actually sought them out when we returned to Australia the last time. The only downside was some instruction about not boiling the kettle while the bathroom was in use, or something to that effect. It didn't bother us, but unusual to say the least.We didn't know there was a wireless facility when we were there, but then again, maybe it wasn't there at the time. We didn't think to ask as cable still seems to be the norm across most of Japan. As long as we can send a couple of quick emails and check news at home we really don't want to waste a lot of time on the computer, we'd much rather be experiencing the city, or country, whatever the case may be.The staff were fantastic. Always friendly and helpful. As an example, they certainly gave us the best advice on getting to the airport. We would have struggled with 2 big suitcases on a train, not knowing that a limousine bus stops right out the front. It was cheap, easy and very comfortable.I always plan to stay in the best hotel we can afford before flying out of Japan so we get a good sleep before an overnight plane trip home.

There is no wi-fi and spotty internet service at best, which is unacceptable in a technologically advanced country such as Japan. Breakfast buffet in lobby restaurant is rather overpriced and low quality. Although my room was on the next to top floor (33rd), I could hear the trains passing through the station below at all hours, not to mention my neighbors in the room next door...poor sound insulation in general.

From the lobby you could see Tokyo Tower and Mt Fuji (when its clear). The hotel is an ideal location with connecting access to the Shiodome station and the Shinbashi station. Since it is an office building connected by elevated walkways, there were 2 coffee shops and several eateries nearby. In addition the other Media Tower in the complex has several restaurants on the 41st and 42nd floor, so there is quite a bit around. Just a 10 min walk outstide the hotel and you are in Ginza.

What will stay in my mind for the rest of my life however, was the view to the city. We asked for a city view room and we could see the whole of Tokyo, the Tower, Ropongi, Shibuya, Shinjuku, the lot. With something around 170 euros a night, Tokyo Park was a real bargain you rarely find in Tokyo for a genuine upper 4 star hotel. From a practicalities point of view, the truth is it's a bit far from the main party lands like Shibuya, but it has great tube connections to everywhere (the station is right in the basement) and it is just a stone throw away from the fish market and Ginza. Shiodome itself is very impressive and there are some great small eateries in Shinbashi just over the railway bridge opposite the hotel. I cannot recommend this hotel more. It really is one of the things to remember from our trip to Japan. Isn't that what every traveler wants?","Bristol, United Kingdom",19,5.0

I said thank you and proceeded getting dressed. Almost immediately, the phone rang again and the lady at the front desk told me that although the nearest hotel was indeed 5 minutes away, it would be a better idea to visit Tokyo Clinic, since they were more experienced in dealing with expats. The lady on the other end of the telephone proceeded to inform me that if I could get ready immediately, she could secure an appointment for me in 20 minutes. If not, the next opening was later that morning (she had already checked). I said thank you and started to get dressed, in order to make the earlier time slot, until there was a knock on our door.The shift manager was at our door, asking if I was alright.

Staff were astonished; no tourists ever seem to want to spend a fortnight in Tokyo but we loved every minute of it and the Park Hotel was a major contributer to the experience. Not to be confused with neighbouring Royal Park, this ultra-modern property is located in Shiodome, a brash new development between Shimbashi and Ginza. The hotel occupies upper floors of a media tower block and the building is quintessentially Tokyo: high rise and futuristic. Shiodome station is right underneath, you can take an elevator from lobby to station. The lobby is a cool place to chill out, they have piano music, soft lighting, free internet and stunning panaoramas of the city. TY Bar is dark, atmospheric and redolent of 'Lost in Translation' bar where Bill Murray meets Scarlett Johansen. TY adjoins a Michelin starred restaurant (pricey). A giant atrium means each accomodation floor looks down upon the lobby through soundproofed glass. This ensures a great night sleep, didn't hear a pin drop during the small hours and staff are so unobtrusive. Room is compact but extremely comfortable and as clean as you'll ever see. Breakfast served in the lobby was adequate but overpriced. We bought yoghurts, fruit, muffins etc in the shop on the ground floor and stashed in our minibar fridge. There are some good eateries in adjoining building (follow signs) e.g. To The Herbs Italian style restaurant and a cool bar where salarymen choose from a variety of 75 beers.

I was looking for something that worked within my budget, was conveniently located in the center, and offered a host of other amenities I desired in order to make my stay a little more comfortable. This was somewhat challenging a), because Tokyo—as most people know--isn't particularly inexpensive and, b), amenities that may come standard elsewhere one tends to pay a premium for here, so not surprising that my task was quite daunting. In the end, I was quite pleased I chose Park Hotel as this hotel turned out to be precisely what I was looking for. Park Hotel is located in the Shiodome Media Tower, in the Shiodome business district of Minato, in Tokyo. It is literally a stones throw from the Shimbashi subway station where you have access to the Ginza and Toei Asakusa subway lines and JR lines, and walking distance from the luxury emporiums that flank Chuo-dori Street in Ginza and world famed dept. store, Mitsukoshi (don’t miss it). The lobby is located on the 25th Fl of the Media Tower and guest rooms from the 26th Fl upwards. At these heights you can imagine what sorts of views await. The lobby with adjacent lounge, for instance, has sweeping views of the Tokyo skyline, with the Tokyo Tower in perfect view.Standard rooms are on the smaller side but I found mine to be quite adequate for a solo traveler. They come with flat panel TVs, standard complementary beverage service, and free hi-speed internet connection via ethernet cables. The bathroom's just as modest, space wise, but the bath/grooming set is actually pretty impressive. I couldn't resist stashing a few toiletries away just before leaving; they were that good. There are several restaurants and a café onsite, and the hotel features a daily breakfast buffet--though I didn’t particularly find this to be of value. I thought it was a little on the pricy side for the scant selection. At those rates, for just a little bit more, I would suggest checking Conrad next door where you can enjoy a much nicer selection and an equally impressive view at one of Gordon Ramsay’s restaurants. Transfers back to the airport can be easily arranged by the very accommodating front desk staff or the Concierge. Overall, lovely place to stay.","New York City, New York",63,4.0

We arrived late in the evening after a long, delayed, grueling flight and were delighted to be greeted by bell hop Chris, a Brit who had recently started working at the hotel. My son speaks conversational Japanese, so it was not essential, but it was still nice to be greeted by a native English speaker. Chris provided us with our first set of local maps and subway info and gave us some tips on the places we were planning to go. English was never a problem at the hotel. The Japanese hotel staff at the reception counter and the concierges all spoke excellent English. And even the restaurant and bell stand staff spoke some. When our questions were beyond their ability, they quickly summoned a more fluent English speaker for help.The hotel is beautifully appointed and the rooms were comfortable and included Yukata and slippers for use in the room. The breakfast buffet which we paid to include with our room was extensive and provide plenty of Japanese and Western choices, loads of fresh hot coffee and juices, fresh fruit, etc. Many hot and cold choices which satisfied Mom, a dedicated sausage enthusiast, and son, a vegetarian. We filled up at breakfast and mostly were able to skip lunch, and just have a light snack during the day.Service at the hotel was excellent. We were there at a very quiet time, but there was a plethora of staff to whisk away plates at the breakfast area. The service was professional and gracious, but not cloying or overbearing.A bonus was a nice view of Mt. Fuji from the reception area of the hotel on clear days. The hotel is located in a high rise above an underground mall area with many restaurants and shops and convenient access to trains and subways. It is a short walk to Tsukiji Fish Market and Hamarikyu Gardens. The hotel is near a busy intersection of roads and has a series of somewhat complicated overpasses to negotiate. This stymied us a bit the first day but once we got oriented it was very convenient. We returned to Tokyo later in our trip and stayed at the famed Park Hyatt Tokyo in Shinjuku, but I actually liked the Park Hotel and it's location better. It was warmer, friendlier.",Detroit,20,5.0

We spent the first half of our stay in Tokyo, a weekend based in Nagoya (to venture out daily to Suzuka for the Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix), and finally a week in Kyoto with daytrips across Western Honshu (Hiroshima/Miyajima, Himeji, Osaka).THE LOCATION: The Park Hotel Tokyo sits atop the Shiodome Media Tower, in the Tokyo media/advertising mini-city of Shiodome. The hotel is right next to the pricey shopping & dining of Ginza and the markets of Tsukiji. The hotel is part of a business center development connected to a sprawling transit station, with connections to Japan Rail (stop: Shimbashi), the metro (stop: Shiodome), and even the automated Yurikamome rail line to Odaiba. It is also conveniently located stops away from major JR hubs at Shinagawa and Tokyo station for connections to/from Narita Airport or to bullet trains traveling to Kyoto and beyond. In short, it's a good place to base your trip. There is a FamilyMart convenience store located on the basement floor of the building, just outside the lobby entrance; this was extremely useful for picking up cheap meals to-go, toiletries, and other daily items. Given that the hotel is in a business area, the foot traffic is controlled chaos during rush hour, and the immediate surroundings are sort of ""dead"" after 5pm. However, there many moderately priced food & drink options nearby in adjacent complexes like Caretta Shiodome; they are all accessible via the underground passageways. However, exiting the complex after business hours on the JR Shimbashi side is like a salaryman's playland: with tons of pachinko parlors, bars, cheap eats and bright lights, it affords the chance for an off-the-beaten path experience.THE LOBBY: The lobby on the 25th floor has definite ""wow"" factor, from the multi-storied atrium to the panoramic view of Tokyo Tower behind the front desk. The hotel hosts a series of live jazz in the lobby with no cover charge, which was nice to unwind to (with cocktail in hand) after a day of sight-seeing. The lobby is the only part of the hotel with free Wi-Fi internet service.THE ROOM(S): We actually checked out a couple of rooms during our stay (sorry, I've completely forgotten the room numbers!). The first room on arrival was a standard City Queen room on the 32nd floor, which had an impressive view of the rail station below... but also looked right across at the adjacent skyscraper. We elected to pay an extra US$20 a night to switch to a Corner Twin on the 34th floor with views of Tokyo Tower. The beds were mounted apart and couldn't be pushed together (as you might see in, say, a European hotel), but we loved the view too much to pay any mind. It is worth the extra cost to book a room with a Tokyo Tower view; be sure to specify this when booking. The rooms have a warm modern feel, although I would have liked better storage options: the closet is very small and the only dresser drawers are in the office desk. The Corner Twin was also considerably larger than the City Queen, both in the bedroom and bathroom spaces.THE FOOD & SERVICE: Front desk service was informative and always helpful; although I speak Japanese, my husband does not yet he was able to talk with the staff without problem. In addition to dealing with switching our room (handled without any hitches or bad attitudes), they took care of setting up advance reservations at a deluxe sushi restaurant via e-mail a few weeks prior to our arrival in Tokyo and answered our questions about watching the Tsukiji tuna auctions (the concierge offered to call a cab for us but we chose to walk--if you're particular about queuing up *real* early for the first batch of auctions at 4:30am, it's better to take the taxi, turns out). Cocktails at the lobby bar are expensive (average US$15), as is generally the case in Japan, it seemed. The hotel also offers complementary pillow fitting consultations, but the consultant was only available during the early afternoon when we were still out sight-seeing.Overall, the hotel was a good base for our first trip to Tokyo that I would recommend to my friends and family, provided they could stomach the high prices to match the great views (or score a deal).","San Francisco Bay Area, California",6,4.0

I really wanted to like this hotel but the service and food are subpar.I'll start at the beginning. The hotel is located on top of the Shiodome Media tower, the top ten floors. So check in is on the 25th floor.I arrived at about 7:15 at night and although there is a kiosk in the lobby of the Shiodome, nobody was there to meet or assist with bags. Someone did come down in the elevator when I called it, and escorted me to the front desk. Check in was fine, no escort to room or again no offer of assistance with bags.The room is nice but small. I expected small and do not fault them for it. As small as it is though, it's pretty well laid out and spotless. The tub is also small (not very long) by North American standards. But it was deep and that helped make up for it. The offered a lot of nice amenties - toothbrushes, toothpaste, razor, etc.The bed is extremely comfortable but not the pillows. The view was very nice but not spectacular. The hallways are cool - they wrap around and look down on the lounge in the lobby. I ate twice at the hotel. Once was in the evening for appetizers in the lounge. They do not advertise appetizers in the lounge, in fact when I asked they told me to go to one of their restaurants. When I pushed the point as they did not answer my question, they said yes they do offer appetizers/small mealsds. The guy running the lounge did not write down my order (he spoke perfect english though) and proceeded to forget half of it.Breakfast the next day was no better. They ignore you at the entry. Some of the wait staff even looked directly at me but offered no assistance. I finally seated and started to serve myself at the buffet when someone magically showed up and immediately gave me a bill (I hadn't even started eating yet..?!!). They did this to another lady as well. As for breakfast - food was pretty bland, eggs not hot, could have more variety. Keep in mind this hotel is not very well marked on the outside. If you stay here - make sure you take a good long look at the front of the hotel and the entranceway and memorize its features if you go for a walk. To add to the confusion, there's another PARK hotel right across the street, and I walked into it by mistake after walking around.One last thing. Because of its location, you will at some point probably want to eat here. Although there was a mini-bar, it was stocked with drinks only. I found them very reasonably prices- less than $5.00 for a beer. However, room service is incredibly expensive. A BLT is $30.00 plus a 10% service fee. The appetizers I mentioned in the lounge before were reasonable though, and breakfast was around 2500 yen - I think $28.00 but that included a buffet.Can't recommend this hotel. I wanted to like it but will stay elsewhere on my next trip.","Toronto, Canada",220,2.0

I really don't have any gripes at all about the service (which was spot on and courteous...always...and I mean always....). The rooms were a tad smaller than I had expected and it was the first hotel I had ever stayed at that had oversized twin beds. The bathroom amenities were nicely presented and ran from shower cloths to emery boards. You have a choice of either international/continental breakfast or traditional Japanese, the latter of which I liked. For some reason, I always felt like something was missing from the international/continental but I can't put my finger on what. There was also live jazz music in the atrium in the evenings. The view was really pretty incredible, seeing as that the Tokyo Tower is practically right next door. All in all, it was a wonderful hotel and well-located, an elegant option for a stay in Tokyo.

Then about a year later I returned to the hotel and the man at the front desk remembered me! Maybe they don't have too many Americans that need a hospital in the middle of the night. Another time I stayed there there were a bunch of people from Expedia staying there, so if that's where Expedia stays when they go to Tokyo then you can have confidence that it's a top-notch hotel. The hotel is within walking distance of good restaurants and attached to a mall and a convenience store. It's also withing walking distance to the Pokemon Center. If you have small kids and you go to Tokyo for business you HAVE to go to the Pokemon Center. You'll get lots of toys that you can't find in the US and you'll be a hero. One thing is that the whole ambience of the hotel is very quiet. So if you are traveling with kids, this is not the place I would stay - at least not with my kids! Plus it's probably more expensive than I would pay on vacation. Oh yeah, if you want to take a bus to the airport they can arrange it at the front desk.","Boston, Massachusetts",37,5.0

Complementary tea and coffee in the room. Nice bathroom with all amenities. The service was excellent. We took the shuttle bus from the Narita Airport (which stops at major hotels across the city) and a member of the hotel staff was already waiting for us downstairs to help with the luggage. The view from the reception is amazing. On a clear day one can even see the Fuji mountain. The hotel has a very relaxing atmosphere. The lobby was very nice, live piano music in the evening, two restaurants: French and Japanese. Breakfast was a bit disappointing in the sense that we expected a greater variety for the price (35 USD pp). We would not recommend eating at the hotel, as it is rather expenssive. But then again, Tokyo is an expenssive city. The staff at the hotel restaurants were super nice, always willing to give advice on sites to visit and directions. The hotel is located between two metro stations (connection to the JR Yamanote line) which made exploring the city very easy. The metro stations are a mere 5 min walk from the hotel (access to one of the stations is actually in the Shiodome Media Tower where the hotel is located).

Park hotel was my choice based on the positive reviews here. I booked a corner suite with two beds. The room was decently sized. Apparently its bigger than the other ones but I've seen bigger corner rooms before. I wasnt stepping on my friend's toes but still it would be hard to call it a large room. The biggest sell for the room though is the view. What a view it is. The world famous ginza is at your toes and you really do feel the excitement of vibrant tokyo. The hotel itself starts at the 25th floor so i can imagine every room has a decent view. Our room was on the 33rd. Which was one away from the top floor. The view is just spectacular. One caveat however, is that the hotel is definately very high in the sky. If you are uncomfortable with high floor rooms or afraid of heights then I'd look elsewhere. I felt my ears popping everytime i went up to my room. Mixed with jetlag, I did find it hard to adjust. You have your jetlag and the high altitude which probably sent my body in all sorts of weird sensory overloads. Hard to fault the hotel for that, so I didnt do so in my review but something worth considering.I took a notch down on cleanliness because on my day of checkout i checked under the beds to make sure i hadnt left anything and it seemed really dusty. Also some of the carpet in the hallways had some spills. Aside from that it was fine. They give you ample toiletries and alot of extras that other hotels skimp on or you have to physically ask for (toothbrush/toothpaste/hairbrush/ floss). Another nice suprise was that the in-room bar is actually not gouging your eyes with rediculous pricetags. We were in a pinch and snagged two beers from the minifridge. At 300 yen, it was even better than going down to the convenience store. The beds were quality mattresses but they felt a little short in length. I know twin size beds arent that wide but it felt like maybe length wise they were a bit short also, I dont usually have my feet dangling off. Also the pillows coulda been a little firmer, or maybe have more of them available.Location wise, its great. You can walk to the Ginza and even take a cab over to the more popular stations like Tokyo station without breaking the bank. You can also walk over to the fish market. Nearby Roppongi is also within reach. I'd recommend this hotel, as it made my stay in Japan enjoyable.

That being said - there was truly nothing special about this hotel. It was OK at best. It just missed the mark in a lot of ways and a lot of little things could be changed that would make this hotel excellent. Hotel staff was friendly and did speak English which was awesome... but didn't do anything extra special. Food at the hotel was crazy overpriced. Internet in the room was free but spotty... had to sit in a certain position for it to work properly. Entire room (and bathroom) needs some sprucing up... getting quite dated. There wasn't a plug for the hair dryer near the vanity so I had to blow dry my hair at the mini bar while my husband was showering (because we can't open the door while showering because a note in the bathroom that says the steam will set off alarm). My biggest complaint is that the air conditioner never got cold. We couldn't really sleep well because our room was too hot.

Situated literally a stone's throw away from the private Shiodome station, we were surprised to find the entrance to the hotel only a few meters away from the station exit. The hotel was stunningly decorated, and when we arrived on the 25th floor where the hotel lobby was situated, the elevator doors opened and almost immediately there were staff waiting to take over our luggage and guide us to the front desk where the check-in was fast and efficient. The staff speak good English and were able to answer our questions and even happy to give us tourist information on how to get to certain places. The room was small-ish but when you compare it to other hotels in Tokyo, it was actually quite spacious and offered AMAZING views of Tokyo especially sitting on the bay window at night. The room was clean and had everything that you could even think of (they even provide hair brushes). My only con to this hotel is the price. The price of the accommodation is one thing (in Tokyo, accommodation is expensive pretty much most places you go) but the food and drinks in the downstairs restaurant/lounge area are overpriced so I highly suggest rather than eating/drinking in, you go out because you can find some much more reasonably priced food if you look around. Other than that, it really was the perfect stay for our leisurely trip. I would definitely recommend this for couples or people on business who don't mind splurging a bit to spoil themselves for a bit of luxury and comfort.","Adelaide, Australia",12,5.0

The first 24 floors of the building are taken up with private offices and media businesses, so the actual reception is on the 25th floor. You are greeted with a truly awe-inspiring view of Tokyo through floor-to-ceiling windows, including Tokyo Tower and (on a clear day) Mount Fuji. The staff are polite and efficient and happy to assist with all enquiries. My room was clean and spacious with lovely view of Tokyo Bay and the Hama Rikyu Gardens through the surrounding sky-scrapers. I ate in the hotel as I arrived so late, and both the food and the service was impeccable. My only complaint is that the hotel still allows smoking in it's public bar, which isn't very nice if you're trying to have a bar snack and enjoy the jazz - I do appreciate that the smoking ban hasn't hit Japan yet so it's not really a complaint, more a personal preference! Breakfast wasn't great - weird scambled eggs, American style bacon (ie.so thin you could read your paper through it), but coffee and juice was plentiful as was the fruit salad and toast.

The hotel is at the top of an impressive tower in Shiodome in a business complex close to the upmarket shopping area of Ginza. Our room was on the 34th floor (not for those with a fear of heights) and had amazing views over the city. It was compact but not cramped. There were mod cons such as TV, room safe, and ethernet cable for free internet. The bed was a little hard, but we got used to it pretty quickly and it didn't affect our sleep. The bathroom was also compact but very well appointed with lots of nice bath accessories.The hotel reception / bar / lounge are in a huge atrium on the 25th floor (i think). It's all very classy and a nice place to sit, although not cheap.All the staff were super friendly and helpful. For example they were more than happy to organize sending our luggage to Kyoto via Takkyubin. (A cheap and efficient luggage delivery service - a must if you are traveling around as it saves carting suitcases on the train.) Shiodome station is directly accessible from the hotel basement, or it is a 5 to 10 minute walk to Shimbashi station. It is also a short walk to the Yurikamome line which goes over Rainbow Bridge to the man made islands where you'll find the beach, Fuji TV building and so on.It's also a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel to Ginza, a large shopping district with lots of upmarket stores and plenty of restaurants.In the complex surrounding the hotel were various shops and coffee places, which we used as a cheaper alternative to the expensive hotel buffet breakfast.Overall this was a great upmarket hotel and we would stay here again.",London,60,5.0

The room was very large for Japanese standards and with all amenities we wanted and more. The hotel is directly on the subway station so the connection with anywhere in Tokyo is very easy. We selected this hotel for his proximity to the Tsukiji (the renowned fish market, the larger in the world) and we weren't disappointed.

We have not tried those highly recommended-Michelin restaurants in our hotel, we are more street-vendor kinda people when we travel, maybe we will give it a try next time. And do not listen to the hotel staff to order room services! Ginza area is just 5 mins away, and just walk in any restaurant that is opened! They are mostly reasonable priced, food is delicious, and they are mostly having English menu.One thing me and my partner found very frustrated was that you really have to ask a very precise question, for instance, from our hotel walk to Tsukiji Market takes no time, but the hotel staff told us ""go outside and look for a tall/grey building then walk along the pathway..""?? hello? look around, they are all tall and gray buildings; or for instance, they will tell you how to get to the temple via which station, but they will not tell you how to get to the temple from the station and there has no signs anywhere else around the station..Overall, we need something modern, convenient, and comfy with reasonable price ($200 per night), and Park managed to do that.

It's an excellent base - really well located for loads of sights, the subway system, and Tokyo station: you can reach the nearest station, Shiodome, from within the hotel building (and the hotel is helpfully signed from within the station), but the better-connected Shimbashi station is only a few minutes' walk away, and Tokyo station only two stops from there. There are loads of local eating opportunities, in the station area, in neighbouring buidings, or a 5-10 minute walk away in the Tsukiji fish market area - or you can go further field by train v easily, eg, Shinjuku. The hotel is a great introduction to Tokyo, being located in the upper floors of a very tall new building, in the modern Shiodome area - whilst the ground floor entrance to the building is fairly anodyne, taking the lift to the 25th floor brings you to the v helpful Reception, and another lift takes you from there to the rooms, which go right up to the top of the building, on the 34th floor. The rooms are a good size, modern and clean, and have decent bathrooms (with ginger-scented toiletries). The rooms all have large windows, with great views over Tokyo - on the city side you get a great view of the skyline, some nearby towers, and the station far below (with shinkansen whizzing past on a regular basis); on the other side, weather permitting, you get Mt Fuji on the horizon, and more great city views. Breakfast is served in the lounge, which is at the base of the atrium, and it's v comprehensive, with continental, cooked, and Japanese food on offer - which you can mix and match in entertaining ways, eg, hotdogs, fish, croissants, pancakes and syrup, broccoli, and pasta with pesto sauce and mushrooms.

The train station is located right next to the hotel so even though we were staying on the 27th floor, you can still hear the trains zooming by every now and then.

Upon arriving (by 'limousine' bus from the airport directly to the hotel - 6000 yen for two), we were a little surprised that there's no real entrance - the hotel is located on the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower, a sort of tall, officey-style building. Once you take the elevator up, the lobby itself is quite nice in a subtle, understated way. Soft lighting, a quiet calm atmosphere. Not grand, more functional. We got a fairly good rate by booking through agoda and having the room pre-paid might have been one of the reasons why check in was super simple and quick - about 2 minutes in total, with our bags whisked up quickly by a porter.Our room was actually quite tiny, though we were kind of expecting that in Tokyo, which is known for teeny weeny rooms. Despite the size of the room we didn't ask to change because other than that, it was perfectly fine. The general style and decor is fairly pleasing though not fabulous.We did have a fabulous view of the Tokyo Tower through a big plate glass window in our room, something which really did enjoy.The bathroom toiletries are by the Thai product line Thann - good quality and fairly generous. (They automatically included toothbrushes, a spare hair tie, shower mit, razor, etc. which not all mid-range hotels do) They are highly scented though, so you'd definitely need to be a fan of strong woody fragrances if you use them all at once! Quick list of some of the additional pros:- Shimbashi station is less than a 5 minute walk away across the elevated sky bridge walkways from the 3rd floor. - Ginza is only a 10-15 minute walk away. Great high-end shopping district, all the major international brands right there on Chuo Dori, lots of interesting restaurants in back streets to explore.- Truly lovely, accommodating staff. Getting flights reconfirmed (including seat requests), asking for directions and/or help, luggage storage, general needs, etc. were all met with ease and grace.- The restaurants in the nearby Shiodome City Center (a 2 minute walk) were actually quite good if you don't feel like venturing out further for dinner. We ate at a great little tonkatsu place on one of the lower floors there (great pork cutlet!) and had a nice dinner on one of the top floors at En (where they accidentally served me up stewed beef tongue instead of pork ribs, which was actually really gross).- The hotel was really peaceful, something which we appreciated after the hectic pace of Tokyo during the day. The rooms were also super quiet - we didn't hear other hotel guests at all once while we were in our room.- We found the hotel really clean and well maintained.- Free cable internet access in the rooms. We travel with our own laptop and this is always important to us.A few of the cons:- Unless you get breakfast included in your rate, it's really not worth paying for. The breakfast buffet is pricey and looked decidely lacklustre so we didn't bother trying it out - no fresh juices, a big tray of premade scrambled eggs, that sort of thing. That said though, the nearby cafe options for breakfast aren't fabulous either - after a couple of less than ideal starts we ended up just going to Starbucks and having coffee and a muffin. Not great but then, you don't really go to Toky for the great western-style breakfasts!- No complimentary drinking water is offered with your room at all, with expensive little Dean & Deluca bottles in the minibar fridge being the only option if you don't remember to buy your own water. Buying big bottles of water at the FamilyMart downstairs solved that problem pronto.- Apart from two expensive restaurants and an aromatherapy relaxation spa (which we didn't actually try), the hotel doesn't really have any guest amenities such as gym facilities, pool, sauna, etc. As one of the staff at the reception desk so cutely put it ""aaahh yes, this hotel very unfortunate for fitness guests"". - The room service spaghetti I ordered one night was pretty bad - oily and bland, with no salt & pepper included on the tray (something I only discovered the necessity for once the room service attendant had left and i was already eating, by which point I couldn't be bothered chasing it up). It was actually the only western-style meal I ate for the entire time we were in Japan, as I love the local cuisine, but I was super tired and the thought of a bowl of steaming spaghetti was very appealing at that point. Best to give it a miss.- Despite its proximity to Shimbashi station and Ginza itself, for those expecting to be right in the midst of all the Tokyo action, it may seem a little out of the way. And to be honest, heading out to dinner in other prefectures at night in the middle of winter did prove to be a bit of a mission in that regard.Despite the cons I've listed above, we actually did enjoy our stay there, and if you hunt around to get a really good rate (we paid less than $250 AUD) then it is very good value for what it is. Would we stay again? Probably not. I'd pick something closer to Shinjuku/Shibuya so we can get around on foot at night a little easier.",Sydney,9,3.0

The rooms are gorgeous, the lobby bar while kitschy, is lovely and Ithe live music is fun. The Japanese restaurant is delightful but very fine dining Kaiseki Ryori style so thos who prefer simpler fare would be better off trying Tsunahachi ""SUI"" in the basement of the neighbouring Caretta complex. There are also geat sushi places and a range of other reasonably piced Japanese restaurants there. The French restaurant is famous and hard to get in so book in advance.I found the staff incredibly helpful and I would recommend that you visit the Tsukuji fish markets if you've never been - go when you are hungry as they will give you free samples! Also, the Ginza is nearby - get the subway as it will also take you to Harajuku (Omotesando for teh 5th Avenue ambience, Meiji-Jingumae if you'd like to see the shrine - be prepared for a 5km walk once at the shrine) I lived in Japan on separate occasions in the 1990s so I know Tokyo well.

Upon arrival at the hotel, which is part of a media complex, we were not met at the ground level by any hotel staff. Instead we lugged our own cases to the lobby residing on the 25th floor. Staff were civil and pre-paying the hotel (by bank transfer?!) seemed to make the checking-in process easier. The standard rooms are a disappointment, and are beginning to look shabby (marks on the wall, stained carpets). The beds are relatively comfortable, with extra pillows at a premium. Bathrooms are tiny, but clean. While the hotel itself is well located, trekking to and fro from room to street level takes a good 15 minutes if you include waiting for lifts, etc. There are a number of restaurants and a very expensive bar at lobby level, the quality is good, but you are better exploring the plethora of fantastic restaurants elsewhere in Tokyo. If you are particularly unlucky, you will experience the jazz entertainment during the evening: if you've ever seen the jazz flute scene in the movie Anchorman, you should get an idea of what to expect. This is a hotel frequented by a fair mix of Japanese and Western tourists, with plenty of Australian and US families, and the occasional C-list UK actor, staying for a few nights before heading elsewhere. I suspect that using the hotel as a base is a good idea, especially as the room price is quite competitive compared with other hotels. However, compared with some of the less-well marketed hotels (see review of Daiwa Roynet in Nagoya as a comparison) that do not often cater for non-Japanese clients, the Park Hotel seems over-rated for ""boutique on a budget"".","Melbourne, Australia",18,3.0

You can get a two minute cab ride between the hotel and the main street in Ginza - about 800 yen per trip. The hotel doesnt have much charm but the staff are helpful (eg organising bus, handling and storing luggage) and the 25th floor reception/lounge area is quite nice (a business oriented atmosphere). The immediate area surrounding the hotel is quiet and a bit desolate. To grab a coffee and snack without going too far, head underground (take the hotel lift from your floor straight down to level B2) where a number of cafes cater to the subway-using private sector employees who work in the area.","Sydney, Australia",47,3.0

There were two beds, not next to each other but in different corners of the room at different angles. They had a large lounge/divan and a large bathroom too.Our room was three doors away and although about half the area, it was not cramped. There were twin beds in the usual layout.We had the buffet breakfast in the lobby. Some seats are around coffee tables, and a little low for comfort, but there are other full size tables in the side rooms- which we were shown to. I thought the breakfast was good value- though it had more western items than Japanese. Coffee, pastries and croissants were magnifique!Unfortunately, the hotel's French restaruant, which has been highly recommended on Tripadvisor, was booked out, so recommend calling or emailing ahead to make a reservation.",Sydney,122,5.0

Our room featured a magnificent view of the Tokyo Tower.The staff were incredibly efficient in delivering our luggage which was missing in transit for two days, thanks to Qantas! They went out of their way to deliver it as soon as humanly possible, which was great considering we were there in the midst of the typhoon without coats or umbrellas. The staff were helpful with all other enquiries too, and when we checked in, our tickets for our JTB free plan Kyoto tour were waiting on the desk in the hotel room- Great service!The location was a little bit out of the way, but only a quick walk to Ginza and surrounded by trains and subways to take you anywhere you need to go. The transport system in Japan is a well oiled machine, so efficient... We easily negotiated our way by train to the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, during peak hour, on our first day.

We got a Japan Rail pass (great value if you are planning on taking a bullet train out of Tokyo) which included access on the Narita Express. It took roughly one hour to get to Shimbashi station and then a 5 minute walk through the frenetic station to the hotel. * I am confused by a recent review that says the hotel is poorly located - it is within walking distance of Ginza, Imperial Palace, the Fish Market, and is on Japan Rail's Yamanote (""Circle"") line and two subway lines. All of the ""big"" tourist attractions are quite easily accessible.* There are TONS of restaurants within the Shimbashi/Shiodome station area, less than 5 minute walk away. The station is like a mini-city, with hotels, coffeshops, restaurants, convenience stores, and limited shops. You can also walk to Ginza (~10 min) which is an upscale shopping and dining district. Even though we are experienced travelers, it is a bit intimidating finding restaurants in Tokyo due to the crowds and limited English...perhaps that is why some reviewers weren't happy with the restaurant selection.* Rooms were quite nice, certainly not big by Western standards but bigger than I thought they would be. Bathroom and toiletries were quite nice. View was gorgeous (and we had the ""bad"" side!). TV was a bit disappointing because there were no English channels but I didn't come to Tokyo to watch CNN.* Didn't go to restaurants within hotel, also didn't try the breakfast buffet. Everything looked nice but expensive. We would walk to Vie de France (also in Shimbashi station) for morning pastries and saved a bunch of money. It was fun seeing the Japanese version of a french bakery! Numerous coffeshops also available.* We didn't bring a laptop but there is free internet. We enjoyed the free access in the business center - 3 terminals with a gorgeous view of Tokyo.* We got a good deal on hotels.com, <$200/night. I thought that was a solid value for a nice room in the heart of Tokyo.",Minneapolis,41,5.0

The hotel is located in the media district of Shiodome, an easy 8-10 minute walk from Shinbashi Station and right above Shiodome station (with access to the monorail). Besides being close to Shinbashi station, I found the location of this hotel to be one of their weaknesses. Although centrally located in Tokyo, there are very few restaurants close by and the area is pretty much deserted. However, I feel their is potential for this area to grow in the future. But if you are looking for a hotel close to all the action, keep looking!The Park Hotel itself is pretty stunning, The lobby is on the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower with panoramic views of Tokyo. We were given 2 rooms (a corner twin and city queen) on the 30th floor facing Tokyo Tower. The views were spectacular as you can see from my pictures. Seeing the sun set over Mt. Fuji with Tokyo Tower was a highlight. It is definitely worth paying an additional $25 for rooms facing the Tower. The room was a decent size. The beds were also really comfortable. The bathroom was a little smaller then the previous hotels we had stayed at on our trip, but their was plenty of amenities. Buffet breakfast was served in the atrium/lobby area. There was a large selection of food and it was all really tasty. However, it was slightly awkward to sit down at the tables in the lobby because they really weren't meant to be eaten on.One of the main problems we encountered at this hotel was the service and attitude of the staff. They were extremely unhelpful and never smiled. We were also surprised that the concierge didn't speak much English. This is surprising considering this hotel seemed to cater to a more western demographic. When asking the concierge to find a good restaurant close by, it turned into a major struggle because she only had names of restaurants in the hotel complex. She was also very unknowledgeable about Tokyo. Since we were staying over new years, we wanted to know which major sites would be open . Two concierges told us Harajuku and all the major attractions were closed and our only option was visiting odaiba. This was ridiculous!! We ended up ignoring their advice and had a blast going to Harajuku and Meiji Shrine. How can a hotel of this caliber have such an untrained concierge? Throughout our visit, the staff had a cold attitude and were unhelpful, which made it uncomfortable to be in such a beautiful hotel.Overall, I would still recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit Tokyo because the views were so spectacular. I can only hope you will have a better experience with the service.",Boston,26,4.0

Tokyo is huge and there is a lot to see and neighborhoods are spaced out. The hotel is within walking distance to the Fish Market and Ginza. Everything else is easily reached by Tokyo's fast/efficient Metro. The hotel is under Shiodome Station and a short walk to Shimbashi Station. We got to the hotel by local train (Yokosuka line), which is half the price of the Narita Express train and only take 20 minutes longer from what we're told. Expect a 90 minute journey in total. The train from Narita stops at Shimbashi station, then a carefully guided maze-like journey through the underground to get to the hotel. The station, like most, is very busy and be careful not to get trampled in rush hour. (Also a good experience).ROOM: We were very disappointed with the room. Very small room. We understood that every tour book says that rooms in Tokyo are small. What we didn't understand is the gigantic lobby with the very high multistory atrium. Sure, the open public space is nice, but not a good trade off of for a tiny room. The TV was a small table top LCD with poor picture quality, not expected for what we understand Tokyo to be the electronics capital of the world. There were no TV stations in any other language except Japanese. Even CNN was translated into Japanese. The toilet was more high-tech than the TV. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect every hotel and restaurant to cater to English/Western desires, but this hotel is being benchmarked to other hotels we stayed in Europe, not to mention Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Singapore during this trip. All of which offered larger rooms, better amenities, and TV channels in Spanish, Chinese, French, German, Arabic, English. The room did not have an iron either. The bed and pillows were very uncomfortable. Overall, at the price paid, the room was very sub-par. The price paid, relative to New York, Paris, Sydney, is not correlated to the comfort/amenities.STAFF: The hotel staff is polite and helpful.HOTEL: Common areas are very clean. The lobby is on the 25th floor, then your room goes up from there. The lobby area has a smart contemporary design. The hallway's leading to the rooms need some updating. The hallways together with the rooms almost seems to be of a budget hotel. That's were our disappointment sets in. (Nice book cover, bad book.) Free internet is offered on three computers in the business center right next to the front desk. The views of the city are nice, depending on the room location. If you don't get the Tokyo Tower view, you can always take a look from the front desk. DINING: Didn't eat at the hotel. We had breakfast at Vie de France, which is located in the nearby complex called the City Center. Vie de France offers baked goods and coffee. All this at a fraction of the cost to the hotel. Tokyo is expensive, so look for anything that can save you cash.CITY: Tokyo is huge, so plan wisely. Set you sites in order of priority. We had 3 days in total and didn't accomplish everything we set out to see. To us, Tokyo didn't offer as many eye-popping attractions as many other cities. But Tokyo/Japan is a different culture, differing from even it's Asian neighbors. Spend time to learn how things work. You may also appreciate the peoples way of life, even though it may seem different. English is not widely spoken. So a few words in Japanese should help.NOTE: All our reviews are not evaluated on the exclusively mutual experience at the respective hotel.

I love it more now than ever. I've stayed in several rooms, including their smallest, the single with a double bed. Believe me, their smallest is far nicer and bigger than many of the more expensive hotels. The issue is that most 4 and 5 star hotels in Tokyo have several types of room - standard, deluxe, club, etc. So if you get stuck in a single standard, it's like a tiny outdated prison. Not at the Park Hotel Tokyo, where they don't have different classes of rooms -- all of them are both sleek and cozy at the same time. The toiletries are my favorite of any hotel I've stayed in. The TV is great, internet is by lan (cable provided) and free and fast.Some people say the location isn't the best or there aren't many shops around. Actually there are TONS of shops around. You just have to know where to look. Within a 5 minute walk, there's 2 Starbucks, 2 Subways, a McDonalds, a Godiva, a Vie de France, and in terms of Japanese foods, TONS of options. Just ask the concierge and they can definitely help you. I would recommend that people use the limo bus to the hotel from Narita because it stops right at the hotel, and if you use the subway, you have to find the hotel through the underground labyrinth, which isn't easy the first time you do it, especially with luggage. On the way back, you'll have figured it out well enough to walk to the Shinbashi JR station if you'd like so you can go to Tokyo station and catch the train to Narita. I really love the location because it is very sleek and chic and has a great vibe. There's always performances or art or something that is new and interesting. Ginza is within walking distance (get the concierge to show you on the map). The Shiodome station is right below the building (B2) and it can take you anywhere you want to go. The location is one of the best things about this hotel.In terms of downsides, first, the smoking in the lobby is disgusting. I always brace myself when I come back from meetings or shopping or whatever, because I know I have to hold my breath between the lobby and the elevators. They really need to do something about this. However, I have never smelled smoke in my room (or I never would have been back). The other issue is the service. It's normally great. One reason I stay here is their English is so good and they always help me extensively in getting places. Often times my Japanese contact just gives me an address to meet them at, and it would be very difficult to find without Japanese help. So the concierge has always come through for me, normally with maps, subway timetables, and everything. However, there are a few people on staff who act as though you have leprosy - they don't smile, they act almost annoyed that you are there, I can almost here them thinking ""gaijin"" in their head. Maybe it's just me, I don't know. But there's definitely an unfriendly vibe from just 1-2 people there. I think they need to seriously fix this because it has no place in a top hotel.Finally, the breakfast buffet. This is the first time I tried it, and it was fantastic. Lots of food, good offerings, and they made me decaf coffee every morning for free (I can't have caffeine). It was 2000 yen, but it filled me up until 2-3 pm, so I was glad to pay that. Again, not so great if someone happened to light up a cancer stick nearby, but thankfully it only happened once.I predict that I will continue staying at Park Hotel Tokyo for a very long time -- mainly because of their affordable, sleek rooms with great English-speaking staff in a fantastic, exciting location.","Estes Park, Colorado",244,5.0

It was our first visit to Tokyo so we did not have a clue where to stay but we took this hotel on a friends recommendation. Firstly Location; There really is no such thing as central Tokyo, I can only describe it as lots of cities within a city. So no matter if you chose Ginza or Harajuku, you still have to travel around by train or metro. The hotel is on an area called Shiodome which is a very new district right next to Ginza (apparently it used to be rail yards). The hotel is housed in the Shiodome Media Tower which is connected to Shinbashi station by a number of elevated walkways (aprox 5-10 mins walk). The fact the hotel is at the top of a skyscraper means one thing - views!! The views are amazing, spanning across the whole city. We were lucky enough to have a corner suite with views over to Tokyo Tower and Mt Fuji. The rooms have floor to ceiling windows and you just get mesmerized by the view. The rooms are nice but nothing special, comfy beds, standard bathroom and average in size. The Tv has international channels including BBC and internet is free though not Wifi. So why 4 stars?? The big let down is the breakfast. The buffet offers very little choice and what they do offer is not that great. Hot drinks include one type of coffee and one type of tea. When I asked for green tea I had to pay aprox £4 more!! Also we had to present a coupon every morning which I have never has to do in any hotel I have stayed in, so we usually forgot to take it down an then had to go back to up to get it!

We loved the super modern Shiodome area with skyscrapers, numerous restaurants, shops and dramatic architecture. We ate each day Vie De France for breakfast - take the lift from the hotel to the basement complex. From the hotel it's very easy to get all around the city with the Shiodome Subway connecting directly to Roppongi and Shinjuku and the Shimbashi Station going to Tokyo Station on the JR Line. Public areas are beautiful at the hotel - a real highlight. The atrium reaches from the 25th to 35th floor - flooded with light and stylishly furnished. We loved the giant projector screen in the evening. Bedrooms are small but exceptionally comfortable and homely. The lighting is really adjustable and i had some of the best nights sleep I've ever had in a hotel on the very comfortable bed. The toiletries are really lovely and the mist free mirror in the bathroom is always appreciated. Excellent water pressure from my room on the 29th floor. We didn't pay for Tokyo Tower view rooms and still very much enjoyed looking out over Shiodome. Staff at check in weren't super friendly, but polite and efficient. Other staff we spoke with were warmer and more engaging. A brilliant hotel - relaxing, stylish, comfortable and well located.","Coventry, United Kingdom",167,5.0

The hotel had the worst service I've ever encountered. First, the concierge's hours were very short so good luck getting advice. When we were able to find the concierge, she told us to go to Roppongi Hills for dinner. Roppongi Hills has HUNDREDS of restaurants, which we discovered when we got there. Not helpful. Second, the concierge was surly and rude.The hotel lobby allows smokers. The lobby is on the 25th floor so there is no ventilation. It's unbearable.The rooms really are tiny. Think college dorm room.Not sure what we were paying for besides a cramped place to sleep and a shower (that was clogged).On the plus side, the hotel is conveniently located near two good subway lines (Ginza and Oedo).",San Francisco,4,2.0

The bathroom was the best we had in Japan- very large and well equipped. The buffet breakfast was a let down- very pricey so we went to the arts cafe on the ground floor for a little continental- very pleasant!

The staff are friendly and speak very good English. As Tokyo can be hard to navigate the hotel provides maps and advice on how to get to where you want to go.

This hotel is not particularly luxurious in my opinion, but it has many conveniences. I consider this hotel as a very nice mid-range hotel, not something to compete with luxury 5-star places. The hotel lobby is on the 25th floor with a good view of the Tokyo Tower behind it. The center of the hotel is an empty atrium, so all rooms are outward facing with panoramic views. Dramatic views of the lobby from your room floor, which start at the 30th floor. The rooms themselves are reasonably sized, not particularly large nor small for a mid-range hotel. We had a corner twin room which is slightly larger then the regular rooms. They are a little non-descript though in decoration.The beds were comfortable. Bathrobes, Yukatas, (small) slippers are in the room. Free internet through ethernet (ask for a cable if you didn't bring one).  The bathroom had a counter of a molded man-made material instead of granite counters. The de-rigeur Toto heated/spritzing toilet is there. There are toiletries aplenty - good quality but not luxury brand. A very complete set - including razors&shavingcream, hair-brushes, q-tips, nail files, toothbrushes, show caps, aromatheraphy shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. A nice touch is the heated mirror which doesn't fog up. Water pressure is good. The entire place is LITERALLY spotless.Shiodome is a high-rise business district without nightlife, but its a good transportation hub:1) 10-15 minute easy walk to Ginza. 2) mass transit at your door-stepa) Shiodome metro station - 15 seconds from 3rd floor pedestrian deckb) Shimbashi metro station - 5 minutes from 3rd floor or 2nd basement floorc) Shimbash JR train station - 6 minutes away (connected to metro station)d) Yurikamome monorail to Odaiba island - 15 seconds The only downside to the hotel is that you can still hear the JR train go by. It didn't really bother us. The restaurants within the hotel are over-priced, but cheaper/better alternatives are just minutes away:1) Walk through the Shiodome metro station and you're in the Tokyo Shiodome Tower and the Pedi-dome food floor with 8 casual restaurants. 2) Walk on the 3rd floor deck to the Caretta Shiodome Tower (4 minute walk), and there's a food floor in the 2nd basement and high-end restaurants on Floors 46 & 47. For breakfast places:1) Excelsior Cafe (Starbucks competitor) in Pedi-dome2) Vie en France (bakery) below adjacent Shoidome City tower outside the metro station3) McDonalds a few hundred feet away from 2) There's a famous garden 2 blocks away, but we didn't have time to see it.","San Jose, California",85,4.0

No one from the hotel was there to meet us; we phoned the hotel with the help of the transportation desk at Narita, to ask about it, & they had no clue how to resolve our problem. We were left to make our own connections to the hotel and pay for them, again. Later, when I asked to have the limo charge removed from our bill, they were totally confused and again, had no answers.

I have put up my photos on my website, Shuweb, so if you want to see photos, and more importantly, links to key information about Tokyo and Kyoto destinations, please check out my site. You will also find that I’ve done similar travelogues for other destinations.The Park Hotel Tokyo is an absolute gem – it is the perfect hotel for the business person or a couple looking for a relaxing, quiet time in a high end setting. That said, we took our 2 year old with us, and she enjoyed the stay too (just don’t let her run around and shout in the main lobby, because the voice will echo due to the high ceiling).LocationThe hotel is located on the 25th floor of the Tokyo Media Tower, and occupy the top 10 floors. Because of this, the hotel has a staff who will greet you on the ground floor and take your luggage upon arrival. Alternatively, you can take the elevator up to the lobby on your own. Either way, it’s quite high up there and the elevator ride up is sort of interesting. And as for location, it is about a 7 minute cab ride from the Tokyo train station. Just tell the driver that you want to go to the Park Hotel on the Tokyo Media Tower, and they’ll take care of the rest. Our room faced downtown, so at night we saw the glowing lights of busy Tokyo. It was rather nice. We had a second room (for our parents) which faced the waters – you can see the Hama Rikyu Garden and the Tsukiji Fish Market out in the distance (about a 10 minute walk; more on this later).The hotel is interconnected with the surrounding hotels, which makes it really convenient (called the Shiodome City Center). If you exit the hotel from the third floor, you will find that there are bridges that link the buildings. There are several restaurants in the adjacent buildings, including some high end restaurants (we went to EN, which is located on the 42nd floor. Excellent food and service!) and some regular restaurants (noodles, curry, etc.) that business people go to during lunch and dinner. You will also see that there is a direct connection to the Shiodome train station (non-JR) just steps from the hotel. If you go to the underground floor, you will find a whole new world down there. From here, you can connect to the other Shiodome buildings, but in addition, you will find book stores, cafes, CD store, convenience stores, etc. You will also see that there is an entrance to the subway, in case you want to go to Harajuku or the Meiji Jingu Shrine (maybe a half hour ride on the Oedo line).If you walk even further along the underground passageway (maybe 15-20 minute walk? Not sure anymore), you will find the JR station. Here, you will find the familiar Wing Department store, which is basically a sea of smaller shops and restaurants that sell absolutely everything. If you resurface to the ground floor from the JR station, you will find yourself minutes away from downtown Ginza. Ginza is the Rodeo Drive of Tokyo. Find the main street of Ginza. There, you will find a row of skyscrapers with major brands… and no car on the main road.Lastly, if you want to check out the Tsukiji Fish Market, get up at 5:30am and start walking toward the waters. It’s a 10 minute walk, but just note that the Fish Market doesn’t have a giant sign that welcomes tourists (I think the fishermen actually hate tourists). Eat breakfast at one of the small sushi restaurants located in the Fish Market (from the hotel, go past the big grey Fish Market building, turn right at the gas station, and turn right again after you see a small temple display. Walk down a couple of minutes and you will see a swarm of tourists. You are at the restaurants). As for the Hama Rikyu Garden itself, don’t bother. So in summary, location was good.Room We had a triple on the 27th floor, which meant that there were 2 beds plus a third bed, which was a convertible sofa. These beds had comfortable, fluffy down feather blankets. The carpeting was nice, the bathroom was just fine, the TV had several channels (yes, people, this is Japan, so you primarily get Japanese channels!), and slippers that they have in the room were nice. This is a non-smoking floor, and I didn’t smell a bit of smoke. I really can’t complain about anything.ServiceThe service was excellent. Their staff speak English, and in a country in which good service is the norm, they were terrific. And they carry it out in such calm and tranquility that you would not see in larger hotels. Breakfast buffet is served on the main floor (25th floor), and again, it was rather quiet. Because we were a party of 5 including a 2 year old, they pretty much gave us our own dining room. That was nice.I’ve read here on Tripadvisor that their service is snooty. Could it be that it’s a cultural misunderstanding among the tourists? I speak both English and Japanese, and I didn’t find them snooty (and neither did my wife’s parents, who are not Japanese and don’t speak a word of it)… in fact, the opposite. My impression is that their professionalism can come across as snooty for the non-Japanese who don’t understand Japanese “office culture.”Lastly, we arranged a bus to pick us up to go to the airport (about a little over an hour ride). The cost is around $30 per person, which is about what you’d expect to pay for the service. Just make sure that you reserve the bus ride at least a day in advance.","Cupertino, California",149,5.0

We initially booked via the hotel’s online reservation system, but I ended up emailing to see if it was possible to get the 4nt+ discount on a 6nt split stay. It was and they offered us a good rate on a queen room plus discount breakfast tickets.Our taxi driver used the printed out map I had to locate the hotel, so I agree with others – it’s best to take an address/map – preferably in Japanese – as not all drivers we used knew it. As per other reviews, our welcome was warm and impressive. We’d requested an early check in and were relieved they could do it, albeit very discreetly as the guests in front of us had to wait until the standard 2pm time for their room.We were really impressed with our room on our first stay. Good size, lovely amenities and amazing view. Couldn’t see Fuji cos of clouds, but Tokyo Tower was fun to watch by different lights.Although Shiodome is away from the main tourist sights and in a business district, it does have its advantages. The skyscrapers themselves are a sight to behold and it’s brilliant watching all the comings and goings of the trains and people. Also, all the main attractions are really easy to get to from Shimbashi station, which has excellent connections to metro and the JR Yamanote Line. Also only 2 stops away from Tokyo station which makes onward travel much easier.The map and directions we got from the hotel weren’t brilliant and we did get lost finding Shimbashi on day one and finding Tsukiji fish market on day 3. But once you work it out, it is really easy to get around. We ate in the hotel for breakfast and a couple of evening meals. The Japanese breakfast was amazing – exquisitely presented and filling. Think we were the only westerners in there most times. Western breakfast, however, is very average. We had the ‘casual kaiseki’ meal a couple of times, which was a delight for the eyes as well as a feast for the taste buds. Excellent if you fancy a treat without going out after a long day of sightseeing or travelling. From our experience, the staff were discreet, rather than overtly friendly. And I was rather disappointed by our second stay. People say they were given bigger greetings on their return trips, we didn’t. In fact, our room wasn’t ready by 2pm and we didn’t get the queen room we had agreed, but a very small single for double occupancy. I wanted to complain and change, but my hubbie was ill and just wanted to sleep and have no fuss. Airport transfer was easy peasy – we used their Airport Limousine Bus, arranged very easily through concierge. We thought we’d have several pick ups but it went directly from Park Hotel to the airport and took less than an hour.One more thing, would also recommend the ‘Zen’ restaurant in the basement of the media tower. Very lively with excellent service and food to match – we loved the tempura set meals.",Stratford upon Avon,82,4.0

The views were amazing, and having stayed in a room on the other side of the hotel, I would say the tower view rooms are slightly nicer with a bit more space and slightly nicer decor. Definitely worth paying a little extra for.The hotel's location is excellent. Ginza is just a few minutes walk away and just across the road is the Sio-Site area with about 20 or 30 restaurants to choose from if you don't want to go too far.

The reception backs onto spectacular city views to Tokyo Tower.The breakfasts are fantastic, get it included in your room rate and there is free internet access. Ask for a room with views over the water.The hotel is part of a group called ""Design Hotels"" and I had expected something interesting in the hotel's design. The atrium is bland and the rooms are small and very average in design. I had a queen size room which was small particularly the bathroom. The furniture is IKEA inspired with very few extras you would expect from a five star ""design hotel"". The flat screen TV is small and the channel selection is pathetic in a country with 100s of cable stations. There were basically only 3 English channels, no free movie channels and even just a small selection of Japanese stations. I know you are not coming to Tokyo to watch TV but when the weather is bad it would be nice to be able to watch some TV. There was no ipod outlet which is expected in new modern hotels.Now don't get me wrong, it is a nice hotel to stay at when in Tokyo but the ""packaging"" in regards to design and room amenities is disappointing.","Sydney, Australia",242,4.0

Also the service in the lounge restaurant is very slow. If you fancy a snack or a drink, just go down to the basement and head towards the metro, you will find what you want for at least a 3rd of the price.2) do not expect to find a non smoking room, even if it's on a non smoking floor. we specifically requested a non smoking room but on the 2 occasions we stayed here we were given rooms that had obviously been smoked in recently - one on a non smoking floor. Even when we asked to be moved to a non smoking room we were still given one that smelled of smoke.

Both hotels are at opposite ends of the hotel spectrum. The Park Hotel is situated about 5 minutes stroll from Ginza and the Ginza Metro line. The hotel was large airy and beautiful, although we spent most of our time out until the early hours and then in our rooms kipping; the ambiance was one of peace and quiet especially in such a large business, tourist hotel and area. The staff where always super helpful and the barmen mixed mean cocktails and gin and tonics (jet lag sleep cure). The rooms where typically Japanese and not overly spacious but everything we needed/wanted was there. The bed was super comfy and the bathroom modern and very clean. As a whole this hotel was great and a brilliant base to explore and indulge in shopping, sight seeing and eating out. The price was very good, although we didn't eat breakfast or dinner which might bump up the price, we preferred to explore and find our own little places to eat. The bar was chilled and relaxed and as I said the barmen where chatting, curious and very handy with a bottle. I would recommend this hotel to everyone because it caters to everyone. Finding your way back in the evening was quiet random because of the subways, stairs and various routes but we got there in the end. The Hotel is similar in style to the Mitsui Garden Hotel which is just around the corner, but the Park Hotel Tokyo is cheaper and more spacious. This is my second time in Tokyo and I'm in love with the city and the people. I hope to return every year until I can move over there.

After 10 days of vacation with my husband, I was totally fine with my own bed :) and you know, you can always join your spouse if the mood strikes you...

Their deservingly proud of their hotel's mention in numerous books and magazine's(evident by the staff placing them in the desk drawers), as well as their being voted one of the top fifty design hotels. They also hype their Michelin Star winning restaurant which looked fabolous but I had more interest in food elsewhere. There is a sense of casual luxury everywhere here. The hotel is located in the Shiodome Media Tower away from the crowds that swarm in certain parts of Tokyo. Felt secluded yet well connected to the rest of the city via the subway, Ginza Line at Shimbashi station and the closer Oedo Line at Shiodome underneath the building. Ginza is within walking distance for those who like to walk. 24 hr convenience store(Family Mart) is located in the subway corridors as well as Seven Eleven(open till midnight) which is the closest ATM that excepts American cards. Hotel signage on building is limited and a few taxi drivers had trouble finding it. No hotel employees are stationed downstairs and the lobby is on the 25th floor with the Tokyo Tower framed by the windows behind the checkin counter. Guest floors start on 26 and therefore all have great views of the city. Rooms are of ample size for japan, and come with pajamas, mini bar, safes, and flashlights in case of emergency. Well appointed, though a little small, bathrooms have premium toiltries and the infamous high tech, heated seat, push button bidet, toilets. Beds are not typical stiff boards I found in other Japanese hotels, they were soft and comfortable. TV's are flat screen and have a decent array of channels. The lobby is in a beautiful atrium. Smoking is allowed in the lobby so those sensitive to smoke may be a little put off(didn't bother me). Premium service provided by staff, from the concierge to the maids to the bartenders, everyone is supremely friendly and you get a feeling their not just doing it because it's thier job. I wasn't staying in a suite or spending mega amounts of money and yet I was called by name by several different staff members during my stay. In particular Wada(bar staff) and I hope I get this right, Mr. Kenji Ishida(bar mgr) were very helpful during our stay. They gave us personalized service and recommended a more local side of Tokyo where tourist don't venture as much. For mixed drinks they take blocks of ice and chip away till it makes what's called dragon ballz(solid balls of ice), very cool.

The staff are so discreet yet faultlessly obliging and the lobby of the hotel is breathtaking.

Accomodations are snug - as is de rigeur in Tokyo but the beds are so comfortable, there is a fridge, minibar, LCD TV and radio. Bathrooms are plush and are with fitted with heated toilet seats! View from room is giddying and I love the silence in the corridors with the soundproofed glass and the ten story atrium. You can have breakfast in the lobby but we preferred to buy provisions in the ground floor shop and stow them away in our fridge! There is a restaurant (didn't try it but understand it has a Michelin star) and a wonderful wine bar called TY. Prices are steep in TY but worth it for the dark ambience and stunning views (think Scarlett Johannsen and Bill Murray in Lost in Translation, except that their hotel - the Hyatt - is about a grand per night!). The Shiodome station is just downstairs and is on the best metro line...Roppongi is 4 stops away, Shin-juku 7 stops). You can also walk underground to Shimbashi station which will bring you to Ginza. Walking to Ginza also enjoyable...just ten mins away. Make sure to take the monorail to Odaibe island, it weaves in between the skyscrapers of Shiodome.

On this trip I stupidly left my mobile phone in the hotel room. Staff were happy to post it back to the UK.The rooms are small by international standards, but a reasonable size for Japan, and were spotless, well equipped, and with stupendous views (larger rooms look out over Mt Fuji on a clear day: if you are staying in a standard room ask for a room on the harbour side as these are slightly quieter and have an even better view).We have eaten in both restaurants. Neither is cheap, but both are good: Tateru Yoshino has a Michelin star, which it deserves, especially for its desserts. Alternatively you can eat well and cheaply in the numerous food courts dotted around the Shiodome commercial area, or walk to the fish market (ten minutes) for the world's best sushi. The hotel is in a large area of walkways and tower blocks, two stops from central Tokyo. Very commercial, and busy (with people, not traffic) both day and night. There are four stations within five minutes walk. Our only slight criticism of the hotel is that its entrance doesn't exactly flaunt itself. We recommend arriving by taxi the first time. The entrance is seriously hard to find from the subway, even using the map provided on the hotel's website, and this is not something to do laden with luggage after a long flight and trip from Narita (as we did).",London,24,5.0

My wife and I spent a whole week at the Park Hotel and we loved it. Whereas on my first time in Tokyo I managed to cope with the jet lag (probably because I had to work properly) this time it took me a week to adjust. So we spent nights staring in awe at the views from our window, and used jet leg to our advantage to visit the Tsukiji fish market, which is a block away. It is best visited very early in the morning, and we had sushi for breakfast for the first time in our lives. The room size is decent, price is very decent for a hotel of this quality (there is no way you can get a room like this for this price in London or Rome, for example), but the extras are pricey. I only had breakfast once at the hotel, as breakfast for two cost a fourth of the room rate, which I found disproportionate. There was no wi-fi either, which I found strange, as Jpan is supposed to be so hi-tech. I couldn't resist the wine bar at the hotel, though, which was a great option for a sleepless night. If you're after nightlife and bars, this might not be the best place for you, as this is a business area. But is totally possible to manage the subway from here to the more agitated areas like Roppongi. This is also easy to reach by train from Narita.The staff was really friendly (well, I never met a rude person in Japan), and even helped me getting tickets for a show.

Fine view of serene Mount Fuji, right next to the hideous Tokyo Tower on the skyline. Room and service impeccable. My room did not have Wifi, but the hard connection was free and very fast.

We didn’t have any luck finding a cheap but well- reviewed 3 star in Tokyo, which is what we would usually go for, but the Park Hotel seemed relatively cheap. We stayed for six nights and had no complaints.The location is very good: it is away from the main tourist districts, which I usually prefer, but it is right by a metro stop so access is no problem. Crucially, it is also walking distance from the tuna market, so the very early start to get to the tuna auction and have sushi for breakfast when the stalls open is painless. For that reason alone, I would stay there again. The area, the Ginza, is also well served for high-end restaurants.The hotel has a beautiful main atrium. I wasn’t as impressed by the view as others: mainly because I don’t regard Tokyo as an attractive city, but the main atrium is a very pleasant place to have a drink and sit around; sometimes they have jazz musicians.The rooms are compact, but everything works as it should and there is a very tempting mini bar. The hotel had free in-room internet access (not Wi-fi). We did not eat in the hotel (even for breakfast) so cannot comment on the food except to say that it did not appear to be a cheap option. We had sushi for breakfast at the tuna market three times. My favourite was Sushi Bun, the first one we tried (recommended in Time Out Tokyo), and which did not have queues as long as you get at Daiwa Sushi or Sushi Dai (which, having eaten at the former, do not reflect an actual difference in quality between them and Sushi Bun).There is also a decent coffee and donut place just down the elevator from the entrance to the Softbank building (go right out of the Park hotel building’s front entrance and then up an escalator). The 7-11 in the basement of the hotel building is also useful for snacks and there are various places to eat in the Shiodome complex.There is no pool or gym.Away from the hotel, I particularly recommend eating at Kanda Yabu Soba in Maranouchi and in local sushi bars.",London,26,4.0

The rates were reasonable considering it was A) Tokyo, B) Practically in Ginza, and C) New Years. I think our 3 night stay was around $770 USD, which is also the result of the plunging dollar against the Yen. Lobby was modern and finely furnished with complimentary jazz performances during 2 nights of our stay. The show was jazz with a Japanese take. Entertaining nearly made the $15 dollar cocktails worth while. Great view of the Tokyo skyline and you could even see Mt Fuji in the distance. Rooms were not large but clean and comfortable. The room had a refrigerator , mainly for a mini-bar, but you could rearrange the contents to store a limited number of perishables. Did have problems with the complimentary internet connection after the first day and was not interested in dealing with the potential communication/language differences from hotel staff to get resolved.Location was convenient to site see from. 5 minute walk to the Yamanote Line (main loop line in Tokyo), which made it incredibly easy to travel the city. 20 minute walk, if you know where you're going, to the fish market.Due to the timing of our visit, New Years, much of the restaurants and sites of Ginza and greater Tokyo were closed. Finding a decent, moderately priced restaurant after dark was difficult. Even when we had directions to restaurants, the streets and addresses were rarely labeled which made navigating futile. If our Eyewitness Travel book said a location was a 7 minute walk, we usually budgeted 30 minutes to reach the final destination.Overall, this is quality hotel that I would recommend to travelers who are considering staying at a American hotel (e.g. Marriot, Hyatt, Hilton, etc) while in Tokyo.",San Francisco,5,4.0

The hotel is right beside Shiodome metro station (you don't even need to go outside to get there!) and is also approx. 7 mins walk from Shimbashi station which has fantastic connections all over Tokyo and beyond. There is a 7 Eleven shop and some casual restaurants and a coffee shop right beside the hotel, which proved very handy. Cocktails at the hotel bar were lovely and the service great.

The staff are friendly, speak very good english, but not as friendly as in other hotels.

It has a fantastic view of the Tokyo Tower behind the counter. The rooms are big, with comfortable beds and pillows, in-room internet for free (although it is a little confusing reding the instructions) and a great view of Tokyo. It is two stops out of Tokyo station, and one stop to Ginza. The mall below the hotel and joined to the shinbashi station has a few boutique stores, walkways joining to the other shiodome towers (there is like 5 of them) and mini-marts. There is a subway station around the corner from the hotel, next to the subway restaurant, just to confuse. It is also about a 5 minute walk from the Tokyo Central Pokemon Centre, a favourite for young and old alike. This is round the corner from the World Trade Centre, a great place to get views of Tokyo and Tokyo Bay and the Tower.There are a few restaurants in the hotel, we didnt have anything from them, we found the Pedi Shiodome around the corner is the best tower, with lots of places to eat at reasonable prices. Being christmas, there was fake snow in the mall underneath the towers, a christmas show (with prizes) for the kids, carols and differnet events each day.

I must mention it was extremely easy to find the Limo place inside the Airport and they were super friendly. Once we arrived a guy from the hotel greeted us and took us up to the lobby. As soon as we looked out the window we saw nothing but the most beautiful view of Tokyo Tower. It only took about 5 minutes to check and we headed to our room right away. Everything was super clean inside the room. They even provide you with the little things you tend to leave behind like tooth brush, q-tips and nail filer.The hotel is located right above a major train station (Shimbashi) and has tons of stores and restaurants within the station. From the hotel you can access the underground station by elevator which is wonderful. The places you can find down there are MacDonald’s, AMPM, Starbucks, a book store, and many more restaurants. Once you arrive within the station terminal you can take a train pretty much any where you need to. From Shimbashi station we took one train to, Shibuya, Harajuku, Akihabara, Ueno Park, and Yokohama just to name a few. Take the train, its so much fun and so cheap plus to hotel will provide you with a map of the rail way and tell you which train to catch.I must say everyone in the hotel was more than helpful.

A neat feature is the heated mirror which keeps an area usable even after a steamy shower.However, as is common in modern design, the hotel is not so practical. The rooms are small, which means doors open into each other. The bathroom is cramped and has bad ventilation. You have to prop the door slightly open and keep the light on in order to dry it out.

The prices were reasonable for Tokyo, the location was quiet and convenient. It is located in the business district which is very quiet in the evenings and weekends which we really appreciated, especially after a day's walk in busy Shinjuku or Ginza. Great place to rest! The room was really comfortable and nice, no complaints at all. For the taxi ride, be sure to state Shiodome, Park Hoteru, Media Tower, next to Conrad if they have no ideas. There are many restaurants within a short underground walk to the Caretta Shiodome. Check the Caretta Shiodome's website for a list of restaurants! Starbucks in the Conrad's basement which is next door. Train and subway stations are within a short walk underground. There is even a supermarket right above the train station on ground level where you can buy quick meals as well. Can walk to Ginza or take the subway. The subway line right outside the hotel on the second level takes you on a scenic ride to Odaiba where there's a great indoor hot springs, Oedo Onsen Monogatari. Also, a nice walk to the Tsukiji market for great sushi breakfast when you are jet lagged. Left the hotel by airport shuttle booked through the hotel which was easy. A bonus was there were different all-girls bands playing every night we were there!Will definitely stay there again without question if we ever go back to Tokyo!",luckbamboo,9,5.0

We stayed there for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon and found the hotel a great place to stay. Getting there was fine - we just took the Friendly Airport Limousine service which took just under an hour and a half (traffic), and which stops at the hotel as one of its stops. Checking in was smooth - our travel agent had organised a bottle of champagne for our arrival. Our room was on the 33rd floor and had amazing views of Tokyo Tower and all of the surrounding area. The bed was comfy, everything was clean. We had the infamous japanese toilet which comes with bidet and shower. The anti-fog mirror was great - I'd never seen one before! We didn't have any meals in the hotel restaurant, but there are quite a few restaurants in the surrounding areas. Overall, staying at the Park Hotel was a really good experience - the building is so modern and sleek, the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, and the views were breathtaking.","London, United Kingdom",21,5.0

Great location (only 2 stops from Tokyo station, and right near the fashionable area of Ginza). We can also walk to the fish markets in about 10 minutes. The views are amazing (reception is on the 25th floor) and the hotel is stylish and spotless. We stayed there on two occasions (once on the 31st floor and then on the 33rd floor), so the view you get of Tokyo is breathtaking and worth every penny you spend. The rooms are comfortable, bright and well proportioned, so we were very happy with our decision to stay there. The hotel just celebrated its 5th birthday so it's thoroughly modern and sleek. In addition to all of this, the service was excellent too, so we would totally recommend the Park Hotel both for business and leisure travelers - we will certainly return next time we are in Tokyo.","San Francisco, California",19,5.0

The hotel is located in a business district but is close to the subway station and not far by subway from entertainment areas - we never felt we were too far away from the action!Note - my taxi driver took me to the similarly named Royal Park Hotel, which is across the street, by mistake. The Park Hotel is located on the upper floors of the Shiodome Media Tower, in the same building as the Kyodo News agency, so you may wish to ask for that if traveling by taxi.As previous reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is well designed, rooms are reasonably sized for Tokyo, and the view is great since it is on the upper floors of the building. We had a view of the Hamarikyu garden and the Sumida river. Service was excellent, bathroom was nice.The cafe in the lobby is pleasant but in my opinion overpriced (800 JPY for a coffee versus 250 JPY in a cafe). There is also free internet access from a little computer room just off the main reception, with a nice view of Tokyo Tower - only grumble here is that only one of the two terminals allows access to online email services like gmail/hotmail.Overall, one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Tokyo - would definitely return.",London,30,5.0

First, its lobby starts on the 25th or so floor; the wall behind the reception area is glass-panelled and you have a first-rate view of Tokyo. Then the stunning view repeats itself once you in your room (don't take the cheapest room category - no good views there). It's the Lost in Translation feeling. On top of that, the lobby's atrium extends for some 10 to 15 floors. Architecturely the place is quite a sight. That being said, the rooms are on the smaller side, as could be expected in Tokyo. But everything is new (the hotel just celebrated its 5th anniversary) and very clean. Moreover, the hotel is centrally located.

We weren't disappointed - its rooms were small but we didn't expect anything else in Tokyo (for the price anyway). Service is as good as any other hotel in Tokyo. My partner is not 100% keen on the location but I thought it was fine - Shiodome had good transport links, and lots of restaurants. The only issue was that we normally shopped in the west side of town (Shinjuku, Shibuya) and this hotel is on the east side. But you can get to those locations within 30 minutes tops. I'll definitely consider staying there again.My only complaint was that there was no gym, but I don't think many hotels in Tokyo actually have one anyway...","London, United Kingdom",12,5.0

We were able to get a special rate with a minimum of 4 night stay. Due to complications with our flight we only needed 3 nights and were able to cancel one night and keep the 4 night rate with no problems. The Friendly Airport Limousine Company has bus service from the airport to the front door of the hotel, which takes about 60 minutes and cost 3000 Yen per person (they take credit cards). The Tourist information desk will help you find them, and will help you if you decide to take the subway. The bus is much more convenient and there is a lot less to worry about than taking the subway which cost about the same. A very friendly hotel porter met our bus, took our bags and guided us up to the 25th floor for check in (the elevator is located next to a small desk with a hotel sign on the ground floor lobby, and only goes from the 1st floor to the 25th floor and up, which makes it easy just in case no one is there to help). She then took us to our room and explained the features of the room, and gave us a map of the hotel area to help us find the subway stations and local attractions (map from website: http://www.parkhoteltokyo.com/directions/pdf/park-hotel-tokyo_map.pdf). The area looks like a maze, but with the map and most signs in English it’s actually pretty easy to navigate. We had a standard room without a tower view, but were very happy because we had a room with a view of Tokyo Harbor instead. I don’t think any view could be bad, because all rooms are above the 25th floor. The room was a little small, but very comfortable. The bathroom was very nice with the heated toilet, built in bidet, anti-fog mirror and portable shower head. The room also had a refrigerator, but no microwave (use the tea pot to heat up water for the ramen noodles). The night stand had a built in clock with alarm, and had built in switches for most of the lights in the room. The hotel apparently has personalized pillow fitters that come up to your room and sizes your pillows for no extra charge, although you will not find any literature about in the room. Unfortunately we didn’t have time to try it. They also have a very expensive room service menu, and also a service for in room massages (the prices didn’t seem that bad). The Family Mart downstairs by the entrance to the underground walkway was very convenient and much cheaper than the mini-bar. There are also a couple of restaurants down there with English menus. We didn’t eat at the hotel restaurant. The business center has 3 computers with free internet and a great view of the city. The concierge was very helpful, from finding hours of a museum to telling us what trains and boats to catch. There is a boat that will take you from inside Hamarikyu garden (5 minute walk) north to Asakusa. It cost 300 Yen to access the garden and 720 Yen per person for a one way trip. English is spoken by most in the hotel and was never a problem. Overall with the great service, good location, and comfortable rooms we will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Tokyo.",Florida,3,5.0

Trains/metro run until 12PM. Great views from the reception and room.

Almost all staff speaks some basic English and some of them good enough to communicate without problems.

I realize that it was the start of our honeymoon, and that there is the threat of being blinded by warm and fuzzy feelings when looking back at our time at the Park Hotel, but I will try my best to be objective here.We landed at Narita, which is a good hour to 90 minutes away from downtown Tokyo. It really doesn't matter which hotel you stay at, you are looking at a long commute into town after what was likely a mega-long flight to Tokyo (13 hours for us from Toronto BTW). Word of advice, opt for the bus into town instead of the train. Its about the same price ($25 per person). The bus will take you right to your hotel's front door, the train will take you to a subway station where you will have to carry your bags into a subway to continue on. After a huge flight, I really didn't feel like ""amazing race-ing"" it to my hotel. The extra 10 min the bus took was fine.The Park Hotel is located in a convenient part of town from what I could gather. Although Tokyo isn't known as ""walking"" city, we did find that quite a lot of sites were within walking distance (ie, Tsukiji Fish market is 5 min, Ginza 10, Sony showeroom 10min, Imperial Palace 15min). The hotel is located in TV land. It is located I believe on the 25th floor of a skyscrapper right beside a subway and train station. The entrance or lobby to the hotel was very impressive. We arrived at night to the soothing sounds of a light jazz in the atrium played by a talented little trio. Check in was a piece of cake, the staff very polite and respectful. The reception desk itself sat infront of a large panaramic window offering stunning views of the city; particularily the Tokyo tower (exact replica of the Eiffel Tower) and Mount Fuji. It didn't matter how many times we walked through the lobby that view always stopped us in our tracks for a moment. It was just a really cool, soothing lobby/atrium set up, which pleasantly surprised us. Relaxing there with a cold pint of Saporo at the end of each day was immediately something we grew fond of. Front desk was nice enough to upgrade our room for our honeymoon. Don't be shy to let them know, it doesn't hurt to try. We ended up with a fantastic view of the city. The room itself was not too shabby. Though it was on the small side (which was expected), it was big for Tokyo standards. The room was very comfortable, very very clean, bed fantastic and washroom fully loaded with any toiletry item you may need (the toiletry items were so cool I have to admit we still have some at our home today...still can't find a wash cloth as cool and effective as the one they provide for you at the Park!). The washroom was actually pretty crazy...I couldn't believe how high tech it was (toilets with buttons, heated seats, retractable bidet arms.....just incredible). Even the mirrors had some sort of chemical on them which prevented the section of mirror above the sink from fogging up, even after the steamiest showers. While the hotel didn't have a pool, it did have a small but decent business center with free internet. The computer room was actually just to the right of reception and also offered that stunning view that I described above. Though we weren't there during peak season, we did find the rate we paid to be very reasonable for what we got. I believe it was about $200 CDN per night. Quite a bargin consideing the sophistication, elegance, prime location, room quality, and stunning views the hotel had to offer.I wouldn't think twice about staying at the Park Hotel if we were ever to return to Tokyo. They just do a lot right. You would really have to knit pick to find something wrong with this place.Enjoy your stay in Tokyo. It is an incredible city, with amazing culture, architecture, and the friendliest most respectful people (the grounds crew at the airport bowed at our plane as we left the gate for crying out loud!). With some 30 million people living in the greater Tokyo area, the city is a marvel of modern transortation. The city really operates like clock work; it was just facinating to see first hand. The Japanese really make the logistics of public transportation an art form.Enjoy your time in Tokyo, probably one of the most advanced cities in the world. We did despite the jet lag, and hope to return one day soon.Safe and happy travels to all.Cheers, Anthony","Toronto, Canada",53,4.0

The room was georgious and quite big. However my one complaint about this hotel is NONE of their premium rooms have a view of facing Tokyo tower. Only standard and corner rooms have a tower view (or so I was told , when i enquired) so bear this in mind when booking. You would think premium meant not only larger room but also better views, sadly not so. However the city view from our room was adequate.We had breakfast each morning , expcept on final moring when we had to catch a shinkansen to Hiroshima. The breakfast was ok not huge but satisfying.They have 2 computers and a laptop with internet connection which was free of charge. The lobby is beautiful and nice for a drink or two late at night.The hotel is well connected to the JR and Metro lines. However can be confusing arriving for the first time.

Also very helpful desk staff for booking taxis etc.The lobby area is a cocktail lounge which has its own jazz band playing most nights, but you really need to get out and get on it elsewhere ... Room spotless, and okay size, with great view out over city. Bathroom something else: heated toilet seat, with all sorts of apparatus! a condensation-proof mirror ... with all your usual 'boutique' bathroom stuff refreshed daily.As stated elsewhere, at the bottom of the building is a small mart where you can get some essentials in eg water. Also tube stops are right there for both subway and Yamanote 'circle' line. Tubes - spotless too - run until about 1 am - worth bearing in mind as taxis are relatively expensive, and can be hard to get late at night, though there are seemingly millions of them about!Oh - if first time there, forget Rappongi - Shibuya and Shinjuku are where it's at. (So only 'improvement' on Park Hotel I can think of is to find a similar quality hotel in those areas.)Time Out Tokyo really good too for info on where to go, but sometimes you just have to take the plunge ie you find a bar is up on the 4th floor, accessible by lift, so you have no idea what it'll be like. But we were only stiffed the once ie charged for food put out for us that we didn't request (thus a £15 drink!) ... otherwise really great cool bars, people friendly . Lastly, the food is fanatstic - and not expensive. How? Use your eyes, and eat where the locals go! Drinkswise the beer is London prices ... and Asahi won my taste contest.",london,2,5.0

We just kept the bathroom door shut and it didn't bother us. Even with that, the room was clean and had newer furniture and free hi-speed internet (not wireless though). The location was great, we walked to Ginza and there was a great park across the street. The Tsujiki Fish Market is only one stop away on the subway line! It was nice staying in this area because there were less people around than other areas of Tokyo (like Ginza/Shibuya/Shinjuku).

You'll either have to walk to Ginza or grab a train.","Chicago, Illinois",39,5.0

The rooms are average sized, but has all the amenities you need – even though you'll have to make do without wifi. The bathroom's a pleasure to use, the air condition is very responsive, the beds are very comfortable and the rooms are well kept. On the ground and underground levels of the building you will find a convenience store, and a small food court.Transportation wise, you'll have no complaints. The elevator from the lobby takes you straight down to Shiodome station which serves the Toei Oedo metro line circling central Tokyo. The Siodome also functions as an end stop for the Yurikamome mono rail, which'll take you to the Odaiba area across the Rainbow bridge. From Shiodome you also have underground access to the Shimbashi station, which serves the Ginza and Toei Asakusa metro lines, and the very efficient Yamanote train line. Shiodome is also a stop on the airport limousine routes.The area around Park Hotel Tokyo consists mainly of hyper-modern, commercial skyscrapers, but sights such as the Tsjuki fish market and the Hama Rikyu garden is a ten minutes stroll away. Also the area around Shimbashi station a few minutes away offers a wide variety of small shops, cafés and pubs.There are no real downsides with the hotel, but a few things are still worth mentioning. The lobby, which can not be avoided on your way to and from your room, is not smoke free. The breakfast is not included in the room price. And although the area around Shiodome can offer both great transportation, opportunities of shopping and recreation, it is not the most exiting area of Tokyo. By day you'll have no problem getting anywhere in the city, but taxi will be your only choice by night as both the metro and city train lines close between midnight and 1 am. Also be sure to keep cash, as the ATMs accepting foreign cards are hard to find, but this goes for the city as a whole.All in all it's not difficult to recommend Park Hotel Tokyo!","Stavanger, Norway",30,5.0

From the Narita airport, we took the Airport Express (about 40 minutes) and then changed to the metro which took us to Shimbashi station. It was only a few minutes walk (completely underground) to our hotel. The hotel staff was indescribably professional. The entire hotel, including our room, was spotless. The decor was very modern. The room was on the small side, but it was what I expected in Tokyo! The bathroom had all new appliances and was very clean. The toilet even had a bidet. We were able to access the subway that was just below the building, so we were able to go everywhere in Japan for just a few bucks on the metro. In the evening, we had drinks in the lobby in cushy modern seats while listening to a live jazz band. My only complaint was the breakfast in the hotel. Our stay did not include breakfast, so we paid for it out of pocket at $25USD per person, and it wasn't very good at all. Not much of a selection at too high of a price. However, we discovered that at the building across from the Shiodome Media Tower (which is where the hotel is), there is another building that has tons of affordable restaurantes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Finally, on our last day, the hotel arranged an Airport Limo to take us to Narita. It costs $30USD per person, but it was worth the convenience. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel, and I plan to stay there again on my next trip to Tokyo.","Tennessee, USA",3,5.0

We had booked a Premium Twin room (33 sq) for seven nights and it was a fantastic room with very firm comfortable beds. The bathroom was amazing with a heated toilet, wonderful shower and toiletries that were replaced every day.The staff were a credit to the hotel, every staff member, and there were plenty, were helpful and spoke English. They were able to direct us to the correct train line and advise us of areas around us that were worth traveling to. We have read previous reviews that mentioned the staff were a bit offhand to casually dressed guests but we did not find any staff that were like that. We were wished good morning and good night every time we passed reception.There is a business centre right beside reception with two computers that are free for hotel guests to use. You cannot book a time on them but there was not often that you had to wait long. Most guests were accommodating and when they saw you were waiting they finished using the computer in a couple of minutes. Of course the time when you really needed it to book your seats on your flight that was when the rudest guests would not let you use them even when you had explained why you needed them – nothing to do with the hotel mind you but just a hint - if you need it at a certain time I would head down there about half an hour earlier.We found the map on the hotel website was fairly easy to follow but you must make sure that you turn right directly after the ampm convenience store and then follow the large signs that have Park Hotel marked on them. We used the train station every day and we purchased a Suica card from the machines at Shimbashi Station. I have attached a picture of the screen to my review). Make sure you touch the English picture and then touch the green Suica Card picture on the bottom right of the screen (the left My Suica white picture requires you to fill in your name and other details that are not necessary). We decided not to purchase a JR Rail Pass here in Australia before we left as we were not traveling down to Kyoto, Kobe or anywhere out of Tokyo so we couldn’t see the value of paying 28,000yen $280AU that we would use anything like that on local trains. Our Suica card cost us 2,000 yen ($20AU) and covered us for the eight days.There are so many eateries around the area and especially in the large buildings around the Shiodome Media Tower. We found a wonderful Japanese restaurant in the Tokyo Shiodome Building. Come out of the Shiodome Media Tower on the 3rd level and walk right past the Subway café. (Just as you enter the building there is also a nice breakfast café there). You then come to Level 2F of the Tokyo Shiodome Building (Pedi Shiodome it appears to be called). Stay on that level and walk right to the end of the level. The restaurant is called Ootoya and it is frequented by business people and locals before they head home. It was ALWAYS busy which shows just how good it is. We were able to have a main meal with rice (two of us) for a total of 1,700 yen. The first night we went to a pasta restaurant and spent 1,700 each on a main course. It is not just that the price is good at Ootoya it was the food that was excellent, there was always locals eating and some of the staff did understand a little English.On our walks to the Shimbashi station we would sometimes stop in for a French cake from Vie de France, a wonderful bakery. Something that we thought was strange, we called into three Banks to change large notes into smaller notes but none were ‘banks’ as such. Apparently you have to go to the Post Office form something like that.We would recommend the Park Hotel, Tokyo as we really enjoyed our stay.",Australia,115,4.0

I loved it and felt totally safe and believe me that includes being lost at 7am in the morning after too many beers. The locals go out of their way to help. I got lost so many times and acts of kindness will never be forgotten.I thing to remember if you are an international traveller. My visa card would only let me withdraw cash at Citibank ATM machines. It was a bit fustrating as there are only about 10 in the city. The 7-11 store ATM's did not work for me.

The hotel was wonderful. Overall, the hotel has a high-class business travel style. The atrium was very impressive, but decorated in a subdued style – lots of dark wood. There was also a business center next to the registration desk with two computers with free internet access, one of which was usually available. The view from the panoramic lobby windows was spectacular, especially at sunset. The room was great. We selected the larger room, which was perfect. There was a good closet and chest of drawers that easily held all of our clothes. There was also a small refrigerator with things like soda, beer and wine, and a tea setting on top (the tea was fantastic). The bathroom was somewhat small, but meticulously clean and highly functional. The space-age toilet was also interesting, with a heated seat and several functions that I dared not try. Once again, the view was amazing. All of the members of the hotel staff were extremely polite and helpful. Check-in and check-out were each a breeze, and the desk staff helped us with directions, sending mail and other routine tasks. The concierge was very friendly and responsive, and booked all of our tour activities and a couple restaurants (although there was one mix-up in a restaurant location, but it was worked out). The location was good. It is located in a business district, not a tourist area. It was fun to see the tides of office-workers going to and from work everyday. Maybe it was just because we were on vacation, but we always seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. In any event, there is relatively easy access from the hotel to Tokyo’s awesome train system, which can get you nearly anywhere. In fact, one of the train lines has a station at the bottom of the hotel. The regular JR station is just a short walk away along the under-street walkways, which are filled with shops and small restaurants. It is actually easy to find the way once you know it, but we got hopelessly lost when we first tried it (we came right from the airport with all of our luggage). Thankfully, a helpful florist pointed us the right way. Finally, we were impressed with the value. The Park Hotel is not the cheapest place to stay, but you get a lot for the money.

The check-in desk, it bears repeating, is backlit by an amazing view of the Tokyo skyline. The lobby is ample with soaring sight lines. We had a city view room with a queen bed. The 'snug' size of the room set us slightly aback at first but we adapted; ditto the bath and shower. Housekeeping is dependable. We were generally comfortable. The breakfast buffet is a real treat with a nice selection of items, set up along one of the back walls in the lobby. Guests sit informally in oversized chairs at low set tables. The cost is about $25/pp at current conversion rates. Service at the hotel is, in the seeming Asian tradition, attentive, polite, endearing.

It's on the Oedo line which doesn't go to many touristy places and it's not a quick connection to get to a more useful line. 95% of the time we ended up walking to Shimbashi station which is on the Ginza line. It's about a 10 minute walk from the hotel but involves using highway overpasses and crosswalks that go across 6 lane roads which can take a while. If you're caught in the rain, it's not a fun walk. Plus getting into the hotel isn't always straight forward. The raised entrance from the highway overpass and JR station closes at night which can be annoying. Also you have to take two elevators to get to your hotel room. One to get to the lobby on the 25th floor, and another to your room. Not really something you look forward to after a really long day; and the elevators are really slow.The restaurants in the hotel were grossly expensive, but this isn't a deficiency unique to this hotel.If you take an elevator from the lobby to the basement level you can get right to the Shidome metro station on the Oedo line. In the basement there are also a bunch of smaller restaurants that are reasonably priced. You can walk past them and outside to get to a FamilyMart (ubiquitous convenience store in Japan).All in all I'd say the hotel itself was fine. Really nothing special. Next time I'm in Tokyo I'll be looking for something with a better location; both for walking and for using the metro.",Boston,9,3.0

We received an adorable room with an outrageous view of the Tokyo Tower. We slept with the windows open both nights to admire the view. The hotel described the walk to the hotel as 7 min. but it was a good 15 for us with large luggage in tow. Using the hotel's provided maps and directions the property was very easy to find from the JR Yamanote Shimbashi station. Check-in was a breeze. The room size was slightly small but perfectly sized for our needs. The room was very modern and the bathroom decked out with a fancy toilet with all the bells and whistles. A TON of nice toiletry/spa amenities available. For a 2 day stay in Tokyo the hotel couldn't be better located. We were within short walking distance to the Tsukiji Fish Market and Hama Rikyu Garden. Additionally the JR Yamanote line gave us great access to the Shibuya/Harajuku/Shinjuku areas. The hotel staff didn't have a great range of English, but they did go above the call of duty in one case. I bought an int'l/domestic calling card from the lobby and tried to make a call to a local cell using the card but upon help from the concierge I learned the card I bought couldn't call local cells in Japan. He was kind enough to let me use his cell phone to call my friend - a huge help. Just a note that most US cell phones don't work in Japan as apparently they are on a different network. We had a 9am flight to Beijing on our final morning and the concierge wasn't really able to help us arrange travel to the airport other than recommending the T-CAT since the airport limo bus did not run early enough for us to get to the airport by 7am - again, lost in translation. Upon recommendation from our friend we were able to take the JR Yamanote to the Keisei line at Akihabara and make it to the airport in under an hour.

I have been living and working in Japan for the last 7 months and have been stunned every day with the kindness of the Japanese so I was so surprised to see such a change when I entered this hotel. I think they do probably give a bit more attention to people wearing suits rather than jeans and trainers which seems unfair as we're all paying a lot of money to stay there!Also, I found the room a little bit tired... lots of marks on the wall and a few stains on the carpet. I know this is bound to happen but it just surprised me when the lobby area is so stunning and immaculate.Overall, this is a good hotel to stay in - I would definitely recommend this for the view but if i were to go to Tokyo again, I would find a new hotel.Enjoy the craziness of Tokyo - Gan batte!","Manchester, United Kingdom",188,3.0

Toiletries are great too with nice aromothrapy from one of my favourote brand, Thann of Thailand.The bad thing is travelling to the hotel if you are arriving into Shimbashi station. Although the walk is 10 min underground, so no sweat, but getting to hotel involve going down stairs. The escalators only go upwards; meaning checking out and getting to station is actually better than getting to hotel.Staff is only ok. Lady at check in was sully and not very friendly, and since she's in black, I would think she's one of the higher ranking ones. On my last day, i went to the 1 starred michelin star reataurent and food and service was average. Generally I feel that staff in this hotel are polite only when you are dressed in suits and all formal. I was in jeans and tee and most of the time i did not get any hellos or greetings from lobby staff on my way out and into the hotel.

It was extremely clean, we had 2 superb large rooms with dizzying views towards the Ginza and lots of windows. Didn't hear any noise at all. Bathrooms were fab and the toilet was fun! There is a button on the TV remote to remove the Japanese voice-over on BBC and CNN. Breakfasts offered a wide choice including lots of fruit which you don't see much of elsewhere in Tokyo. Croissants, toast, hot choices ,cereals etc. Or you can choose a Japanese breakfast if you prefer. The staff were great and lots of English was spoken.There is a room off the lobby where you can use the computer for free if you haven't brought a laptop. This was useful for checking out restaurants and opening hours of places we wanted to visit. The hotel is superbly connected via an underground maze to at least 2 subway stations and is 10 mins walk to the Ginza, much of which you can do underground if it's raining. We would highly recommend 3 visits from this hotel:1. Walk to the local Hamarikyu Gardens and experience the tea ceremony there.2.Take the Yurikamome Line from Shiodome station to Fune-no-Kagakukan and visit the Museum of Emerging Science (aka Miraikan) to see the robots in action! Watching the humanoid ASIMO run across the room in front of us was quite extraordinary. And brilliant for our teenage kids who were enthralled.3.

The room was spacious by Japanese standards and was spotlessly clean and comfortable. They even provided yakutas to sleep in which was a lovely touch. While Shiodome is not the most exciting neighbourhood in Tokyo, the fact that the underground and JR stations are downstairs means that it is very easy to get around.

LOCATIONThe hotel is right near the Shimbashi station. Not really knowing how to get there from the NRT airport, we took a bus, but it took an hour and a half due to the number of stops along the way. You can buy a Japan Rail Pass prior (this is good if you are traveling to other cities in Japan. We used it to travel from Tokyo to Kyoto -- you purchase the exchange order outside of Japan, and then get the Rail Pass once you arrive). With the rail pass, you can take the metro to Tokyo Station, and a cab to the hotel from Tokyo Station is not that expensive (by tokyo standards). The hotel is also walking distance to Ginza and the Tsukiji fish market. Underneath the hotel area is a mall or restaurant area -- we discovered it on our last night, and it had a lot of restaurants. perfect if you are getting in around the evening and don't want to travel far for dinner. Can't remember exactly where or what it was called b/c it's been a few months, but the hotel staff should know.STAFFextremely friendly and VERY helpful. The Japanese are normally very polite and courteous, but I thought the concierge was exceptional. They helped us get tickets to a Sumo tournament (we were lucky enough to be staying in Tokyo at the time of the tournament), and assisted us with directions everywhere else.HOTEL ROOMSWe stayed in Tokyo for 3 nights, went to Kyoto for 2 nights, and then came back to the Park Hotel for our last night.

We got a great room with a great view for about £80 per night. Stayed for 4 nights and it was a great base for seeing Tokyo. Walking distance to Shimbashi station and the JR circle line around Tokyo which takes you everywher you want to go, and its free if you have a JR Train Pass. Good location for shopping in Ginza and nightlife in Shimbashi. Also walking distance to the famouse fish markets.Easiest way to get here is the Narita express to Tokyu station and then a cab (£6), takes you to the door, so you dont have to navigate the rather confusing overhead, underhead, through your head walkways, which you eventually get the hang of, 5 minutes befoire you leave Tokyo.Only drawback, was the bar life, restaurants etc was a little dead in the hotel as everyone goes out.Would definately stay again.","Berlin, Germany",27,5.0

The first time was ver recent to their oppening and I had a hard time with the taxi driver finding the place, but the second time (one year later) was smooth and with no problem (the first time I was there, they were still building the roads to get to the hotel, buit now everything is fine).What I like the most about this hotel, that I always recommed and I'm happy to see that jumped up to the second best choice in Tokyo for TripAdvisor users is):1) The location: is perfect, because at the ground floor you'll find the metro connections to almost anywhere worth a look in Tokyo2) The friendliest staff you can get (I've only been to another hotel in Tokyo besides this one, but the staff is just a 10/10.3) The shows at night. Once you get to the hotel at night you'll find some show (piano playing, a chorus line, some music) at the ground floor. You can have a drink while watching the free show, and that's just perfect4) The japanese restaurant at the groun floor is as best as it gets. Please, try the shasimi if you're into raw fish because it's excellent.5) The place itself is awesome. The lobby is somewhere around the 40th level, and the look up to the hotel from the looby is breathtaking.6) The spa might not seem big but will do the job just prefectlyOn the downside is the size of the rooms that are quite small but who care when you plan to stay in them just to sleep. Besides, the views are just amazing.So, in all, it's the perfect hote in Tokyo for the price.

The lobby is on the 25th floor of a large building, with the rooms being in the 10 floors above that. Below the Park Hotel, the subway is only an elevator ride away, which is extremely convenient.Also only an elevator ride away on the floors at the ground level and below are a Family Mart (convenience store), the US chain Subway sandwich shop, and several restaurants. If you want more restaurants, there are loads of them (dozens) in the three main large buildings adjacent to the Park Hotel in the Shiodome complex. However, they are mostly Japanese and Asian restaurants! None of them say they have an English menu, but most of them do -- you just have to ask (learn how to say ""Do you have an English Menu"" in Japanese and you'll be fine!) Our favorite was the Singaporian place in one of those huge buildings (not Pedi Center -- sorry, don't remember which one!) The weirdest one was Ducky Duck, whose menu consists of a Japanese version of various pastas and various dessert cakes!Outside in the walkway area of the Shiodome complex you can find Mos Burger, Nathan's hotdogs (all beef, same as NY) and a donut shop. There is also a British-type restaurant, but believe me the food is not very authentic!The Shiodome Complex was finished around 2002, so it's all very modern and new -- if not somewhat stark and futuristic. You won't feel like you're in a neighborhood here, but you won't lack for any conveniences either. Check out the weird motion sculpture with the huge clock that comes alive at 10 a.m., noon, 3 p.m., etc. It's like something out of Disneyland!Now for the hotel itself.....Our kids are young teens. They had their own room, so we paid for two rooms. The rooms are small but very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. The rooms are also extremely QUIET, which is one thing you really want after spending an exhausting day of sightseeing in noisy frenetic Tokyo! Seriously, this is probably one of the quietest hotels I have ever stayed in. And the views of Tokyo and Tokyo Tower are terrific!We took an overnight trip to Hakone and then came back to the Park Hotel. We had booked non-smoking rooms but unfortunately the rooms they gave us wreaked from smoke. The staff was very apologetic and gave us new rooms -- nicer ones at the corner that were non-smoking for no extra cost! The corner rooms had a lot more windows and great city views! We slept with the curtains open every night because the view was so fantastic (we were on the 28th floor).The shower heads are great -- incredible water pressure, although the flopping shower curtain was annoying.The high-tech toilets are fun, especially the heated toilet seats! Now that I'm back in the States I really miss them!Each room has a small flat screen TV with a few cable channels, mostly in Japanese. It's easy to get an internet connection. The current is the same as in the US. If you need an adapter plug for a three-prong device, the hotel can lend you one.The decor of the rooms is very modern and understated, as is the decor of the entire hotel. It's like a boutique business hotel. The lobby is at the bottom of a huge atrium similar to the way Embassy Suites does its hotels. The difference is that there is an extra glass barrier between the atrium and each room, which accounts for each room being very quiet. But the lobby itself is very echoy. Drop a fork at breakfast and everyone hears it, LOL.On the weekend nights there is jazz music in the lobby, which is a really nice touch if you want to relax with a drink or a light snack.The staff speaks excellent English and is extremely helpful and accomodating. My kids have various food allergies. We notified the hotel of this in advance as we'd be having breakfast there. I was so impressed -- the first morning we went to breakfast they were waiting with our information and told me what items on the buffet my kids could safely eat. They even read the labels of the cereals to ensure their safety. I was so grateful!!!The buffet breakfast is not a huge elaborate affair as I'd had in other Asian top-end hotels. However, it is quite filling and nice. You get breads, chocolate croissants, scrambled eggs, various meats, cheeses, salads, smoked salmon, various cereals, nice plain yogurt, fresh fruits, granola, coffee, tea, juices, and bottled waters. It was expensive (around $25 per person; a little less for the kids) but on those first days in Tokyo it was better than trying to hunt down breakfast elsewhere. If you want something cheaper I suggest going down the elevator to Family Mart and trying some of the interesting packaged goods there. Each room has a small refrigerator, so if want you can go to Family Mart or Subway Sandwiches and stock up on some stuff and put it in the fridge for breakfast or snacks.Each room also has a tea pot and some coffee and tea (both green and black), sugar and powdered creamer.There is no microwave or any way to heat anything up aside from the tea pot.The location of the Park Hotel was very convenient, especially since the subway was at the lowest level of the building's elevator. There are several stores and a few restaurants at ""subway level."" If you want to head over to the fish market, it is only one or two short subway stops away. But go early -- many sushi restaurants are shut down by noon, or have huge lines for lunch!I would highly recommend the Park Hotel hotel for many reasons. BUT -- if you want a hotel with a ""neighborhood feel"" then this may not be the place for you. We stayed there 9 nights and were very happy with our decision.Oh, by the way, several hotels were in the exact same complex -- the Royal Park and the Hotel Fontaine (in case you were trying to compare hotels). We went into the lobby of the Royal Park. Seemed fancier and larger, but we liked the Park Hotel better!","London, United Kingdom",18,5.0

The shower in particular was awesome. Our view was of Shimbashi Train station, which was ok, but not really inspiring in any way, but that's ok. Basically the only possible problem I can imagine anyone having with the Park Hotel is it's location. Shimbashi itself is not the most exciting area. But it is on the Yamanote line, so it's really easy to get anywhere in Tokyo from here within 30 mins. Personally I preferred Cerulean Tower, but has to have the caveat that Cerulean is about twice the price.

It's too far away for a one night stop-over, probably close to 2 hours door-to-door from hotel to Narita Airport. Anyway the hotel, the hotel is great. It is spotless and modern. The decor is stylish and has the feel of a top class hotel. The staff (although lacking charisma) were extremely helpful. It is a short stroll (12 mins once you figure it out) to Shimbashi station, the Shiodome station that is closer to the hotel doesn't really connect well with the main areas of interest. So the location is fine because there ain't a 'centre' in Tokyo, you'll get to anywhere you need from Shimbashi.The food in the hotel was great. We had dinner there one evening and also has breakfast in our room each morning (don't think this cost anything extra). There is a Michelin-star type restaurant and a more informal restaurant area to dine in. There is a cocktail bar there also but honestly the place was lacking in atmosphere when we were there (as these places tend to be, it is a hotel bar after all).Our room, a premier room, was brilliant. It had a stunning view of the city (therefore breakfast with this view won hands down versus the dining area). It was a spacious room that faced towards Shimbashi, some people mightn't like looking at the station and tracks but I found it facinating watching the people march along like ants in different directions. The beds in Park Hotel Tokyo are probably the best I've encountered anywhere in the world.

We arrived early (around 10:30am) and were told that the hotel was having some 'facility issues' and that if we wanted to check in on time, we would have to be downgraded from our queen room and would be given meal vouchers. We agreed as it was only for one night and were hungry. The room we were given was a city single- 19 sq meters- it was TINY. This is apparently normal for Tokyo, but after being in the Cerulean it was a box. One double bed, a very small bathroom, and we were tripping over bags constantly. That said, the room was tastefully furnished and the bed comfortable (though small). The hotel is somewhat small and seems like it's only there since they decided there wasn't enough demand for office space. Service was good, and the breakfast was a typical buffet. Nothing special. We were there on a Saturday-Sunday and did not like the Shiodome area for the most part. It was empty and sterile. It's next to a great garden though and we took a ferry to Asukasa- definitely recommend- great view of the cherry blossoms! Shiodome was convenient for restaurants, which were all empty on a Saturday night. It worked out perfectly as we had an amazing meal at the Korean restaurant on the 42nd floor of the City Center, dressed like complete slobs. However, we probably would not have been able to get a private room in a restaurant like that during the week, so being at the deserted Shiodome worked for us.

The hotel was chosen on the basis of other reviews here on Tripadvisor.Upon arrival we were told that we were upgraded thanks to our newly wedded status and given a premium room with a stunning view of the Tokyo Tower. It snowed for part of our time in Tokyo, so we ended up just seeing clouds from the room on one of the days, which we thought was very cool.This is a smart, clean hotel. The toiletries are excellent and I absolutely loved the toilet! Oh how I'll miss the seat warming and jet ""cleaning"" facilities!The hotel is easily accessible to the subway. Just hop in the lift and you're pretty much at the station. The staff were great and couldn't do enough for us. Tokyo itself is fantastic, with politeness and safety on a level the rest of the world can only dream of. The subway train was gleaming with a floor so clean you could eat your dinner off it. You'd also be hard pushed to spot any graffiti in this city.A few things to be wary of :- there's no Wireless Internet access (only a cable connection) in the rooms or throughout much of the hotel- Tokyo can be tricky to navigate for western tourists and you can get easily lost, especially if you want to see the sights. We found a real lack of tourist information especially at subway stations and on the street. This is especially true if you arrive at a station and want to get to a tourist spot.- ATM machines and Credit Card ePOS terminals are not all the same! We ran out of money and went from machine to machine where it spat out our cards time and time again. Thanks to a helpful man in a bank, he said that the only machines compatible with our UK bank cards were at Post Offices (although the only other machine that worked was at Narita Airport). We had the same problem when purchasing some CDs at one of the major record stores. Our cards were rejected at the till, but we hadn't had any problems in restaurants.","Worcestershire, United Kingdom",545,5.0

The view was just as good in the morning especially with the sun glistening.As mentioned by several other people the heated toilet was a novelty & the toiletries provided were very good.The hotel staff were very helpful & friendly providing maps & advise on how to get to places.The free internet access was handy to look up places to visit or log onto tripadvisor for tips.The view from hotel reception has been mentioned several times before but is fantastic - Tokyo tower & Mt Fuji in the distance.It was our first visit to Tokyo & we were happy with the location but have nothing to compare to.

We stayed in a standard queen bedroom on floor 33 looking out at the park and the bay. While the room is small, I thought it was extremely space efficient and didn't need anything larger. The room was stylish and very clean, and the housekeeping was fantastic. Our room was on the train station side, which I was quite wary of due to the reviews here and being a light sleeper, but strangely enough they didn't bother me. I found it more of a ""white noise"" than anything else. Your mileage may vary. I did not find the hotel front desk staff to be rude; they are certainly not as friendly and welcoming as most Japanese customer service staff we met elsewhere, but nothing to get your knickers in a twist about.We didn't use the room service or hotel restaurant, there is just so much choice in Tokyo that I didn't find it even remotely necessary. Keep in mind that my partner and I are both in our early twenties, and were keen to explore the city every day and most of the night. So really all we did at the hotel was sleep, shower, and watch a little tv. While Shiodome is not exactly in the heart of the action, so to speak, this can be a positive or a negative depending on how you look at it. I loved Shibuya for exploring at night, but as far as staying there? Not really that relaxing. Shiodome on the other hand, was clean, brand spanking new, and almost like a little retreat from the hubbub of Tokyo for us. We used the nearby Caretta mall restaurants and the convenience stores on a daily basis, and the walk through the underground passage to Shimbashi station was really convenient. Overall I adored this hotel, its amenities and services, the location and the room. Would love to go back some day.","Sydney, Australia",5,5.0

It is in the 25th to 33rd levels of Shiodome tower in a nice business district.The interior is very stylish, not what I expected at all for the price. The lobby is very comfortable and never seemed too full, and drinks aren't too expensive. Staff are very attentive. Rooms have a good view over Tokyo, beds are comfy, there is good lighting, good tea and coffee and minibar supplies, with drinks vending machines tucked away in some hallways. There is free internet next to the lobby and free secure wireless internet.Bathrooms are excellent, and well stocked with everything you could need, even razors and toothbrushes.The rooms are spacious enough (for a hotel room) with good lighting, radio and tv. There is a walkway leading from the 3rd floor of the tower so you don't need to walk to the street, which then blends in with all of the other walkways, so it is easy to get around.We had a wonderful stay here, it was one of the best hotels I've stayed in, and I can't think of anything I didn't like. Admittedly I didn't eat at the restaurant there, so cannot comment on it, but I don't usually see the point of staying in the hotel to eat anyway!

Our premium was just lovely, even with the extra bed for our son, it was comfy and roomy. Beds are great, maybe a little on the hard side, but I liked them.Service was great, we send our luggage to our next hotel and the girl on the bell desk did fantastic job helping us out, just excellent. We didn't find anybody rude etc on the front desk staff, but maybe we were just lucky, I don't know.As for the location, it is very close to few subway stations and only a short walk to Shimbashi JR station which connects you to JR Yamanote line. We didn't try hotel restaurant, since well, it is tad pricy. We ate few times at restaurants in Shiodome City Center and Caretta Shiodome, good food, nothing very fancy, but good, solid food. We ate most of our breakfast at the Vie De France, good selection on different kind of pastries.All in all, if we ever go back to Tokyo (and I'm pretty sure that we will be, we just love the city, although can't really explain why...), we will definetly stay at the Park Hotel !","Nummela, Finland",74,5.0

I booked it on expedia the day before I checked in because I was so disappointed with the original hotel choice. The hotel is very stylish and modern. We sheepishly walked in with backpacks not knowing how we would be received. I was surprised to find everyone was very nice. I read a review below about how the front desk was rude. I will add, in that respect, that I spoke Japanese to book the hotel and initially at check-in. I know in some countries that knowing the local language can make a difference in service, but not sure if that was a factor here. The room had amazing views and reminded me of what I would expect from the New Otani. The room was rather large for Tokyo standards and the was nicely decorated and very modernI recommend this hotel for the last leg of your trip if you want to spend a low key day before your flight home.

I'm glad we didn't decide on the lead in as the room was small (again as many hotel rooms in japan can be). The fabulous view of the city and Tokyo tower made up for the slightly snug space. The hotel is located in the new business district of Shiodome which though a little quiet outside of business hours did have good rail and underground connections which meant we were less than a 20 min ride to most areas.

We got a lovely room with a prefect view of Tokyo for £90 a night. Not bad at all5) Heated toilet seats etc - as said by many others. They're dead rightBad point:1) The restaurant is a rip off.

The set-up of the check-in waiting/lobby area was great: comfortable, good-looking couches set facing each other in pairs, bookcases with design & other cool coffee-table books, and good lighting. However, the room was ho-hum. While clean & spare, the 'City Queen' room was tiny, much tinier than either of the standard hotel rooms in which I stayed in Seoul (both 4-star+ hotels), and the design & materials of the furniture & bedding were poorer (the blond wood composite was definitely cheaper) -- look at the photos of the small round table. Also, I did not find the service 100% polite and seamless. One woman whom I asked about mobile phone rental (which I mistakenly thought was included with the room) spoke excellent English but was quite rude and brusque. Also, we had to remind them about our luggage for the airport shuttle, as they had forgotten our original request.The special elements of this hotel were the small details such as Dean & Deluca products in the minibar and the quality of the toiletries. The aromatherapy products smelled fantastically fresh and invigorating and I loved the wash-cloth, shaver and other products in the cool packaging. I also liked the computer room with free internet access and the mobile rental desk, both next to the check-in desk.The hotel was conveniently located close to the main rail station and some great places to eat. However, as the Shiodome area is predominantly a commercial area with office buildings and we were there for a couple of days just after the new year, the area was really dead.Overall, this experience was mixed.

We found that we did not really need our heavy guidebooks. The cleaning staff were so courteous and honest and highly consistent. Depsite our mess the room always welcomed us in superb and almost identical generous fashion each evening. We had small rooms with railway noise though soft , despite request for quiet room. The bathroom is space-age with great auto toilets (in fact greatest toilets in the world are in Japan!). However if you are obese find another hotel! Literally the bathtub took its entire length and the width was 2.5 times the width of the bathtub. The heated mirror was great and the Thai (Thann) toiletries soothing. We found such an amazing choice of restaurants in the surriunding areas that we did not need to eat in the hotel. With JR pass we used the subway free of charge just by sticking to the JR Yamamote Line-(just show to the attendents do not bother with subway tickets on this line) gets you to Akihabara, Shinjuku etc from Shimbashi Stn which is 10-15 minutes walk. The secret to finding the hotel is to follow signs to Hamamatsucho (monorail station). Tokyo is amazingly safe even at night, There is a Family Mart downstairs as well as the AM/PM mini supermarket. Stock up on drinks and snacks for the next adventure in this great megapolis. There is even a Sinagpore Hainan Chicken rice Rest. and Vie de France (see petite Japanese ladies roll out french pastries!) in Shiodome City Centre.

At least one person spoke English at the front desk, and it was easy to communicate.We returned in the early evening, got our keys, and found that our bags had already been brought to our room.

The hotel atrium and lobby are beautiful and tastefully decorated, as are the rooms. We liked the location and did not find the hotel at all difficult to find, contrary to other reviewers. It is very conveniently located to a choice of railway and subway lines, and is two minutes to the monorail. There are cafes and restaurants in the Shiodome building and the railway station, as well as in the nearby Marriot. It is also only a short walk to Ginza, the upmarket shopping area with a great choice of shops, department stores and restaurants. Our room was big by Japanese standards and had a lovely wide window sill, which I enjoyed sitting on and gazing out at the view. The night scape was particularly pretty, so much so that on our last night we did not even close the curtains. The concierge were very helpful with maps, directions and making reservations and in general the receptionists were good too, with one exception-we did encounter one very arrogant trainee who laughed in my face when I requested a late check out. We did eventually negotiate one, but there was a charge. The only other complaint I have was with regard to breakfast one morning. I had been to the fish market and returned to the hotel about 7am and decided to have a quick breakfast at the buffet in the lobby before going back to bed. I only had a glass of OJ and a pastry and decided to bring some fruit and pastries up to my husband who was still in bed. I signed for the breakfast (I think it was 16 euro for one buffet breakfast) and went towards the lift with my plate but was stopped by staff and told if I wished to have breakfast in my room I would have to order it through room service.

The hotel occupies the upper floors (25-39) of the Shiodome Media Tower in the ultra modern Shiodome district. The location is very convenient; inside the building complex in the B2 level is a Family Mart convenient store. The Oedo Subway Line's Shiodome station is right outside the Family Mart, with easy access to Roppongi and Shinjuku districts. The Yurikamome Monorail Line also stops outside the building if you're heading to Odaiba. A 10-minute walk, either through the upper level skywalk (with excellent views of the nearby skyscrapers) or the underground passage, will lead you to the JR Shimbashi station with access to the popular Yamanote Line. Tokyo station and Shinkansen bullet trains are only a couple of stops away. The Ginza district is just steps beyond the Shimbashi station.The room we stayed in overlooks the JR Shimbashi station, but the noise from the passing trains is definitely not that noticeable unless you pay special attention to it. The double room is above average in size, but with the clean and minimalist decor, it looks spacious. The usual furnishings for a model Japanese hotel are there, including LCD TV, free broadband internet access (if you bring your own laptop), bidet for the toilet, bathrobes and slippers.There are a lot of dining options in nearby building complexs, including Pedi Shiodome, Caretta, and Shiodome City Center, all accessible by the underground passage.All in all, Park Hotel is a great choice if you want to stay in that area of Tokyo.

It takes a bit effort to find where the exits are and where to go since there are three floors underground and 2-3 floors above ground. There are two major metro station closeby. SO you can get anywhere. There are also two 7-11ish mart nearby so you can get drinks etc. Overall, it is a great hotel with great view: one side is faced toward Tokyo tower(such as front desk). We will go back without any problem. We stayed for three nights which is probably not enough for this city. I think you need at least one week there.

The Tokyo train station is also a few stations away, so it's really convenient if you want to go on a trip to Kyoto for example. Plus it's in the most modern part of Tokyo, everything is so clean and easy to find. There are a lot of restaurants in the area, and the chic area of Ginza and the Tsukiji fish market with it's delicious sushis are not far away. The hotel is located at the top floors of a skyscraper so the views of the Tokyo bay were beautiful. We even saw mount Fuji one day when the weather was clear. The rooms weren't huge but still at a good size. The decoration of the room is pretty modern, very comfortable and cozy. A nice surprise : the fragrance coming from the bathroom.The staff is the best my father has ever seen -- and he travels alot. They were so welcoming, kind and patient. They really honoured the Japanese sense of hospitality.We didn't go to the restaurants of the hotel much because they are quite expensive, but there are plenty in the area. We did go to the Japanese restaurant in the hotel for our last night though, and it was delicious, the best sushi I have ever eaten in my life.

My favourite view is looking down at Shimbahi train station from the Japanese restaurant whilst having dinner. From 25 floors up it is like watching a model railway set up but in complete silence. Breakfast in the lounge area is also good and there is plenty of variety to choose from. I know that some folks have thought it expensive but it's less than £12 which is about par for the course. You can get a continental breakfast at the cafe on the 3rd floor if you like but I prefer to start the day with something substantial. The rooms are very good with just about everything you could need. I stayed here twice and my second room was smaller but still fine. The internet is free but usually not too difficult to get on. There is often very good entertainment in the evening. A good range of drinks and cocktails and a very swish French restaurant. Most of us aren't here to eat French food of course but the Japanese themselves seem to love it.The hotel is on the route of the airport bus and has a stop right outside.The only gripe I ever had was that altough Shimbashi station is easy to get to from the hotel, finding the hotel from the station always caused me trouble, even with a map. A bit of signage would be a great help I'm sure.","Bournemouth, United Kingdom",135,5.0

The hotel is easily walkable over to such great/convenient locations as Shimbashi Station, the fish market, Ginza, the Ginza Corridor (great dining of all sorts), etc. Back to the hotel, they were very efficient and accurate about arranging things such as a day trip to Mt. Fuji and a bus back to Narita at the end of our trip. We never ate at any of the restaurants/cafes there, since they seemed a little pricey and there were a ton of lovely and reasonable places to eat in neighboring highrises that were easily accessible by the over-street walkways that connect the buildings in this area (by the way, highly rec. the ""set"" meals at the Excelsior Caffe in the Pedi Shiodome building if you're looking for something easy to get to, good, and cheap — for instance, first thing in the morning — think they open as early as 7am), but we did splurge on drinks in the lobby bar on our last night -- we sat and looked at the beautifully lit-up Tokyo Tower and contemplated our lovely stay in this wonderful city and at this wonderful hotel!","Los Angeles, California",12,5.0

It's mainly a business district so there's nobody around at night or during the weekend which explains why the restaurant choice is somewhat limited to small lunch joints. We resorted to using taxis (600 JPY for the first 2km - it actually makes sense if you're a couple and not sure where you're going exactly).Even though we got there at 12:00, we had to wait 1 hour for our room and were not even offered a drink at the bar (not great when you're jet lagged and just want to go to bed).The room was pretty small with not much space left for luggages. The deco was nice though and the view was amazing. The bathroom amenieties were nice and the shower very powerfull, although they ask you to close the door as the steam might trigger the smoke alarm (?!).CNN and BBC World were the two English speaking channels on offer.We had breakfast through room service (about 5,000 JPY, crazy expensive!), nice an quick. We also had the buffet breakfast, which was served in the lobby bar and felt a bit like a train station cafe.Yes, everybody speaks English, including guests (mainly American, English and French - not a native in sight...) but what you gain in convenience is somehow lost by the impression that world-class Japanese customer service has been replace by a not so attentive one.That said, they didn't hesitate to give me some headache pills after a crazy karaoke night, lent scissors to open gadgets packaging, were always prompt to bring iron/ironing board to the room and the mini-bar was well stocked.All in all, nice enough stay but we'll try something else next time.","London, United Kingdom",20,3.0

The hotel itself is really lovely, with the room (City Queen) an adequate size for the time that's spent there. On reading earlier reviews we requested a room away from the many train lines, which was granted. The view was still awesome - of the bay and the Hamarikyu gardens (you must visit these gardens, easily accessible from the subway under the hotel (exit 7 or 8) and walk over the overpass. You can then get the ferry to Asakusa from the gardens. There's a great tea house and bridges within. Whilst we could still hear the hum of the trains from the two train lines below (31 floors below), it would probably have been unbearable on the other side of the hotel, where I think I counted 6 or 7 train lines - and they NEVER STOP! However, you would get THE best view of Tokyo Tower and at night that's pretty spectacular. (You can visit this Tower until 10pm nightly - a must see also) The size of the city is truly unimaginable until you get up there!The jazz in the lounge in the evening was fantastic. Different every night or so. As per earlier reviews, mostly we found the staff to be extremely efficient and friendly, only one did we find a little unfriendly, but not so much to notice.We had the breakfast on the last morning, and at 22,000 YEN wasn't overpriced for the selection, but the food was uninspiring and cold. The other mornings we took an earlier reviewer's advice and went to Vie de France underneath the hotel in the subway. For directions: if you're heading out of the hotel to the trains, it will be on your right in the building next door.My only complaint would be the directions on the hotel's website about finding the hotel. As the Limousine Bus from the aiport stopped it's route to this hotel ealier than our arrival, we got off at another stop and got a cab. The cabbie didn't know where the hotel was and I ended up finding it for him. The hotel has a great map for finding your way to the subway and JR lines, and back again, but you get that AT the hotel, not off the website. It would be soooo helpful to have it before so you could just get the Narita Express from the aiport. (We did this on our way home and I would get the train every time over that hideous Limousine Bus)! And, if you have a JR pass, and it's still valid, the train journey is free!Hope this all helps! I could go on.....but won't.... Have a great trip to Tokyo!","Brisbane, Queensland",27,5.0

I had a ""welcome back"" on check in which was a nice touch.As I was travelling alone on holiday I booked a single room via the hotel website for 5 nights. No problem with the booking and the rate was very competitive.This single room is a little cosy but because of the decor and layout it did not feel restrictive. The room was spotless and well stocked with little comforts - great bathroom amenities, nice coffee in the bar area and free internet access. Some hotels tend to start showing their age after a few years of service but this was not evident at the Park Hotel. I stayed in the hotel in the year it opened and can say that the hotel looks just as good now as it did back in 2004. The staff are very well trained, exceptionally courteous and speak perfect English. They will go out of their way to assist or answer any questions.The facilities around the hotel in Shiodome are very convenient. Shiodome is a major business district in Tokyo so the eating, drinking and transportation options are plentiful. To stock up on small drinks and snacks in the room there is an am/pm and Family Mart downstairs.I would have no hesitation to stay here again - in fact on this occassion I didn't even bother looking for a different hotel to try.

The lounge areas are gorgeous and veryrelaxing, and the service is impeccable. The hotel concierge was veryhelpful with maps and directions several times. When you book ahead online you can get a pretty good rate by Tokyo standards.The location is actually quite good in my opinion. Since Tokyo has an intricate subway system, it is important to be in a location whereyou have access to the different subway lines to where the touriust attractions are. This hotel fits the bill. It is all indoor walking to every key subway line as well, which is nice when it's raining. Just makes it nice if you take a subway from the airport, as it is only one change of trains. The rooms were definitely small by any standard, and the appointmentsare not what I would call ""upscale"". But it was clean and fine. Not many TV channel options, which was a bit lame. And includes high speed internet, which is great. Very happy with our stay overall.","Minneapolis, Minnesota",207,4.0

Wow what a place! As many of the other reviews have said, the hotel is extremely clean, all the hotel employees are very polite, are so nice and most of them speak English well enough to communicate effectively. Any questions you might have, I highly suggest that you ask front desk / concierge. They will go out of their way to help you out. Some things that I want to mention that other reviews have not … there are many other “Shiodome” complexes, within walking distance, that have great, reasonable places to eat. My favorite is “Pedi Shiodome”, which is just a short stroll thru the Yurikamome (3rd floor) pedestrian walkways. We tried many restaurants here including Ginzo Sushi and Excelsior Caffe (for my Western caffeine fix).The Oedo Subway Line (pink line) is what we took most. This line goes in a circle throughout Tokyo and connects to all the other major lines. The subway system is very efficient but requires a lot of walking (which I am surprised that everyone failed to mention). Be careful and double check that the subway line and the pay station match since each line requires their own tickets which are non transferable. This hotel overall is an excellent choice and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone staying in Tokyo. Enjoy!","San Francisco, California",19,5.0

Interesting location known as ""Shiodome""- an area reclaimed from marshland and now a modern scyscraper business area but very close to the main train lines and within walking distance of some of the big shopping areas such as Ginza.The hotel occupies the 25th to 34th floor of the building it shares with Kyoto News. Service could not be better. Anything we needed help with (i.e directions on arrival) they were only too pleased to do. We arranged to meet a friend for dinner one evening and when we asked at reception about getting there via taxi, they printed out a Japanese map with the exact location of our restaurant. Rooms were excellent and super clean. It is worth upgrading to the Premium Rooms as the views are spectacular especially at night.We arrived very early off a flight from Singapore and they checked us in straight away.Also, it is wirth getting the breakfast in the hotel as it is a buffet and can really get you up and running for the day! There is a choice of ""western"" or ""traditional""Finally, from here you can walk to Shinbashi station which is on the JR line and pretty much services the entire of Tokyo.

You can walk underground to the train station, the subway station, and the new monorail station. The nearby train station is only two stops away from Tokyo Station where you can connect to all other lines. The hotel is also only a 15 minute walk from Ginza where the kabuki theater is located. The walk is a simple direct route and very safe and well lighted even late at night.The front desk staff and concierge speak excellent English and are very helpful and solicitious. The lobby is gorgeous and the room very nice although not large. The restroom is very nice and the toiletries nicely aromatic. There are two computers available for complimentary internet use. We were there in late August when the weather was still somewhat hot and humid and we really appreciated the ice machine on our floor which also dispensed cold water so we could always enjoy ice water in the room. Also very convenient was the Family Market on the building's ground floor, equivalent to a 7-Eleven, where you could buy snacks, drinks, hot food, medicine and toilietries. We would definitely stay at the Park Hotel again.We booked online and got a special rate of 18,000 yen for making our reservation early. The front desk advised me that special rates are only available online so making reservations at the hotel's website is recommended. If you are unable to book at the Park Hotel Tokyo, in the building next door is the Villa Fontaine Shiodome, also a good choice. The Villa Fontaine is a business class hotel chain and many of their locations are not so nice, but the Shiodome location is new and very nice. We stayed there for two nights when the Park Hotel was full. At the Villa Fontaine Shiodome we had a 13,000 yen weekend rate which included a simple breakfast. The Villa Fontaine has self service washing machines and dryers on every other floor.",California,130,5.0

Front desk spoke good english and as in true Japanese style were exceptionally courteous and helpful. We didn't have the breakfast - not included in the rate, approx $30 AUD per person which is pricey, but it looked nice (buffet with pastries, cereal, eggs, juices etc). There are plenty of breakfast options though and by the number of people coming into the hotel with supermarket bags this was the prefered one!I would highly recommend a stay at the Park Hotel. It is central, great value and super clean. What more could you ask for. It is a 5 minute walk to Ginza, where you can find great restaurants and shopping. If thinking about Ginza vs. Shinjuku as a base i would choose Ginza - no comparison really.

The hotel, as mentioned in previous reviews, is in Shiodome Media Tower with the lobby on the 27th floor. Visually the place is amazing, beautiful views and very serene. The staff at check-in were excellent and upgraded us to a higher floor upon our request. We were looking over the bay area. We stayed in 2 City Queens (standard rms) on the 33rd floor, the rooms are compact but beautifully designed and the beds are really comfortable.We ate in the Japanese restaurant on our first night with great views & excellent food although small portions and reasonably expensive. Be warned that most restaurants (incl. the hotel) in the area have last orders between 9 and 10pm so you need to take this into account when planning your evenings. I recommed trying the top floor restaurants in the Shiodome City Centre building nearby - the view & food are outstanding.From a location point of view you are within 5 mins walk of Shiodome station with excellent and easy links to all the most popular areas of Tokyo.We have just booked our Christmas trip to Tokyo and are staying in the Park again. Both times we have booked on their website and the rates are excellent plus the hotel personally email you to confirm you booking and any individual requests you might have.

I stayed here during February 2007, so forgive the belated review but here’s my impressions and tips.I can confirm that it is difficult to fault the staff and the hotel. The hotel is very convenient for central Tokyo and the travel links are superb, i.e. close to Shimbashi Station for the JR loop line and the Tube. Initially, the hotel is not easy to find but was resolved by taking a taxi from Shimbashi Station (cost less then £3) to the ground floor entrance and subsequently obtaining a ‘directions’ leaflet from the English speaking Concierge for the walkways accessed from the Third Floor. As other contributors have noted, it should not be confused for the Royal Park Hotel which is adjacent. As for the noise factor, for those who have exceptional hearing, there is some ambient noise in the background but this is not significant. This may be dependent from which side you are located; from what I can discern, all the rooms are built around a central atrium and face outwards towards Tokyo Bay or Tokyo Tower. As for dining, the easiest option is to head for the Caretta Centre or Shiodome City Center as these have every variety of restaurant imaginable.As for the negatives, being very pernickety, the size of the room coffee mugs seemed miniscule by Western standards and the free-internet facility in the Lobby was sometimes unavailable. I was also charged 30 Yen for one A4 copy from the internet which I thought was slightly cheeseparing! This said, if you want the futuristic Tokyo experience, this is the place.","London, United Kingdom",83,5.0

Having stayed at the other aforementioned places, for my money, I would choose the Park over the rest (not that I can really afford to stay at the Conrad haha) as it offers the best value for its rates. I have stayed here a few times and on my second visit, they upgraded me to a better room with a fantastic view of Tokyo Tower, not much in the daytime but really gorgeous at night. Now, every time I stay there, they have always given me the upgrade, without my having to ask for it.The rooms are very comfortable and the decor is understated and chic. Bathroom amenities are from a Thai company that makes natural and organic products. If you want to take them home (and they do smell lovely), bigger bottles are for sale at the hotel store, tucked in a small corner off the elevators on the lobby.Don't take the breakfast - at over Y2,000 it's very plain and you can get better pastries and bread at Vie de France and the other coffee shops in the Shiodome train station area.The other great thing about the Park Hotel is that it's connected to the Shiodome and Shimbashi stations via an underground passageway -- terrific to get out of the rain or the cold. It's also connected to the Yurikamome station for shopping forays into Odaiba. And the buildings around the hotel have so many restaurants and coffee shops to choose from. Not to mention convenience stores for last minute emergency supplies.You can also book online and they have a special rate for bookings 30 days in advance that was even cheaper than the corporate rate that I used to get.There are no unpleasant suprises at The Park Hotel Tokyo, just consistently good facilities, service and great value!","Manila, Philippines",237,4.0

At 6:00am I wandered down to the front desk to get a room change so I could sleep and I was taken to a single room, which was much nicer, although smaller, on the otherside of the building. I could still hear the trains but it was a huge differance.Bonus: Toilet seat is heated, has a fancy bidet option as well as a heated section of the mirror so you can see when you get out of the shower and need to do your hair. There is a kettle and coffee/tea in the room as well as good bathroom amenities and soaps.The Japanese restaraunt in the hotel was wonderful and the food was fresh. The girls that were in-training were a great help for shopping and subway directions. They were full of energy and very happy to help, which is more then I can say for the gentlemen at the front desk. The location was good for me as I just took the subway to Ginza to shop and look around the city. There a lots of places to eat in the lower level of the hotel as well as a Starbucks and a McDonalds if you need your western fix. They also offer free internet in their mini business centre with two semi private computers.The last night of my stay, a category 9 Typhoon stormed through Tokyo. The hotel lobby had computer printouts of the weather and kept the guests up to date with what was happening. The television stations had a few good stations that offered english interpretations. No problem in the morning and my flight left on time in the afternoon.They also offer an airport shuttle bus that makes a couple of hotel stops. When I arrived, it was quite late at night and I missed the last bus for this hotel. Thankfully, the airport counter attendtant for the limo shuttel bus service suggested I take the next bus to a close hotel and then taxi it over. This worked for me very well, although beware, taxi's are VERY expensive in Japan. It's a good hour from the Narita airport to this area of Tokyo, but it was worth it.

It's inexpensive, it's chic, the service is great and the location is not bad either. The reception is situated on the 25th floor of one of the towers in the Shiodome complex. You get both excellent views of the Tokyo cityscape going up in the lift and from your room window. It's also easily within walking distance of all the stores in Ginza. We had not one complaint about the service. Everyone on reception was both helpful and efficient. We had read murmurings prior to our trip about the small size of the rooms, but found the set-up similar to many rooms in Europe. The decor is stylish and the bathrooms well-equipped. You have heated toilet seats and the part of the mirror above the sink does not steam up while you're having a shower. So, you don't have to shave or brush your teeth through the mist! For us, the real highlight were the breakfasts, which are absolutely delicious. We live in Paris and the pastries were as good as any we have tasted here. If I had any grudges about the Park Hotel, then they would be slight. The first one would be the difficulty in actually finding it. We arrived at the Shimbashi train station and I had printed out a plan from the Park's website. However, it wasn't 100% clear that we had to go into the underground complex when we got out of the station. There are also steps in the same place going up to an overpass and we were slightly confused. The second thing, which may bother some people is that the tower in which the hotel is situated is right next to a major train line. You can hear the rumbling of trains below all the way through the night. It didn't bother us, but it could be a pain if you're a light sleeper. Otherwise, definitely try out the En restaurant on the 42th floor of the neighbouring Shiodome City Center tower. The views are amazing and the food fantastic.",Paris,111,5.0

It is one of the best hotels we've been ever, and through Expedia it was only for 105 euros every night, without breakfast. As there are lots of other traveller's comments and I think that I can't tell you nothing new about the hotel itself, but maybe some tips (useful, I hope) will help.1) How to get to the hotel the first time you travel to Tokyo. When in Narita, to take a train to central Tokyo, step down in Shimbashi station and walk to the hotel along the underground floors seems extremely complicated. One easier possibility is to take the Airport Limousine Bus [--] which in some cases takes you directly to the hotel door. I think first departure from Narita to the hotel is at 13:50, so if you arrive earlier you can take the Airport Limousine Bus that goes to the Dai-Ichi Hotel. It's so near to the Park Hotel than a taxi from the Dai-Ichi to the Park Hotel costs only about 600 yens. The Airport Limousine Bus it's not a limousine, it's just a bus.2) To have breakfast. In the basement floor (press B2F in the elevator), walk to the Shiodome City Center building and you'll see Vie de Paris. Excellent to buy croissants and many kind of pastries, take an orange juice and a coffee.3) Spend some time to familiarize yourself with the hotel surroundings. In the B2F basement floor there are the entrances to the Shiodome City Center, Caretta Shiodome and Tokyo Shiodome Building. They are plenty of restaurants. No need to go far away at night to have dinner, enough good choices beside the hotel.4) Go to the Skyrestaurants floor in the Caretta Shiodome (46th floor). There is a free viewpoint to the Tokyo City. Excellent at night. Don't miss it.5) If you get tired of japanese food, you can go to the Gran Diva restaurant. Excellent pizzas & salads, and with english menu with photos to help you with your choice. It is outside the Nihon TV Tower. To go there, exit the hotel by the 3rd floor (Yurikamome), and walk opposite to the underground station and then turn left, not down to the street, but along the pedestrian deck and you'll find it after the escalators, one floor lower.6) Tokyo / Japan souvenirs. Among all the places we visited in Tokyo and Japan maybe the best place to buy souvenirs was the street in front the Senso-Ji temple (Asakusa Kannon Temple), one of the best spots in Tokyo. There are lots of shops, will lots of things. Be aware, shops close very early, I think between 17:00 and 18:00 hours.7) If are going to travel around Tokyo or Japan with the Japan Rail Pass, and even though you are not going to use it from the first day of your arriving at Narita, exchange your voucher and get the Japan Rail Pass at the Narita Office, because I think in the Shimbashi Station there is not an office to do so.Hope these tips will help you a bit in your Tokyo visit.",,52,5.0

In fact, Tokyo is a lot easier to get around now with English translations in buildings, restaurants and subways.Hotel itself is very modern, airy and serene at the top of a 38 story building in Tokyo Shiodome, which is a series of modern skyscrapers serviced by subway and trains below street level and connected via pedestrian walkways on the third floor. Very quiet despite the activity down below. Didn't use the trains, but found the subway connected to the Ginza and Asakusa Lines, which will hit just about every tourist site in the Tokyo area. There is also a monorail that will take you to the seaside development of Odaiba. Hotel is ten minutes from the Wholesale Fish Market by foot--this a Tokyo must see, if you get up early.With my family of 5, got a twin and a triple. Rooms generous in size for Tokyo, bathrooms and amenities were very good. Restaurant services a very good breakfast buffet which our family enjoyed before hitting the streets. Did not eat any other meals in hotel--seemed pricey, but the building is connected to other Shiodome buildings--Carretta and City/Pedi Shiodome had a number of inexpensive and good restaurants offering a variety of Japanese and non-Japanese foods. There is a Family Mart in the basement level of Park Hotel building for snacks. While we were staying in the hotel, there was a free jazz concert every nite in the lobby.Service was excellent. The concierge services were very helpful and helped me to work with a tour agency that had ""lost"" our reservation for a tour to the Ghibili Museum on the outskirts of Tokyo. Fortunately, the concierge was able to clear up the problem and we got to go on our tour.Can not think of anything negative to say about the hotel, definitely worth the price, would definitely go back and would definitely recommend it to my friends.

It is not nice having to walk through that stink every time.This was one of the more classier/expensive places I stayed in. The service was very good, and I got a free upgrade to a 'tower view queen room' (from a city queen room) which was very nice of them (hotel was definitely in low season). They kept my luggage for several days after I checked out and they were very professional and helpful. While the view is quite nice, I wouldn't recommend paying that much for one! (see pics)Room size was adequate, and you could set up a washing line in the SOB. Bathroom was quite nice, nice towels (of all kinds), many toiletries (of high quality and natural ingredients), fancy toilet, slippers, robes. Rom key was electronic, and electricity only powered when key is inserted. Air con was adequate for the hot weather. There was a safe, free internet, nice LCD TV, big bed, room and laundry service, fancy stuff in mini bar. It may seem fancy but stay away... quite expensive stuff in there. There's a Family Mart on the bottom level, go there for cheap food and drinks! I did order a pizza from room service and it was SO SO greasy ... at more than 1800 yen for a good size slice of GREASE, Tabasco and a small bottle of Evian.Bit hard to reach, have to trek from Shimbashi station through the Shiodome complex (which was quite nice clean and modern, just a teeny bit of a hike), find the office building this is on top of and then take a side elevator up to the foyer. But once you find it, it's all good! If you use the map on their site, it's not very detailed and make a note of the levels...I don't recommend eating here, very expensive and didn't look that great.Again... too bad about allowing smoking in the foyer. Plenty of old Japanese businessmen come in to eat at the restaurants and chill out, smoking in the foyer 8-( Everything else was very good, and appropriate for what I paid.","Melbourne, Australia",45,4.0

The toiletries were very generous - including toothbrushes, toothpaste, hairbrush, moisturiser, bath salts - and the basic ""city"" rooms are a decent size for Tokyo with great views ( a view of Tokyo Tower costs a little extra, but the other views are good too).The location is also perfect. It's a relatively newly developed area, but within walking distance of the fish market, boat trips, Ginza shopping area.

While all the travel sites were showing 250$-270$ per night, she was able to get me the 170$-180$ per night range. So word of advice: worth checking with your agent.The hotel itself is amazing. Just as you see on their Website. The whole place is classy and it feels that way right when you walk in. But it's very unpretentious. We were two jeans-T-shirt type of guys and didn't feel awkward. The staff makes you feel at home.I'll go with the usual Pro/Con description:PROs:- Amazing common areas. Slick boutique style hotel. The only hotel in Tokyo that made it into the Designer Hotels category (or some similar classification)- Great attention to details in the rooms (example: part of the mirror doesn't get condensation so you can shave in that spot right after the shower)- Nice little plasma TV- AMAZING VIEW! With the hotel occupying floors 25 and above, you get a great view of Tokyo and surrounds from the top. Absolutely request a room that faces the tower. The hotel has 3 sides but to avoid any confusion, ask for a room on the same side as the reception. On a good day we were able to see the Mount Fuji. It is worth waiting for a room with that specific view if one is not ready- Location: It is located in an area that has somewhat of a futuristic side to it, above malls. If feels a bit like being in a realistic sf movie when you walk on the top of the platforms with all these tall buildings and the monorail above you.- Plenty of eating options around: restaurants, cafes as well as food stores. Local and western.- The breakfast looked amazing, never tried it though- Amazing value for the price- The staff is really nice and helpful. Take advantage of the concierge, she was a great source of info for shopping for us.CONs- Out room was somewhat on the small size, but very functional- Location: I understand that it could be somewhat off the main touristy attraction. It is not Shinjuku but the area is 1) really not isolated, as you can find malls as well as typical Asian places all around and 2) it's really close to everything by metro. But if someone is more into nightlife he's probably better off with a hotel in Shinjuku.It was the best hotel experience of my entire 5.5 week trip in Asia Australia (with the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore being a close second). I am thinking about a trip to China next year. If I decide to stop in Tokyo, I will absolutely go back to this hotel.Word of advice: there are 3 or 4 hotels in Tokyo with the word Park. So make sure you select the right one. Also, if you go to Japan, make sure to visit Kyoto. Tokyo's temples and gardens really pale in comparison. Kyoto is unique, not to be missed! Spend AT LEAST 3 nights in Kyoto and 3 in Tokyo. For an odd number (7 nights, etc) I would add a night in Kyoto.","Montreal, Canada",251,5.0

There are corner rooms available if you want a few extra square feet or perhaps are staying for a while.The staff here are very helpful and brought me hair appliances when mine didnt work (ladies be warned its a different voltage from many other countries and straightners dont work so dont waste your luggage allowance) they are also excellant with advice for where to go or how to get there. Just ask the front desk if you need anything.We booked through the hotels website after checking majority of main sites online and phoning the hotel it worked out the cheapest rate by quite a bit. I think we paid $300 USD for 2 nights so about £150 including breakfast and of course the wonderful view.Right below this hotel is a 7/11 convienience store which is not suprisingly about an 8th of the price of stuff in the minibar and obviousley offers some good snacks too.We ate in the hotel restaurant one evening, Don't recall the name but its the one which isn't japanese cuisine. It's not a cheap meal but having said that its not as expensive as things can be in Japan. We had a set menu of 6 course which i think was around £30 each and also a wonderful rose wine to go with it. The food was wonderful, they served two different appetizers, then fish, then a meat of your choice followed by 'pre-dessert' and grand dessert' i dont quite understand the idea behind the pre dessert thing but it was definately delicious.After dinner we drank cocktails in the hotel bar which for me is the only negatve to this place, the bar itself is modern and sophisticated and cocktails were up with some of the best ive had but the view has been ruined by an office building that you just can't quite see over the top of. Whether it came after the hotel was built i dont know, but it does make you wonder why they didnt have the bar on the top floor. Having said this its really not bad as you can watch people still working i their office at midnight and revel in the fact you're away from that.All in all a great hotel at a very good price for Tokyo. I feel you get your moneys worth just from the view but if you dont agree theres always buffet breakfast which you'll definately want to return to for more.","Jakarta, Indonesia",29,5.0

We chose this hotel based on the reviews we read here on Trip Advisor, and wanted to try something different than our earlier stay in Tokyo's Shibuya district.We found the hotel to be clean and modern, as described, but our ""Queen"" room was quite small, still OK. We found the room fit and finish to be a bit on the spartan side, especially the bathroom. I understand why others have suggested upgrading to the executive floor. But generally speaking the hotel is well appointed and the staff was efficient, although the concierge desk was particularly unfriendly and unhelpful, I guess it depends on the person at the desk. Bellmen , on the other hand were very efficient in dealing with our logitics to Narita.We did not use the hotel for breakfast, but we did have one dinner in the Japanese restaurant in the hotel, which was quite acceptable.I guess our biggest disagreement with other reviewers here is with location. The hotel is right in the center of an office building complex, so if you like empty office lobbies and aerial maze of passageways, this hotel is good. But apart from a strange and quite large mall and outdoor TV studios next door, there is no ""there"" there.It is a good 15 minutes from Ginza on foot.

The staff of this hotel is amazing, paying attention to every detail and request we had and the concierge was very helpful in booking our day trips. At times I ordered something for my room before I got in the elevator and it was delivered 2 minutes later. The room was impecable with a beautiful view of the city. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the A/C was fantastic. The bathroom has everything you need for shaving,a comb and nice shampoo and conditioner plus creams and many other things. The location is also very nice if you take the time to explore the area. First of all you have Ginza in a 15 minute walking distance and two metro stops that will take you anywhere. Do not be afraid to use the metreo because it's easy to learn (fo;;ow the color for the line you need and the number for the station) and every station has an attendant who speaks english and gives directions. If you stay at this hotel, always get off on the 3rd floor and use the overpass to get to your metro or walking destination. You have an AM PM across the street for water, fruit, beer and many restaurants in the building next door for dinner or take out.Again, for the money you are getting a very nice staff and a great room.

I selected this hotel based on the wonderful Tripadvisor reviews and I could not have been more pleased. The location is within walking distance of both a JR Station (Shimbashi) on the Yamanote line and a Metro (subway) Station (Shiodome). Check-in was a breeze and we were welcomed when we arrived. The lobby is beautiful and welcoming. Our room had a wonderful view and was larger than I thought it would be. Although not huge - I must say that I have had much smaller rooms in Europe. TV had CNN and BBC for us English speakers and we had Ethernet Internet access in our room. In room safe. An English speaking newspaper was delivered every morning. Breakfast was delicious - croissants absolutely wonderful. Concierge helpful with restaurant and directions (Tsukiji is very close by). It's about 3 minutes to the subway and I would say about 10 minutes to the closest JR station. Both can be reached by the underground pathway system. For those with kiddies, McDonald's in the Caretta Shiodome Building on B2 level is close by as are several wonderful restaurants. We liked Buitoni in the Caretta Shiodome building (B2 level) and also had a very nice meal at China Quick on the B2 level of the Shiodome Media Tower - same building as the hotel.

We stayed on the 30th and 33rd floors with no noise from the trains, even though we were above the train lines. The hotel was great, and we throughly recommend it. For a first visit, the Airport Limousine from Narita stops right outside making travel easy - if you're more confident, its easy enough to take JR to Shimbashi, and then follow the pedestrian walkways to the Shiodome tower (download the map from the hotel's web site first!). The walkway to the 3rd floor of the Shiodome are easy to follow - the basement tunnels are more complicated and we rarely used them. There is a Family Mart in the basement, useful for food and other items. As other reviewers have noted, the surrounding buildings are full of restaurants of all types. The location is also good - lots of metro lines close, easy to get to Tokyo Station (though the fastest way seemed to be the JR lines from Shimbashi, not the metro), right beside the Yurikamome monorail that goes to Teleport, and easy walking distance to Ginza.The only disappointment was that there is no WiFi network (there is cable access for laptops in the rooms however).

Add in the free internet service, free Herald Tribune under the door each morning, complementary coffee and tea, and the hotel deserves 4 stars. Now for the bad news. Our room faced the Shimbashi train station, and the noise was persistent and loud between 5 a.m. and midnight. A noise generating air purifier was cleverly left running to mask the noise, but did not help. Most frustrating for us was the location of the hotel, attached to the complex of buildings known as the Shiodome. This complex is reminiscent of one of those large hamster habitats, with a bewildering 5 level array of overhead and subterranean walkways. A planned stroll to the Palace gardens turned in to a 3 hour fitness program of stair climbing and many wrong turns. We seemed to always be on the wrong level and the numerous orientation maps placed at corners each have north pointing in different directions. Bono would love Tokyo, because it is a place where ""the streets have no names"". Your first challenge is to exit the building. You cannot simply hop in the elevator and go out the front door. You must first descend to the lobby level on floor 25 and parade across the lobby to the elevators on the other side of the room. Mercifully, this hotel does not employ a legion of service workers bowing and chanting pleasantries as you pass in front of them. Once at the next bank of elevators, you must choose between the ones on the left that take you to the overhead walkway and main entrance or the ones to your right that also go to the subway levels. Even at the subway level you will be descending and climbing stairs in order to get through the bottleneck of the Shimbashi station. Whatever you do, do not try to leave the hotel from the main door entrance. The surface roads are all but impassible to pedestrians. You will spend your day climbing and descending long staircases. And Heaven forbid you should try to enter the nearby Dentsu building to use the escalator. You will cause a great deal of stress to the security guard whose job it is to keep people like you out of there. Like caged rodents it will take you several days to learn the best pathway to food and entertainment from your room. Perhaps some people thrive on this sort of complexity, but if your knees and brain are aging you may prefer simpler surroundings.Some advantages to the location include:Fantastic Miyazaki designed mechanical clock on the pedestrian walkway level. Plays an enchanting tune several times per day. Arrive several minutes before the scheduled performance time. Some people have posted the performances on Youtube.comMany low cost, high quality restaurants in the surrounding buildings. The Shimbashi station is on the JR Yamonote line. Day pass for the JR Yamonote line is only 730 yen. It circles Tokyo and takes you to most of the interesting neighborhoods.",California,16,4.0

And though the room was small and had little storage space, it was thoughtfully designed so we really didn't feel cramped or disorganized. It's also worth mentioning that when my jet-lagged daughter and I were up at 3 am, the all-night convenience store downstairs, with a reasonable selection of relatively healthy prepared foods, was a real blessing.The location is very convenient -- a few blocks from shopping and fabulous restaurants in Ginza (I'm not much of a shopper but the yen is weak and Japanese goods can be utterly irresistible) -- and easily accessible to trains.","Westchester County, New York",20,5.0

Rooms are just standard in terms of interior design. The lobby is beautiful. Service is excellent (everyone greets you with nods and bows, like a king). The lady working at Concierge desk was extremely helpful, and copied me detailed maps from a street directory to make the process of finding places easier.Location is a bit hard to find for first time travellers to Japan (but same goes for most places in Japan).The price was exceptionally cheap at 14,500yen per night. For the 4.5 star standards of this hotel, this was fantastic value for money.If it's your first time to Japan, you will find it a challenge. The Japanese cannot speak English. Street signs are in Japanese. It's very tiring and difficult to find places. And the subway lines are a maze.In Tokyo most of the streets do not have names, and so the address is conveyed as area number, block number, building number eg. Shinjuku 2-1-9. I recommend you get a detailed map from a Street Directory (not a tourist guide), and then it makes it easier to navigate to places. Always find out the address in terms of area number, block number, building number of whereever you are going.This hotel is located above the ShioDoMe (pronounced She Oh Doh May) subway station. The easiest way from the airport is to take the Limosine Bus (a normal bus) to Tokyo City Air Terminal for 30000 yen and then catch a taxi which will cost 20000 yen to the hotel.If you are getting the subway around, I found it easiest to use the Shidome subway station. The Shimbashi station (which was recommended by the hotel) is a long walk and difficult to find in the maze of the underground subway lines. The Shidome station is just outside the entrance from the hotel on Basement level 2.While in Tokyo, I recommend a visit to the basement food court of the Isetan department store in Shinjuku, the array of food offerings are amazing! Also a must is shopping and dining in Ginza, which can be walked to from the hotel. On Saturdays and Sundays they close off the 8 blocks, and it is a pedestrian street. The shops, restaurants and atmosphere is wonderful.","Newcastle, Australia",129,5.0

I've stayed in lots of hotels in Tokyo before where I paid a lot more and got a lot less. The room was on the small side, but so thoughtfully designed that I really didn't notice. Bed was terrific - slept like a baby. Loved the Thann bath products from Thailand - will have to pick some up on my next trip to Bangkok. The adjoining Shiodome complex has lots of restaurants, Japanese and Western, and I tried one tonkatsu place that was really very good. Also, from the hotel as mentioned it is just a short 15-minute walk to Ginza (there is an excellent supermarket under Shimbashi station) where there is all the shopping and nightlife you'd want. It took me just 15 minutes to jog over to the Tsukiji fish market and I am not a fast runner. I loved how the Shiodome subway was right at my doorstep (that line could take you to Roppongi) and how convenient it was taking the airport limo bus.

Not much to add that has not already been said - so I will offer some local pointers for those that would like to stay here: 1. The ""Limousine Bus"" from the airport stops and picks up at this hotel which is great. This bus is an excellent way to get to and from the airport - as cabs are very very expensive, and if you have a lot of bags, using the subway can be a challenge. You can easily find the ticket counters @ the airport when you arrive and the hotel will sell you a ticket at the front desk when you depart. 2. This hotel is two quick subway stops from the Tokyo (Tsukiji) Fish Market that is in many guide books. You need to get there very early but it is worth the trip in my mind. Unique and fun. But wear shoes that you are OK getting wet and mucking around in (It is an active fish market - not a tourist attraction). 3. For great sushi try Midori-zushi - remarkably reasonable prices given the quality. Note the sign is not in English but it we found it. It is in Ginza and very close to the Imperial Hotel. Address: Ginza 7-108, Ginza Korida-dori 1F. Open 11am-2, 5-9:30pm dailyWe would stay @ this hotel again on future trips.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",73,5.0

Truly, this is a gem. The rooms are spotless and very spacious for Tokyo. I booked on tablethotels.com and found the rates to be very reasonable for the quality of the hotel experience. The only possible negative is the location, but even that is a stretch. It's in Shiodome, a relatively new skyscraper/business district and the hotel is directly connected to a subway line and a monorail line (which runs to Odaiba). That said, it's not really walking distance to the big attractions like some other hotels are, but I think you'll find that you don't regret picking the Park!

It’s located in the top floors of the Media Tower of Shiodome, an ultra-modern collection of high-rises on the southern edge of the Ginza neighborhood (and not to be confused with the Royal Park Hotel, which is in the Royal Park Shiodome building next door). We arrived via the Airport Limousine, tickets purchased at the airport for about $25 each way. A bellhop seemed to know we were coming and brought us to the 25th floor with our bags for check-in (and it felt very strange not to tip him). We stayed in a City Twin room, which their website says is about 280 square feet (26 meters sq), for about $225 per night. Our view was to the southwest, overlooking Hamarikyu Garden (which has a water bus to the Asakusa neighborhood with the Sensoji temple), Tokyo Bay and Tokyo Tower. My only complaint was that we could have used just a tiny bit more space so we could keep our bags out rather than tucking them away each day. Plenty of toiletries were provided (photo attached), as were terry cloth robes and cotton wrap gown pajamas. The minibar fridge had enough spare room that we were able to keep some of our own food and beverages chilled (purchased from a convenience store called Family Mart at the base of the building, or a larger store nearby called DonK). There are also vending machines on each floor with cool Japanese versions of bottled water and sodas for just over $1 each (fun souvenirs). We didn’t try any of the restaurants in our hotel building as there were dozens of others in surrounding Shiodome buildings, from Subway, McDonald’s and Nathan’s, to diners where you buy meal tickets from picture-button vending machines. And Chuo Dori street, the equivalent of Champs Elysees or Fifth Avenue, is a short walk and has plenty of high-end dining.The Shiodome area can be really disorienting. There’s an underground pedestrian passage that connects the Shiodome train station to the nearby Shimbashi station, and we found it much easier to navigate from that level than the elevated pedestrian walkways that wind around the skyscrapers. Our bags were stored for us on our last day while and brought down for the shuttle home, tickets this time charged to our room through the concierge.The staff was impeccable (the concierge was kind enough to go with us to an ATM-like kiosk in the Family Mart to buy tickets to a sumo match *highly recommended* since the screens were in Japanese only). The decor was stylish. The bed was firm with comfortable cotton bedding. The location was convenient to the Ginza neighborhood and two train lines. You always hear about how expensive Tokyo is, but I know I've paid more for lesser rooms in other cities. I would stay here again.","Tustin, California",8,5.0

The internet was speedy and the location was convenient enough. It's a good 10 minute walk from the station but as it's accessible from the JR and Metro lines that's excusable, especially since the entire walk can be done across an elevated promenade.

Walking distance from the Fish Market and Ginza area, 3 metro lines plus the JR Yamanote take you in 15mins to anywhere from Shibuya and Omotesando to Shinjuku. The last morning we wanted to book a restaurant for dinner and when we got back in the evening to change clothes not only did we have our reservation confirmed but also 4 pages printed in colour from a gourmet website with pics of the place, the menu in English, directions for the subway and even a map in Japanese to show the taxi driver.What a pleasant stay.

Just keep in mindif you don't get a corner or a premium room you will be in a shoe sized room. I had a corner twin and it was very good sized but we didpeek in the other rooms so and they seemed very small. I found the info on this site to be very accurate regarding this hotel.You will be dealing with 4 levels when you stay at the Park.1. Lobby level which is on the 25th floor2. Overpass level that connect the hotel to surrounding builds and is a raised walkway over the street.3. Street level, there is a little construction going on there.4. Subway/underground.Between all these levels you will find at least 50 or so places to eat for high and low budget meals. I suggest you take an hour or two to look around all the levels. If you don't find that many eateries keep looking cause they are definitely there and wil save you abunch of $$$ with infinite food choices.Also the view is stunning from the lobby and if you have a premium or corner room it is just as good. But after you seen that view for a few days I suggest you walk over to the Conrad hotel right across the street, go to the lounge which is first calss all the way and the water view is stunning definitely worth the walk.The fastest way there is to take the NEX (Narita Express) from the airport to Tokyo station 54 minutes then a ten minute cab ride from the station to the hotel. wait and take the hotel bus and you will get there almost an hour later or maybe longer.Most important tip is to print out the map from the hotel website with street names and hotel info in Japanese.

The hotel is very clean with an attentive staff. Although the rooms are relatively small, you don't feel cramped.

You never hear your neighbors or hall traffic; something I can not usually say for US hotels.The location is very convenient as it's only a 10-15 min walk to Ginza (tons of shops and restaurants) and only a 5 min walk to a shopping center (I recommend ""Vie de France"" as a bakery for those looking for European-style morning pastries). And there are 3 subway stops and 1 train station in the immediate area, so it's always easy to go where you want in Tokyo.We didn't try the restaurants due to cost, but the breakfast buffet was tempting just b/c of seeing it each morning in the beautiful lobby. On a side note, we exchanged a little bit of money at the hotel our first day to get us going, and the rate we got was within 1% of what we got at a bank the next morning.

Our father-in-law, even with a native car and Japanese navigation system, couldn't seem to locate the hotel and had to ask multiple people in the area. In fact, we spent a good 30 minutes in the vicinity circling around until we found it. The reason was that the hotel is part of a skyscraper, and is located on the higher floors. So the only thing pointing out that there's a hotel there is a small sign that was hard to see from the construction-crowded road.Once there, we took the quick and quiet elevator to the spectacular lobby. The view from behind the check-in desk was expansive, and the lounge was in a very open and cozy area with modern furniture and smiling hotel staff everywhere. Everything reeks of upper-class service and quality. For some reason, the entire hotel seemed to be exceptionally quiet...muffled even. White noise perhaps?The room is typical Japanese...that is, small. For those used to living in large suite hotel rooms in the US, get ready for a shock. Needless to say, everything was spic and span clean, but the actual room was barely large enough to fit the furniture.The ""TV"" was really like a 21"" flat panel monitor from a computer. What was mildly irritating to me was the fact that virtually all the channels were Japanese. The only English channels were CNN International, CNBC i think and some various ones here and there. To make matters worse, they didn't compensate by offering much pay-per-view choices, nothing like the ones in the US. On the bright side, you could get quick previews of Japanese Adult Videos before they asked you to pay.The bathroom was immaculate with a toilet that required a computer science degree to fully enjoy if jets of water is your thing. Room service was pricey as to be expected. The food was quite good.The restaurants in the hotel were top notch and pretty expensive.The bathrooms in the lobby/lounge were, to quote my wife, ""the best bathrooms I've ever seen"". For a germophobe like me, Japanese bathrooms are heaven.Part of the Shiodome complex, the building is actually one of a few towering modern skyscrapers in the area. The immediate vicinity are mostly businesses. If you go down to the subway level, there is a 24-hour convenience store with all manners of goodies...definitely not the 7/11s...we're talking pretty darn good food. On the subway level are some restaurants open only during business hours for some good quick cheap bites. Further along there's a Starbucks and a bookstore/stationary store.The subway system is quite complex and not for the faint of heart. However, everything is laid out with a logic that the Japanese are known for. The actual subway lines to get to attractions in the city is about a 10 minute walk that takes you through the Shiodome complex and down a subway area.All in all, I'd stay at the Park Hotel again in a heartbeat. And at the deal rate we got ($118 US), it was unbeatable.","Orange County, California",77,4.0

Our experience with Park Hotel Tokyo is totally a disaster. We checked in around 9pm and found out that they didn't have the room we requested with king size bed, and the rate we got is for their standard room with queen size bed. This is just the beginning of 9 nights nightmare. After second night, we were finally told that we could stay at their standard room with queen size bed) or we have the option to pay more to get the room we requested, or we can check out and check in other hotel. The difference between the rate for their standard room and the room we requested is over $100/ per night. We couldn't figure out how the room rate could increase so much upon check-in (it should not have, we have the print out of the confirmation!!! The rate and room type request are all on it) Hotel insisted it is our travel agent's mistake and they spoke with our travel agent, and our travel agent confirmed it's misunderstanding (between? Hotel never clarified) We decided to stay at Park Hotel Tokyo and in the standard room AND not to waste our time finding out who screwed up our reservation because we just wanted to enjoy our vacation and didn't want to waste our time to pack up and move.The night before we checked out, we found out that our room rate is higher than what shown on our reservation confirmation. We were told that the rate we got is for one person and the new rate is for two people. My husband and I got so furious. Hotel has a copy of our reservation confirmation and it clearly states in the reservation the confirmed room rate and the number of guests staying at the room is two. We decided that we couldn’t let the hotel get away from changing room rate, so we requested the hotel staff to call our travel agent in front of us. After 1 hour long international phone call, the hotel agreed with AE travel agent and honored the rate. Will we stay at this hotel again? No!! To be fair, the location is good.

We stayed here 3 nights.The JR station is only about a 10 min walk, only the first time it's a little bit hard to find,but then it's easy. I disagree that the Tokyo metro is confusing. It's one of the easiest metro systems to use. We come from Helsinki with only 1 metro line and we didn't get lost one single time. Also we took a taxi from and to the Tokyo station (because of the luggage we had) and the bill was only about 1000 yen, which is really cheap. Overall we found Japanese taxi prices to be quite cheap in comparision to Finland. In general we haven't found Tokyo or Japan to be very expensive.There are many great restaurants near the hotel. The service was very good and the room perfect.We had a double room on the 34.floor (last floor) with a view of the Tokyo tower. The room was big enough and so was the bed (normal European size bed) and the bathroom (plenty of space for one person). Both hubby and I are medium built, and we had plenty of space in the bed. One would really need to be quite large to fall out of the bed or not to find enough space in the bathroom.Also the room wasnt noisy at all. The view is really spectacular and it's worth spending a few yen more to get a room with Tokyo tower view.Internet surfing is free. Also,all the hotel stuff spoke good English.Even using the hotel phone (which we had to do before our rented mobile arrived) wasn't too expensive.The area is within walking distance of Ginza.Ah yes,one receives also a free newspaper (in English) every morning.

The rooms are a very generous size (for Tokyo), and because it's in what is essentially a business district most day trips are against the flow of humanity. The staff have (so far) been very friendly and accommodating, and we're looking forward to the rest of our stay. Two small things do stand out about this place as problematic, however. Firstly, breakfast and room service are very expensive. Secondly, there are few truly local eateries. We've spent our dinners so far going down to Odaiba or closer in to town.

The best thing is, the hotel is located exactly outside the Shiodome Train Station, on Yurikamome line... which takes me directly to Tokyo Big Sight. Despite being so close to the train line, you can't hear anything (perhaps it's because the lobby is situated at the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower).

As others have noted, the location is excellent for public transport, including the Yurikomome monorail that goes out to the Odaiba waterfront area - a day ticket is well worth buying for 800 yen to hop on and off and explore this area (spectacular views back to the City at night, too).Many others have mentioned the 'small' rooms; we found our room perfectly adequate and, certainly, well designed - in fact, the whole hotel is stylish and comfortable. Breakfasts are easily bought from one of a number of coffee shops nearby and on our first night at the hotel, being pretty exhausted, we ate in the restaurant and did not consider our simple, but good, pasta dish too highly priced.As has been mentioned, the Limousine bus does not run to this hotel until around 2pm - on advice from the helpful staff at the Limousine counter, we took a bus to Tokyo Airport 'City' and then a taxi for the short distance to the hotel. The hotel concierge will book the return Limousine, store your luggage, if necessary, and deliver it to the bus for you.

Instead we got another bus to a nearby hotel and had the name of the Park Hotel written down in Japenese to show the taxi driver - this did not prevent him from taking us to two 'other' park hotels first.The hotel itself is new and located in the modern Shiodome complex. The entrance is on the ground floor but the hotel lobby is actually about 20 floors further up. The lobby / bar and reception do indeed give great views across the city.

We ate once at the hotel, for breakfast, and wouldn't recommend it. They only had pretty disgusting western buffet style stuff, no japanese breakfast, and it was overpriced. You don't need to rely on the hotel though because there are tons of restaurants within walking distance in all directions.There is nothing spectacular about the hotel itself, but for this price you wouldn't expect there to be.

The hotel is directly connected to the Shidome Subway stop which is on the Toei Oedo Line which my girlfriend and I found was an excellent starting point to go to the various neighbourhoods in Tokyo. Most sights are a maximum of one transfer away. A little further walk can get you to the Shimbashi Station and another metro line that is useful for taking you to other areas of Tokyo directly.The hotel is very modern in design and had a truly boutique feel about it. The view from the hotel lobby on the 25th floor is stunning and features an excellent view of the Tokyo Tower and Mt. Fuji. The check-in process is effortless and the staff is very accommodating and always provided quick and useful advice on issues ranging from restaraunt suggests to directions to timetable information for the Narita Express trains.The rooms are an adequate size and well furnished with a flat screen TV, a mini bar and an in room safe. The entire hotel is spotlessly celan. The bathroom is effecient and supplied with nice amenities such as toothbrushes, razors and soaps and shampoo.We ate in the asian themed restaraunt and it was good but quite expensive, especially when compared to the countless local restaraunts that are scattered through many of Tokyo's neighbourhoods.There is a convenience store in the basement of the building on the way to the subway that is open 24 hours. There is also a Starbuck's coffee shop and a variety of restaraunts in the basement of the building which looked good but we didn't have a chance to eat there. It looks like their hours are mostly oriented towards catering to the office workers lunches and dinners.As for booking, I found that the best rate was avaiable through Tablet Hotels but there was a service fee added to our bill which could have made it on par with booking directly through the hotel's website (to be honest I didn't look into whether it would be added by hotel as well). Regardless, my average rate was $200 Canadian which I think is reasonable for the quality of the hotel in Tokyo.I would stongly recommend this hotel to people looking for a stylish hotel in Tokyo at a resonable price. It is particularly attractive if you are unintimidated by using the subway which is, in my opinion, the best way to get around and to see Tokyo. Those used to the London or New York subways will have no trouble using the Tokyo transit system. In fact, it is the best marked system I have ever experienced. This is particularly true when paired with the Tokyo Handy Guide that the concierge (the woman that works there is excellent) gave us.I would definitely stay again at the Park Hotel Tokyo when I return to further explore the amazing city of Tokyo.","Toronto, Ontario",22,5.0

The view from the lobby is absolutely amazing and far outshines the views from Tokyo tower which we visited on one of our tours of the city. The rooms are clean and we felt more than large enough for a few nights stay. A large array of toiletries are provided as well as tea and coffee making facilities. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants, but there is ample choice of places to eat in the shopping mall which can be accessed from the ground floor of the hotel. Contrary to some other reviews on this hotel I would say that it is well placed for exploring Tokyo. We used the subway which was easy to find and navigate, although buying a ticket without the help of a friendly Japanese man who took pity on us would have proved difficult! I think the only small quibble we had was that we had problems getting to the hotel, as it was confused with the Tokyo Park hotel. However, after reading the reviews on this site before we left we were aware that this may happen and were eventually transported to the correct hotel!

I booked a small room (with double bed) for approximately 18,000 Yen (approximately US $160).Overall the rooms were very clean, excellent and cosy for one person (might be a tad cramp for two as the room is possibly the smallest I've every stayed in in Japan). View from hotel room is fantastic and a small bistro table is provided right next to the window so you get breathtaking view sipping coffee or having room service.In typical Japanese fashion, hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is within a 10-minute walking distance to the Ginza line which takes you straight to Shibuya within 15 mins if you need to go shopping.Only catch was, when I arrived at 8:30 pm, I'd missed the last airport bus to hotel (last bus at 7 pm I think) as it's not considered one of the major hotels with high traffic. So I had to take the airport bus to Tokyo Station and transfer to the hotel, that costs an additional 1500 Yen.I would definitely stay there again should the rates stay reasonable as my last trip.

I was really worried that at roughly $155 a night, the Park Hotel would be a dump. Boy, was I wrong. It is a sleek, modern, new, immaculately clean, trendy, and gorgeous hotel. Anything under $200 a night is a bargain in Tokyo and I can't imagine that there is a better bang for the buck anywhere in the entire city of Tokyo. The hotel is very close to one of the main subway lines and an easy 8-10 minute walk to Shimbashi station, which makes it a snap to get to all the other popular areas: Roppongi, Shinjuku, Meiji, Akihibara, Tokyo Station, and Shibuya. I can't emphasize enough how critical it is to choose a hotel that is close to a subway/train hub. This hotel is also within easy, easy walking distance to the Ginza and the Tsukiji fish market. Both of those are absolute must visits. By the way, the only reason to get to the Tsukiji fish market before 6:00 is if you want to see the actual auction process. I found the post-auction process the most interesting. Things like carving up the monster tunas, strolling the colorful seafood stalls, and watching the elaborate engine of sushi commerce in action. My advice is to sleep in a little and arrive around 7:00 AM instead. The only negative is the size of the room. They are indeed small. It was no problem for me because I was traveling by myself, but I the size would be a serious problem for anything more than 2 people. Don't bring a family here. The hotel restaurants are good but expensive. Take advantage of the Family Mart store in the basement. Family Mart is the 7-11 of Japan and has drinks, snacks, and cheap-but-delicious bento boxes to eat.

Conceige was helpful. They gave maps of subways, directions and recommended routes with options. (we should have utilized them more.) Would I stay here again - Yes. And the lobby, yes is very quiet, dragging your stuff on the nice wooden floor is not adviseable. Not the hotel for your if you're looking for cultural ambience scene. And you want to smooze with the locals.Room size was was great - premium room with seating. (paid 3,000 yen for extra bed.) They converted the seating to a fold out bed. (for my 13 yr old dau and her 12 yr girlfriend.)Toiletries includes -shampoo, conditioner, body gel, soap, razors, bath salt, wash scrub, q-tips, makeup cloth and nail file, toothbrush and paste, body lotion and a hairbrush. They have a blow dryer, pajamas, terry cloth robes, slippers, tv, nice room lighting, radio, tv (and lan available.) Bed was comfy, no tower view, but thats ok. I was more pleased with the room size. I've stayed at Shinjiku Washington Hotel - now that is small.Didnt get the pillow fitter service as raved in other reviews.They have excellent complementary coffee and tea for your morning dose.We didnt eat at any of the hotel restaurants or used the other hotel services.Recommendations: Check your bearing. We probably should have checked out the Carretta Bulding - several reviews indicated that there are shops and restaurants on 1st and basement floor. Japan has great food. Wish we had more. I kinda feel like I didnt eat as much as I should have. I notice the Via La France (which isnt too bad of a walk about 5 minutes. Shibashi station is another 7 minutes from there. We took JR to Akihabara - and that was another 3 minute from there. (in route we found a great food store - grocery, bentos, fine candies, cakes, all kinds of food things you could picked up.) Fine Foods Fair (I think was the name) We even went back the morning of the day we left.In the same building as Via La France - 2nd floor they have around 12 restaurants all in a row. I was told by hotel that the restaurants areon the 41 and 42 floor of that building. Usually last order for restaurants are around 9:30 pm so had to eat at the English Pub twice - and do the prime-rib thing. Prices is not as cheap as you'd like it to be, but not bad.We found the am/pm store and went there the first three nights - finally found the Family Mart store (yes, the Family Store is very close (just right out side the hotel.) Hotel has two elevators. If going the subway and trains easier to switch elevators on the 1st floor - security guard will help you. (they look stiff but very helpful. (the elevator is hidden behind a wall. (but thats your ticket to get below ground level.Did a walk to Ginza from the Park Hotel. With baby and stroller.

The hotel is very clean and modern. The lobby is on the 30-somethingth floor of an office building, which makes for some really awesome views of Tokyo, though lots of long elevator rides. The rooms, though VERY small, were incredibly clean and had large windows with great views (ours was looking out over the park). And though the room is small, you have everything you need - including filtered coffee, which very much impressed my boyfriend. One of the biggest reasons we booked the Park Hotel was for its location right over Shinjuku station on the JR loop line. And though it is connected via underground tunnels, they are very confusing at first and it is quite a trek to make a couple times a day. Probably about 20 minutes from station to hotel lobby. Also, don't try to use the tunnels late at night (after the last train) because we almost got locked in! Going above ground is not very easy to do either - our first morning when we ventured out to try to find the fish market, we couldn't even go a block without street construction or dead ends stopping us in our tracks. Eventually we discovered the extensive network of over-street passageways you had to use to get anywhere, but it was not easy to figure out in our jet-lagged state. We were always starving in the morning, so opted for the very pricey but filling buffet in the lobby. Basically we stuffed ourselves silly at 8 am and ate lightly on ramen, etc the rest of the day.The staff at the hotel was pretty helpful. They spoke English and tried to help us when we were lost a few times.The Park Hotel was one of the least expensive hotels we stayed at in our 2 week trip and also one of the best.

This could prove a bit of a nuisance for business travellers. But, at the price, it is extremely good value, particularly for tourists to the city.The public spaces of the hotel are beautiful... all dark wood and understated lighting, although, as someone else has alluded to, this does mean it feels rather like an exhibition space to be crept around, rather than somewhere to drag trolley cases across or to drop umbrellas - a bit of a victory for form over functionThe standard room size is not particularly generous, but they do seem to have been laid-out to make the best possible use of the available space. The bed was extremely comfortable, which proved a great help in easing out the jet lag - the hotel is justly proud of its custom-made pillows! The lighting control also makes it easy to create a relaxing environment.There's certainly no danger of getting lost in the bathroom, but, again, the use of space has been well thought out and all the usual facilities were well up to scratch, plus everything you could need by way of complimentary toileteries. When booking, it's worth specifying that you'd like a room on the Tokyo Tower side. Given the hotel occupies the upper floors of a lofty office tower, the view is absolutely stunning, especially at night. There is some noise from the Shinkansen tracks that run by the base of the tower, but this is little more than a gentle rumble.The staff, while friendly and polite, are also refreshingly unobtrusive... none of the cloying over-attentiveness of the big hotel chains. While Shiodome could hardly be described as the most charming corner of Tokyo, it is very well connected - nearby Shimbashi station is on the JR Yamanote, which loops around the central areas of the city (and to Tokyo central station, in 4mins), plus there are a couple of subway lines that link up to some of the main tourist destinations. The third floor exit from the building takes you on to an elevated walkway where everything is clearly signposted in English. It's easy enough to reach places like Ginza by foot, and Tsukiji fish market is just 15mins walk away - great if you decide to make the early start to watch the auctions. The Hama Rikyu garden provides a counter to the steel-and-glass sterility of the rest of the area. All-in-all, a great value, good-looking hotel.","London, England",11,4.0

The French Restaurant, run by chef Teteru Yoshino, deserves a mention. I entertained 5 Japanese businessmen here and the staff were very helpful in setting it up, providing special menus, etc. The food is good french 'nouvelle cuisine' - beware, the portion sizes are quite small so I think my Japanese colleagues felt a bit short-changed and ate lots of bread.

We generally agree with the positive reviews. High quality room (not large but this is Japan), and we had great city views of the Tokyo Tower and surroundings from the 28th floor. Found a very high level of service from greeting us at ground level and taking us to check in on the 25th floor. Staff at desk had fluent English. The room has nice amenities, and as said by others nice to get an English newspaper (International Herald Tribune combined with English version of Asahi Shimbun.) We booked over the internet for 17500 yen per night, not particularly cheap but not bad for Tokyo.It is a bit confusing to find (especially at ground level) because of construction right now, and it is across from the somewhat similarly named Royal Park Hotel. Like others we had some trouble navigating at first until we found that if you exit at the 3rd floor, you can exit turning left to reach an upper level walkway that takes you past the Royal Park on your right, then you turn left to reach Shimbashi station which has the Yamanote rail and Ginza subway lines. If you take the escalator down near the Royal Park there are restaurants and shopping. Also on the 3rd level if you go right past the new yurakicho sky train station you reach the Pedi Shiodome which has some very nice restaurants and coffee shops which we frequented. We also ate in the underground by Shimbashi station. We did not eat in the hotel, though on the ground level there is nice cafe, Cafe Des Artes.We have stayed at Keio Plaza in Shinjuku previously and the ANA in Roppongi. While the ANA is a superior hotel, we found the Park to be good value for the money. Unlike another reviewer we did mind being a little out of the action, and having a bit of a quiet retreat in a smaller more boutique like hotel. We would happily stay there again.","Kailua, Hawaii",58,4.0

As other reviews note, it can be difficult to find if arriving by cab (the roads are very complex and under construction) or by train (the train station/office complex is huge). Best bet for arrival is by limousine bus from the airport.The entire hotel, from lobby to restaurants to guest rooms and bathrooms is beautiful and immaculately clean. It no doubt helps that the hotel is only 3 years old. The rooms are well designed and quiet, and have especially nice attention to amenities in the bathrooms. Beds were very comfortable and there is excellent attention to lighting control in the rooms.The location in the Shiodome area is very convenient for easy transportation to almost everything in Tokyo (or outside Tokyo, for that matter). The hotel connects directly to the Shiodome station for Toei (newer, private) subway line and the Yurikomome elevated train to Odaiba; and it is a 10 minute enclosed walk to the Shimbashi station for Tokyo Metro subway and JR station (Yamanote line as well as several other lines, e.g., to Kamakura). It's only a few minutes by train to Tokyo station for the bullet train. As others have mentioned, it's also about a 15 minute walk to Ginza, Tsukiji fish market, etc.The downside of the location is that taking a cab to the hotel is quite difficult. It's essential to pick up one of their map cards to show the driver. Also, the Shiodome complex is sterile -- full of office buildings and chain stores. Although the enclosed nature of it is convenient when hot or rainy, it can also be claustrophobic, like living in a shopping mall.You may be wondering: why is the hotel so much less expensive than other top hotels in Tokyo, especially since it is new and beautiful? I think there are two reasons: the rooms are relatively small for a luxury hotel, and the hotel provides relatively few services, compared to 5-star hotels. The regular rooms with king bed allow very little room apart from the bed. I stayed in an upgrade corner room which had a separate small sitting area, but it was still fairly crowded, even for just one person. It would be fine for two people, but would probably feel quite small if a child were added (and would be impossible for more than 3). On the other hand, you're likely not to spend a lot of time in the room anyway. One thing to remember, though, is that extra room is very nice when one or more family members suffers jet lag and wakes at 4:00am.As for services, there are many things the hotel does not have: a fitness center, a pool, business services (apart from a couple of computers), a variety of restaurants (only two), etc. Those things are probably of main concern to business travelers. For instance, I needed to make more business cards, which they could not do, unlike other hotels I've visited in Tokyo.Finally, the open atrium style architecture of the hotel (a 10-story high open central space) is dramatic and lovely, but it has a drawback -- one feels as if ""on display"". Eating at the main breakfast area in the lobby, one sits at the bottom of the open area. All sounds are magnified by the echo chamber effect and the hard wooden floors. I felt like I should not talk (it echoes all over) and must walk quietly. When I dropped an umbrella, it resounded loudly throughout the restaurant area. (FWIW, a better place to sit for breakfast is in one of the side rooms, which also have views). So it definitely could feel awkward coming or going through the lobby with boisterous children.In short, is it a good deal? Absolutely. Is it a good location? Yes, very much, as long as you get out of the Shiodome complex. If traveling alone, I'd be happy to stay there again. However, it is not really fair (or the intention of the hotel) to be compared against five star hotels with complete range of services and spacious rooms.","Seattle, WA",85,4.0

The staff were always keen to help and spoke good english, which helped us. The meals are a little pricey, but there is a good selection including French, English and Japanese. Rooms are a good size and kept immaculate - the heated toilet seat in the bathroom is a bonus. Most nights had live music in the atrium, mainly Jazz and Blues with a mixture of Japanese and Western muscians playing and singing to a very high standard.

The hotel is in a great location, only a short walk to Ginza, a great shopping district. The shops were a little out of my league (Prada, Salavatore Ferragamo, Ralph Lauren) but most people just enjoying walking up and down the street.It's also very close to Shiodome and Shimbashi metro station which can easily be reached by an underground, very clean, well-lit walk way. The metro was quite easy to tackle as the ticket machines have an english function, so working out how much to pay for a day trip or single journey on the metro is quite easy.The room was fantastic, I was worried it would be small, but I would say it was average size for a western hotel room. There were fabulous shampoos, conditioners and body lotions provided - they smelt divine - and didn't leave skin dry like some hotel creams/shower gels can. The shower was great, bed was very comfy and they had fab toilet with all of the japanese mod cons!!! - It would wash your bum and heat the seat for you!!We had 3 great nights in Japan and I would love to stay at this hotel again.

I booked directly through the hotel's website and paid around £80 a nights. The room was fairly large and had a great view of the water and surrounding skyscrapers. Decor was modern and everything was top quality and up to 4* standard.The transport links are also very good. Shimbashi station (on the Yamanote line is about 10 mins walk away through underground tunnels and Shiodome station is a few hundred metres away. The hotel is a short cab ride from Tokyo station with the Narita express out to the airport.The downside for me is that the hotel is in a characterless (although upmarket) business district. Reception is on the 25th floor of an office building. In the evening the ground level is totally deserted except for a roving security guard and did not feel at all welcoming. The lobby itself had no atmosphere and at 11pm on a saturday there were just 4 people in the lobby bar. Under the hotel are long spotlessly clean underground passages leading to the subway. Very few people around at night. It feels totally safe, but a bit isolated. If you want somewhere to escape all the hustle and bustle of Tokyo then this is fine.

As I pen this using the complimentary Internet hook-up in my room, I am just wrapping up my second stay this month (this time on business). Excellent value for money. Shimbashi station is about a 10-minute walk (15 minutes when stopping at Starbucks ;), while the Oedo subway line - which I've used several times to get to such places as Roppongi - is accessible through the one hotel elevator that descends to B1 (basement 1). (The hotel has four elevators; the one on the right side, farthest from the reception desk, is the one to take to B1.) You exit into an underground hallway with restaurants; go straight out and through a revolving door, and you'll see a Family Mart convenience store on your right. Keep going, and you'll exit into an underground pedestrian walkway. Look for signs that will direct you to the Oedo line. One trick to get back to the hotel using the same underground access is to follow exits 7 and 8 from the Oedo line exit....you come out of the subway area, take a sharp right and go up an escalator. The Park Hotel Tokyo entrance is up ahead on your right (turn left and through the sliding glass doors for Starbuck's, Mailboxes Etc., convenience store with water, etc.)When my husband and I arrived for our first stay in early October, we were intent on walking to the hotel from Shimbashi station using the hotel's on-line map that I'd printed. We failed miserably - and we laughed when I remembered the one reviewer who said he is a savvy traveler (as are we) and his best advice was to take a taxi. We solved the problem later! When reading maps conveniently posted all around Japan, be sure to look for the symbol that denotes which direction is ""north."" Turns out that maps on display here are oriented in the direction you are facing! And the map we'd consulted in Shimbashi station had North pointing down.Incidentally, my colleague reports that the Business Center on the main floor by the reception has two computers connected to the Internet with free access and printing.We bought breakfast items in a convenience store instead of having the hotel breakfast. When we asked for bowls/spoons for our cereal, they were promptly delivered to our rooms.Also, if you like to exercise, this hotel doesn't have a fitness center. The front desk has a 1-mile-circuit jogging map, though. It's a simple, ""rectangular"" route. I would have preferred a fitness center, but the difference in room rates for another, untested hotel would likely not have been worth one.Also, when we asked the front desk personnel to help us plan how to arrive at our various meetings this week, they were more than helpful, showing us on a subway map which lines to use, etc.","Excelsior, Minnesota",143,5.0

It was super-clean and had FREE high-speed Internet access. Also, the room and the hotel, in general, were super-quiet; even the elevators were silent.Friendly Staff: The hotel staff were some of the most friendly and helpful people we have ever encountered at a hotel anywhere. One evening I called housekeeping to request an ironing board; no sooner had I put down the phone, then the doorbell rang. The front desk and concierge made restaurant reservations for us, and provided us with maps. The hotel kept our bags over the weekend, when we took a side-trip outside of Tokyo. Everyone at the hotel understands and speaks English.Location: We thought the location was really convenient. I actually appreciated that the hotel was in an office district and was removed from the bustling shopping and entertainment districts; it was a nice refuge at the end of long day of shopping and sight-seeing. There is a convenient underground concourse that connects the hotel to the Shimbashi train/metro station; it is about a 15 minute walk from your room to the station, and you never have to go outside. From Shimbashi, you are just two stops from Tokyo Station, which is the main Japan-Rail hub for the bullet trains. Directly beneath the hotel is the Shiodome metro station. This stop is on the Oedo line, which also has stops at Roppongi and Shinjuku; you don’t even have to change trains.Getting to/from Narita: You can take the Japan Rail train from Narita to Tokyo station; then take the JR line to Shimbashi station. If you’re adventurous and don’t’ have a lot of luggage you can try to navigate the underground concourse to Shiodome Media Tower; just keep looking for the yellow and black English signs that will point you in the correct direction.Food: We took the advice of other reviewers and grabbed croissants and yoghurt for breakfast at the French-themed bakery (I can’t recall the name.) in one of the nearby office-tower concourses. There was also a Starbucks close by (I think it was in the same building.).Fish Market: You must visit the fish market, and you must do so before 7 a.m.! You can indeed walk to the fish market in about 15 minutes with a good map.

We walked to Tsukiji, the Ginza and being too ambitious our first day on Tokyo, the East Garden (meaning we passed out at 1800hours and woke up again at 0300hrs...so much for correcting jetlag our first day!)The attributes of the room; The bathroom had a dimmer switch, great and generously provided ""Thann"" amenities (very much like Molton Brown) and powerful shower pressure. Room temperature adjusted quickly, pillows were a mix of Barley-filled pillows and feather pillows, the bed was really comfortable although unlike other Japanese hotel stays, we received a hospital-style nightgown and not a Takata (we prefer Takatas). The Park was only hotel on our visit to Japan to provide complimentary coffee. Honor bar was reasonably priced and a morning English paper provided. I found the room size efficient and comfortable (size is much like staying in established classic European hotels), but I will say the design lends to business travel, so we had little drawer space for our folded clothes.

In other hotels you bang your knees on the desk getting off the bed! Yes, it is clean and modern. For those wanting more of a ""Japan"" feel then stay in ryokan. For people not used to walking then the 5 minute walk to Shimbashi station may seem like a lot. However, for Tokyo it is an excellent and close location. There are restaurants all around the hotel in the other buildings. I did not eat the breakfast at the hotel. I prefered simple sandwich from the Vie La France bakery a short walk away. There is also a delicious onigiri (rice ball) restaurant in the Caretta building. Also in the Caretta building there is a famous Taiwanese dumpling restaurant.

Front desk was rude when we tried to check in early. They wouldnt let us check in early and at the same time they didnt offer to even store our bags temporarily while we went sightseeing. The concierge had very few recommendations and initially only gave us a map to get to the subway station from the hotel, we had to press her to get even a city map. Rooms were small, but fairly clean. There was lots of construction around the hotel, so it was difficult for taxis to get in and out. The subway station is actually about 15 mins walk, and then a 15-20min ride to shibuya, shinjuku, and other popular destinations, so it wasnt an ideal location (thought itd be closer to the action). Also thought the hotel being at top of tower would be interesting, but there are only a couple elevators so you have to wait to get into the hotel section (25 floors up), so there was some inconvience. Would never stay here again based on service and location.",San Francisco,43,1.0

The first few days I wasn't the happiest with the room as side of the bed was against the wall and the room was tiny. I really didn't see what the fuss was about that I'd read here on Trip Advisor. I then went to Kyoto for a few days and decided that when I returned to Tokyo I'd stay at the hotel again as they offered to keep my luggage so I would only have to bring a small bag to Kyoto with me. When I returned the room they gave me stank of fish (really strong) so when the bellman came to deliver the bags I asked him to step into the room and see if he got the smell. He immedately rang downstairs and came up with another room key. This room was gorgoeus and I'm gutted I didn't ask for a room like this the first time. There was more space and the bed was in the centre of the room and the view of the Tokyo tower was amazing. I have to say that staying in that room completely changed my opininon of the hotel. My advice....if you're booking a normal room then ask for the room I was in which was 3306. If they put you in a smaller room then ask to be changed. It's worth it.Of course I'll also say what everyone else is saying....it was great location because of the subway and trains underneath.

We had a great view on the 33rd floor overlooking Tokyo Tower and part of the Bay. The water pressure from the shower was excellent. The one minor negative observation we had about the hotel was the lack of warmth. Everytime we walked through the lobby, it felt as if we were in a library and had to keep our voices hushed.

We like something a little less opulent and flashy, yet we are very picky on hotels, and this met or exceeded our expectations in every way. I would request a room on a corner, since you get 5 windows instead of 2, and the views are amazing. One night we got a fireworks display thrown in, and what a spectacle it was. The staff were very attentive, and the rooms seemed to be made up as soon as you left , no matter whether you slept in or rose early. Simply, this was one of the best hotel values I have seen in the world, especially knowing how expensive Tokyo is. We booked ahead and paid around 20,000 yen per room per night including all taxes.

We could not have had a better experience.

The price of the room was very good, better than other comparable hotels. Our friends stayed at the much pricier Conrad Hotel next door, and although it was a good experience it was 4 times the price. We also loved the design of the hotel - it was very modern, without being cold. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It is close to a local subway, and more importantly it is close (3 minute walk) to the JR Yamanote Line. It is very important to be on the JR Yamamote line because it is the ""express"" train that runs in a circle around the heart of Tokyo stopping in all the best neighborhoods (Shibuya, Shinjuku). The Yamanote also gets you to the bigger train stations such as Tokyo Station, where you catch the bullet trains, etc. to quickly get in and out of the city.

No bows, no greetings, and no help with the bags. I guess many gaijin prefer this treatment, but why come to Japan if you want New York. The room was quiet with a nice view and lots of amenities typical of Tokyo hotels (toothbrush, hair brush, shampoo, razor, morning newspaper, minibar, tea and coffee). The furniture and rug were spotted with stains. The room safe was too small for a 12"" laptop. It seemed the hotel guests were mostly foreigners.

We stayed at two different hotels because we bookended Tokyo stays with a five-day trip to Osaka and Kyoto. Our bifurcated itinerary enabled us to visit sights near our hotels (Shibuya, Harajuku, and Shinjuku while at the Cerulean; and Asakusa, Imperial Palace and Tsukiji while at the Park) without spending time and money travelling around Tokyo. Even though Tokyo has an excellent transportation network, getting from Point A to Point B can still be quite time-consuming.As far as the Park Hotel is concerned, we had a lovely corner room with a stunning view of Tokyo Tower. Though not overly large, our room was very well-designed and fully-equiped with LCD-TV, mini-bar and, best of all, free high-speed internet. Our bath was spacious and was stocked with a full array of amenities. Service from every hotel employee was gracious and polite. And, location-wise, the hotel is about a seven-minute walk from the Shibuya station on the JR Yamanote line.One tip: We did not think the 2200 Yen cost for the Park Hotel's breakfast was worth the price (the Cerulean's breakfast offerings were far superior), so we decided to eat breakfast at the nearby Conrad. We agree with other posters that the Conrad is a spectacular hotel visually and will only add that its breakfast is also superb.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms are small, but not ridiculously so (I've been in smaller), and are nicely furnished so they feel clean and bright.Location: this hotel is in the SE quadrant of the city of Tokyo, within walking distance of Ginza. It's located in the Shiodome Media Tower, which is right above Shiodome Station (about a 5 minute walk); from this station you can access the Oedo line (which sort of does a loop around the city) and the new Yurikamome line, which offers a direct route to Odaiba (I recommend riding this route even if you don't plan on exploring Odaiba, just for the fabulous view you get while crossing the Rainbow Bridge). If you walk another 5 minutes from this station, you can get to Shimbashi Station, which serves the Asakusa and Ginza lines but also the JR Yamanote line, which is the one you can ride without buying a ticket if you've got one of those Japan Rail passes. Riding from here to the trendy areas of Shibuya/Harajuku/Shinjuku via JR takes about 20-30 minutes, though it never feels that long when there's so much to observe! Shimbashi Station is also just two stops away from Tokyo Station, which is the major hub for bullet trains or trains that take you on day trips to places such as Kamakura. I could go on but the main point here is that the hotel is conveniently located.There are places to eat in the hotel, of course, but there are also a bunch of restaurants in nearby Carretta Tower and also the tower right next door (the name escapes me at the moment). Numerous coffee shops are nearby (including Starbucks, if you need it! - one in the train station and one in the tower next door), as are convenience stores (including 7-11).

The downsides are 1) everyone from taxi drivers to long-time Tokyo residents confuse it with the Royal Park Shiodome, located across the street, 2) the single rooms are a bit small, so it pays to upgrade to a slightly larger room if within your budget, and 3) shiodome has many great restaurants in the skyscraper buildings, but it is a bit outside the happening central areas of Tokyo. Unless you are comfortable taking the subway (Toei-oedo line is at your doorstep), you'll be taking cabs everywhere. Shiodome is not too far from Roppongi/Akasaka/Aoyama/Daikanyama to make this impractical, but it can be costly and time consuming. That said, this is one of my favorite hotels in Tokyo, and I give it the highest rating with the above provisos.",Tokyo,12,5.0

We loved the Park Hotel, although as noted in other reviews, the Shidome area was a bit sterile after the lights and action of Roppongi. An easy walk to the Tsukigi fish markets, the Hamarikyu gardens and Ginza and an easy tube up to Ueno park, Akihabara and Asakusa. But the whole walkway above street level among the huge skyscrapers was a bit strange. Have you seen Bladerunner ? The monorail (Yurikamome) out to the Oedo Onsen Monogatori (hot baths) is worth doing as well - the station is just next to the hotel.As for the hotel, we had a standard double room and had no concerns with size (maybe that is a whole US pre-occupation). Very clean, robes, LCD TV with BBC in English, minibar, in-room safe, toiletries and everthing you could wish for. A heated toilet seat but unlike the B Roppongi, no beer dispensing machine on each floor !! The city view from our room on level 32 was simply spectacular. The staff were excellent, spoke better English than I did, and were extremely helpful. Very good knowledge of the local area which is important. They also allowed us to check-in early and had a room for us at 11am which was great.We didn't eat at any of the three restaurants in the Hotel, but there are plenty of good eating options in the nearby Cabretta Mall and for very reasonable prices. Nearby Ginza has plenty of more sophisticated restaurants and bars but be warned, we couldn't find a bar with a happy hour and had to get up and leave one jazz bar after finding out a single beer was going to cost Y2000.Would definately stay again and it was a very nice hotel.

The lobby was very nice and although we never sat to listen, they have jazz bands at night for entertainment. The staff was very helpful, although we had to wait a long time for the concierge one day. They finally had someone else help us, but her English was not very good. The manager did check on our way out that she had given us the correct directions to our destination. They made dinner reservations several times for us. We loved the free business center where there were two computers to check/send email. The view from behind the check in desk of Tokyo Tower and the city was truly amazing. We saw Mt. Fuji twice, which we couldn't believe. This hotel caters to westerners, more than Japanese it seemed. It is hard to find at first if you arrive on the train at Tokyo Station, but once you figure out where to go, it's very convenient. We loved the whole underground area that connects to Shimbashi Station on the JR Yamanote line and the Ginza subway line. We ate breakfast in the Vie de France bakery every day rather than paying the high prices for the hotel's breakfast buffet. The pastries were very good and I loved the kiwi banana soymilk smoothies. We thought having a subway station below the hotel would be convenient, but we never ended up using the Oedo line. It just didn't go to any of the areas we wanted to visit. The room was very clean and modern, and as everyone else has said, small. There was enough room for two of us though, and for the price (we booked on Expedia for $180 per night) it was well worth it. The water pressure was very strong and we loved the heated toilet seat. The provided toiletries were of high quality also. We had a wonderful view of Hama Rikyu gardens and the water. It was also a very quiet hotel, we never heard any noise when we were in our room. We liked the location of the hotel (I know there's been mixed reviews on this). It's proximity to the JR Yamanote line was perfect as we preferred to take that rather than the subway because it was free with our JR rail passes. It's also perfect if you plan to visit the Tsukiji fish market and Hama Rikyu Gardens, which we did on our first morning. The above ground walkways and underground malls and restaurants in all the surrounding buildings seemed exactly what this futuristic city should be like. If you wanted nightlife it's a short walk to Ginza or short train ride to any area in Tokyo. We never took a cab so we didn't have the trouble of the driver not being able to find it. Shiodome really is a whole city within the city. We would definitely stay here again.","Glen Ellyn, Illinois",34,4.0

Small flatscreen TV, a good bathroom with great toiletries, filter coffee, yukata etc.When i left this morning, the concierge took my bag, brought coffee down to the waiting area whilst I waited for the bus to Narita, and gave out umbrellas to a couple of tourists who were likely to get wet! Needless to say, both the level of service and indeed the level of english is quite good (for Japan).As for the location, it is a bit sterile, but i got used to it.

Perfect hotel for high end shopping and back to hotel again.Once you find the hotel it is easy to find your way around. (initially finding it was impossible for me.)If you choose this hotel here is the best way to find it:Take JR express to Tokyo Station. Take subway to Shimbashi station (only two stops away). Exit Shimbashi station and get a cab with the print out of directions from Park Hotel's website). The cab ride was only 660 yen (about six bucks and well worth it). I am a pretty sauvy travler and could not find the hotel on my own. Once you know where it is it is easy to head out and find your way back.If you don't only shop on Ginza it is a short and easy subway ride to anywhere else.Booking your room on their website is the cheapest option.,"Carlsbad, California",10,5.0

It was a good choice. Shinjuku has always been our choice of area for Tokyo visits, this time I decided to try elsewhere. Not disappointed at all. Like most have said, the area is ultra modern, very clean, sleek, and Shiodome area is very business like, and like a small city itself.I found the location to be perfect. It was easy access to everywhere. It's actually next to Ginza. So how much more convenient can it get? going to the fish market for breakfast, and Starbucks just across the basement of the hotel.The staff is the best I have every encountered. Excellent english, and very helpful concierge. Each time we asked for directions to somewhere, they would print out the map, and exact directions for us. Subway map, hotel map provided. The most impressive was, when we got back from our trip to Nikko, we needed to repack our luggage before going to the airport. The Hotel was kind enough to give us a spare room to do this instead of having me to do it in the lobby. It was very generous of them. We already checked out the day before. They stored our luggage, and provided this service of bringing our stored luggage upstairs for us to reorganize, and then had a bellboy help us bring back all the luggage after we were finished.This was very helpful, especially because I was travelling with a toddler.The hotel is very catered to Business travellers, but we were treated with perfect service and attitude even with a young child.The Japanese restaurant was excellent.All in all, I was very happy with our choice.

The water in the bathroom gets hot immediately and the water pressure is fantastic. The views from the room--we had views towards the bay, not the city--were quite nice.Location: When you first arrive at the hotel, the area seems a bit corporate, a bit bleak. Once you get used to using the skybridge, which is connected to the hotel at the third floor, you realize that the area, Shiodome, is actually a little city, just three blocks above of the street. Not only that, once you venture from the hotel at ground level, you realize how well-located the Park Hotel actually is. It's a 10 minute walk from the Tsujiki Fish market, 5 minutes from the Hama Rikyu Gardens, 15 minutes from Ginza, and located on top of a subway line and 5 minutes from the JR line. All in all, the location was very, very good. We liked the Shiodome area itself because it looked like how we imagined Tokyo to be before arriving--clean, hyper-modern, and hyper-efficient.Service: The service here--with all the graciousness the Japanese are famous for--was really first class. Each staff member we encountered was very helpful--they assisted us in mailing letters, getting train reservations, and the like. The staff are everywhere and always willing to help.Overall: This is a new hotel in a developing, very modern area.

While we were pleased with the hotel itself, we felt disappointed with its location and would not stay there again. The hotel is in a high-rise building which sits amidst a small cluster of skyscrapers in the relatively deserted Shiodome area of Tokyo. The area surrounding the skyscrapers is a gigantic construction site which has obliterated most all of the sidewalks. There is no street life whatsoever -- if you have the urge to walk around the neighborhood, get a bite to eat or people watch (as we wanted to do), there is nothing to see & nowhere to go except the confusing, identical underground passageways that link the buildings. On the positive side. the hotel is within walking distance (20-30 minutes) of the Ginza district, Tsjuki Fish Market and the beautiful Hama Rikyu Gardens. However, no taxi drivers or tour guides know about the hotel yet and it was difficult to find our way back when we took cabs. It also didn't help that right next door to the Park Hotel's location in the Shiodome Media Tower is the ROYAL Park Hotel located in the Shiodome Tower. Confusing! The hotel's rooms are well-appointed with a very modern, sleek style that is quite nice. The staff was helpful.

The room I got was really small, even for Tokyo standards...having said that, I did book a standard double. The room was OK, but I would not call it a luxury hotel room (I also stayed at the Granvia in Kyoto which was). Check in was easy. My largest complaint was at check out, where at 6 in the morning there was a line of 3, and only one person behind the desk. I was asked to sit and wait. Soon the person behind the desk left. Finally someone from the back came out to deal with the next customer. He had an issue of thinking he pre-paid, and didnt want to pay again... so that went on and on. It wasnt until I complained to the Bell person that she fished someone else out of the office to check me out. Ahotel like this (which gets the #1 ranking) shouldnt let customers wait like that.

Ask at the tour desk for their recommendation of a sushi restaurant down near the fish market. A short walk and worthwhile adventure. The temple beside Tokyo Tower was also well worth visiting.

The staff were friendly and helpful and it was enjoyable sitting in the bar listening to the jazz trio of an evening. We also found the location of the hotel very useful. If arriving on the Narita Express, it is only a 1440 Yen taxi ride away from the Tokyo Station and the train links near the hotel make it very easy to get around. There are also shops nearby from a local convenience store in the basement to bars and restaurants in the Pedi Shiodome complex which is linked to the hotel by a walkway.

We chose this hotel because of all the good reviews on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately, we were not as pleased by our visit. First and foremost, I must admit that the hotel staff is wonderful. They are incredibly helpful, and they speak English very well.That said, there were certainly a few concerns that will prevent us from ever returning to this hotel. The hotel rooms were tiny, even by Tokyo standards. But that was not our main dilemma. Our biggest complaint was that the bathrooms smelled very strongly of urine! Although the rooms looked clean, the bathrooms always smelled bad. We thought perhaps this was a fluke, so we moved into another room. The bathroom smelled of urine there too. In fact, we stayed in 3 different rooms at this hotel and found that they all had stinky bathrooms. We were very unhappy.Otherwise, the hotel is in a very convenient location with access to both the Japan railway and the subways. The hotel lounge offers live jazz on some days of the week, which is also very nice. If not for the horrible smell of the bathrooms, I would have given this hotel a better review.",Minnesota,5,2.0

My partner and Ihave just visited Tokyo for the first time as part of our honeymoon trip and we trusted the reviews on tripadvisor and decided not to spend on the Park Hyatt but booked the Park Hotel. This was taking a chance as we are used to 5 star travelling and are very fussy when it comes to accommodation. We made the right decision. The hotel is directly cconnected to the skyrail and to the metro so it couldn't be easier to get around the city. Also, it is a 5 minute walk to Ginza which we think was one of the nicest parts of the city. Much better than Shinjuku which is covered with MacDonalds! The service in the hotel was freindly and very efficient. One night we ordered room service at 3am and it arrived within 5 minutes. The reception staff couldn't be more helpful (they made reservations, posted our mail, provided us with the best guides to the city). The hotel itself is very stylish and modern but the best thing about it is that it is very much Japanese. This is something that we were worried about missing if we booked with a big chain like the Hyatt which has very American style surroundings. The rooms are comfortable with great amenities (trea, coffee, nice cosmetics, etc.) and the views of the city are unbelievable. This hotel is very close to being a 5 star.

We attemped to find a hotel that was somewhat nice, but would not break the bank.The Park Hotel did not let us down! We paid about $190 per night, and booked our room online, at Travelocity.com. Most of the other rooms we were interested in were well over $250 a night, so we were surprised to find such a bargain.The lobby of the hotel is located on the 25th floor of the tower, and immediately we were impressed with beautiful views of the city and Tokyo Tower. The lounge area and bar off of the lobby, were immaculate and uber-classy. This was a perfect place to have an evening cocktail, or to listen to the lounge singer that performs on Friday nights.The rooms were on the small side, as are most rooms in Japan! We had a queen-sized bed, that came equipped with a cozy down comforter. The toilet sported a seat-warmer and a bidet..something I could get used to at home! We each received a pair of slippers and a Japanese-style robe, which were nice for lounging around after a shower or bath. The hotel also offers a ""Pillow Fitting Service"", where a consultant finds the perfect pillow for you, to make sure you get a great night's sleep! Only in Japan!Before we would head out for the day, we took advantage of the hot water kettle, and made ourselves cups of complimentary tea and coffee. It sure beat having to pay for room service!We didn't try the restaurant or room service during our stay, but ate several great meals at the Caretta Mall, which is directly across the street. There is everything there from high-end dining to Mc Donald's and 7-11! The Shiodome area where the Park Hotel resides, is still being developed, and seems to be less crowded than other areas in Tokyo. It was a nice quiet place to return to after a long day of sightseeing. The JR Shimbashi station is a few minute walk from the hotel, so it was very for easy to use public transportation. It is also in walking-distance from the Tsukiji fish market, which is a definite highlight in Tokyo. If you visit, you MUST GO TO TSUKIJI!All in all, our stay was wonderful, and the staff was friendly and courteous. They made us feel welcome from the moment we entered to the minute we checked out.

The service here was especially gracious, even by Tokyo standards. A trainee bellboy, Nobuna, went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable in our room and repeatedly brought us various panphlets and maps full of activitiy and restaurant suggestions. He made our initial impression of the hotel that much better.The hotel's location is quite convenient, in Shiodome, a modern, up and coming area of Tokyo. We took the Yurikamome monorail line to Shiodome and wondered if we would need to take a taxi to the hotel. Much to our surprise, as soon as we stepped on the very convenient elevated pedestrian walkway, there were signs for the Park Hotel. There is also convenient underground access (about 7-10 min walking) to JR Shimbashi station and the Ginza and Hibya Metro lines.I am usually not a fan of open atrium style hotels, but the Park Hotel's design is very striking. The atrium gives one a sense of space that is hard to come by in Tokyo. Also, the lobby doubles as a lounge area and gives the hotel a sense of intimacy and activity while still maintaining that spacious feeling.Check-in was no problem and our room, while not large, was very attractively furnished with a full view of the Tokyo Tower. The 28th floor offered a perfect view of the Tokyo cityscape, perhaps even better than our 45th floor view from the Park Hyatt. Being at that level allowed one to look out to the cityscape, rather than down to it.","Oakland, California",55,4.0

Also, perfect area for someone who is handicapped, since so much of Japan is hard to get around. We also we able to connect easily with many subway lines from all of the stations right next to the hotel.Another thing that we liked was this hotel rounded out our stay in different types of Japanese hotels- this was the modern one- we also stayed in Historic traditional and business hotels.On the downside, the hallways seem to be slightly threadbare ( SLIGHTLY!) and we had a view of buildings from our room- not the "" on a clear day you can see Mt Fuji"" that so many other hotels claim.

The lobby was gorgeous, the staff extremely sharp, and everything was in place. If you're looking to hit the Tsukiji market first thing, this hotel is an easy walk to the auctions.I would definitely say that this hotel is a rising star in Tokyo - once the Shiodome area comes into it's own and the construction is done.

Without doubt we can add to those as this was a superb place to stay and we would recommend it to anyone. It benefits from being very modern and chic and at around £120 was definite value for money. True, the room wasn't that big but as long as you go there expecting that, it's not a problem at all. The fancy toilet (two levels of seat warmth!), flat-screen TV and wonderful views more than compensate. We paid an extra £5 a night for a view of Tokyo Tower and it was worth the extra for those ""this was the view from our hotel room window"" camera shots.The Shiodome area (full of modern skyscrapers) takes a few walkings to fully get your bearings but all the towers are worth a visit - especially for cheap eating. We eat in respectable places for under £30 a night (between us that is!) which certainly exploded the myth that Tokyo is the most expensive place in the world. Quite simply, it is not.Shiodome also has its own train station which is good for taking the underground to other parts of the City. You can also get the monorail from there to Odaiba, crossing the elegant Rainbow Bridge and getting a good look back to the City.Shinbashi station is also a 5-10min walk and that serves plenty of destinations on the overground JR Train. You can also take the train from here to Tokyo station (just two stops away) and catch the Shinkansen (Bullet Train). We did that when we had a day-trip to Kyoto.It definitely pays to carry a map of the train lines with you (the hotel will sort you out with one if you haven't got a guidebook) as at some stations the maps are only printed in Japanese. When this happened to us we just asked one of the staff who were all very helpful, taking us to the ticket machine, telling us how much to pay and even wishing us a ""nice day!""We had breakfast in the hotel a couple of times (a tad expensive for £12.50 each) and it was a good way to start the day - cereals, fruit, bread, egg, bacon etc (there's plenty of time to eat Japanese food later in the day!).Finally, the staff were all overwhelmingly polite, spoke good English and made our stay a memorable one.For the same money, I'd be amazed if you could find anywhere as good as this!!!!!","Leeds, England",19,5.0

If you are not in tokyo on business and wish to do day trips the proximaty to Tokyo station (two stops) is extremely convenient. We used both the Ginza metro line and the Yamonote Train line extensively. The Shiodome area is modern and fascinating but the area around shimbashi station is terrific also and not mentioned in any guide books.

I imagine that as the lowest floor of the hotel is half way up the Shiodome media tower, all rooms are likely to have pretty good views.The bathroom was small but beautiful, bright, spotlessly clean, and well eqipped with loads of goodies. The shower was wickedly powerful. The toilet warmed your bum and had inbuilt bidet - amusing...

The bed was sooo beautifully comfy and BIG.The bar is lovely, with attentive waiters, big comfy sofas, and jazz music playing live most nights, or at least gentle background music.Room service menu looked impressive but very expensive, so we didn't try any of the meals in the hotel apart from breakfast.Reception has a breathtaking view and the staff could not have been more courteous and helpful. My poor boyfriend was on crutches at the time and they were so kind to him, and so helpful, we were really touched.Internet access is free to all guests in the lobby for an hour each day of your stay.

We were so happy here and were sad to leave.

Words cannot explain how great this hotel is - please go to their website - the rooms all look just like the website promised. Highly recommened, and I'd love to come back!","Los Angeles, California",36,5.0

Each time the service was fantastic (what else would you expect in Japan!). The twin room was a little on the compact size, however the design and room amenities were first class. The hotel is conveniently located in the new Shiodome district and is a short walk to the Shimbashi JR station. I would not hestitate to stay at this hotel again when I make future visits to Tokyo.",Sydney,43,4.0
