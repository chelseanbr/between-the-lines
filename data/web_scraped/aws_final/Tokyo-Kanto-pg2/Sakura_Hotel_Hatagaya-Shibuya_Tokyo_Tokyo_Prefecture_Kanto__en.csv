This is it!As a solo female traveller, I'm not the biggest fan of sharing rooms because I don't like the pressure of always being mindful of my stuff spread out in the room--for that, I always opt for getting my own room. This hotel has the best rates for solo traveling that I saw for Tokyo. So let's talk about things I love about this place.1. CostThis place is affordable, of the many locations I checked, this is one of the most affordable ones.2. LocationThe location is quiet and not on the main road which is great because it's perfect for your shut-eye. But it still remains very accessible to train stations, it's 3 minutes away from Hatagaya Station which is just two stations away from Shinjuku which means cheap train fares despite not being covered by the subway pass. It is also just 15 minutes away from the train station that is covered by the subway pass.3. Access to Food and Stores NearbyThe vicinity is also with a lot of convenience stores, hole-in-the-walls, drugstores, and restaurants. But, you need not worry about that because the hotel itself has a 24-hour cafe that is reasonably-priced.4. RoomsThe rooms are great. They're not the most spacious but I think that's the norm in Tokyo. The entrance might seem underwhelming if you're tall, but the ceilings are higher inside, I promise. :)The room is equipped with all the basic necessities you'll need, but the hotel offers more free rental equipment for other things you might need. I find that smart and considerate! Plus, I got my own room which is all that I really look for. That's a plus, yes, given most accommodations I found in the same price range has shared bathrooms.I wanna address a review I read that the toilet stinks, it's not true for me. If you smell something, just close the toilet lid and you should be good. They also offer deodorizers and humidifiers for free, if you ever encounter it.I went in the summer and their air-conditioning is perfect!5. BreakfastThe free breakfast is bread, juice, coffee, tea, and soup. Though it's the same everyday variation comes in the jams, juice flavor, and soup. But the highlight of this is the duration, they start early and end really late which is perfect if you need to leave early or just want to sleep longer and wake up late.6. WiFi and Other AmenitiesWiFi is great! It's reliable in all locations. Our Muslim friends are also considered as there is a prayer room available. :)7. StaffThis, I think is the gem of the place. For Non-Japanese, they speak and understand English! Great customer service in Japan is common, but Sakura Hotel Hatagay takes it to the next level. First off, thank you to the staff for the little things:a. Letting me get cold water in my water bottle from the bar every morning and every nightb. Helping me with my questions about getting around and how to use my subway passes together with the IC Cardsc. Giving me band-aids; this seems like a little think but I bruised myself and just needed one band-aid, buying a whole box in the drugstore seemed wasteful as I only needed one but the staff (maybe Hako, the one in your Instagram account photos) gave me two. I appreciate that very much!Most especially, I stumbled upon an issue in Tokyo and they went above and beyond to help me. Short of it is, I got left behind by my overnight bus to Osaka due to misinformation from the person who booked me. I was so tired that night, feeling lost and overwhelmed somewhere in Tokyo Station. I called the hotel and everything started to just be too much for me and started crying on the phone whilst talking to the Assistant Manager of the Hotel. I was asking them for help to contact the bus company and they were more than happy to do it for me. Filled with anxiety on the phone, they have calmed me down and offered to go back to the hotel and sort the entire thing out. They even went ahead and offered me a discounted room for the night. But since I planned to leave in the morning, they offered for me to just stay in the cafe since it's open for 24 hours. When I got to the hotel, they could not be any more accommodating and friendly towards my stressed self. They helped me just settle in the cafe with my laptop and even as far as booking a new ticket to Osaka, helping me find the cheapest rates online. That was so stressful for me as someone traveling alone, but their help made it all okay for me. I contemplated leaving the next night but they also gave me tips that there is a typhoon coming and leaving soon is a wiser decision. True enough, when I got to Osaka, a typhoon hit Tokyo which would have stranded me in Tokyo even further.To Sakura Hotel Hatagaya, thank you to the Assistant Manager who helped me and his staff on the night of September 7, 2019. I got your business cards but have not had the chance to unpack to look for them (I apologize), but I wanted to express my utmost gratitude towards your team in Hatagaya! You made my Japan experience memorable and I cannot wait to come back.",,12,5.0

The people: some were chilling, some were on their laptops, some were with their group, laughing and sharing stories. Since we are Muslims, we are delighted that the cafe offered Muslim-friendly menu, properly labelled on the display. Food arrived within a 10 minutes (or less) wait.Near the toilet, a prayer room is provided- which is really convenient since the room is too small for a space to pray.After 3 PM, we checked in. The interior of the lift was too red and has a claustrophobic feel for my liking, since they used a carpeted red wall (the only part of the building that irked me).The room we stayed was one double bed, for 2 people. When we opened the door, it was only enough for the entry of one person at a time, immediate left is a mirror and a place to hang our clothes, and to the right is the toilet. You have the double bed near to the table and TV. Small space for walking but it does its job when your focus is travelling and only require the room to sleep in.Amenities like, hair dryer, slippers, towels, toothbrush and toothpaste, cups were provided.

Like, we're not picky. I tried to brush my teeth and almost hurled. After a few hours of being in our room and the smell not getting better, we asked to be transferred to a new room. At first the woman said they were full and it wasn't possible, but my boyfriend asked ""can you check?"" and the woman was like ""oh, we do have a room."" She didn't seem happy at all, and I understand that it is an inconvenience, but really if they hadn't wanted to move us they shouldn't have put us in the poo room. I did notice when we first went in the room, the window was open, so perhaps they thought it would air out before we got there, so that in itself is understandable, but the attitude wasn't cool. We got moved to a tiny room with a view of the stairwell, so we had to keep our curtains closed for privacy for our remaining 4 nights there.

Train station exit to the hotel is equipped with elevator.Cafe - Food was great. There was a quite variety of Halal menu so you can try different food everytime. The halal menu sold out fast so better try it as soon as you can.Laundry - Laundry is a bit dissapointing as it was very limited.

The people on 5th floor seems to conquer it as I've encounter numerous case where the machine was done yet no one pick the clothes.

Cons:- room was super small and yes, I’m aware that most hotels in japan are small but for the double room that we had, the only way to open our luggages is by putting them on top of each other and open one at a time.- breakfast is below average: only bread and some jam, butter.

Mainly the location, which is close to the Hatagaya station.The Bad.My biggest complaint goes with the room size. I booked a double room, and when I entered the room I was rather shocked. I'm used to rooms in Japan being small (I've been to Japan several times), but in this case the bed occupied like 90% of the room, and there was no space left to open the luggage. Essentially I had to lift the bed to open the luggage.The Internet was bad, especially at night when other people were using it.The breakfast is a joke. The only solid thing they have is bread! Moreover there are only two extremely slow toasting machines, so in the morning everyone is essentially queueing to get the bread toasted.The staff was ok, but well below the japanese standards. The last day I needed a taxi and asked the reception if they could book one for me. The lady at the reception made a phone call and then told me that there were no Taxi available! On a Wednesday morning in central Tokyo, that is just simply unbelievable. She just called a random company and gave up without making any effort to call another place and find a taxi.And I paid more than 10000 Yen/night, which is not a cheap price for a budget hotel in Tokyo.","Bristol, United Kingdom",0,2.0

This is an excellent location, with easy access to a subway line that takes you directly to Shinjuku. It's also clean, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the rooms are adequate for the casual traveler. It also has a nice sitting area outside where you can socialize, as well as its own cafe. All in all, a good place to stay. Now for the negative. Last Friday night (July 20th) I stayed at the Sakura Hotel in Hatagaya. My boyfriend and I had reserved a double room through the Agoda booking site for one night. When I checked in and went to the room, I was very upset to find that the room I was assigned was not actually a double room, but a single room. Yet I was charged the price for a double.I have stayed at the same Sakura Hotel before, in a double room, so I noticed the size difference in both the size of the room and the size of the bed right away. And to be clear, I am aware that the size of hotel rooms in Tokyo are smaller than in other countries. I have lived and worked in Japan for 25 years, and have traveled extensively both as a single traveler for business trips and as a couple for vacations. This means I am well aware of the standard sizes for both double and single rooms across Japan. This room was definitely a single room being used for double occupancy. I did not complain to the clerk at the time as I know he is not the person who is in charge of making the decision to sell single rooms for double occupancy at the price of a double room. I suspect this could be a decision made higher up at corporate, or it could be that Agoda is the dishonest party here, selling off single hotel rooms as doubles and then pocketing the difference. I complained via email to the Sakura House corporate office and hope to receive a reply from them. Meanwhile, people booking this hotel via Agoda should be aware that this is happening and factor it into their decision making process. Only you can decide if the good points outweigh the bad. Also, if you are booking through Agoda or other booking site, check the Sakura House website as well and double check the prices - you can see they are different right away.","Tokyo, Japan",1,3.0

Though the bed was kinda take the whole space, makes you hard to walk around the room but it has enough space to put all your luggage and shoes. The bathroom was pretty small but it was okay. The room sizes in Japan is different from other countries, they're smaller.It has 24 hours front desk service and food at the restaurant (no room service). The food was quite expensive, but the taste was good and quite large portion. I ordered fish and chips, I don't. Know what kind of fish it was but it wasn't just a plain dory fillet, it was other fish that cooked very well and fresh. The calamari salad was surprisingly not squid but octopus.

It takes less than 5-10 minutes from the Hatagaya station which is great if you want to access major areas in Tokyo. Surprisingly the room was bigger than I thought it was, which is good considering its a budget hotel and I was carrying a lot of luggage. The hotel is very near many areas like conveniences stores, laundromat (their own laundromat opens from 10am-10pm only), post office and box if you need to mail back those 4G Pocket Wifi's or other stuff, and many food joints nearby. It's also a 10-15 minutes walk to the Tokyo Camii, which is great for Muslim travelers. The Sakura Hotel Cafe is also a good alternative since it operates 24/7 if you are tired to go out to look for food. The cafe also provides a good alternative for Muslim travels because of their halal selection menu, although finding halal food in Tokyo is much easier now compared to before thanks to the internet. There's a also a Muslim prayer room in the cafe while you wait. They also provided a lot of other facilities like handy, an integrated mobile device that helps you to navigate the city free of charge, activities and tour trips. A commendable effort and initiative from the hotel to the customers and I'll give credit where its due.However, even though I didn't want to expect much since this is a 2 star hotel, the breakfast selection was a big disappointment; a few choices of jams, coffee, bread and butter. While the cafe its open 24/7 and there's quite a number of selections of food, the staff at the reception has to constantly juggle back and forth between the food counter and the reception counter, which makes it awkward and inconvenient. Cleanliness for the room is somewhat passable but there was a fly in my room when I checked in and while I was drinking my drink in the cafe, a bug actually entered my drink. The aircon was weird and had a constant ""clean filter"" sign on the device and I coughed a lot compared to my other hotel stays. Security and safety wise very concerning because when I arrived early at the hotel I put my baggage in the luggage storage area, but the fact I can freely go in back and forth to get my stuffs in the luggage area without any supervision tells you a lot of their security level, even though the crime rate in Japan is generally low. Very average to low hospitality and service from staff, which is something I don't expect from Japanese people. Staff friendliness depends on the people and some of the staff do not have the Japanese level hospitality and courtesy. The Wifi internet connection speed is unstable and slow, got disconnected many times while using it.If you on a budget and looking a budget accommodation with easy access to subway and other facilities, you can put this hotel under consideration but be caution of the flaws it has. With its price however, I think you can get a better option if you look hard enough.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",4,3.0

The hotel (along with the other branches) also hosts a variety of events, like a traditional hanami or mochi pounding, which are great fun to join.

I decided to choose them and was not disappointed. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood near Hatagaya station so it was very convenient for me to head out to Shinjuku. In front of the hotel is a convenience store which I frequent during my stay there. The room and toilet were small but good enough for someone on a solo trip and need a place to crash after sightseeing. The bed is comfortable enough for me to sleep in. You can borrow an electric kettle and iron from the reception. The only heads up I wish I had was to turn on the heater once I entered the room. It was winter when I was staying there. I was under the impression that the heater was on by default (centralised heater) as my room was quite warm when I first entered it during the afternoon. But it turned out that the heat came from the sunlight shining into my room which was located at the corner. It got really cold in the middle of the night and I tried ""adjusting"" the heater but it didn't work. I later realised on the 2nd night that I had to turn on the heater (the light on the thermostat had to be on) and was able to sleep comfortably. The Halal food was ok but I wish there was more variety. Other than that I actually enjoyed my stay and considered it my ""home"" while I was in Tokyo. I would definitely return again to this hotel when I'm visiting Tokyo.","Singapore, Singapore",1,4.0

This subway station has an elevator that takes you to the street, so very convenient for you and your luggage. Hatagaya Station is just 3 stops away from Shinjuku Station.

I will be as fair and honest in this review. The good news is the ""hotel"" provides daily cleaning service from 10 am to 2 pm. So you don't have to worry about cleanliness in that sense. It is also a 5-min walk from Keio New Line's Hatagaya Station. There are many affordable food choices near the ""hotel"" such as Sukiya and Origin Dining. Family Mart is also near the ""hotel"". However, there are some cons staying in this ""hotel"". I don't consider this a hotel because the set-up is too hostel-like. The lift is slow and old. The rooms are really tiny. It is impossible to put two luggage in the same room. You will have to stuff one of the luggage under your bed. I could barely open the room door without hitting my luggage. The rooms are also not soundproof. I could basically hear what the guests in the other room were talking from my room.  Another thing that really made my stay kind of uncomfortable was the attitude by the staff. I arrived in the morning and approached the staff politely to let her know that I am here. While I was busy searching for my passport (because I don't know the procedures for check-in at that point), the staff (a woman) said that check-in was after 3pm in a really rude tone. She even glared and stared at me. Throughout the rest of my stay, whenever I see her, I caught her rolling my eyes at me or just glaring at me. On the day I checked out, I asked another staff (a man) politely if they had the airport bus service from Shinjuku Bus terminal to the airport. However, he looked very frustrated and said no. I asked if there was a way to check the timetable and he looked very unhappy and said to check the website for details. When I was leaving the hotel, the staff glared at stared at me. I wonder if glaring at guests is a service that they think is acceptable to guests Apart from these two staff members, the rest of the staff, including the cleaning crew is polite and friendly. Please be wary even if they claim that Shinjuku is just two stops away from Hatagaya. Yes, it is true that Shinjuku is just two stops away from Hatagaya. However, you always need to take the Keio New Line from Shinjuku only. This makes travelling very inconvenient especially if you buy the one-day or three-day Tokyo metro pass. This is because the Keio New Line is not covered under the metro pass. This means that your trip from Shinjuku to Hatagaya for a one-way trip is about 125 yen - which also means additional transport cost. At Shinjuku Station, it is advisable to take the Odeo Line or the Shinjuku (green) line (from wherever you are coming from) if you want to take the Keio New Line. I will never come back to stay here because the bad service really turn me off.","Tokyo, Japan",9,3.0

This is awesome for visitors to take transportation to travel. Besides, there is a post office on the right of the hotel, which makes postcards posting much convenient. Finally, there is a healthcare store with some food and drinks available for sale. I do not have to worry about forgetting to bring any healthcare products next time when I stay in this hotel. I also can buy some food or drinks very easily. If you were on business trip, this hotel is recommended in terms of convenient transportation. The one that makes me mad the most is the tap water in the restroom. The supply of cold water is unstable. It could happen to suspend temporarily. And after some time, the cold-water supply resumes. This is terrible if I had put the soap on the skin and the cold water were suspended. What was weird is that there are no one to fix it even there is daily room cleaning service. I cannot rate higher than zero in a scale of ten for this. Another thing that dissatisfied me so much was that you must check out so early, that is, at 10:00 hrs (Tokyo time). Just imagine if you woke up late after a day of content activities, you need to pay 1,000 YEN for one additional hour that you check out after 10:00 hrs.

The TV has no English channel, hence, if you are not a Japanese, do not bother turning it on.4. There is no complimentary coffee or tea. Neither there is a water kettle.5. The air-conditioning systems hums rather noisily.6. The water closet has no bidet,much more automatic bidet, that I've grown accustomed to in other Japanese hotels.7.There is practically no hotel lobby to hold you while you are waiting (you have to stand up on the line during check-in).8. Like its room, the elevator is so small it can only hold 4 persons.9. Bed mattress is a bit hard and pillows are undersized.10,. Buffet breakfast comes in the form of bread and three types of fruit jams and a butter, with soup. Do not expect anything new in the breakfast for any succeeding day.","Metro Manila, Philippines",79,3.0

In addition, its just less than 5 minute walk from the train station. One thing I can recommend is not to take the train from airport to hotel if you're carrying heavy luggages because its really hard to commute. You'll have to carry your luggages up and downstairs which is kind of hassle. Going back to the airport, we took a cab from the hotel to the bus limousine station then rode from there to the airport!

Coming to Japan during Cherry Blossom season, finding a reasonably priced hotel was a challenge. This hotel seemed a bit too-good-to-be-true with a rate at only just over $100/night, however we had read numerous good reviews and were hopeful. What we found was just what the reviews has promised: a bright, lively lobby staffed by young, multilingual staff and basic rooms. The Sakura feels more like a hostel than a hotel, but it was welcoming and inexpensive. The clientele reflected that hostel feeling: a mix of guests from all over the world, young travellers and families. We had a corner room which was larger than the rooms we had stayed in in many business hotels. There was a fridge and desk space and a small bathroom (sink/toilet/shower). The wifi was spotty at times. The bedding and towels were pretty utilitarian and the decor was dated but the bed was comfortable. Location-wise the hotel also good. The neighbourhood around the hotel has lots of shops and small restaurants and is well worth exploring. In the end, we were happy with our stay and would return. This is not a hotel for those looking for luxury and style but is great if you are looking for a safe, comfortable place to lay your head.Some transit tips: The train to Shinjuku comes frequently and takes only a few minutes. Be warned however that the travel time within Shinjuku is almost laughably long. The Keio New Line seems to be located at a far flung corner of Shinjuku Station, well underground: transferring from other lines involves a lot of walking, stairs, escalators and some very poor signage. Easy once you've done it a few times, but quite confusing the first time. It is possible to walk to Shinjuku Station, but it is a long walk. We found we walked more often toward Yoyogi Park and the stations there -- using Google maps this was a pleasant walk through residential neighbourhoods and didn't feel long.","Halifax, Canada",34,4.0

Only negatives I personally had were the small rooms (which are inevitable if you're staying at a budget hotel in Tokyo) and the fact I was too tall for the shower (which isn't going to be an issue for anyone around 6 foot and under). My room was also right next to the laundry area, and I did once have an entire girls' sports team making a lot of noise outside of my room, but fortunately there's a 10pm-10am curfew in place for this exact reason. Generally, however, the hotel was pretty quiet, like Hatagaya in general. Most of the noise comes from the cicadas in the summer, and they seem to pipe down when night falls.

I really loved the attached cafe / restaurant which had a nice homely and social feel to it with lots of travel information, maps, a 24 hour cafe, a wide selection of beers and two Internet computers and Wifi. The all you can eat free basic no-frills breakfast was an added bonus. The neighbourhood is quiet and ""quaint"" and a family area - I noticed lots of ""mama chan"" bicycles.

The hotel itself was always clean and tidy, which was also very true for the rooms. The only thing to be aware about is the location. Personally, I really liked that it was a more quiet area, there was little noise, and though there wasn't as much to do at night, or as many different eating places as you find in more central parts of the city, it had its own charm; we even found a small park where the children played baseball matches on Sundays.

It was probably the only place in Japan where they tried to make small talk. The area: Hatagaya deserves a special mention as an absolutely charming residential area. The quiet, narrow main street has a number of beautiful shops and feels a world away from the madness of Shinjuku. Right behind the hotel is a walking path through the neighbourhood lined with cherry trees. In the blossom season, this was one of the most beautiful places I saw in Tokyo, with many families out with picnic baskets and bottles of wine. Location: The hotel’s just a few steps down from Hatagaya station, which is two stops away from Shinjuku station on the Keio New Line. It sounds easier than it is. Because the Keio line platform in Shinjuku is quite a few flights of overcrowded stairs and escalators away from the JR line platforms. And after a long, long day of walking, it’s not something you look forward to. Luckily, the hotel is close enough from Shinjuku/Shibuya to take a cab and not cause a financial crisis. Overall: A great little affordable hotel in a beautiful area.

It has a youthful vibe with an open area in the lobby / restaurant where you can meet fellow travelers. I was there on business but most of the people staying there were simply on vacation seeing the sites. The staff speaks excellent English and were extremely helpful. The hotel is literally two streets (alleyways) on the right out of the south entrance of the Hatagaya station off the New Keio line (Keio #4 in Shinjuku station). If you take more than 5 minutes to find it you have gone too far.There are a number of good restaurants on the main street from the station and it sits in an upscale residential area so you can wander around with no issues. The Sunday I was there one of the staff took a tour group over to Meiji Shrine and the local flea market. We ended up at a fantastic okanomitaki restaurant afterwards. It seems that the group that owns the Sakura hotel chain also owns an art gallery, and various restaurants which this is one of them. The gallery next store to their restaurant was worth visiting too for some unique items. Ask for directions from the staff.The Internet is free and there are small stores across the street and up the block (Family Mart). Breakfast is simple Japanese soup, toast, or some rolls with juice but it is enough to get you up and going.

You are away from the familiarity and the sanctuary of your home. But as a stranger in a strange land, I found a place I could definitely call home in Sakura Hotel Hatagaya. - The rooms provides me with the space just enough for a solo travellor with free wifi in the room and in the common area as well. - The location is great too... for the price charged by this hotel. Hatagaya is a quaint neighbourhood with 'jems' to be found by any travellor who is willing to explore. The train station Hatagaya station is just a few steps from the Hotel and and the station is just a few stops from one of the main train stations in tokyo...Shinjuku Station. There are interesting places like the Shinjuku Sports centre for people who want to play sports and do gym and exercise and there is the Yoyogi park and Meiji Shrine which makes a great walk and photo opportunity. There are some interesting Restuarents and Cafes and even a Karoke neaby. - Not only that their website provides a lot of useful information and even detailed information on how to get to the hotel from both the main international airports in tokyo. - But most importantly the one thing that I would like to headline about this Hotel is its service. Its service staff: ones at the reception and tending the bar at their cafe' called the Sakura Cafe', are awesome and are people I would certainly 'hang out' with. They are friendly and keen to answer answer any question that you might have. And most importantly they can speak and understand good English. It's well enough that most solo travellors in japan have studied the language to some extent but its a relief when one gets home that he/she need not have to go through the hassle of remembering their Japanese...its a good moments reprieve. - The Sakura cafe' is a dime in a dozen for budget cafes. It provides interesting food and drinks from across the globe at reletively affordable prices. A great menu for a global customer base.  - One problem with Sakura cafe' is its breakfast. I dont hate it but I dont exactly love it either...one could get a more interesting breakfast at the Mcdonalds nearby who by the way ave some great tasting beef burgers strangely...The sakura cafe provides a 365 yen breakfast which is mostly the essentials - tea, coffee, toast, butter and jam (all you can eat). I hope that they could make the price for this breakfast a bit cheaper and have another 'deluxe' option where one could top-up to have a more interesting breakfast with more variety like pancakes or waffles or a healthy one like tasty oatmeal.All in all I will surely be coming back to my home away from home in Japan ...

I am trying to be generous by using hostel criteria. I noticed the hostel self-description only upon arrival, so the shortcomings made more sense.My wife and I first stayed at a budget business hotel near the Ningrocho metro stations for 2 nights before moving to Sakura Hatagaya for additional 2 nights in Tokyo. Although the 2 places charged nearly the same price per night, the quality of accommodations were night and day. I'm not used to hostels, so I may be judging the Sakura Hatagaya too harshly. Again, my reference point is the fact that I paid the same price for a hostel room as a real hotel with new-looking furnishings located 2 blocks from a Metro station.Location. Theoretically, it's 2 train stops from Shinjuku, but it involves additional cost and walking distance. The Keio New Line is neither part of the Tokyo Metro/Toei system nor the JR Rail system, so this fare is additional to any JR Rail Pass or Tokyo subway pass. We were lugging two large suitcases from the Shinjuku metro station to the Shinjuku Keio station, not realizing that the walking distance was considerable, especially when some stairs did not have escalator or elevator alternatives. While the hotel is a short distance from the Keio Hatagaya station, the hassle of getting to other parts of Tokyo was considerable.Condition of facilities. The outdoor cafe seating had a nice feel, but the hotel lobby felt worn and outdated. It felt like time stopped in the 60's or 70's.The walls, furniture and carpeting all could use renovation and updating. The elevator was small, so often it was wall-to-wall with people. The staff, though, were friendly and helpful. Condition of room. Our room was similarly worn and tired looking. Of the 3 places we stayed in Japan, our Sakura Hatagaya room was the smallest. Literally, we could not open our 2 suitcases on the floor at the same time. We learned to use the space under the bed to store our suitcases. The comforter did not have a separate quilt cover, so I did wonder how often the staff washed the comforters. The a/c was directed right at our faces while in bed, so there was an uncomfortable draft all night. I wish I had duct tape to secure a towel in front of the a/c vents to re-direct the air flow away from our faces. My absolute worst pet peeve was the shower curtain. It was so narrowly positioned that it was inevitable that it would adhere to my body while I was trying to soap up or rinse off. It reminded me of the old days of cruising when ships had tiny shower stalls with nylon curtains that would wrap themselves to one's body. It helps to open the shower curtain half-way when you're trying to soap up.Breakfast. It's literally white sliced bread, sliced french bread, dinner rolls, soup/broth of the day, juice of the day, generic coffee and tea bags. Toasters were available for breads and rolls. We managed by supplementing our breakfasts with yogurts and fruits bought at nearby convenience stores and markets.The Sakura provided a 24-hour lounge space (breakfast room) for those who want to surf the Internet or work at their laptops (given rooms have no desks). Outlets are available at a couple of tables.In my opinion, I much prefer a budget business hotel rather than a hostel (given relatively the same cost). Ironically, it probably takes less time to get to Shijuku/Shibuya from a cross-town hotel near a Metro station than from the Sakura Hatagaya.For me, the Sakura barely gets a 3-star (even for a hostel).","Boston, Massachusetts",20,3.0

Hotel was slightly out of the way in terms of travel, 3 min subway journey on Keio New Line to Shinjuku. Doesn't sound like much but when you're carrying a bag in 30 degree heat and 97% humidity that you're not used to, it's a struggle believe me! Also, your JR rail pass doesn't count on the Keio New Line, so you have to pay, which is annoying.Most staff were polite but some seemed stand-offish. Room was very small but clean. Small size didn't bother me too much as I am a small person, but even I struggled to fit into the bathroom and shower! I thought ""If I were tall I wouldn't be happy with this"". WARNING: the rooms have VERY thins walls. Man next door to me sounded like he was sitting next to me I could hear his Skype conversation so clearly and he snored so loud I could feel it vibrating through the wall as well as the noise! A good hammer on the wall soon put an end to that! Breakfast...hm. Disappointing. Now, I might be small but I like decent a breakfast. Especially in Japan as I was out every day in the heat walking from 8am to about 7pm at night, so I needed something to start me off in the mornings. Only breakfast provided is bread(and a toaster), tea/coffee, juice and soup. I kept a stash of fruit upstairs to munch on before I went out after breakfast. There is a Family Mart on the corner not a minute away from the hotel which is also handy after breakfast.Overall, I don't think I will stay here again as I don't think it was good value for money. The room was small with very thin walls (albeit clean), and the breakfast was meager. Location wasn't as ideal as I thought it would be either. I think if you are staying here for just one or two nights it's passable, but any more I would recommend you stay somewhere else that has better rooms, breakfast and location. An average stay.","Birmingham, United Kingdom",53,3.0

Our rooms at the Hatagaya had a mini fridge and a bathroom which we wouldn't of had had at Jimbocho.There is a family Mart just meters from the Hotel where a staffer was nice enough to operate ticket kiosk to help us buy pro wrestling tickets, there is also a supermarket (Gourmet City) around the corner for a huge selection of unusual Japanese food.Now for the Negative, the only train line here is the Keio New Line and you are 2 stops from Shinjuku station this train line turns into the Shinjuku (Green) line so that's good if you are going somewhere near the middle of Tokyo (Jimbocho station has 3 different lines going through it) the major issue is that the only stations that even show the Keio New Line on the route/price maps were Shinjuku station and the ones on the actual line, this was very frustrating.

He got himself and us frustrated when he could not get it right. When he managed to get the amount stated in the email, he said, ""THANK YOU FOR MAKING THINGS SO DIFFICULT!""1) He doesn't know how to read email? Everything was stated clearly in there.2) He can't do simple calculations?3) Is this customer service?We stayed one night, left the hotel for Hakone the following day and went back to stay for the next 2 nights. We were given a smaller room than the one we had before and also a really smelly toilet. Revenge or what, we don't know. We requested a change of room but the other triple room is occupied for that one night. The hotel manager called to apologise while we voiced about the rude staff whom checked us in.

I have searched for many places in Tokyo. I would need to book two double rooms. Somehow I found Sakura Hotel Hatagaya. It is reasonable priced. I have read many good reviews before I booked for 3 night stay. We flew to Narita Airport and took Narita Express to Shinjuku station. We looked for Keio New line. Hatagaya is only two stations away. After got out Hatagaya station, it took us about two minutes to get to the hotel. We checked in right before 6PM without any problem. Staffs were very friendly and answered any question we had in English. We walked in to the rooms. The room is small which is very typical in Tokyo. Right after settled in, we went out to street to find a traditional Japanese restaurant. The owners of the restaurant were very friendly. After the dinner, we walked around streets. There was Family Mart and 7-11. If you walked out to the big street, you can find Gourmet City which is a big super market. The hotel location is just very nice. Later in evening, I spoke to hotel staff Eddie and Tarmo about what to do in Tokyo. They showed me different map and what attractions we could go as a family. They also would look online to find out more detail answers. They really spent time with me to make sure my visit would go well. Later I found out Eddie was a professional Tour Guide. Did I find the right person how to visit Tokyo? I am very impressed with the staffs, most of them are young and full of energy. First day, we visited Asakusa temple, SkyTree, Tsukiji fish market and Tokyo Tower. All these places were accessible with subway all day pass which cost $1000 yen per adult which is a very economical way to go around Tokyo. Later in Saturday evening, we took Keio New line to Sasakuza which is one station down of Hatagaya on Keio New line however you can walk if you want. There were more shops in Sasakuza. By the time we finished the day, we just fell asleep in hotel bed very quickly. For the second day, we just walked around Shinjuku. One suggestion is that you can go to Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building observation deck in Shinjuku. When you are up there, you can see the city very well. The one good thing is that it is free. Also there are a lot of big department stores in Shinjuku which are nice to visit. Overall, I like the location and staff of Sakura Hotel Hatagaya. The hotel rooms are ok and clean. Breakfast included in our hotel rate was very good (I love the soap of the day). We will definitely stay at this hotel again.

Hatagaya station is located like 2 min away from the hotel and from there you take the Keio NEW Line (there's also a Keio Line, so notice that you take the Keio NEW Line, as Keio Line will not be stopping at Hatagaya station). The trains from Shinjuku and Hatagaya are arriving and departing within a decent time frame (I estimate that there was a 10 minutes stop between each train, but I didn't wait long for the next train). From Shinjuku station you can basically travel everywhere as the lines (as in other major cities) intersects with each other and you can transfer to other lines and etc. The Post Office is literally around the corner from the hotel entrance, and there's also an ATM there, which is able to take foreign credit cards. This ATM is open from 9AM-5PM on weekdays (at the time of my stay), but there's a 7/11 with an ATM that I think is open 24/7, located across the street from Hatagaya station, so approximately 5 mins away from the hotel. There's two shops close to the hotel, one Tomod (a lot of household articles, cosmetics and quick snack/food) and one FamilyMart (with a bit more of a selection of snacks and food). The Hotel also takes some foreign cards. The hotel is for Scandinavian standards, very decent, but the rooms are really tiny, but keep in mind that this is in Japan and the rooms are small here. Hairdryer is located in the room, along with a mini fridge. But an electric kettle isn't in the room, but hot water is accessible in the hotel ""lobby"", which also functions as an area for breakfast/lunch and etc. Sakura Hotel Hatagaya also offers meals for a decent price (coming from Norway and used to the price point there, and the currency equivalent is very in favour for Norwegian currency compared to Japanese). The food was great for the price you pay, and not bad in terms of taste. The staff here is very service-oriented, all very polite and nice! And they are able to communicate efficiently in English, so not knowing Japanese won't be a problem. The reception is open 24/7, so no matter what time it is, you are able to get some help from the staff any time. They are also very informative if you're wondering about different places in Tokyo to visit, and they also offer a free map of the Underground in Tokyo, which is a great thing to have when you're travelling around in the city and transferring to other lines and etc. I would definitely recommend you to stay in Sakura Hotel Hatagaya, or other Sakura hotels located around in Tokyo.

A taxi back from Roppongi after the trains stopped running cost just over 3000 Yen. The room itself is quite small. Mine had a double bed (which took up most of the space) and a desk with a TV. There isn’t a wardrobe, but a clothes rail with a few hangers is provided. It was fine for me as I was staying alone, but if you were a couple it would probably be quite cramped. The adjoining private bathroom was also small, but was clean and shower worked well.The staff were friendly and happy to help with any questions asked. Breakfast was served in the mornings for 300 Yen which consisted of bread/juice/tea – it didn’t look too appetising so I didn’t have it, but plenty of other guests did.

The location was quite good, with many restaurants and eateries nearby. It also had a lovely bookshop for me to pick up some Japanese books, along with a street lined with cherry blossom trees. The station is a three-minute walk away, which will take you straight to Shinjuku Station (this is the main station and on the Yamanote line, from here you can go anywhere). So I found I was able to easily go to most tourist destinations. The staff were lovely! They were multi-lingual, with at least seven or eight languages being spoken in total by the various staff members, and they would willingly help out with any problem or question. They also would make conversation in a friendly manner, and one time - when the maids were cleaning my room, and I had an arm full of perishables - let me use their fridge. There is nothing they won't do to help you!There are computers for rent and free wi-fi. You can use your own computer for free.The cafe is spotlessly clean, with a huge amount of food to choose from. There is food from all over the country and the world, with the ability to suggest your own recipes for them to use. It is cheap and even the locals use the cafe often, so you are able to make many new friends and practise your Japanese skills with the locals. It is bright, airy, and colourful. The cleanliness is perfect. The maids clean every day without fail and spend vast amounts of time on every room, meaning not one speck of dust is left standing. They are also very friendly, all of which - despite not having good English - will smile and try to greet you. It's very secure. There are cameras on every floor, which are monitored by the staff in the reception, and keys are handed into reception before leaving (so no risk of losing keys or people making copies).

When we were choosing a place to stay for our trip, we didn't want a pricy hotel and we didn't want a hostel either. The Sakura Hotel Hatagaya was the PERFECT fit. While the rooms might be considered small, this encourages guests to get out of bed and explore the city.It really is more than just a place to sleep, as they foster a sense of community amongst all the guests, and all the staff members are BEYOND helpful and friendly. While the hotel is not central, it is literally a couple steps away from the Hatagaya station, which is only two quick stops away from Shinjuku--allowing us to travel anywhere in the city. Yes, the rooms are cozy, but for the price, they are absolutely perfect. I could not recommend this hotel more. Though we stayed less than a week, the Sakura Hotel Hatagaya felt like home after a couple of days. Each room has a great AC system and a small fridge to put your leftovers/waters inside.For example, we wanted to check out the nightlife scene in Tokyo. We approached the concierge asking for advice on where to go, when to go, and what to wear. From his past experience in the city, and great English, we got all the answers we were looking for. The concierge provide us with a map, directions for transit, and the appropriate dress code for the club (AgeHa--highly recommend). The 24 hour internet cafe has a fridge full of beer and assorted drinks. There is also a post office, and 24 hour ""7/11"" across the street (Family Mart).

This time I was with my wife for an overnight stay before our flight out the next afternoon.Sakura Hotel Hatagaya has the typical smallish rooms of a Tokyo business hotel, and the bathrooms are a bit cramped, especially the shower. We had a double corner room with a somewhat inconvenient column in the center we had to work around. On the other hand, the room itself was very clean, the bed quite comfortable and the hall very quiet and peaceful. I believe they've put down new carpet and refinished the walls since my last stay in May of 2012. We couldn't ask for a better experience with the desk and cleaning staff. Very friendly people and helpful.If you're expecting something upscale, you're in the wrong place. Young groups, solo travelers and couples who want to ramble around Tokyo will probably have the best experience. Sakura Hotel aims to give you a pleasant base for exploring and socializing with other travelers at a wallet-friendly price and they do excel at that. While we were just there for the night, if you're really into meeting people you can hang out in the cafe downstairs and take part in all kinds of fun events. I'm not sure if they were having anything that particular weeknd, but I have been there for a musical performance and the Sakura hotels have seasonal parties as well.

The main reason why I chose to stay here was the location and price. It's a few minutes walk from subway station (2 station away from shinjuku). It's located in a neighbourhood-ish area, so there're convenience stores, supermarket, drug store, ramen shop etc. There's Mcdonalds and Mos Burger(Japanese burger chain). There's a bento shop. The best one must be Douter coffee shop where I went for breakfast (or rather brunch everyday). Lots of food places around. You should also try to walk across the street from the subway station; also a lot of food places.Room-wise, It's okay. The nescessities are there. No fancy Japanese toilet with lots of buttons though. Shampoo is provided. Things to note is that there's not much of a view for you and for some rooms the windows give you straight view into a neighbour's house which is pretty uncomfortable when it's spring and you want to let the sun in but you're seeing a stranger doing their thing in their own house. The room is not too small for me but for 2 person stay, it might feel a little cramped.There's a vending machine onsite but the convenience store is across the street so I recommend you to go there. There's also a washing machine (not free) but the recommended use time was 10am-8pm in order to not disturb other guests, so I didn't get to use it.If you buy food from outside to eat you can ask the staffs to heat them (in the microwave) for you. I have not once eat the hotel food so I have no clue how good/bad it is. There's wifi at the lobby. I'm not sure if it's hotel-wide already.They also provide baggage sending to airports/other hotels via Yamato transport but you need to send them 2 day earlier (e.g. you want them Sunday at the airport, you need to send them off on Friday) So I resort to the post office(JPpost) in front of the hotel.

I practically have to squeeze myself around the room. The basic utilities are there with the hair dryer and TV. Computers available at the lobby will have to be paid 100 yen for 30 mins which I find a bit steep for a hostel and the person in charge does not seem to know much about the condition of other parts of nearby Tokyo area or even a good restaurant to eat. The person in charge does not even know how to operate the paid phone which is available at their hotel as the instructions given at the phone was quite difficult you understand at first. The shop around there selling food are has many choices like mos burger and cafe and even have a 24 hour bento shop. I booked 3 nights and was given special rate of 7200 yen per night for a double bed. Original price was 9000 yen. For 9000 yen room and not really at the heart of Shinjuku and have to change train from the main JR line.

I've seen some reviews where people complain about the entra train transfer but honestly, it's only a 15-20 minute walk to Shinjuku and you basically walk in a straight line! I did it almost everyday! You're there to sightsee! Which brings me to my next point: yes, the rooms are small! Why does this matter? Get out! Go do something! You should only be sleeping here! If you're coming to Tokyo solely to sit in your pretty hotel room, suck it up and spend a few hundred for a fancy room. I found the rooms to be very cozy and clean. The bed was comfortable and the area is insanely quiet. You will definitely sleep well! However, the walls do seem to be quite thin as I could hear the people in the next room talking and I could also hear when they coughed, but no one was trying to be loud by any means and I never heard anything during the night (just a bit in the mornings). The shower pressure was great and the water always nice and hot. Maybe I was lucky since I did not experience any weird smell that other reviewers have mentioned.The cafe in the lobby is nice. I didn't eat their often but what I did have was decent. Usually I just sat there to use the free wifi, which works fine. The staff are very friendly and speak very good English. When I needed change for the trains they had no problem exchanging my bills for me. When I wasn't sure how to get where I was going, they gave me booklets, maps, and written directions complete with what the fare would cost to get there. Overall I would 100% stay here again!

Only 1 doble bed and thin bed side table fits. Luckily we had soft suit case, so suit case fit nicely(but just!!)But it was actually really comfortable!We weren't planing to spend our precious time in Japan in the hotel anyway.and we loved just sitting on the bed, drinking beer that we got from 24 hours convenience store which is 1 min away from hotel, and watching Japanese TV at night.And the size of the room is just usual thing for 'Business Hotel'. That's why its business hotel and that's why its cheap.350yen breakfast is cheap but not worth it.You can get out from the hotel and go to convenience store or 5 mins walk and there is a fresh bakery. anyway I stayed there for 5days and at the end, Sakura hotel was our home in Tokyo.It was really comfortable.I certainly recommend this hotel if you want to stay in the convenience location to travel Tokyo.","Victoria, Australia",21,4.0

Shinjuku station is a nightmare to carry suitcases around while trying to find the train that takes you to Hatagaya.Sakura Hotel Hatagaya is in such a nice area. We were surprised it was actually pretty quite at night. The staff were nice and our room was a twin for 3. The room was small with the two beds pushed together but it was still good. Had our own private bathroom which was clean, mini fridge, tv and a cable line for the internet. Wireless was only available downstairs. There were drink vending machines on each floor, and one of the floors hand coin operated washing machines.There is a cafe downstairs selling a variety of world foods and drinks available on their menu. A bit pricey but good. Plenty of seats, a piano, magazines, books, guitars, tv, lounge and computers to use. There were plenty of places to eat around, conbini, drug store, mos burger, coffee place, karaoke, book store, bento store all in a minute or two walking distance. Train station just nearby.The only complaint I would have is when my friend walked me into the hotel and we were saying our goodbyes when a male staff member rudely said out loud to my friend that they were not allowed up to my room which embarrassed me so much! Never in my life has any hotel staff in the world have said this to me. One of the rules is that only the people who signed into the room and paid are allowed, but I was not inviting them up which I found rude.

Business hotels in Japan normally serve a free breakfast. The one at the Sakura was disappointing. There was only a choice of two types of bread, with strawberry jam or marmalade to top it along with Miso soup. There was only one toaster oven, so when crowded you would have to eat your bread cold. No ""onigiri"" (rice balls) or other forms of rice were present and nothing that contained protein -- no eggs, ham, dried fish or some of the other items often served at a business hotel breakfast. They did serve decent coffee as well as one type of fruit juice -- orange one day, pineapple the next. There was, however, a ""FamilyMart"" convenience store on the corner where you could pick up a wider variety of breakfast items rather inexpensively.The toilet was the typical low-end prefab type --cramped but with the basics. A warning says to keep the door shut while showering, lest the steam set off the fire alarm.The bed was comfortable although I found the tick-tock of the alarm clock a little distracting.The hotel is two stops from Shinjuku on the Keio new line (underground) and about a block from the station.","Osaka, Japan",39,3.0

The room was tiny, even though we had expected it to be small, this one was really really small and felt quite stale. The bathroom was tiny, and also had a bad smell associated to it. Size wise the room might have been fine for one person, but we found it quite uncomfortable. We managed to fit our packs under the bed, if we had different luggage we've no idea where we would have stored it!! The bed was squished right up under the window (which had a view of a stairwell.. ) and in the morning my clothes actually felt damp from being left on the small stool overnight. We had attempted to use the air condition/heater but turned it off as it seemed to emit an awful awful smell, and was covered in dust.The second day we upgraded to a twin room and were so much happier with this one! It seemed to be at least TWICE the size of the first room (was located on a higher floor) was bright and spacious and had a wonderful street view! The difference astounded us!This second room was quite lovely to stay in, and really nice to come back to after a day out. I should say the cleaning staff were a bit... abrupt, noisy and a little intense!!The staff were hit and miss. We had a lovely member of staff help us find a local vegetarian restaurant, and she was really sweet in assisting us, and on the other hand we had staff members who seemed distant, and appeared as if they didn't want to be there. We also had a mix up in the 'cafe' part of the 'hotel'. I had wanted to order a meal and asked if it were vegetarian.. (and this seems to be an issue throughout japan.. not just in this hotel) and was given yes yes vegetables and noodles as an answer so went ahead and ordered. From experience I decided to just check again there was no meat in this dish... and listed all the things I wanted to avoid - beef-chicken-pork-fish.. (etc etc.) The staff member replied that there was a little bit of pork and I could just seperate it from the vegetables.... needless to say I changed my order, oh and by the way.. the food on the menu appears to be pre cooked and simply reheated and wasn't terribly palatable..... So... would we stay there again? If we wanted to go back to that area.. and it was convenient.. we would definately request the TWIN room at least, and not having high expectations would probably enjoy it.",melbourne,11,3.0
