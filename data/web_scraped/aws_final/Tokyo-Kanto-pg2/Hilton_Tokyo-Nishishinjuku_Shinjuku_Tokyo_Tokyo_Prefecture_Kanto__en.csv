Otherwise, it is a standard Hilton that is huge and busy.I wanted to stay in Shinjuku to see that part of the city more. The hotel is connected underground to three metro stations on two different lines, which was very handy to get around parts of the city. Almost anywhere is convenient to Shinjuku station. I would recommend this hotel purely because of the location!The hotel is 38 floors, so there are a lot of people staying here. Most of the rooms are just standard, since this is a big box hotel. We got an upgraded king room, which wasn’t anything special for the price, but you’re in downtown Tokyo. The room had more storage space for luggage than I originally assumed, because underneath the closets was a lot of room for storage. I appreciated that design element.The bathroom was rather small. The bath and shower area was quite large, but I could barely even open the shower door and sit out. A larger person would have more difficulty even using the shower that way.The concierge was very professional and helpful with securing dinner reservations at restaurants for me. Having a good concierge is key in Tokyo because of the language barrier at the restaurants as well as the time difference.This hotel is very crowded. We had access to the executive lounge for breakfast and for the free cocktails in the evening, but it is rather difficult to take advantage of those benefits because of how crowded the lounge is. In all the Hiltons I have stayed in, this one had the biggest issue with space. And that is not to say that it is a small lounge, I guess just so many people have status with Hilton who stay here, I showed up at 5:55 for a 6pm happy hour and there was already a line and the lounge was full. On a different day when I showed up at 6:15, there was a wait for a table. All I saw were people streaming out of the lounge carrying three or four beers a person. Kind of random.Overall, the hotel is good for location and service, otherwise it’s just a standard Hilton with nothing remarkable about it.",WashingtonDC,450,4.0

They have a free shuttle bus, went to Shinjuku shopping & dining. Also, huge train station, where we caught the Romance train to another Hilton resort in Odawara (with hot spa).The guest relations check in person was Monica Meng, friendly, warm, & professional. She told us about the Romance Train, and how we can catch it. Even promised to get us the train schedule, I didn't think much about it, since lots of hotels don't follow thru. To my surprise, I found an envelope slipped under my door when I was out, and there was the schedule. Got upgraded to Premium Twin beds, with soaking tub. Great after a day of shopping. Breakfast in the Executive lounge was great. View of Mt. Fuji, Fresh squeezed OJ from a large machine. Cooked to order eggs. Then had Champagne or wine at night, with snacks.

The bad the restaurants are pricey but the bar prices are about what you pay in Las Vegas for lesser quality whiskey. The good the staff goes over the top to make you feel welcome. From the moment when we entered after a long day when the staff got our bags to the departure where the staff made a mistake and apologized proffussly, the staff is an example of how you should treat customers. Being Hilton gold we did get an upgrade to an executive room. Something not expeced but appreciated. The breakfast while a buffet was excellent and tasty. The lounge could get crowded mainly because of the cheapskates grazing on the free food. The shuttle to the Shinkuku station helps save the legs. On a clear day you can see Mount Fuji from the executive lounge, we had one partly clear day. I would not hestitate to stay here again I highly recommend this to hotel to anyone.

I normally stay in another hotel but the Hilton were offering great rates. The restaurants are pricy but great food. The train station is right under the hotel and next door is the Park Hyatt (I like the bar there from Lost in Translation). In the train tunnels, there's lots to explore like shops and eateries. I just returned from a quaint little sushi joint for lunch that was playing jazz. The only downfall I have, and even as a loyalty customer is they put me on the 8th floor where my view is a wall and the tennis courts. I guess for the price, this is the type of room you get. It's a shame because I'm here for 9 nights. The rooms are comfortable and the bathroom is fantastic - I even have a bath tub! But my favourite is the Japanese toilets. Beds are comfy and large, room is spacious. I'm here for work, so spending quite a lot of time in my room and the TV stations are limited in English. There's basically only one English channel that's Fox Movies and most of the movies are over 20 years old or B and C grade movies.

We thought this was a non smoking hotel and one of the reasons we booked it (serious lung disease). The Junisoh restaurant was such a bitter disappointment. Expensive food and extremely small dishes, tasteless food and poor service, we were left alone while other patrons received exemplary service (we assumed they were locals), we would have ordered more drinks but nobody came to our table and we had to actually hail a wait staff to ask for water who then seemed very put out that we hailed them!

Here the crowds were even larger, but the staff cheerfully welcomed us each morning & proptly ushered us to seats. The food selection was just unreal. I've never experienced such a bustling breakfast buffet, but it worked as the staff kept replenishing items and clearing tables.

They stayed they upgraded us to an executive room, but those are the same rooms as the regular rooms, and actually on a lower level than the one we looked at ore selecting on the app before we were upgraded. They said the room would be ready in 15 minutes which was nice although we were disappointed to be on a lower floor with no view from what we were expecting. Our view was of a white wall from a medical building next door. Anyway, our room was not ready in 15 minutes and they told us another 15 minutes. We asked again and they told us another 15 minutes. Finally after an hour our room was ready - this was after the check in time of 3. It was frustrating watching other people go directly to their rooms who were not Diamond members and on floors higher than us. The staff was not as friendly this time. No welcome gift in room compared to other Hiltons in Japan. No bathrobes in rooms.On the plus side, the WiFi is nice, air conditioning works great and the location is nice. About 15 minute walk to Shinjuku area.

I'm lowly Honors Gold but if I were Diamond, I'd have had a fit of epic scale. Rooms are clean but tired. Executive lounge was tastefully refreshed but over-crowded at breakfast so I opted for the restaurant downstairs. Great food selection. Packed to the rafters. Navigating the tightly laid-out buffet and returning to my table with a plate of food was nothing short of harrowing with all the instagrammers chronicling their morning meals.

The gym and pool were very good. I felt slightly disappointed that there was no mention of an upgrade ( and put on a relatively lower floor) but the hotel looked vey busy on the saturday night especially.) I was given a voucher for a welcome drink from the HH Diamond menu in the bar and chose a Kahula milk which was excellent and had a huge perfectly spherical ice cube in it which was a unique experience.The lounge on the 37th floor was excellent offering great breakfasts ( including a made to order omellette station and a fresh orange juice machine) , afternoon tea and snacks and evening snacks and drinks. In the main lounge the food was on 2 table which could result in a bit of congestion at peak times but it was ok and there was another lounge close but that was used when there was high demand ( I was invited to use that lounge once during my stay on a particularly busy evening)The main lounge had a number of counter chairs also which made good use of the space but not a comfortable as the tables. All the staff in the lounge were excellent and friendly and provided great service.I did have one minor incident as when I returned to my room one afternoon, I found a note from housekeeping apologising for breaking my Nivea roll on deodorant during housekeeping. I mentioned this in passing to the lounge staff who were very apologetic and took details of the brand and offered to get a replacement deodorant.I went out for the evening and on my return to the room there was a replacement japanese brand deodorant ( western brands would be very difficult to find I expect) , a note from the housekeeping manager and a small box of chocolates which I greatly appreciated. The lounge staff were apologetic the next morning when I went up for breakfast also.I loved the christmas decorations in the hotel and it is in a great position in Shinjuku.Checking out in the lounge, and the staff enquired about the rating I put on the survey (8 out of 10) and noted my minor comments and gave me another box of chocolates.I arranged for the bell desk to take my luggage downstairs and for a taxi to take me to the Hilton Tokyo Bau but ended up approaching the Hilton Odaiba ( we went over the Rainbow bridge as per normal but only realised we were heading to the wrong hotel as we turned inot the road leading to the Odaiba hilton with the hotel being visible. The taxi driver was apologetic and were were soon back on the express way to Tokyo bay ( the detoour only costing a few minutes and probably a thousand yen maximum in addtional travel distance which I was not that worried about)Overall a very good stay in a very busy hotel with excellent executive lounge staff to help make the stay memorable and look forward to returning in 2020.",Falkirk,87,4.0

The location is very convenient in that the airport limousine bus (after picking up luggage, head out to your left passed the tourist information booth is the orange ticket machine for airport limousine bus) from Haneda Airport stops directly in front of the hotel. We booked an executive jr. suite and with executive level privilege, there's separate check in area but we did not need to use for this purpose. Checking was smooth and upon learning that we have kids in tow, housekeeping the brought extra towels, bottled water and toiletries without asking. With executive room, Executive Lounge access with complimentary breakfast and evening cocktails were provided. We can either had breakfast in the executive lounge or the sumptuous buffet on the ground level. Both were fantastic with many choices of fruits, juices, Asian or Western flares. There're other restaurants on site as well but we did not have a chance to visit. If you're craving for ramen and local cuisine, there're several malls within walking distance. We walked over to the building next door and had ramen at Hakkata Ippudo and it was fantastic! While the Shinjuku shopping malls and department stores (Keio, Takashima, etc) can be reached on foot, the hotel provides shuttle service to the shopping mall areas which is a much needed reprieve from the sweltering summer heat. At night we also walked to Shinjuku Golden Gai's narrowed small alleys and tiny shanty style bars in contrast to the neon drenched ""gambling"" clubs and bars of the Red Lights District of Shinjuku (commonly known as Kabukicho). Even with teeagers in tow, we did not have any problems walking around the Red Lights District. We're more at awes at the neon flashing lights, the numerous vending machines (pasta in a can??), Robot Restaurant, and eventually stumbling into Piss Alley (Omoide Yokocho) which is lined with tiny restaurants frequented by locals after work.Sadly, our time only permits 2 nights at Hilton Shinjuku. The day before checking out, the executive lounge staff (Marie?) helped us finding our ways to Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan (taking and connecting multiple trains) and arranging to have our luggage transferred to Conrad Tokyo. The staff was at all times very courteous and helpful, all speak English (which is a huge improvement from what I remembered 16 years ago) and housekeeping keeps the property clean and is very responsive. Room is spacious even with such expensive Tokyo real estate. Location is convenient and within walking distance of malls, major attractions, restaurants, laundromats, etc. We would not hesitate to return and recommend our friends and family to stay here.","La Canada Flintridge, California",88,5.0

It is an impressive hotel with large, well maintained bedrooms but scratch the surface and it all is not as pretty as it seems. As a luxury hotel I expected something more but I've stayed in 3 star hotels in Japan offering similar standards for a lot, lot less. My particular bugbear, but not the only gripe, is their predilection for charging service fees on everything. Get a room upgrade, expect to get hit with a 13% service charge despite no mention of this. Get room service and bang there we go again. Everything has a hidden 13% smashed on top - and this in the heart of no tipping Japan. I stayed for six days and this adds up. And they don't take nicely to requests to remove it for poor service or pointing out it's not mentioned anywhere. And service is not great with a certain disdain in the bars and pretty lousy room service with a 30 minute wait. The main restaurant for breakfast is in the main lobby and is noisy. Not only because it is packed but because the marble foyer reverberates every sound. Get an invite to the executive lounge for breakfast, then expect the same cramped conditions and crowds but with a far smaller choice.The breakfast is pretty broad but is not that good and food getting cold is a problem.The hotel has two tennis courts on the roof but a tiny swimming pool. The gym is pretty good though. No sauna that I could see. The restaurants close at 10pm, except the burger and pasta bar which goes on for another 30 minutes. The Japanese restaurant closes at 9.30pm. Room service after 9.30pm is only for burgers, steaks and pasta. There are no restaurants around the hotel to speak of: it's in the business district. Nor anything else for that matter leaving you with a healthy 12 minute walk to the heart of Shinjuku.If you're planning to arrive by metro at Nishi-Shinjuku then get instructions on the way because there are no signs to the Hilton, although it is quite straightforward once you master things.

I am a diamond member. Told staff I was a diamond member when served in lobby, received no special assistance. Was no special dedicated check in area, had to line up with everyone else. At bfast in restaurant again was no special priority for diamond member had to wait with everyone else. They were offering people to sit in the bar/cigar lounge for bfast cause they were so busy. Who would want to sit in a dirty smelling smoke marinated room. Yuck. Can’t believe you still allow smoking in your hotels. I stayed on a non smoking floor but my sheets still smelt like cigarette. Fruit in the bfast restaurant was all canned fruit from a can. A Hilton hotel can’t provide fresh fruit only canned fruit? Ordered a egg omelette at omelette station. Egg was runny and still uncooked once I got to my table to eat it. Received an upgrade to a suite, carpet had multiple stains. Shower glass was very dirty. Another feature is u can see from the room through a glass partition to bathroom. It’s just covered with a cheap blind. If someone goes bathroom at night it fills room up with light cause blind doesn’t block out the light. Sliding window Japanese style blinds in room are wood and the wood is cracked and broken off around the railings. The lifts in hotel are a joke, so slow, so slow. There are 6 lifts, when u press the button for a lift only one lift lights up to say that that is the lift is coming. So one lift only is dedicated to come get you. What about the other 5? Surely another one could be quicker. Waited over 8 minutes for a lift. The gym are was closed from 8-12 on our check out day so couldn’t use it. No prior notice was given before check in. Hotel is quite far from main Shinjuku. They do provide a shuttle bus but not often enough.Don’t take airport limousine bus from Narita to hotel it takes way too long. Was 2.5 hrs in total.

Public transportation through nearby Shinjuku station will get you throughout Tokyo with ease. The food options at the hotel are both outstanding in quality and selection. The staff are some of best that Hilton has to offer. Details: I stayed at Hilton Tokyo for a week of work with the desire for visiting some sites. When I suggested a hotel in the Roppongi Hills area, he quickly talked me out of it for many reasons – one was the commute and train congestion in that area and the other was that, in his view, the area was “not so desirable” – he said “you’re diamond with Hilton, why not stay at Hilton Tokyo?” – I didn’t have an answer, other than there was a restaurant I wanted to try in the RH area, clearly I was not thinking straight. My stay at the hotel was exceptional from the minute I walked in the door. The staff are attentive, well spoken in many languages, patient and just overall nice people. Room: I booked a junior suite and was upgraded to an executive one-bedroom suite with views of Mt. Fuji. The room was large, comfortable and well appointed. I appreciated the VERY quiet, very efficient AC system in the room as well as the more-comfortable-than-usual-bed. The views out of the room were fantastic. And there was a Nespresso machine, which was utilized daily.Gym: I utilized the gym a few times during my stay. It is broken out into three areas, plus a pool and tennis court. There is a cardio area, a weight area and another mix cardio/weight area near the pool. The gym was never crowded, and I was always able to utilize all desired equipment during busy times. Restaurants: The ones I visited are located on the 2nd floor, where you will find choices including an outstanding sushi restaurant, a steak house and a Chinese restaurant. I only tried the sushi, which was beyond awesome, and overheard many other hotel guests at the bar (with live music!) just rave about how good their meals were at the other restaurants. The restaurants have an open feel, and it’s almost as if you can mix between them. The space is well designed, open, warm and inviting. Executive Lounge: Simply put, it’s the best at any Hilton property worldwide that I have stayed at. Breakfast options included an omelet bar, various breads and pastries, Japanese options as well as standard English breakfast options. The evening happy hour, which should be called happy-afternoon-evening, was equally well prepared, with options of champagne, red and white wines, a good beer selection as well as any hard alcohols. The food in the evening, as others have stated, can easily be enough for a meal should you choose to stay in for the night. Location: The hotel is an easy walk to Shinjuku station should you miss the shuttle that comes every 20 minutes. There is a pharmacy a couple blocks away should you need to pick something up, as well as the convenience store in the Hiltopia mall under the hotel.","Seattle, Washington",268,5.0

On the afternoon prior to check out our luggage was organised to be transferred to our next hotel in Kyoto, as we caught the bullet train. During our stay we discovered a 24 hour convenient store in Hiltopia, in the basement, which also had an ATM with English options.

With the World Rugby Championships going on all over Tokyo the hotel us totally booked with rugby fans from all over the world. It’s a little too raucous and crowded for my needs of winding down from two weeks golfing all over Honshu. The breakfast buffet is chaotic. However, the staff has handled it well. I enjoyed my upgraded room. The service is prompt and courteous. No complaints. The real complaint I have is that I booked the room months in advance with points and cash. However, I found out late one night there was a schedule change and I had to change it to arrive a day earlier on the Hilton website, but somehow I carelessly hit the wrong button and ended up having to pay all cash for an exorbitant nightly rate! I discovered my error within an hour when I got an change confirmation. I immediately contacted American Express about the error. I couldn’t get a hold of anyone at Hilton so I called the next AM I spoke to customer service(?). I got a totally indifferent employee that didn’t care about the mistake and repeated over and over in her bored vice that there is nothing that can be done. Totally detached from the problem. I asked for a manager or supervisor. The same old attitude problem. More or less her attitude was “tough S” and it wasn’t fixable no matter what I said or didn’t and that was that. I was told that I could cancel the reservation but either way I would have to pay for it in full. A great option. She said call corporate. So I called “corporate” at the same number. I got the same response from them. Then they said to call the hotel in Tokyo directly and see if they would help. No luck. I was told Hilton Tokyo can’t waiver the cancellation policy and mistakes are not a reason for mitigation. I was told to call Corporate. So it went on in a giant circle in the several hours I tried to talk logic to someone. The booking was weeks ahead and the mistake was brought up timely. Of course Amex was of no assistance. So I accepted it since it was my error to begin with. however, I do resent that the room rate is between double to triple the normal rate! As a courtesy the Hotel staff in Tokyo did upgrade me as a courtesy as a Gold member. My respect for the Hilton has dropped to an extreme low and I will resume bookings with Bonvoy instead. Hilton, you need to re-examine your policies to consider mitigation or relief under certain circumstances. Especially with the timing. I understand that you could loss revenue from cancelled booking etc. this wasn’t a cancellation but an alteration of an existing booking. Hilton, I hope you view this message and can respond to me.

They also left new water bottles every day, neatly cleaned the room and always left adequate supplies of soaps/shampoos/bath wash etc. Concierges were very helpful with restaurant picks, reservations, etc. The hotel is also in a great location, it’s only about a 10-15 min walk to the Shinjuku Train Station or you could take the Hilton shuttle that comes every 20 min or there’s always taxis waiting outside. Or a short walk to the Nishi-Shinjuku station, stairs to the station are right outside the hotel door or inside and transfer to where you need to go.

It gets very crowded here too, but we never waited more than a few minutes to be seated and the servers were very kind and attentive.I was concerned that the hotel may feel a bit out of the way from the main part of Shinjuku, and it was. However, this was not a problem as there is a stairway that connects the hotel to an underground subway, which connects to nishishinjuku station in about a 2 minute walk, and also connects to both the area around the Hyatt in one direction and to Shinjuku station proper in the other, which turned out not to be more than a 10 minute walk at a medium pace. The hotel does have a shuttle, but we felt no necessity to use it.There is also a conbini in the immediate Subway area for quick snack, sandwiches, etc., and a place for coffee, which wasn’t needed, due to the breakfast espresso choices being so good at the hotel.We were fortunate to also be offered a one time complementary sitting at the Japanese restaurant for Kaiseki breakfast one morning during our stay. It was also exceptional, and was located in a very modern, pretty restaurant on their mezzanine level, where we sat at the bar.We booked a standard room, but as gold members at the time, they were able to offer us an upgrade after the first night, to a slightly higher class room on the club level floor. It had a pretty view of the Shinjuku area and its neon, and was decorated nicely, with the paper window covering serving as a shield from both light and noise.We were also offered lounge access, of course, which is always astoundingly good in Asian countries. We had a choice to eat breakfast there, but chose to eat downstairs instead, for the full list of breakfast choices.There was an afternoon tea which had very nice cakes, cookies and puddings, and the beer choices from the evening lounge services were also available at this part of the day, and of course a full spread of evening hors d’ouvres which were expansive enough to make a meal out of, with many alcohol choices, ranging from various hard alcohols to an Australian version of Chandon champagne, which was our favorite.They have a overflow lounge for busy periods which is smaller and more exclusive and quiet. They reserve this for diamond members first, but depending on their client demographic at the time, you may be invited here. We were lucky enough to be given a key to this lounge on our third night, and got to experience this more exclusive service for the rest of our stay. The food and beverage offerings were the same but the service was more personalized, and the space lovely, elegant and quiet.Check-in was quick and efficient despite arriving at a busy time, and expediting our move to an upgraded room was handled with ease.

It's an upscale hotel in what is probably the most central area of Tokyo (Shinjuku). About a 5-10 minute easy walk to Shinjuku station (which gets you anywhere) and close enough to be right near the wild lights, crowds and popular area just north and east of Shinjuku station, without having to sleep in the middle of it. There's also direct access through an underground walkway from the hotel to a subway station which can connect you even quicker to Shinjuku station or anywhere else in Tokyo.Our room was comfortable and with all the amenities one would expect from a Hilton brand hotel, and it had a minimal Japanese styling to it so you get a bit of the feeling of where you're staying,We really lucked out having breakfast buffet included with our stay. Choices were extensive varying from western and Japanese offerings. There’s an omelet bar. The coffee was EXCELLENT and bold tasting. Fresh juices and creative juice mixes are available. Lots of bread options…lots for vegetarians. We’ve seen breakfast buffets at hotels all over the world, and outside of Las Vegas where buffets are at a whole other level, this was the best we’ve experienced. You could set yourself up with a completely different meal every day. The staff was attentive. Chefs were on hand to answer questions about ingredients and the dining area was comfortable, and although always highly populated, never felt over crowded. If you’re staying here, it’s well worth making sure the breakfast buffet is part of your deal.If we were able to return to Tokyo we wouldn't hesitate to stay here.

We found the location easily accessible due to the underground system (there is a 7/11 and Supermart in the station) but found the service slightly lacking, maybe because it is such a large city hotel that they are just not able to give that fine attention to detail that others can.

Location was great too being that it is walking distance to the metro subway and rather close proximity to a local garden/park for a nice jog in the morning to start the day.The breakfast buffet in the lobby every morning was especially a treat as it was complimentary for Hilton Honors Diamond members. A good mix of Western and Eastern offerings were on full display. Hence, going downstairs for breakfast is clearly the suggested recommendation over the somewhat limited offerings upstairs in the Executive Lounge. The complimentary shuttle bus service every half-hour to/from the Shinjuku station turnaround was extremely convenient and appreciated, especially during the hot and humid Summer days.For those trying to decide between the Hilton and Hyatt across the street, hands down, the Hilton is the way to go. Though a somewhat older property, the hotel is still nicely appointed and updated to continue to be relevant today in 2019.","Tucson, Arizona",22,5.0

Since we arrived late, I contacted the hotel to notify them of our late arrival, and they acknowledged via email promptly. The hotel is not far from Shinjuku station and is an easy walk even with suitcases. I would advise that one take the airport lime bus since the trains are still packed at 9:30/10:00 pm. Besides the stairs at Shinjuku station are a workout. We were upgraded to a larger room, and it was unique in that there was a glass partition dividing the shower/bath from the bed. And it was controllable from the outside, so fun to mess with people who like their privacy. Japanese toilets are interesting and once you got used to them, they make sense and US should have them.The common areas are very nicely appointed and the breakfast buffet was probably the best I have ever had, variety and freshness. Fitness room is nice but could have used some free weights and a functional trainer station.If I had one gripe it would be the crazy carpet pattern. Could be because we were still tired but swear if made us dizzy ;) Lastly the customer service outstanding. We had a lat flight out and stored our luggage. The manger on duty from England, (awesome young lady) provided us with some tips for the day, and just showed a genuine desire to talk to us about our stay.Without hesitation I would recommend Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku for the rooms, the food, the ambience, and for its prime location to the metro, train, and short walk to the sights of Shinjuku.","Chicago, Illinois",4,5.0

Housekeeping were excellent in their room presentation over the 6 days we were guests and we enjoyed two of the restaurants during the stay, food and service first class. As I have mentioned in previous posts my partner eats gluten free and especially welcomes gluten free bread for toast in the mornings. On the first morning I approached a staff member standing in the lobby saying hello to guests and mentioned about the gluten free bread, the staff member was in fact the General Manager of the hotel Mike Williamson. Yes I know, who knew General Managers of large hotels stand in the lobby and talk to guests. Mike understood my request for gluten free bread and over that day a large number of his team swung into action to assist us. The Marble Lounge Restaurant Manager Mami Yuguchi met with us along with her head chef and went through the steps they were taking while advising all hotel restaurants regarding the gluten free requirement. The hotel sourced gluten free flour and made a number of bread selections - quite simply service above and beyond. At the same time Food and Beverage Manager Eiji Kondo kept us informed and made our stay something special. Each morning chef Mr Nobuhiro would search us out with the daily gluten free bread and make sure everything was in order. Now having traveled a fair bit to many cities of the world this level of service from what was at the time a very busy hotel was something special. So if you are travelling I recommend to let the hotel now in advance if you have allergies and what they are. With regard to this Hilton - it looks very well prepared for the coming 2020 Olympics. The Hilton Tokyo is certainly worth your consideration for many reasons - a wonderful high performing team working to ensure your time in Tokyo is memorable - is just the start of it.

WOW I am so amazed by you Hilton, a international 5 star luxury hotel brand that do not have a room attendant after afternoon. Luckily I am work in a hotel and know it is a lie, but how dare you say this lie while you are representing Hilton. At this point I am completely disappointed with the “Hilton standard” which the staff can lie whatever they want to avoid any possible workload. And I questioned his lie of the off duty housekeeping team, he then find me a room at 9/f, although he did warn me that the room view will be so much worse but I don’t care, all I want is not see the hospital, so I gladly accepted the offer and going to my room and packed my luggage. After around 10 mins, the manager helped me with the membership program issue and a bell boy has come, and then the manager come to my room and walk to the window and asked me three time, which hospital, where is the hospital, so I explained my worries to him, he then told me that actually my room is not facing the hospital he then take out his phone and prove it from google map, although I am making the fool out of myself but since this room still making me uncomfortable, so I still want to change my room, but then the manger said the new room that they arranged is facing the hospital and convince me to still in the same room. I am sorry to bring so much trouble because of my own mistake, but this is ridiculous, two of the front desk do not know the view of this series at least they need to know which room will be facing the hospital and even the manger need to come to my room and stand by the window and watch the view and question me three time of the hospital and so then prove it with a google map.

We purchased a Luxury Escapes package which was loaded with value. It included a Junior Suite with Executive Lounge Access including breakfasts with live cooking stations, evening free-flow drinks with premium alcohol, afternoon tea, nightly canapes, free Wi-Fi and private check-in / check-out on the 37th Floor. Arrival to the Hilton was easy from Shinjuku JR station. Walk to KEIO bus station 21 (Shinjuku Sta West) were the Hilton have a free shuttle service departing Shinjuku every 20 mins. You can’t miss the bus as its black and has Hilton decals. Check in was smooth and professional. The Junior Suite room type itself was amazing!! It was huge , around 44m2! More than enough room for 3 people. We were on the 18th floor facing the city, the views have been dearly missed since coming back home! I highly recommend this room type as it gained free access to the Executive Lounge on the 37th Floor. Although access is not essential to having a great experience on your travels, the lounge did come in handy many times. The Executive Lounge gains you private check in/ check out avoiding large lines. You had the choice to eat buffet style bfast at the Executive Lounge or in the main buffet section on the lobby floor. You could access the lounge 24hrs a day. It offered a peaceful quiet setting with parallel dining wings with amazing views out toward the city. It offered free water, beer and juice , tea & coffee. Afternoon Tea every day with small selection of deserts. Selection of alcoholic beverages from 6pm-8pm. An area to kill time and watch the news or surf the net once checked out if your departure is late. All in all very nice perk included in our package. Room keeping did a great job every day. Concierge were friendly and the location was fantastic. One negative was the buffet lunch. It was underwhelming in my opinion due to the cost VS quality of food.

Sometimes is it perfectly fine. And that was the case at the Tokyo Hilton. First, a couple areas where they went above and beyond. The concierge is amazing. They assisted us with a number of reservations, essential for westerners hoping to dine at good restaurants without paying a service like Pocket Concierge, as reservations are mostly by phone. The spa area is spectacularly. No, it is not technically an onsen because there is no natural spring, but the space is competitive with actual onsens, as the bath area is lovely, the sauna is piping hot, and the staff are attentive. Hard to believe that that it is included at no extra charge.And the lobby and second floor bar/restaurant area are lovely to look at.That being said, the rooms are nothing particularly special. Large desks take up a lot of space in the standard rooms, and the decor is businesslike and drab. They are spacious by Japanese standards and the beds are comfortable, but I did expect something more for the luxury level pricing. Also, there really aren't any other perks for guests. The drinks and food are pricey (though competitive with nearby hotels -- Park Hyatt's are maybe 1.5 the price here). There is no complimentary breakfast and the breakfast buffet is very expensive, and there is no courtesy shuttle. The hotel limo service that offers transport to the hotels in the area is also expensive.Finally, this has no bearing on the review, but it should be mentioned that while other honeymooning guests have gotten upgrades, we didn't get one. I know upgrades aren't always possible given demand, and we did book through Expedia, but since we read reviews that said there were upgrades when we made our hotel decision, it should be mentioned that this isn't customary for every honeymooning couple.In review, the Tokyo Hilton hotel can be looked at as a very fine business hotel or a weak attempt at a luxury hotel. Go in expecting the former and you'll be pleasantly surprised. For true luxury in Shinjuku, I suspect the price of admission will be much higher than the $250/night we paid.",,47,4.0

Well our flt departs at 10pm tomorrow night and the late check out, after some negotiations, is 2.30pm. Hardly worthwhile. Our room. The remains of the previous guests rubbish behind the rubbish bin is poor but The 2000yen gin and tonic in a test tube size glass with no lemon, and the ‘free drink’ (which was actually part of the package) in the lobby bar that was all ice - very annoying.

Service came with a genuine smile and care. The room and amenities were fabulous. Cleanliness amazing. And to top it off, we were given a phone with internet, and free calls (international included) for our use the whole time.My message to retired travellers, do your homework, sometimes you can get better Luxury stays elsewhere.To the Hilton brand - just because we book via an online deal does not mean we do not spend a lot on travel.

We initially did not think to book the extra night, thinking that we could stay up and roam around in the city until the 3pm check in time. One week before we travel, we changed our mind and decided to book an extra night - and Hilton was really helpful and was able to get us a room (during Easter Peak season!)- although the room was at a lower class, but it was a room for us to rest up after our long flights! When we went out for lunch, the staff helped us to move our luggage to our intended room and we barely felt any inconvenience (if any) at all!Furthermore, as we were unable to book Sushi Jiro on our own, we have asked the hotel to help us in advance. With a small fee (3,000 yen) they went to the restaurant in person to help us to secure a reservation, although it didn't work out (it was fully taken by the restaurant's regulars, who have priority over tourists like us), the Hilton staff have given us other michelin star restaurant recommendations and have helped us to secure those bookings as well!

The hotel arranged for our large group to check in on an upper floor in one of the meeting rooms handing out welcome packages and room keys while handling our luggage. We were served buffet breakfast and gathered before tours in a conference room every day until the cruise ship sailed. The mornings were hectic and the elevators were pushed beyond capacity resulting in long waits and grumpy guests. One morning my husband walked from the 24th floor down to the 3rd or 4th floor to the meeting room for our tour. Walking down the stairs wasn’t an appealing option for me since I’m recovering from a broken leg but I considered it when the 3 full elevators stopped and left a growing group of us. Eventually we got on an elevator going up and just rode it up to the 31st floor and then down. It was an inconvenience exacerbated by jet lag. This is the only negative thing I can say about the hotel. The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful even when dealing with frustrated guests. The shuttle bus running from the hotel to the Shinjuku train station was convenient and made getting around so easy. The signage with the schedule and location of pick up was excellent. Breakfast was delicious and I appreciated being able to get eggs made to order as well as pancakes. Our room was comfortable and clean. The views were great. We stored snacks purchased in the convenience store in the arcade in the mini fridge. My husband and I slept well in the comfy bed and quiet surroundings. The tv channel selection left a little to be desired but we were thrilled to be able to watch most of the final round of The Masters golf tournament even narrated in Japanese. Some things just don’t need to be translated.The concierge recommended an excellent restaurant and gave the taxi driver directions. The hotel supplied map was excellent and all we needed to get around on our own when we weren’t on a tour. I would definitely stay here again but I would probably ask if any large groups were in the hotel and adjust my schedule and expectations accordingly.

I did not like tge lounge set up, as there were two separate lounges and sometimes the food options were different. The staff was very nice and professional but they seemed understaffed/overwhelmed. Perhaps it was due to the hotel being full for Golden Week, but there was lots of laspe in service. For example, the soup spoons and bowls ran out and no one replaced them for 15-20 minutes during evening cocktail time. We put our names on the wait list for lounge use due to the lounge being full and were not called back until an hour later. Also, we did not get any recognition for being Diamond.

This time however (4-nights stay May 1-5) was not good as the hotel appears to be unable to deal with full occupancy. Hilton Diamond ""upgrade"" at check-in to a so-called corner room rather than a suite was understandable since this is a busy period, except that the corner room (1829), is not in a corner at all and as far as I can tell is no different from the other rooms on that floor. Housekeeping is not available after 6:00PM (surprising for a hotel of this category) and repeatedly failed to show up when called within their business hours (had to call 3 times today before they finally came). The renovated Executive lounge looks the same as the previous lounge and every single day there was a line to get in. I got seated at the ""counter"" (i.e. no table available) every night, caught a cold from the aircon that was blasting next to the only place where I was allowed to sit (at some point I moved to an empty table and was politely asked by an attendant to get back to my counter seat, which is unbelievable). Cocktail hour is from 6PM to 8PM. As I came in at 6:40PM tonight I was asked ""do you need to be seated?"", then ""can you wait in your room and we will call you because we are full""? After I explained that the cleaning staff was in my room because they forgot to come earlier and so I could not wait there, a counter a seat magically appeared (next seat remained empty). Overall a very disappointing stay, I hope this is an exception due to the holiday week-end. And whoever renovated the lounge should have thought of a better design, there is just no place to sit while tables for 4 are routinely occupied by single travelers who arrived early.

As Diamond Club members, we were informed at check-in that the executive lounge was being remodeled. To compensate for it, the hotel instead provided access to a great bar for happy hour and access to the buffet breakfast in the morning for food. The food options were really good, and fresh, however, not as fresh as our stay at Osaka Hilton. This replacement for the executive lounge was awesome. We stayed at a property in Houston where the executive lounge was also undergoing renovations. The Hilton property gave us some soda and bag of chips and thought that was the same. It wasn't.

One thing we noticed in the lobby is the lack of seating. Perhaps this is due to the the restaurant taking up a rather large portion of the lobby. There are many enough seats for 7 people in the lobby and while everyone is waiting for shuttles, limo busses, etc, there's a lot of people standing around for long periods of time at times. Other than that, the staff are very polite and helpful. I think almost all of them spoke english which was helpful and convenient as english speaking foreigners. The lobby is also very nice in general with a little section with baked goods as well. There is a complimentary shuttle that runs around every 20 mins from the hotel to shinjuku station. If we were planning to take the subway at shinjuku station, we would just go to the subway station below the hotel (M09), which is just one stop after shinjuku station (M08). It cuts down any time you have to wait for the shuttle and it's definitely less busy at the subway under the hotel (I believe it's called Nishi-Shinjuku Station). So depending on our situation, we utilized both the shuttle and the subway under the hotel.There are also a bunch of vegan options at restaurants at Shinjuku station for anyone who needs one, because you won't find any options at the hotel. The rooms were okay, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was a little awkward in that it was small and if you were trying to open the shower door, it's a very tight situation in there. Most hotel rooms in Tokyo are small. Still, I have stayed at another hotel that I think the bathroom space was better. Last time I stayed in Shibuya and I think if I was back, I might stay in Shibuya again over this location just because it seems more convenient where you can walk to everything in Shibuya. Even though Hilton offers a shuttle, it's just not as convenient to just walk outside to everything. So in the end location does matter.

It has an underground walkway to the no 7 Nishi Shinjuku stop on the Marunouchi line and Oedo line (but I prefer walking above ground to the stops - it's a leisurely 5 minute walk to the stations). It is a 10 minute walk to Shijiku station and the Kabuchiko area (lots or restaurants/stores/clubs etc) It is so accessible and convenient and there is no need to take a cab or uber to get to where you want to go. They have a very knowledgeable concierge staff who have made restaurant resservations for me way before my arrival. And this has made my trips to Tokyo less stressful and more enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the Marble Lounge is top notch! They provide Japanese and Western dishes and there is an abundance of food that you won't get bored for a week. For this stay I had requested, the concierge to make reservations at Yakiniku Jumbo. I would like to extend thanks to Ms. Arakawa, Ms. Sato and Mr. Nakamura for securing the reservation. The Concierge team has always assisted me in reservations even during my previous stays. I would also like to thank Ms. Chieni at the Concierge for assisting me in getting a prescription medication.Thank you for the delightful experience and I look forward to the reopening of the Executive Lounge before my next trip!","Chicago, Illinois",49,5.0

We were a couple of days early, but still were able to enjoy some blossoms in the park nearby. The hotel is super busy all the time. The lobby has way more action going on than most hotels, every day there was a 50+ person lineup for their afternoon tea. With this kind of trade, there is little need to go beyond for your customers. So no upgrades, no late checkout, and not even a club lounge to visit. I'm not saying it was unprofessional or mismanaged, exactly the opposite; this hotel is a well-oiled machine that churns guests through with few hiccups. You don't go away feeling that anything was missing, nor do you get a feeling of being special. But for me, when I am spending more than $700 USD a night for a hotel, I generally find I go away feeling special or recognized in some way. I'll have to come back to Tokyo to see if that's the norm of the culture or just this hotel. Concierge was knowledgeable about the area and the shuttle to the train station was particularly useful. The room was a large suite for Japan, with a very comfortable king-sized bed and a huge shower with strong pressure and hot water. The tiny tub was only good for bathing children. Having two chairs at the desk was very useful for my wife and I both to be able to work on our computers, but the window blinds made the room have a bit of a prison like effect. I didn't get to try the pool, but had a feeling based on the buzzing activity at mealtimes in the hotel, that the guests in the pool would be like dumplings boiling in a pot.We took the train in from the airport and the limobus back. I have to say the train is the better choice if you suffer from car sickness.","Shanghai, China",76,3.0

The drive is about 2 hours and will cost >$200 USD. If you book in advance, you can get a set rate of about $150 but still is not the way to go. The best choice is, after going through customs, look across the walkway to the left and get in line for the Limousine Bus service. For $29, you get a comfortable drive to the hotel getting dropped right in front. Maybe takes an addition 15-20 minutes but a great value!

There were definitely lots of people who werent hotel guests who specifically came for the buffet. Originally when we arrived we tried to book for our third night to have dinner here but was told the only place available was side table sitting side by side. We didnt think this was ideal and the staff went above and beyond to get us a very nice table for two in the end. Very impressed. Back to our actual stay at the hotel... when we arrived, the place was definitely buzzing but not overly busy that we have to wait for long. This was for our last leg in Japan and we had stayed in other hotels around and we found Hilton has the best bed and pillows! It is no surprise as our family always trust the Hilton brand and stayed with Hilton whenever we travel. In the first night, there was plumbing issue that cAuse a lot of inconvenience. The toilet were rattling every time so often which interrupted our sleep significantly that night. Engineering was called around 11ish and they couldnt replicate the problem because it happen so randomly (and loud) that u just cant wait for it unless it happen, i did took a video to show them the issue so that it didnt look like i was imagining it. The reception offered to move our room right away but we refused because it was very late and tbh im super exhausted and wishing this will go away(it didnt). And surely enough the pipes keep rattling loudly all night at random intervals. By about 5am i was fed up and went to the lobby and decided to take up their offer of moving room but i said i need time to pack up first. I then tried to catch up on some sleep time as much as i can (no luck) until we have to go to our activity at 8am, by that time our luggage are now fully packed and we are ready to move room. So the staff said that i can come pick up our new room key later this afternoon and our luggage will be moved to the new room while we are out and about. Nice.In the evening, we were moved to a corner room at a higher floor which is bigger than the original room we were given and no plumbing sound. I do appreciate the bigger space though i specifically go for Hilton hotels for their bed mainly. We were sleeping so comfortably that night and the following night.I think that while issues do come up here and there, what makes a hotel great is their ability to resolve their hotel guests problem. And in this very case they did and we were very satisfied with the result despite the interrupted sleep on the first night. Overall i find the staff very helpful and speaks english very well.Also, location wise this hotel is connected to the nishi shinjuku station so i can catch a train down from basement, i also walked to shinjuku station (catching pokemon) without much effort in terms of distanxe. There is also a hilton free shuttle every 20 minutes to and from Shinjuku station which makes this hotel very convenient.

There is also a free shuttle bus to take you from the hotel to the middle of Shinjuku town central.

Polite and friendly and I noticed that they do take away the cups and glasses to be replaced or washed. Even though we booked 3 suite rooms and all were on the same floor - the rooms were different. Some were larger with smaller bathrooms and one was smaller with a larger bathroom. The biggest complain we have would be the breakfast - although the spread was okay with some western choices and Japanese / Asian choices, it wasn’t as good as some other 5 star hotels that we have been to. In addition, there was no variety. It was the same thing on a daily basis. Maybe we have just been spoilt by other 5 star hotels and the expectation on this is higher.The strawberry buffet for dinner was very good though.Is this a good hotel for a stay in Tokyo - I would say that yes it is if you wanted a good hotel in a quieter location in Shinjuku.

However, I wish I could say the same about our return 2019 stay.From start to finish, the hotel just didn’t deliver. We are Hilton Honours members but booked a Luxury Escape 5 night club room package on this occasion. We arrived at the hotel to be told our room was ready, however 10 minutes later that changed and we were told we would need to wait 2 hours. We headed out and returned back later in the afternoon, only to wait over 60 minutes for bags due to miscommunication (three times!) between the front desk and the concierge team. To top it off, we were informed that the Club Lounge was “shut for renovation” until April. The hotel created a make-shift lounge in one of the bars but it just wasn’t the same and the ambience was terrible.The room could best be described as “ok”. It was certainly nothing special, the bed was firm (we asked to switch but were told it was the softest bed they had) but for the money we paid, you couldn’t help but feel disappointed at the size and layout. The positives were water pressure in the shower and the amenities. The restaurants are over-crowded and despite a wonderful breakfast selection, the breakfast period was like feeding time at the zoo with far too many people. We tried to make reservations several times for dinner (in the morning, not at the last minute) and were told we could not be accommodated. We leveraged a teppanyaki dinner included as part of our Luxury Escapes dinner but were left feeling hungry and disappointed once more at the quality of the dishes. The location of the hotel is good - it’s still a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway and probably 10-15 minutes to Shinjuku station, but we enjoyed the walk. We left the Hilton after 5 nights and both agreed that it was a disappointing experience. The hotel just couldn’t seem to get the little things right. There were a few outstanding team members who did their best to rectify the issues but it just wasn’t a great stay.

The Executive Lounge is small, dark and crowded. If you are not the first ones in there, you will probably have to queue or go to another restaurant for breakfast. Thankfully they offer to phone you when a table is available for canapés. Staff are very professional and English proficiency is high amongst staff. One of the best meals we had on our entire 2 week Japan holiday was at the restaurant Junisoh. We enjoyed the sets and different cuts of steaks with sake at the teppanyaki section. It was excellent. The hotel has a bus to Shinjuku and back but we did not use it as the shops closed early on NY eve and closed on NY day. You can walk to a couple of train stations from the basement of the Hilton but it can be 10 to 15 minutes. Tokyo train lines can be confusing so do ask the concierge for help (they are very helpful) or whip out your phone and find the best way using a map. Otherwise, just take a taxi. ",Asia,115,3.0

So our expectation of the brand and level of service is different. Hilton Tokyo is a disaster. Location is far (walking) from any nice restaurants and commercial areas. Always a long subway ride and walk away. Second, the front desk is horrible in giving the WiFi password and checkin anyone in. Lines are too long. WiFi is slow, too. To the room, the furnishings is old and outdated. Tv is old, the desk has bad design that will stub your toe and the worst part is the toilet we had did not have a seated seat. Even the mall toilet or the lower star hotel we stayed in had a heated toilet seat. But not the toilet in Hilton 36th floor. The gym also is like a tiny 10 sqm of free weights. It’s pretty much like a treadmill and elliptical room and swimming pool. A joke to be called a gym.So that’s the main issues location, room and services all with failing marks.

Executive check in was professional. We were served drinks whilst we waited for check in. The lounge had views across to the mountains and tokyo sky line. As we checked in around 11 they had sandwiches, cakes and pastries on offer, with juice, soft drinks, tea and coffee available.We had an executive junior suite room 825 on the 8th floor, quite close to the lift. Despite this we didn’t hear a thing and didn’t see any one else get on or off the floor, it was as we were the only ones on the floor. The room is quite big by tokyo standards. A roll away bed was put in place for our son and we still had room with a large couch setting. We were surprised to see a nice card and some biscuits from the hotel celebrating out wedding anniversary. The staff in the lounge remembered us each time we went there.With lounge access we could choose from the lounge, the marble restaurant on the ground floor or the Japanese breakfast on level 2. the executive lounge staff were more than happy to book the Japanese breakfast for us as they only run at 7, 8 and 9. The Japanese breakfast comes in a tiered bento boxes with a great deal of thought put into the presentation. It wasn’t as filling as a buffet breakfast but is definitely worth a try. The marble lounge was quite busy on both mornings we tried it. It had a mix of western and Japanese dishes like the standard fair of baked beans, hash browns. Juices were limited to orange, apple and grapefruit, however there was a smoothie station at the back which was a nice surprise. We like the made to order ramen and egg stations, they even had soy lattes you can order, However, the marble lounge and executive lounges seemed to be quite hectic. The evening canapés were a bit mixed, the pasta salad and rice salad were nice. The make your own salad was also great, but there wasn’t much of a Japanese flavour to the food on offer. Each evening changed though there were the same basic salads etc. the only thing lacking was a desert corner. The chandon, wine and hard liquor were busy corners of the lounge. Tip – go here before 6 to get a table. Saturday night was busy and we had to go back to our room to wait for a call when an empty table became available. The lounge layout is divided into 2 sections. The section on the right has windows facing mt fuji. We were lucky enough to see my fuji early one morning from the executive lounge.We used the pool and although it was small we were fortunate to time our visit where there wasn’t any one there so our son enjoyed the pool to himself. The staff at the fitness centre checkin was friendly and spoke good english.The shuttle service to Shinjuku station is quite handy and very efficiently run especially on cold mornings and evenings. The hotel is also connected via an underground walk way to both underground stations - nishi-shinjuku and Tocho-mae (about 3-5 mins away for both).There was no turn down service as you might expect from a five-star hotel.We like the Evelyn and crabtree verbena and lavender bathroom products.

The range of food at the executive lounge from noon to evening was limited and of average quality. There was a staff who went around refilling the guests' glasses and having small talks with them and these guests happened to be of the same race. It was probably because those were regular guests or maybe they just happened to be having the same drink.Buffet dinner - Range of alright, could be better. Tips:If you wish to try the buffet dinner, make your reservation earlier, say a day in advanced.Do try the Japanese breakfast if you have the option.Is this the best Hilton? Not too sure about this since we have seen better elsewhere. However, it has served its purpose. The complimentary shuttle and room size are plus points. Executive lounge......can give it a miss.

The room costs the same whether there are 2 of you or 1 of you but that is then not reflected in the club lounge charges and it should be. People who are by themselves should be able to have free club benefits for others because the costs would still be less than having a second person in the room and them having breakfast, afternoon tea, drinks, beer/wine and dinner every day v's a cup of coffee!I had to negotiate with them that their excuse that it gets busy was not based on reality as the lounge was empty after breakfast and before dinner when my meetings happened.The lounge is being refurbished apparently. It needs it.Not especially customer focused though as I am sure the extra charges will still apply.The gym is very limited. There is no cycling of any kind only running and cross trainers. The weights section is very small, only 2 people at a time can use the limited number of weights and there is no additional equipment.The rooms are small and bathroom is not well designed.I know it's Japanese culture but cutting all the windows in half is bizarre when most of your audience are not Japanese. It makes everywhere much darker and means less people can see the views.Some of the staff in the lounge were very nice and very helpful, others more jobsworthy.The cleaning was also bizarre, the room gives a teapot with strainer but no leaves so I put a teabag in and the cleaners didn't empty...maybe they thought I liked cold stewed tea!One of the great things about the Hilton was the range of bars and restaurants which is extensive and to suit all tastes.

Prior to our visit we had a few emails with the manager Albert, which was really helpful and he was very kind to assist us. The location actually turned out to fine, the shuttle bus was easy to get and there were two smaller stations super easy walk away and the walk to the main Shinjuku station was only 20 mins. We got the airport limo bus, which I would highly recommend, as it drops you right to the door and staff help you with your bags immediately. We had been tempted to get the train, but so glad we took the hotels advice and booked the bus. Stress free and comfortable easy journey. Check in was smooth, our room wasn't quite ready which was fine, but Ernesto a manager was on hand and went out of his way to get a room that was ready for us. This was really appreciated. We were pleased with our room. We had an upgrade to a junior suite and it was specious and modern. the bathroom was particularly great. We also ordered Yukata robes for use in the room, which was so comfy I really wish I'd bought one! As diamond members we had use of the executive lounge. In general this was good. There was a good selection of food and drinks in the evening and a lovely afternoon tea in the afternoons. Breakfast there was also great. In fact we only did the main breakfast room once in our stay, preferring the executive lounge the rest of the time, which is usual for us as we have very different breakfast tastes we usually find we need the main lounge to both get what we like! Staff in the lounge however were quite mixed. We didn't find those on in the afternoon or evenings particularly friendly. They clearly know who the regulars are and spent a lot of time chatting to them and helping them. Only giving us limited help when we asked and moving on to others they knew. I can understand this to some extent, however it does make you feel like a second class citizen in a hotel you've paid a lot of money for. The only exception to this was Waku who worked the morning breakfast shift. He was so friendly and helpful and chatted to us, giving us tips and making sure we were comfortable. We didn't eat in the restaurant apart from breakfast, so can't really comment except to say breakfast was delicious. We also had drinks in the cocktail/jazz bar one evening which was great.Overall we enjoyed the hotel and would like to return, but we did stay in a significantly cheaper hotel in an easier location for our second tokyo trip.

Tokyo is a huge city so deciding where to stay can be a daunting task. We were fortunate that the Tokyo Hilton fit the bill. The hotel is located in the Shinjuku district of the city. It’s is a commercial, retail and entertainment hub with countless options located within walking distance. The hotel is directly connected to a metro line and Shinjuku Station is less than a 10 minute walk. The hotel is a stop on the bus lines that run directly to both Haneda and Narita airports. A great option. The hotel itself provided an upscale experience. I would not call it luxury as it did not have an air of exclusivity, but it was nice. Check-in was fast. Our room was on a high floor and offered a lovely urban view. The room was nice, and clean. We had a city view junior suite. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The linens were nice. Temperature control of the room was easy. The room had a Nespresso coffee machine which was restocked daily. The bathroom was a little small but it had everything we needed. It also had one of those high-tech Japanese toilets that requires a tutorial if you plan to try out the many different functions. I have two areas of dissatisfaction with the room. The first was there was no comfortable chairs for sitting. What was there lacked backs and they were too deep. They looked stylish but were not functional. My second issue was the lack of sound proofing between the rooms. I could hear EVERYTHING coming from the guest room adjacent to my bedroom. I do not expect that in an upscale hotel. The hotel has four restaurants and two bars and is walkable to any kind of food and nightlife you would want. Of note, one of the bars is a smoking bar. Not complaining. Just saying. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member we had access to the Executive Lounge. As far as lounges go at non-US properties it was not one of my favorites. Quite simply, it is too small for how many people are using it. There were times at breakfast and in the evening when you had to wait for a table. The tables were also very close together. I also didn’t like that at 9pm the lounge is closed and you have to leave. For people looking for a convenient, reasonable priced upscale option in Shinjuku I would say the Hilton is a decent option.

I have been to better lounges under the Hilton brand elsewhere. Perhaps this needs some leveling up. Otherwise, the staff were all friendly and provided excellent service.Breakfast at the Marble Lounge was also a busy affair. It could be chaotic, but you can get a wide variety of food choices there. I like they specially prepare the fruity yogurt shakes in small glasses.

Very good business class hotel, with a good executive lounge for Honors members. The breakfast options were very good, all fresh, all presented pleasantly. In the evening, you have to be there 5-7pm for the happy hour to get pre-dinner snacks. These were OK, but not sufficient to allow you to skip dinner afterwards. The rooms were clean and neat, housekeeping did a great job straightening our mess. The hotel is close to transportation, shopping, and to the Shinjuku area, and it is also quiet and a little away from the action, so it isn't too noisy.For getting around, there is an underground shopping area access by stairs near the lobby restaurant. There is a mini-mart there for light snacks and any toiletries, and you can also access a walking tunnel to take you to the nearest metro station (you really want to take that instead of walking to Shinjuku station, which is large confusing and busy). In fact, there are tunnels connecting things all through the area of the hotel, which are god options to get around without worrying about traffic, crossing streets, etc.One last advantage of the hotel is that it is a regular stop for the airport bus to Narita or Haneda. Unless you want to spend a lot more, or be a lot more frazzled by using public transportation, this is the best option from either airport.","San Diego, California",25,4.0

I was expecting some tired 1972 hotel luxury but the Tokyo Hilton (even though it's cheaper than the Conrad Tokyo) is very nice, and quite recently built. Our bathroom (in Room 2519) included a huge unified 6' shower stall and massive porcelain soaking tub, so that during a shower you can stretch your arms out in many directions. You have to close up a modesty panel so that the person in the bed room section can't see directly into the windowed shower! The Hilton Tokyo (In the Shinjuku area) is halfway between two nearby subway stations, on different lines. Once you're free of your luggage, you can get to either of them from underground passages entered from the (modest) Hiltopia Mall-which has a stairway to the Hilton lobby. You have to go outdoors for no-stair subway access. We rolled our bags to the Tochomae station elevator. This is past the Hyatt front stairs entrance, and by TMG Tower #1, Observatory entrance. (That popular FREE observatory has a massive line, so we never went up.)We particularly liked the massive lobby breakfast buffet, but it's no bargain if you have to pay for it. When we don't have time for serious restaurant-going, we sometimes book Executive Rooms and subsist on free heavy hors d'ouvres for dinner. That worked fine here. The executive lounge is a rabbit-warren of multiple rooms, with not enough window seats. The staff doled out the window seats like restaurant hosts. The food was fine, but not a huge variety. It was very busy in the lounge, but we got the food and wine we needed.","Bergen County, New Jersey",264,4.0

Decided on the Hilton Tokyo. Must say this was the third Hilton we stayed in this year around the world and after this stay will be the last as we notice they all have poor sound proofing and provide poor sleep. Stayed four nights and initially booked a king Deluxe. Last minute upgraded to executive room and got a twin. Was a newly renovated room with nice looking washroom. Wall along the back if the washroom was glass and could move to see the room. Provides more light to the washroom. Room felt a bit small with the two twin beds. Hotel is in good location and has a shuttle to shinjuku station every 20 minutes. Provides easy access to food and shopping. Also has lower mall with a 24 hour store for food, drinks and amenities. Lower mall has an Italian and Indian restaurant. Also easy access to two subway lines. Unfortunately the sound proofing is not great. All night I could hear the upstairs guest stumping around his room. Could also hear occasional bangs when they would open the closet door or minibar door. I noticed this in our room when I opened the closet door. Complained and moved rooms to a higher floor on the 37th floor. Was not a renovated room but felt bigger as bathroom was smaller. Still poor sound proofing as could hear guests walking and opening snd closing doors. Two nights of poor sleep. Moved again to the 38th floor which is also not renovated. 37 and 38 floors will be renovated in 2019. Unfortunately still noisy from side guests. Anytime anyone opens the closet or minibar door you will hear a loud bang. Heard another guest complain about the same at the breakfast one morning. Executive lounge is good size and offers some food and drinks. Breakfast can be taken here or Marble buffet or a smaller Japanese breakfast in the sushi bar. Only has 15 seats so more quiet and intimate. Buffet is basic and not awesome, just average. Lounge is quiet during the day but at cocktail hour becomes a drink fest with loud boisterous tourists. Could hear conversations from other guests all the way down the room. People would drink and one group of three had 8 Asahi beer cans sitting on their table at one point. Staff try to clean but at times tables can be left uncleaned for a long period. No class either as I saw many people in shorts and flip flops (in November!!). Had the seafood buffet in Marble restaurant. Made reservations and asked to be seated away from the bar which allows smoking. Host wanted to seat us right in front of the bar when we arrived. I stated we had asked to be away from the bar and he replied all those other tables were reserved Yeah, we had a reservation too. He finally checked and moved us far away. We asked about a table and said it was reserved. People did not show up until 2 hours later and these were no even hotel guests. Many people in the restaurant were local young Japanese females out with friends. Who else comes with umbrellas and jackets. Did not see many people that looked like guests and restaurant was 1/2 empty. Overall the staff was nice and supervisor to the lounge apologized and helped us with the noisy rooms but I would not stay here again. Lobby is always busy and reception is always crowded. Hotel is too noisy in the rooms from poor sound proofing and too many guests. Too many other options to pick from in Tokyo that allows you to get a good sleep. Do not recommend this hotel to others Had a better stay at the Mercure Ginza. ","Toronto, Canada",70,2.0

We were informed by her that it was comfortable. The king bed was firm, but not as bad as we've heard they can be in Japan. The room was very nice and spacious but our bathroom was very small. Not a lot of wiggle room or counter space. This was our only negative experience in the stay. It was clean and stocked with nice towers and amenities. Water bottles were provided each day. We did miss the signature chocolate chip cookies. Not sure if they are served or not. They were not offered. The bathroom did have a window to the room with the blinds on the outside of the bathroom which gave our teen some pause.

We were in our room 10-15 minutes after we arrived.Room: Our room was a Junior Suite, around 44 square meters, which is quite spacious by Japanese standards. It is an open concept suite so there were no division between the living room and the bedroom. The windows are done in Japanese style and there are two Yukata available in the drawer. The bathroom has a tub and standard Japanese toilet.Executive Lounge: The lounge may, at first, seem small but it's actually spacious divided by a small hallway. Drinks are excellent with many options especially during cocktail hours. Also has a nice selection of premium teas. I heard that they will be renovating it by January so it can only improve from thereon.Breakfast: Since we had lounge access, we had three breakfast options. First at the lounge, second at the full buffet at Marble Lounge on the ground floor, and third at Junisoh Japanese restaurant at the 2nd floor. We tried them all during our five days of stay. The lounge has good enough option and it's definitely less crowded than the Marble Lounge--but the Marble Lounge has more options. Junisoh breakfast is a must try for those wanting to learn a little bit about the Japanese Diet Philosophy of eating only up to 80%. It's a bento box style that's best enjoyed slowly and with great relish.Service: Service was topnotch. During our last two nights, which fell on a weekend, the lounge during cocktail hours was quite crowded but they managed to seat everyone at a reasonable time. They were also helpful in providing us maps, directions, and the Concierge let us borrow an umbrella during one day when it rained.Getting Around: There is a shuttle going to and from Shinjuku station every 20 minutes so it's not a hassle.

Both in the same both,so Im speaking generally for both stays, just different rooms.Check inThe moment you enter the hotel, there is a sweet smell all over the place in the lobby. The lobby its very big and there was a lot of managers doing check in, so we didn't wait. RoomsSuperior roomWe were 3 persons sleeping in different beds, so it was a bit crampy. We used the hotel only for sleep and shower, since we went sightseeing all day. It wasn't that bad, but still, expensive for the room we get. Amenities in the room included coffee (nescafe was a great one) and tea. No cream, so we bought our own.Upgraded to executive suite for 2nd stay.This room was a way more big that the superior room,only downsided, was that it meant to be for the 2 queen beds, and has amenities like a big sofa with huge coffee table in the middle. I imagine it would be very nice if we only had that 2 beds, but we asked for a 3rd bed and the layout was super weird. We were moving all the room to see the best fit for our little 2 night stay.Amenities in the room included a fancy nespresso coffee machine, plus the amenities from the superior room.BedsThis is one of the best rollaway beds I had in an hotel.It was super comfortable!Breakfast buffetOne day we had the prix fix menu at the marble lounge. It was super good portioned. It included cereal, fruit, pastries, yogurth, juice, coffee or tea etc. I didn't finished the whole thing.Another day, had the breakfast buffet at same location, but choose the buffet. It was so good. With oriental and occidental choices. I personally loved the skinny french toast, was amazing!Shuttle serviceSuper punctual, fast and efficient.Business centerThere was 2 macs and 2 windows pc. One of the macs was very slow and the windows one was out or order.Concierge serviceThey were very helpful. From lent us an adaptor,to had several baggage taken care of for 9 days until our return to the hotel. They also provided timetables and reservations for the airport limousine between other stuff.The areaAs others says, this is not the Shinjuku area you see on tv. Its a little far away from it, but for that you have the shuttle service.We found the area good to stay, since it was very peaceful and had a super market open 24 hrs. just 2 blocks away.Also, had several cafes around and a Dennys restaurant.There is a park almost in front of the hotel (Central park Shinjuku) which was small but lovely.

On a positive note the bed was really comfortable! The breakfast was good but was extremely busy. Reception staff had limited to no English so when we asked where to transfer our pre paid voucher into a JR pass we were given another map with railway stations marked. After a day of going from station to station ticket officer to ticket office we were extremely confused and exhausted. The front desk staff were off hand and showed no interest. I think they should get assistance from someone who can speak a little English to help. Finally we approached a gentleman who was the only staff member who understood what we were talking about and along with a very helpful man from concierge went out of their way to help us find the correct location. The hotel is a long way from restaurants so therefore you have to use the hotel facilities and pay exhorbitant fees of around 24% in taxes in service fees and consumption on top of very high prices in food. The Zetta bar was the same having staff with limited English and Off hand and not friendly. . If you pay such high rates you expect service and a pleasant evening but not so at this Hilton.

It was definitely a good place to end the trip. Though it wasn't the most luxurious of the hotels we'd stayed in, it certainly lived up to the Hilton name. We'd arrived at the hotel early and were pretty sure we weren't going to get a room right away, but they got us a room immediately, which was great because it allowed us to rest for a little bit before exploring Shinjuku.The hotel itself is in a great location, close to all sorts of awesome sights, places to shop, and restaurants. You really can't beat the location! The room was a good size considering it was in Tokyo and the bathroom was very nice and clean. The breakfast was very nice, with a good selection of different kinds of food, though it's very clear it caters to a western clientele. The entire hotel is very obviously catering to westerners and has an American feel to it, which is I suppose to be expected considering it's a Hilton. That being said, we had dinner at the japanese restaurant on our last night and it was one of the best meals of our trip. They even had wagyu beef, which my boyfriend absolutely loved. I'm a pescatarian so I stuck to the set meal with sushi in it. Though I did notice that I had told the server I didn't eat meat and yet the appetizer served to me had chicken in it. I suspect this was more my bad for not being more specific, though- maybe she thought I meant only red meat. The appetizer was such a small part of the meal though, I just gave it to my boyfriend and happily ate the rest of my food, no problem. It was also very helpful that the hotel offers a shuttle service to the airports. It isn't free and I believe it's more expensive than taking the train there, but in my opinion it was worth it for the convenience of it. That way we didn't need to worry about taking the trains with all our luggage, or any uncertainty about timing, since they knew exactly what length of time it'd take to get there (it's about two hours). All in all, we enjoyed our stay very much! The service was excellent and all the staff were so cheerful and helpful. Would gladly stay here again.","Ontario, Canada",2,5.0

It was a reward stay and I paid points for four nights and received the fifth night free. So this was a great value to me. As a Hilton Gold member, I did not receive Exec Lounge access, but I was not expecting that.I did receive a wonderful room upgrade to a king bed. The room was large, high up with a wonderful view and a huge bathroom with a walk in shower. The AC was strong and quiet, there was a chair and a desk and also a chair/ottoman set up. Plugs by the bed and the desk area. Housekeeping was done so well during my 5 days stay. Everything was replaced, replenished, cleaned, etc. It was spotless every day. I had a kettle in my room and coffee/tea set. There was a minibar with a little room for snacks that I would buy at the convenient store in the basement.Breakfast in the lobby restaurant was really well done. I found the food delicious, lots of choices, and it never got too crowded. I would be there around 7. Lobby is busy but the staff is very helpful. I used the luggage forwarding service in the lobby to have my bags sent on to the next hotel. This is VERY USEFUL when you are traveling in Japan by public transit as your bag is in your next hotel room when you check in. I think the fee was around $10 for one bag to Yokohama. It was charged to the room. Very well done and worth it. Even though I found the transit station near the hotel very convenient, I would often take the shuttle to Shinjuku station since there are so many great eating places near the station. This was a great stay. It is a large busy hotel, and, while the service was excellent, its too big to be very personal, and that is just fine for me and appropriate in a place like Tokyo. The price was right for me, as I was paying with points, but the rates were high when I stayed there. But that is for a world class city hotel in a city known for high priced hotels.

This Hilton was good but it wasn’t great. The not great: This is in the business location of Shinjuku and it’s a 20+ minute walk to the other side of Shinjuku and there isn’t very much in the area. We did find a Starbucks, a 7-11, Denny’s and a convenience store all within a block of the hotel but otherwise it’s very sparse.There is not a hang out area in the lobby. There are a couple of seats but there is no where to sit and wait or kill time in the lobby area. If we were waiting for a tour guide or just each other we would have to stand in the lobby as all the seats about 10 of them total were always taken.The bathroom is a hot mess. Yes it’s Tokyo yes it’s small but the real issue here is that there is no glass enclosure or curtain for the shower and so you get water everywhere on on everything since it’s such a tight space. We were not told about the free shuttle to Shinjuku Station and can I tell you this would have been life changing for us. I saw it out front on our last day and had to inquire about it. Luckily we were able to use it to get our luggage to the station. I wish upon check in or in the paperwork they sent be upon booking they would have let us know about it. It would have made getting to the hotel so so much easier.Any noise from the hallways can be heard in your room so anyone walking Dow the hall talking can be disturbing.There are no electrical outlets near the nightstands to charge your phones. I like to use my phone before bed and just charge it up and leave it next to me but I had to always get up and go put it up. I use my phone as an alarm so it was always on the other side in the mornings so no snooze button for me. The good:The room was very nice size, the bed was comfortable the room was clean and the view was beautiful. We stayed on the 26th floor. The A/C was quiet and worked wonderfully the room was also dark and easy to sleep in. The bar on the 2nd floor was also lovely we spend some time there on the first night. Spacious great music and service. There is a convenience store in the mall in the basement of the hotel.

Worth noting that I’m a Hilton diamond member.Location: off the red line, there is direct access via the under ground passage ways if you head towards the Tokyo metropolitian government building / Hiltopia, it might not be that easy to find first time. I went over ground the first time, then left the hotel via the underground afterwards. I thought the location was fairly central but to be fair there didn’t seem to be a lot to do immediately around the hotel (except the observation deck in the government building). But you are only one station from Shinjuku so not really a problem. Plus I love the hotel so much that I can overlook this. Room: best upgrade I have ever got, junior suite. It was huge, and lovely. Even thou I’m not that noise sensitive I was worried that I was right by the elevator. I’m pretty sure I heard noise like once, which is pretty amazing. I think the blinds/shutters must be noise blocking too, as despite being next to a hospital I only heard an ambulance once! I was on the 16th floor. The air con made a tiny noise that I notice sometimes but only because the room was so quiet! The elevators were pretty quick. The sofa was comfortable, as was the bed. The toiletries were Crabtree and Evelyn. I enjoyed having a tea set in the room. The shower pressure was excellent, but I found the bath in the wet room set up a little odd, and it look me a while to find a good angle for the shower head so that I wasn’t backed into the bath. It also made the bathroom a little smaller than it could have been. I find having a moving shutter outside the bathroom a bit odd, if you were sharing the room with someone then you need to trust they don’t open it whilst you are showering. I also assume they can see a shadow of you in the shower?Lounge access: I got that via my status. I tried afternoon tea - excellent lots of choices of cakes, all western. Also tried pre dinner snacks, you could probably make a meal out of it. I don’t drink but saw wine and spirit.Breakfast: Free with status, I didn’t try the Japanese breakfast which needs booking in advance. The marble lounge breakfast buffet was amazing, western and Asian option, especially love that they offer soya milk, I saw soya smoothie too but did not try it.I had minimal interaction with staff, I was granted late checkout (my request 2pm) but did not use it in the end.If I had to nit pick:- the lobby always seems busy. I waited a bit at checkin, no real waiting at check out. - I really don’t like that the clean towels are stored right next to the toilet paper holder, doesn’t seem very hygienic to me.If you have right Hilton status, the perks are really great here, I would definitely recommend staying.

The reviews were glowing, but we were so terribly disappointed--this was most definitely not a 5-star hotel, and I'm not even sure what measures were used to rate it as such. The hotel itself is just a hotel, very average, nothing special or distinctive. Our room had a beautiful view of the city, but the room itself was not particularly nice. We only had one other Tokyo hotel experience (The Palace, which is truly 5 stars), and it just did not measure up on any level. The room was fairly small with an outdated and small bathroom, with a minimum number of towels provided, only instant coffee with paper cups, no special amenities whatsoever-whatsoever! We also had the breakfast buffet one morning. The food was okay, but it was a total mob scene and minimal, although friendly, service (we had to specifically ask to have our table cleared). Our one interaction with the concierge, when we were on our way out for lunch and asked for sushi recommendations. We were sent to 2 different places, one which was closed and being remodeled and the other which required reservations. There was no offer to make reservations, something that really should have been offered or mentioned. I could go on how the rooms were uninspired, had no turn-down service, robes and zero special amenities or that there were no cloth napkins used during breakfast, and I say all this not to sound like a snob, but so that there are real expectations of what you're getting and what you're not getting, which are things that you typically expect from a 5-star hotel. Yes, the people who work here are friendly and helpful and the bed was comfortable. They also provide a shuttle to the station, which was a nice perk, but I wish the hotel was billed more in line with what it is.

Well that’s missing from this hotel. It is an average average hotel. I had specially booked a room with a king bed, and on check in I was told that I had a room with a king bed. Well after waiting for a long time for a check in, as you’ve to line up for it. Its literally a noisy, loud fish market in the lobby. You have to find your way through the people to get to reception (with your bags, no they don’t have anyone taking your bags off you). Then after the check in we get to our room, and there are two single beds. On calling the reception, we are told apologetically that they will send someone to “join the two beds together”. Well, we could do that ourselves, if we had asked for a king bed then we should get a king bed, not two single beds joined together. The bedroom itself was big considering TOKYO standards. The carpet is plush but old. The beds themselves were ok but the pillows lacked memory foam. The air conditioner worked ok but I couldn’t find a remote to control it. The TV had mostly Asian channels with just a couple in English. The bathroom itself was pretty average. It was small considering the size of the room. The shower is in the bath and not separate, with a very flimsy screen, that whenever we used it the water would splat from our body and it made the floor wet. Did not like it, so called up the reception again. No resolution was offered. We had to make do every time by mopping up the floor with the bath towels. There were no bath robes provided in the room. On request we got them the next day. We went to the pool and gym to take a look, and the staff member there told us that we will have to remove our shoes to go in there?? We were only taking a look and not dipping our feet with our shoes on!!On the last day we requested that we be given an extra hour for check out as we had a late flight. They said we could get only half an hour. Well, so we planned accordingly and were about to step out, then we were told that the room was required so only “15 minutes” were possible. So we didn’t go anywhere, as we had the housekeeping supervisor standing outside, knocking on the door, hurrying us to leave. We rushed out, lined up for our check out and that was that!!YEAH, SO I DONT THIINK WE WILL BE COMING BACK TO THE HILTON IN A HURRY!!","Melbourne, Australia",45,1.0

Arrival / check in - Once arrived, we were greeted by the staff and our bags were held until check in was complete. We were checked in by Ernesto who was simply amazing and has a great personality. He didn't just check us in and move onto the next person. Ernesto recognised my Hilton Honors Diamond Status and did his best to upgrade us though the lobby and the hotel seemed extremely busy. He was able to work his magic and upgraded us to the 37th floor though the room wasn't ready so he went above and beyond and gave us a temporary sleep room for a few hours. We felt extremely well looked after and could tell he did his best to accommodate us. Location - Located in the business district of Shinjuku , this hotel is situated near a train station metres away and offers a free shuttle 3 times per hour to the main Shinjuku entrance. Room - We were upgraded to a king suite on the 37th floor (due to Diamond status) . The suite size is more than enough for 2 people, with 2 bathrooms and a make up room, massive amounts of luggage storage , 2 toilets, a lounge area and a MASSIVE bed! Water pressure is adequate and pillow selection is fantastic. Housekeeping have done an amazing job, extremely thorough and more than enough high quality amenities. Executive Lounge - My status allowed lounge access which has been very handy though the lounge can get very busy in the mornings and at evenings though is a real first world problem. Staff are very accommodating in these busy periods. Food on offer is wide range of hot and cold dishes ( depending of time of day) . Lots of non alcoholic and alcoholic drinks available though if I can suggest something, it's to upgrade the coffee machines as they aren't great and are super noisy. Note - This Hotel doesn't have a welcome pack for Diamond Members though we have been offered 2 x free drinks at their cocktail lounge which is more than sufficient. The hotel also offer well priced airport transfers which to be honest, is worth taking instead of battling with the trains. Breakfast - The buffet breakfast can get very busy but the staff work extremely quickly to turnover tables to ensure you are seated as fast as possible. A great wide range of food accommodating to various cultures ; salad bar, cold meats, asian delicacies , western food and all in between.Overall our stay so far has been memorable.

Yep that’s a rip off. Cost $1500 plusSecond instant involved some friends at the bar who ordered two whiskies and 4 beers. The Barman held up a bottle of Japanese Whisky to see if it was acceptable, my friend nodded okay. The bill for one round of drinks for six people $360 AUD.

From pre-arrival questions to baggage handling, you can depend on them.The location is pretty convenient. The closest Metro station is Nishi (West) Shijuku (M07) followed by Tochōmae (In front of Tokyo Metro Government) Station (E28). Both are connected by underground tunnel (just turn different ways when you enter the tunnel). If you need to find your way in the Tokyo Metro System, I find it is easiest to go by the station numbers. This way, you can quickly find ways to transfer and calculate the number of stops. The E line is sort of a loop (shaped like a sideways 6 or 9) so you can go to a lot of places on it once you realize the case. Tochōmae is actually where the loop splits and trains go essentially 3 different directions from there.The hotel offers a shuttle to the Shinjuku station and it is a 15-20 minute walk if you don't get lost. The Tokyo Metro Government is 2 blocks away and has a free observatory on the 45th(?) floor that opens well into the evening.Tried breakfast at the Lounge, downstairs restaurant and the Japanese breakfast. The Japanese breakfast was served very fast and efficiently so it did not take much time. Restaurant has a lot of food but is really busy. Lounge is a more relaxed environment for breakfast. Afternoon tea has lots of desserts. Evening offering is OK and it is really busy.One thing I do not like is at some of the food stations (both in the lounge and in the restaurant), there was not a place for utensils. So, people put the utensils right on top of the food. It is not sanitary.The gym has a swimming pool, tennis court and sauna.The room is nice and it seems pretty new.

My big problem with the room was the smell of smoke. Otherwise, I would have given the hotel a 5 star. The other issue was you can hear the elevator rolling up and down the shaft.

Oddly they had put a card in my room thanking me for spending my ""special anniversary"" there, which was surprising as I was on a business trip, but it did make me smile!!!The gym at this hotel has recently improved quite a lot and now has separate areas for free weights, cardio and machines, allowing for a good workout. The location is exceptional, a short walk from Shinjuku station (regular courtesy bus is also available), and an underground route to Tochomae station which is well connected on the underground train network, so it's actually very easy to access pretty much anywhere in the city.

We were able to communicate with the concierges indicating that it was a very special stay (birthdays and the beginning of a pilgrimage) and they kindly left a card, balloons and small box of chocolates & madeleines in the room, very nice. We got to the hotel early in the morning and knew that early check in was going to be difficult but they processed everything so that we just needed to come back after 3pm to retrieve the keys, we left our bags and went sightseeing. During check in we were offered again an upgrade for JPY 10,000. I appreciated the offer but was honestly surprised as of how many times the hotel was offering these upgrades, perhaps it was because we reserved the room with points (?). I have stayed in Hilton hotels all over the world but never experience this constant offering, in fact, other Hilton properties we just received a free upgrade (which we never asked for by the way). The staff was very polite, the hotel huge and the lobby area quite busy. Our room was in the 20th floor and had a city view, this wasn’t a renovated room, but it was huge for Japan standards; it was just OK, nothing to talk about; we stayed in over 8 hotels during our Japan trip and all of them, including guest houses and temples, offered free internet and yukatas, not the Hilton. I know, this is not the end of the world but it gives you a perspective, basically you need to pay way more to have access to things that other smaller establishments provide to every single person that stay in their properties. The shuttle from Shinjuku was very convenient but walking to the station was not bad at all.

It was surprisingly easy and pleasant. Simply let the ticket booth person you want to take the next bus to Hilton Shinjuku, and ask where the bus stop is. It’s really nice that International Terminal is fiat pick up stop so bus is mostly empty. And the Hilton is first stop back to Haneda. Hilton front desk can book your return and include it in the hotel bill. I booked on a very full weekend, and the guest service manager was quick to come up to welcome me as a Diamond member and apologize for lack of free upgrades, and offered other amenities.

The common areas are a bit noisy as it did tend to echo a lot (one of the main dining areas is right next door to the reception with no partition or wall separating diners from others).The rooms were also clean and reasonably spacious (for Japan). Beds were comfortable, and rooms maintained well from one day to the next by the housekeeping staff. Pool and gym were also good. We had one meal in the hotel at the slightly pricey teppanyaki, but in return for spending almost USD700 got an absolutely outstanding meal.The location is not the best as it is too far to walk to Shinjuku station and surrounds with the kids (the hotel recognises this by having a shuttle bus that goes between the station and hotel every twenty minutes or so). There is nothing wrong with the hotel, but with young kids you might be better served staying closer to Shinjuku station itself, or perhaps even in the entertainment district proper if you prefer.

I fully stand behind my previous review but I feel like a few things need to be added.First of all, when I say that I have stayed at this hotel over one hundred times, that is no exaggeration. I began staying at this hotel when it first opened in the 1980s and I have continued to stay here ever since.For the first couple of decades of this hotel's existence, very little changed. In recent years, however, they have launched a redesign and upgrade campaign. The thing about change is, however, it does not always make things better it simply makes things different. And, I believe this is the case with this hotel. Yes, their restaurants and their cocktail lounge have moved and changed a bit but have they really become better? I don't really think so.In terms of the rooms, they have re-designed the interior space. What they have done, in terms of design, is that they have placed new furnishings in the rooms that are somewhat reminiscent of 1980s high-tech furniture. For example, at my most recent stay I had a desk in my room that had a glass top and very extended chrome legs. I cannot tell you how many times my wife and I stubbed our toe's on those legs because they are sticking out so far into the main area of the room. I actually thought of posting a photo of my bruised foot, due to this table, but I thought that would be in poor taste. But, they should really rethink this furnishing pattern because it is actually very dangerous. I am certain I am not the only person to have stubbed my toes on these extended legs.Another problem I find is that they have redesigned their bath/shower areas. They have installed these very limited shifting glass pieces that do not extend the entire length of the tub. I have seen the same glass pieces installed at other Hiltons and I always question why. They are just not very functional. Moreover, if you hope to take a shower with your partner, it becomes virtually impossible because water sprays all over everything. Again, this is a new design that I believe they should really rethink.In terms of actual hotel service, I did have a problem on my most recent stay. I return to my room at approximately 2:30 in the afternoon and the maid service had still not cleaned my room. I walked in, and I was in a literal disbelief. I was forced to call to actually have my room cleaned. For a hotel of this caliber, this kind of poor service should just not exist. Then, I had to go down to the cocktail lounge and have a drink while I waiting for my room to be clean. Simply unacceptable!One of the other problems I find is that, in times gone past when you needed to do currency exchange, you would go up to the main desk and there they had a section of their main reception area dedicated to currency exchange. An actual person would exchange your money for you. Now, you go and stick your money in a machine over to the side of the lobby. This is just way too impersonal of an experience for a Hilton of this caliber to offer. It is simply lazy. The entire reason that one stays at the Hilton is so that they can have personal encounters with the staff if and when needed. Thus, in my opinion, this was just a bad business decision to make money exchange via machine the only option.Overall, I still love this hotel. A few things to keep in mind, however. You really need to be very specific about the room you reserved. The higher the floor, not only the better the view, but the better the overall experience.Great hotel. I just believe that they need to rethink some of their new redesign ideology.","Los Angeles, California",74,3.0

We always like to stay at international chains because they generally dont go terribly wrong as their reputation is at stake. In many options I zeroed in on Hilton Tokyo and boy I was too damn right.

Best yet, since we got the executive floor they have light snacks every evening and great breakfast in the morning. The breakfast host was amazingly friendly with bringing made to order omelette or coffee or orange juice at your table, talking and explaining things in a very friendly manner. I can go on and on, made our stay in Tokyo very pleasurable and indeed making it a trip of a lifetime.Location wise this Hotel is perfect, has subway line right below in basement Marunochi line which takes you to Tokyo and Shinjuku and E line.

Great help from Concierge (we tend to be fairly independent travelers, but did appreciate their help with restaurant reservations, luggage transfer setup etc)Subway accessible through their underground tunnel (luckily we didn’t encounter much rain even though we went during the rainy season, but we used the underground tunnel consistently anyway)Most places to visit within a few subway stopsBeds in rooms probably the most comfortable of all the places we stayed in Japan and nice sized rooms for Japan ( we stayed in city suite executive connected to twin executive)Rooms were quiet and A/C worked very well (June in Japan tends to be hot and muggy)Very prompt room service-as the first couple days we were too jet lagged to go out for dinner (within 20-30min each time, healthy choices, and not ridiculously expensive)Cannot comment on their restaurants-as we did not eat at them, apart from the breakfast as mentioned aboveCons- really can’t say there were anyWe would stay and recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Tokyo!","Poughkeepsie, New York",37,5.0

There's an easy ten minute walk into Shinjuku and the hotel as three shuttle buses each hour running in an out.We opted for a Junior suite (an inexpensive add on to an Executive room... plenty of room but with limited views it being on the 10th of a 38 storey hotel. Views from the Club floor (37) were great with even glimpses of the distant Mt Fuji in the late afternoons.Room facilities were good without being knockout. Despite the suite having plenty of room the bathroom set up was strange with the glass door to the bath/shower area swinging back and compromising space in the remainder of the bathroom/toilet. The Club staff were pleasant and efficient, a wide choice of drinks available between the 6.00 and 8.00pm (precisely!!!) period. Food choices were limited (three hot dishes) and some cheeses mainly.One tip... we discovered that the Nishi Shinjuku station is just a few hundred metres away (above or below ground) and that it is much more convenient that using the massive station at Shinkuku itself.

Staff were very helpful. However the hidden gem is the steakhouse on the second floor. We couldn’t take a second night at the evening buffet so we by chance drifted up to the second floor and started chatting with Niko the chef at the Steakhouse. He sold us on trying the steak that is cooked on a wooden plank. OMG, it ain’t cheap but it’s the best steak my wife and I have ever eaten.

As a diamond member of Hilton, they upgraded us to a junior suite but they were sold out of those suites so offered a paid upgrade to the next sized (full) suite. i found the up sale pitch odd for a diamond member but chose to pay the extra money. The suite was spacious and lovely and was a good choice. We found the bathroom to be large, and the shower a bit odd (Essentially a large wet room) but quite efficient. The decor was lovely. For the club floor, it was large and the staff efficient The fare was excellent for breakfast. There was an omelet station with any egg dish you want, some Japanese options, wonderful fresh juice, a coffee machine with the usual options, fruit, breads and water. They also offer the option of a traditional bento box Japanese breakfast on the 2nd floor, with reservations required. The meal was unique, lovely, and worth the visit. There are 3 seatings a day at 8, 9 and 10 am. For evening appetizers, the fare was not novel but adequate. The alcohol choices were abundant, none close to top shelf. But this is a club floor and the room was crowded each evening (packed) with no tables left within 30 minutes of opening. The staff did do all in their power to seat people and serve them. The staff was mixed in their attitude, with some incredibly friendly and welcoming and others tolerant of foreigners at best. Compared to the Conrad hotels in Bangkok and Hong Kong it was a step down. But compared to most Hiltons it was a step up. Overall, it added an excellent element to the stay. The location of this hotel is wonderful, close to the subway and much of the city action.There are multiple restaurants one serving a massive breakfast buffet. Music at the 2nd floor bar was lovely, with drinks poured not an iota over an ounce. For the price, the pour was stingy. The atmosphere was lovely.

The Toto toilet took a little getting used to, but now I want one in our house back in the states.

I am writing this review in all sincerity and based on my personal experience. Since I don’t have much time writing, I will break my points into three aspect. I hope that someone planning to visit this part of the world will find it informative when deciding on the choice of hotel. First and foremost is the location, the hotel is rightly located at the major hub of Tokyo and 5-10min walk to one of the major Metro line. Truly, if you are looking for convenience and plan to get around as often as possible, you must stay at this hotel because of its great proximity. They have a shuttle bus to the station, but I recommend that you walk especially if you are visiting for the first time. I find it very interesting to walk around. Also the city is very safe, and general Japanese people are nice in case you ever get lost. Secondly, the service, without a doubt I will give the hotel 5* star plus plus for an exceptional service. I mean how else can someone have a memorable stay in a busy city without choosing the right place to stay?! I have stayed in many luxury hotels and I can tell you that the service at Hilton Tokyo is top notch. The staffs are very helpful, they always go out of their way to assist immediately. Whenever, I call the room service for something to be deliver to my room, I receive knock on my door literally within 2-5minutes. Also, the check-in & check-out process is spot on. I have strong opinion that the front office is the first impression of any hotel, and Hilton Tokyo nailed it. No long queue (despite the fact that it’s a busy hotel), all the staffs speak fluent English, and the employees are very welcoming. Oh, I must comment on their overall uniform, its very presentable, suitable color for each departments and the staffs are well dressed ( e.g, I have noticed that the female staff have nice clean nails).I must also applaud the concierge team, I don’t want to mention names here because it will not be fair to others as I believe they all work similarly. Seriously these guys/ladies are very knowledgeable about directions around the city and beyond. They can also assist you to plan your stay, where to visit around the city and outside etc. Believe it or not, they provide accurate direction and information that any help desk around the Metro stations. Moving forward, the food and beverage department. Please bear in mind that when I mentioned F&B, I am referring to all the departments within in general, that is, the restaurants, executive lounge, bars and breakfast. Let start with the breakfast, Wow! what a great selections of food, from healthy meal to Japanese, and western cuisines. Their breakfast is tailored to everyone from all walk of life, they also have several life cooking stations, 100% Freshly squeezes juices (I love the kale), infusion water, soya milk for people with diary allergy and name it all, you will certain find it there. If you like to experience Japanese cuisine exclusively for your breakfast, you can reserve a table before 9pm (please find out the eligibility). I love Zatta bar most especially because its very contemporary and the great selections of music entertainment. I love the fact that they switch different singers at least twice a week. The ambience is also very nice, and never overcrowded because of the space and design. The staffs are excellent and very professional. Florian is a great host and asset to the Bar (I think is very relaxing and home feel when one can chat with the staffs at any bar while sipping drink). The Executive lounge is another great part of the hotel because it’s very relaxing, very exclusive and don’t forget to carry your camera with you, you might be lucky to capture the view of majesty Mt. Fuji from there, and intact the overall city view. You can be rest assured that Waki will always keep you entertained while at lounge (amazing host)Finally, they have great numbers of restaurants to dine and wine (make sure to book ahead or immediately you arrive at the hotel because it’s always busy). I love the overall designs of the restaurants; very exquisite. ","Hatta, United Arab Emirates",1,5.0

It makes me think that the hotel has many different standard and treat guests differently due to they way they booked the hotel! Be careful if you do not book directly with them as you might be second class! Other than this! We were asked to be an Hilton Honor member so we can have free WiFi which is norm for most hotels worldwide but after filling in the forms we are told again because we didn’t book directly and we cannot be extended the free WiFi. Second class again! So why ask us to be when they know we cannot get it???? Maybe because they all have a quota to achieve so they use the same technique to achieve it. Felt very cheated! Hotel otherwise is ok! Staff are like robots maybe because of the standards set out to be achieve! Nonetheless in the industry of hospitality I feel they need to treat everyone the same. Location is not bad rooms are also good size for Tokyo standard. Just don’t be robots but look after everyone the same as all of us pay the same only through different channels booked which the hotel makes the call to sell the rooms!!!! If you want to be just anyone in this factory stay they. The person whom checked us in is not a normal staff. Ps it is not just wanting more or pinpointing at anyone however the overall experience is way below average of even a 3 star howver for the price paid!,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",6,2.0

We chose this hotel because of its location to Shinjuku Station and the shopping and restaurant districts that surround it and weren’t disappointed.The drive from Narita airport to the hotel took approximately 1.5 hours. Good motorway conditions existed, but there was a lot of traffic as we got closer to the city.Our checking experience was good due to the team speaking excellent English and due to them being so friendly and efficient. The hotel has a number of really fabulous restaurants on the second level (ground is called level 1). We ate at the Grill on the first night and the Chinese on the second and have to say that while they are expansive, the service and quality of the food was simply excellent. Our third night, we ate out at a little (tiny) restaurant in the ‘Alley’, which was lovely and the fourth night we booked in at the Italian restaurant located in the basement shopping area below the hotel. This Italian restaurant ( Ristorante Carriera Italiana) is super friendly, not quite as good with their English, but has the most amazing quality and flavour in each dish we had. We highly recommend this restaurant.The breakfast restaurant is located on the ground level and has a wonderfully comprehensive buffet, with Egg Station and Coffee shop. The team are very attentive and help guide you if needed. We enjoyed a relaxed breakfast here each day.The hotel is located approximately 15 minutes walk from Shinjuku Station and from there you can access their amazing rail system. Above and around the station are an enormous number of shops, shopping centres and restaurants. Something for everyone.We arranged for 4 hour introductory tour of the area with a private guide (Yuki) through City Unscripted. This was a great was to get a local to show us how to get the rail card, how to use the rail system and to be comfortable with walking the area. Yuki was just great and took us for a comfortable walk around the area.In essence, our stay at Hilton Tokyo was very enjoyable and we we were very happy with everything.

The standard guests rooms are small (not unusual by Tokyo standards) and quite dated - the bathrooms in particular. Our bathroom was quite small and sad with none of the details that elevate a hotel into luxury status. Our tub/shower had one of those partial tub doors where the water splashes out when you take a shower. The bathrooms could definitely use a face-lift.

The lobby is often crowded with groups and has almost no places to sit. Indeed, when our room was cleaned -- usually in mid-afternoon -- we were hard pressed to find a comfortable place to wait. The lounge areas on floors 3-4, where the meeting rooms are, were roped off (we had to ignore the robes, I confess). But, on the plus side, the hotel is conveniently located in Shinjuku -- not a bad walk to Shinjuku station (it did take us three days to figure out where the hotel's shuttle bus stopped there) and connected via underground passageways to the subway. This is an upscale part of town, but also close to a wide variety of restaurants and shopping.

The property is 4-star through and through: kitschy lobby which, at times, is almost as crowded as a train station; no security when entering lifts (although Japan is a low-crime country); extremely dated furniture in rooms (the rooms’ design is thoughtful and efficient, though); minuscule bathrooms with basic amenities; insufficient noise insulation when you have rowdy nocturnal neighbours; winding queues for buffets (even for the Happy Hour at the Executive Lounge). However, it is well located in Shinjuku: convenient limousine bus from/to Haneda and Narita airports, atop a metro station served by two lines.

I emailed the reservation team regarding the situation and did not check in as we were on a family trip and needed rooms on the same floor.Upon checkin our request that dated more than 6 months ago were unable to acceded to.

With the exact same kind of view.I am not sure if i deserved less as a hilton diamond member but i do remember checking into the room 3129 (after shifting from room 2329) seeing gifts and mineral water prepare in the room with a card welcoming a european named couple. I am not sure if it was 100pct occupancy what made our request less a ""priority"" than others. Not to mention diamond members were suppose to get room upgrades with preferred view.

I needed some assistance with fine dining options in Tokyo and the team were able to both recommend and secure reservations for us at some of the best restaurants in the city.The front desk check-in experience was also top notch, as while they weren't able to offer me a complimentary upgrade per my status, they did provide a number of extra amenities to make up for the inconvenience.Everything else was not so 5-star.The rooms, while comfortable, did feel a bit dated. There's the option of city view vs park view and there's really not much of a difference as I've had different views in two separate stays and hadn't had a preference.Even though the hotel has 5 elevators, it seems they only keep one or two running at any time. One night we arrived back around 11pm on a week night and there was a huge queue for the elevators for some weird reason.Breakfast is similarly very crowded. There was always a line no matter what time it was in the morning and just trying to get food from the buffet could become chaotic with people all over the place. Even though we had breakfast included in our stay, we didn't even go down the final few days because of the crowds and the repetitiveness in the food.The hotel has direct access to an underground tunnel system that takes you to two different subway stations so that was fairly convenient for travel.

Salad is also provided, pieces of apple and a repetitive duo of cheese, and if you are quick a few crackers.There is an open bar with a wide range of spirits which seems to be one of the big attractions, plus cheap red and white wine and Chandon, and the usual soft drinks.The worst feature is the fact that small children are allowed to scream ,squeal and generally run riot as they become increasingly tetchy as the night wears on.Staff weave around them in very cramped conditions and nothing is said.While the Lounge has a no visible tattoos rule, misbehaving kids are fine.So now to the room, ours was unrenovated on the to 38th (top) floor and was very comfortable, clean and serviced nicely. It had both a sleeping and lounge area, however the bathroom was cramped with a shower over the bath.Perhaps they will fix this in the next makeover.Towels were fluffy and large, so top marks for this.As for the location, that is what keeps me coming back, walk to 2 different underground stations, a great shuttle bus service to Shinjuku for those who don’t want to walk , on the Limousine Bus route to both Haneda and Narita airports.Taxis are always available too.All very convenient.","Sydney,Australia",106,3.0

I did a lot of research before deciding on Hilton Nishishinjuku because this hotel seems to be generous to gold member according to most Trip Advisor members. However, that was not the case with me. The limousine bus took two and a half hours to reach Hilton from the airport due to Shinjuku traffic. I begin to doubt if I made the right decision when I was stuck in traffic and when I got to the hotel, they told me they are fully booked and cannot offer more to a gold member. They did offer an upgrade on our 3rd night that we accepted. We were then assign to room 3005. The room was clean and of decent size. However, the bathtub door only covers 40% of the tub. What normally is a relaxing moment for me has became stressful as I tried to move my body and maneuver the shower head to try to avoid water leaking out the tub. The first three days of my stay, there were a lot of people so elevators were very slow and jam packed regardless if I was going up or going down. It stopped at almost every other floors. I would advise management to look into the possibility of assigning express elevators. On our last day, we waited for our shuttle at the lobby. We tried to find a seat but the 10 seats were all occupied. We witnessed an elderly lady with her daughter trying to find a seat but none were available so they proceed to walk to the concierge area and stood there to wait for their son/brother to pick them up. When we spotted a vacant seat, I went ahead and took it while my husband went over to retrieve the lady so she can sit down. I think it is unreasonable for a hotel this size to only have 10 seats in the lobby area. Tourist are tired people, it would be nice that there are more seats available.

Great location, about 10-15 minutes walk from the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku and right above Nishi-Shinjuku and Tochomae stations. You can pretty much get to any corner of Tokyo from here within 45 minutes on the subway, and some great places like the Tsukiji Fish Market are on these lines so really easy to get to. Basic King room (2621 - view from room in photo) was very comfortable and super clean. My only negative on the room was that (n.b. first world problem and not really “room” related) the selection of TV channels for a non-Japanese speaker was very poor. Basically you can’t watch TV in English unless it’s CNN or Discovery, and forget about any European languages. I like to watch for a while at night before falling asleep so it was slightly annoying on a personal level.Breakfast was great. Can get quite busy at 9am but good an hour before or after. Terrific selection, and if something was not on display you just ask for it and the staff went out of their way to get it.

As a diamond member, I was upgraded from a standard room to a premium room, and received access to the executive lounge as well as one complimentary cocktail at the bar downstairs. I thought the service at this hotel was excellent (of course this typically occurs in Japan), the hotel room was in very good shape, and everything worked properly. The executive lounge offers nice alcoholic beverages and snacks in the evening, a limited but lovely breakfast in the morning, and a pleasant atmosphere with attentive staff all day. Everyone at the hotel spoke fluent English. I was also offered the option of the breakfast buffet at the restaurant downstairs, and it was an elaborate breakfast with extensive choices.I have read some criticisms of this hotel, around location, standard of the rooms and service, but personally, I found everything to be of a high standard.There is one issue with the extent of Diamond recognition, that has been raised in the past. In my experience, with most hotel chains in Japan, one will receive the level of recognition that is exactly specified in the membership programme but typically, no more than that. That was indeed the case at this hotel and so I do not see this as a problem at the Hilton in Tokyo. Of course, it would have been nice to have received a big upgrade to a capacious suite with sweeping views of the city, but the diamond membership level entitles one to a preferred room or suite subject to availability (and technically if a room is available that represents an upgrade from what you have booked, there is no specific obligation to give you a suite). In some other countries like Thailand, quite often huge upgrades are given to diamond members, but this is not typically done in Japan, in my experience. (and I have experience with numerous chains) Therefore, I would say that the Hilton Tokyo is in line with other hotels in this country. The price point for everything is very high at this hotel, but not out of line with typical Japanese prices. Tokyo, in particular, is an expensive city.Overall, I was very happy and would be pleased to stay here again in the future or to recommend it to friends.","Bangkok, Thailand",29,5.0

Most of the staff in the lounge were great and apologetic about the wati, but there were a few staff who really needed to learn how to smile and show some courtesy. We were in an executive room, so could have had breakfast in the executive lounge, however breakfast there finished at 9am which was deftinitely too early for us on holidays. the only other negative for us was that we had our luggage forwarded to the hotel from a ski location, but on the third day when it has still not arrived i went asking if anyone had seen it, and it had been sitting in a store room since the day before and no one had bothered to let us know or bring it to our room, which was quite disappointingover all, despite the coupld of neagtives, this was a lovely hotel in a great area with great rooms and fantastic views.

I hadn't even touched my bag before being offered assistance by a smiling young woman who escorted me to the front desk, luggage in tow. Her vivacious nature was a positive indication of the type of stay I would come to experience. Although it was two hours before official check-in, I was immediately accommodated by the equally welcoming front desk associate, and assigned an upgraded room on a high floor with sweeping city views. Executive Lounge access was provided due to my Hilton Honors Diamond status, and I was even given a drink voucher for the St. George's Bar in the lobby, which I gifted to a surprised guest I encountered in the elevator. My room was comfortable and well appointed. I loved the sliding Japanese screens that added a degree of privacy to both the exterior windows and the interior bathroom shower. All furnishings were in excellent repair and the room was immaculately clean, and kept that way for the duration of my three night stay. Housekeeping was performed efficiently and discreetly without the incessant knocking and repetitive announcing of, ""housekeeping,"" so prevalent in many hotels around the world. Tips left on the bed pillow for the housekeeper were neatly removed to the adjacent nightstand, left unpocketed, an occurrence one sees only in Japan. The unusual shower setup was quite interesting, and the flooding I anticipated never occurred due to the ingenious drainage system. Water pressure was very strong, and I never encountered a shortage of hot water. Toiletries were Crabtree and Evelyn, and replaced as needed. A minibar fridge was fully stocked, and complimentary bottled water replenished daily. The bedding, pillows and mattress were of a high standard and most comfortable. I slept very well. My only criticism is that my neighbors on the other side of the connecting door would occasionally get a bit animated, and the ensuing noise would filter into my room. If you have a choice, ask for a room without such a door. The Executive Lounge was very busy at times during the weekend, but quieted down during the weekdays. No matter, it was well run with typical Japanese efficiency and grace. Despite this having been my first time visiting this property, I was continually addressed by name and made to feel like royalty. Drinks were proactively refilled, dishes quickly cleared and preferential seating offered. Kudos to Keynon-san and all the team members for making guests feel so valued. The breakfast, afternoon and evening offerings were of a high caliber, rotated daily and kept replenished before they ran out, no matter how busy. Not an easy task, given the number of guests during peak periods. In my many years of travel, there are many pleasant experienes that remain memorable, but none so personal and satisfying as mine at this Hilton. I will go out of my way to stay here at every opportunity.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands",38,5.0

The staff was amazing and everything was so conveniently located close by. If you arrive into Narita, the Airport Limousine bus drops you off right at the hotel, making it convenient to get to. We checked into our room, only to find that the room was slightly different than the pictures on the website. When we asked the front desk, they noted that some of the rooms are not renovated and the pictures on the website are of the renovated rooms. The staff mentioned that only some rooms below the 21st floor have renovated rooms, making it a challenge to locate one. The staff was able to locate a renovated room for us, but unfortunately, the room type was slightly different than the one we reserved, therefore there was a difference in price. We decided to splurge and I'm glad we did because the renovated room was spacious and had more light. I can't speak enough of the service of the staff. They were so accommodating. We utilized the concierge for day trips and other recommendations and they were very patient with us, even though there was a line behind us and they took as much time that was needed to help us. You could sense that the staff truly wanted to make our staff the best possible and we really appreciated it. Additionally, the house cleaning staff was amazing.

Tokyo being very populous and expensive city, many hotels including top notch ones, only occupies top floors of skyscrapers, sharing mid and bottom parts with business offices. However this hotel has its building solely for its own uses, making the hotel feel more like comfortable instant home away from home. This hotel utilizes huge area for executive club lounge which offer panoramic views of Japan including Mt. Fuji and other famous landmarks (I wasn’t very interested much except the Mountain Fuji view but I could definitely tell one of the most valuable assets for the hotel is, good location which provides such good panoramic views in the heart of bustling city)I heard the lounge is always so full, but I was lucky to enjoy good time without crowd, and I took breakfast at lounge all the time despite I heard breakfast restaurants on 1st and 2nd floors provides much more menus.One bad thing was, restaurants the concierge recommended – classic Japanese deep fries course restaurants, wasn’t much to my satisfaction personally. The restaurants had many good reviews from tripadvisor I saw, but my own perception is, anything can taste good if fried and there are too many good stuffs to enjoy with the price of the deep fries course meal- I heard deep fries are one of the high-end meals in Japan, but hope concierge offers more options for the guests who ask for good recommendation.The location is, I wouldn’t say, it is too perfect, because it requires hotel shuttle bus or quick taxi ride from Shinjuku and nearby stations, but the hotel has very good access from both Haneda & Narita airport. I usually do not like taking subways but in Japan, there are almost no options. However, you can take airport limousines from both airports (but it takes bit more than then taking subways), and hotel can book your return bus to airport. The hotel is also easy to go to Ginza, Omotesando, and other popular areas by subway (connected to hotel ground floor). As i heard, the hotel rarely gives gold benefit- anyway, I booked executive rooms because I wanted access to executive lounge as I ways do. The hotel say they are always full so I recommend to book the types of rooms you want even if you are a diamond or gold member. The hotel seems busy all the time indeed. I would definitely consider being there again. (some of reviews I studied before my trip had, some staffs are not very nice but for my stay, most staffs were very professional and nice, and provided excellent service with feeling of hospitality).","San Francisco, California",1,4.0

There were issues we faced and they brought my rating down. The physical hotel is nice. Standard rooms are comfortable and whilst bathrooms are small with showers in the tub, they certainky worked well and were clean.Service is where it becomes hit and miss and it seems the excuse is ""It's a big hotel"". Gold upgrade not provided. I can understand during busy periods however I believe the reason why they couldn't accomodate us was simply that they don't plan properly and advised me they totally ignore the online check in. Why ask guests to check in, what time they will arrive and also confirm that early check in which provides room assignment automatically (and gave me no choice) will not impact upgrades. When i arrived I was offered a twin upgrade after booking a king with a confirmed kids bed. I was told that I had selected a room already (complete contradiction to the online system), I was told one cannot book extra beds (it in facts states you must when booking) and when I challenged this I was asked to prove it which I did. I was then told if we keep the standard king room then we wouldn't be entitled to lounge access and breakfast. All in all not a good start. Basically in the end they ""generously"" offered ""something they never do"" which was lounge access. What I feel is a gold card entitlement. After all this they then said they were moving us to a different room which was a little more spacious. What I don't understand is how then they managed to get the extra bed into the room in the minutes it took us to get upstairs. Something was off. They had said they would send up amenities For the extra person with the bed. We waited 2.5 hours until 10pm to get a bath towel. The whole thing felt sordid.This was followed by concierge failing to assist effectively with restaurant reservations leaving us stranded and forced to eat in a smokey Hilton restaurant that was like a zoo with very average food and highly over priced.There were too many dropped balls and the underlying issue seemed to be that everyone wanted to argue about everything rather than take responsibility and make it right, as the promised. Room service was awful with poorly cooked food. Cold fries and 90 minutes to eventually recieve over priced but edible food. Again they new there were issues as they had to replace food twice yet no one made it right.They tried on check out but that's too late.I have had too many sub par experiences with Hilton who it seems are struggling world wide to compete in terms of service and the ""make it right"" philosophy is great if delivered on.It's a shame as the hotel has all the makings of a great experience but in all honesty the team need to stand up and be responsible for the short comings.","Bangkok, Thailand",146,3.0

While the bathtub was small and deep the shower made up for it. The sliding door between the bedroom and living room also made it comfortable and more private for us traveling with our kid.We had access to the Executive Lounge which always proves useful for less crowded breakfasts, lunch snacks (which we were never around for) and pre-dinner drinks and light food which was great though we were rarely back early enough to truly utilize this.The amenities were all good including the pool, spa and gym.There is one absolutely massive downside to the hotel and that is undoubtedly it restaurants, which while they seem to be very nice, the prices are simply outrageous and unjustifiable.

If you're looking for omotenashi, then this is definitely not the place where you can find it. If you wish to remain anonymous and feel like you are nothing but a room number, then this is the perfect place for you.I was assigned one of the rooms that were not renovated and it was dark and dated, nothing like the photos on their website. Breakfast in the main restaurant had great variety but the hostesses always wore sour faces and didn't seem very happy to see us. The service staff was much nicer but service was just as awful, it was clear that they were shorthanded. If you have access, then breakfast in the Executive Lounge is the way to go, way more peaceful and not that much difference in selection and variety. Japanese breakfast at Junisoh was a great experience too, definitely a must try if you have access.Executive Lounge was another disappointment. Service during Breakfast hours was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Came the afternoon and evening though, it felt like a completely different place. It was an absolute madhouse every evening with increasingly boisterous crowds. I didn't get what the draw was since the offerings were very poor for Asian standards. The staff also seemed to have given up trying to provide any kind of basic service in the evenings.Thankfully, the hotel does provide a special private lounge down the hall from the main lounge to qualified guests. The staff didn't proactively advertise about the existence of this private lounge though, even to qualified guests, so make sure to ask the staff about it if you are qualified.Overall the whole experience was very underwhelming. I will not recommend the hotel unless you are a Gold or Diamond Hilton Honors member for which you will get additional benefits. For everyone else, I imagine there are much better options for this price point.","Madison, Wisconsin",30,3.0

The evening fare is good too, yes not as much of a spread of food as other Hilton lounges in Asia, but they have an ample selection of drinks and the canapes are constantly replenished. It's the staff though that set this lounge apart from others, they were all so polite, kind and courteous at all times. Nothing ever seemed too much trouble. I was blown away when my suitcase broke on my check out date, the lounge manager Keynon went above and beyond, he took care of everything and personally went and got it repaired for me. Such caring and genuine service is rare to find in this industry. In fact the whole team in the executive lounge; Tsukuda, Makoto and Chihiro are all a huge asset to this establishment. The views of Tokyo from the lounge were stunning and mesmerising.Facilities at the hotel were excellent, from the vast array of restaurants and bars (choices to suit all tastes) to the well equipped gym and fitness facilities.

It's Hilton, it's not cheap, my expectations are gonna be higher than if I was at a small budget hotel in the city.The pros: -Large rooms by Japanese standards. Great for families or your American grandparents visiting Asia for the first time. If you still think their rooms look small you need to go to Four Seasons or Peninsula in Tokyo and I'm not being sarcastic.-All the amenities/services from a big brand hotel: gym, pool, sauna, different restaurants, a team of concierge. Everyone spoke great English, had no problem with communication. They also sell the day passes for Tokyo Subway at concierge.-Direct access to underground for the subway, or there's 3 shuttle/hour to JR Shinjuku train station. Many people complain about this hotel not being near Shinjuku JR. Note that there are no big roomy hotels near Shinjuku JR. It's either nice spacious rooms here, or you're walking distance to the JR station but staying in a small cramped room. This is as close as you can get to it for this type of hotel. Personally as a tourist I prefer getting around Tokyo using subway vs JR whenever possible, since they offer a foreigner day pass at 800/yen day which is a fantastic deal.-Airport Limousine stop onsite. When you are going home with bags and bags of stuff you bought you don't need to stress about how you're gonna get on the train to the airport. Also great if you want zero hassle with getting to hotel from airport.-Beds were very comfortable, great view of the city lights. Good closet/wardrobe space for storing things.The cons/room for improvement:-Amenities are not bad but lacking compared to its neighbor Hyatt Regency. Across the street at Hyatt they have a convenience service that'll deliver anything from humidifiers, charging cables, down to bath salts, nail clippers and skin care products to your room free. Hilton offers no skincare products, had a nice bathtub but no bath salts (only shower gel). No coffee machine and only instant coffee mix, I find that unacceptable at this price range. Tea selection not very thoughtful seems random. So the rooms look nice on the Internet, but once I was inside the room all these small things started popping up which detracted from the experience.-Wifi is free only if you sign up for their membership. I understand the membership is free, but still this is a hassle, just give me the password and let me get on the internet. It's 2017, not all of us are traveling on business and can charge to our company so stop nickel and diming people.-I wish the shuttle ran until 11 p.m. With the amount of activities at night in Shinjuku it would be a very nice touch to extend the hours a little.Overall it's still a good hotel, I still recommend this place to families or people looking for a comfortable stay. Also, if you are a Hilton regular/have rewards points then stay here. I hate to say it, but Hyatt Regency across the street offers everything here and a little more for about the same price. If I were to stay in Shinjuku again I'll most likely choose Hyatt Regency over Hilton unless there's improvements, sorry :/","Seattle, Washington",15,3.0

I am a diamond member with over 70 stays each year. I love the Hilton brand specifically for its recognition of diamond members when I travel in Asia and Europe. The executive lounge is beautiful and unlike many I have experienced. It rivals the experiences I have had in Hilton properties in London, Rome and Istanbul. I loved it! The people are kind and we all know the employees make or break the hospitality industry. I would like to recognize Ernesto in the guest service department for going above and beyond to make my award stay as a diamond member seamless, unforgettable, fun, and every other positive adjective imaginable. He not only recognized my diamond status from the moment I arrived, but fully explained all of the wonderful and unique features of the Hilton Tokyo. He encouraged me to sign up for the traditional Japanese breakfast, upgraded me to a penthouse level tower suite on the 38th floor (yes, you read that right!), hand delivered my luggage to my room, drew me a map complete with subway instructions, shopping recommendations and even found me a great spot to eat dinner. He is a fantastic employee who deserves to be recognized for his efforts. He goes above and beyond in every guest encounter. Even in the 10 minutes I stood with him he held the elevator door for guests, asked everyone around them how he could help, and had a huge smile on his face. I have stayed in hundreds of Hilton hotel rooms yet this experience will stay with me for the rest of my life. I am so impressed. Thank you so much! I have found my new home in Tokyo.

We bought reserved seats on the bullet train so we could sit together but what we didn't realize is that made us commit to the departure time from Kyoto. ($500rt). You can do non-reserved seats for the bullet train for about $12 less. You aren't committed to a time/train but you might not sit together. We spent 20 min (typing translating on an iPad) to actually figure all this out and buy the tickets because we were unfamiliar and language barrier) Even then we made it from the hotel to Tokyo station (and bullet train) in about an hour. We should of asked for a window seat though because she gave us a center and aisle seat and you can't change seats once you board or pay without a fee.

The other issue was with mixed messages from the concierge and front desk. One said just ask for a large taxi when we were checking out to depart to Kyoto. I did that and they asked “Did you Order one?” Ended up taking 2 taxis. Otherwise a great place. The shuttle was great to Shinjuku Station. ","Moreno Valley, California",11,5.0

It rained non stop and by our trip end, a typhoon was on its way to the city. Fortunately, our stay at the Tokyo Hilton was a bright spot. First plus is the hotel's location. From Haneda airport, we took the Friendly airport limousine which deposited us right at the Hilton's doorstep. The hotel staff greeted us warmly and we were checked in at a reasonable time. The room was adequate in size and while smaller than other rooms in other countries, keep in mind this is Tokyo where space is a premium. We found their gym fullyequipped with treadmills, statio bikes, cardio machines, and a small pool and made use of them on a daily basis. We did not have an opportunity to eat at the hotel but enjoyed the nearby districts' eating places which are numerous. I also appreciated the staff's help in booking our Hakone-Mt Fuji tour and reservation with the airport limousine back to the airport at the end of our trip. For our transport, we had a choice of taking the subway which had an at the hotel or a shuttle which will take you to the Shinjuku station. Form these points, you are connected to almost anywhere. Btw, we got the bundle transport from the airport which had roundtrip bus plus 72 hour subway use which cost us about 3500 yen.

First and foremost, while the language was an issue in most of the local hotels, at the Hilton, we were able to speak and communicate fluently in English... happiness! The location of this property is fantastic as we were close to the heartbeat of Tokyo...Shinjuku. Shopping, restaurants, shows, and most importantly, the Tokyo metro station was a stones throw from the hotel. While the lights and action of Shinjuku would have been enough adrenaline to keep you awake, the hotel was nicely placed in a quiet neighborhood far enough away so that when you did retire for the evening, it was a peaceful sleep. What was great about the hotel was the friendly staff and the room which was at the standard of what we were used to. A king size bed instead of the traditional Japanese setup of two twin beds. Views were amazing and the decor of the hotel was in line with what one would expect in a great city as Tokyo was. The complimentary shuttle transported those that wanted to get to the shopping district fast, but with the great facilities for pedestrians in Tokyo, we walked everywhere. The Tokyo metro station is connected to the hotel which was very convenient. When our stay was over we boarded a shuttle bus that took us directly to the airport without ever leaving the property.

I made the mistake of booking through a third party agent (they had a good deal) - this meant that I was not eligible for free wifi in my room as Hilton only offers this to members of their HHonors program and only if you book directly through the hotel. The daily charge for standard wifi is 1000 yen. They do offer free wifi in the lobby if you can be bothered going down there - a lot of guests hang around (probably the ones that were not eligible for free wifi in their rooms).The day before we were due to check out, I called the guest services hotline to ask the best way to get to Shinjuku Station so we could catch the Narita Express train to the airport but was told that the only way to get there was to walk (I thought this was strange, as I knew there was a free shuttle bus from the Hilton to Shinjuku but thought maybe we weren’t allowed to take luggage on the shuttle). On my way out, I asked the concierge desk to double check and they said we could take the free shuttle even with our luggage. Not sure why the information is inconsistent. It is also not conveniently located if you want to stay out late. While it is connected to Nishi-Shinjuku station, there is only one subway line passes through here and the walkway closes at around 10pm, which means if you want to get to other parts of Tokyo you’ll have to make a few transfers.

However, there was one concern that I particularly disliked is that the hotel did not have a turndown service, despite staying at their top suite category.

The 1 star is for the helpful concierge and decent breakfast. However, that is where the good points end. We booked our hotel room through an online agent, Japan-Ican. My husband is a Hilton Honors gold member and when we tried to register his membership number to the room, we were told that since we booked through an agent, showing his card has no effect. Meaning that his patronage would not even be acknowledged. I can understand that no points may be counted, but to acknowledge a paid visit would seem to be appropriate if the hotel would like to establish any long-term relationship with it's loyal guests. Further disappointment came when we requested to extend check-out time from the usual 12pm to 2pm. Again, we are told that due to the booking being made through an agent, that the request will not be entertained. That is perhaps the worst and most absurd reason to refuse late check-out. So the hotel wants to make it clear that it doesn't like us or any other customers for booking through an agent. If you don't like agents, then don't sell your rooms through them. Why compromise good service and act in such a petty manner? This will be the very last time that we patronize this establishment or any of it's chain hotels. We don't like places that don't appreciate our business. ",,6,1.0

Not sure what our original booking would have looked like but when we arrived in our 'upgraded' room we were disappointed to find it was tiny, drab and tired. We were perplexed as to how they were going to fit an extra bed in also (there were only two in the room and a third was supposedly being sent up right away). We were forced to go out and look around shinjuku (although we wanted to sleep) as the third bed never eventuated. 7 hours later at 10.30pm it was still not there, at which point we enquired as to where it was - we then still waited another half an hour for this mysterious bed to arrive, which it finally did 8 hours after we checked in. It was shoved into the only remaining spare space and the only chair in the room was taken away, leaving no room for bags or to walk around.

In fact, between all of my stays during the 1980s, the 1990s, and into the 2000s, I am certain that I have spend more than one year of my life living at this hotel. So, that lets you know my overall feelings about his establishment.This hotel is very nice and it is easy to get to from Narita International Airport (NRT). There is direct limousine bus and they drop you off right in front of the hotel. Then, the bell men quickly grab your bags for you.The front desk staff is always nice. Checking in is easy and there is always a very nice person who escorts you to your room. Though it is not really customary to tip in Japan, (as some employees find this offensive), this is a Western hotel chain and it seems that the staff have become accustomed to tipping. Though it is not required, my recommendation is to give the bell man somewhere in the neighborhood of five-hundred to one-thousand Yen. They always smile and they never turn it down.The rooms are always great at this hotel and well maintained. If they do not give you a room on one of the higher floors when you check in, my suggestion is to ask for one as this hotel provides you with some great views of Tokyo and beyond. You can even get a view of Fujiyama if you are on the right side of the hotel.More than just a place to stay, this hotel has a few very good restaurant, a nice bar, and a fun shopping arcade on its basement level. Check them out. It will be worth your time.This hotel is located just a few blocks from Shinjuku Station, so getting around Tokyo and beyond is very easy. It is also just a few blocks from the Shinjuku entertainment district. So, again, you are close to having something fun to do. Take a walk, that is one of the best things to do in Tokyo!

My room was beautiful, spacious, and had some nice design touches like the fact that you could see through the shower/tub room’s glass walls from the sink to the bedroom and out the window beyond. Of course there were screens you could close for privacy, but I was traveling alone and loved the sense of light and airiness. The bed was super comfortable (and I’m super picky about my beds!), the room was perfectly soundproofed and the room had all the amenities - tea kettle, TV, steam iron, etc. It’s a short, beautiful walk to either Shinjuku station (and all the amazing shopping and dining around there) or a relaxing, leafy green park with a lovely Shinto shrine in it. Its a slightly longer walk (20 minutes maybe?) to the Meiji Jinto and Shrine, which is a must-see on any visitor’s itinerary.

It was technically a layover as we were moving home, and we decided to stretch the layover into three nights to allow for sightseeing and to stretch our legs before the long flight home.I booked this hotel online with our Hilton Honors membership, which is free to join. With Hilton Honors you get free in-room wi-fi. The cost for three nights are in a King Deluxe room, advance pay (no refunds or cancellations), with breakfast, was 126,302.90 Japanese Yen, which was about $1,139 USD. That comes to about $380 per night. I generally refuse to pay this much for hotels. However, I figured Tokyo is in general an expensive city, and I wanted something comfortable and easy. I looked into many options to get from Narita Airport to the Hilton and settled on the Airport Limousine Bus. I was concerned about how to reserve these tickets in advance, but I ended up just getting off the airplane, going though customs, getting my baggage, and getting in the line at the Airport Limousine Bus counter. There are three counters in Terminal 1, two counters in Terminal 2, and one counter in Terminal 3. There is also one counter at Haneda Airport. It was easy to find the counter. I simply stood in line and bought the tickets on the spot. I had also been concerned that there wouldn't be enough seats on the bus and we would have to wait around for a later bus, but that didn't happen. I bought the tickets around 4:05 pm for the 4:30 pm bus, which gave us enough time to use the restroom, buy some snacks at the convenience store, and wait in line outside for the bus and get our baggage tagged. We had six pieces of luggage plus a stroller which is why I opted for the bus over the train. The bus goes directly from the airport to the door of the Hilton Tokyo (with a few other stops in Shinjuku, the area where the Hilton is located). It was very convenient. One round-trip ticket is 4,500 Yen. I bought a round-trip Narita ticket combined with a 72 hour subway ticket (on all Tokyo Metro and Toni Subway Lines) for 6,000 Yen. I also bought a ticket for my toddler because of how much baggage we had (I think the bus permits 2 pieces of baggage per person), although she could have sat in my lap at no cost. Going to the Hilton the ride took 1.5 hours. Going to the airport took 2 hours (45 minutes of that was picking up passengers at other stops in Shinjuku). I would definitely take the airport bus again if I had a lot of baggage or wanted an alternative to navigating the train/metro upon arrival. Check in was easy. I had purchased baseball tickets in advance and the tickets were safely with the concierge. I had a room request that I made in the online reservation and it was remembered. The Hilton check in representative even gave my toddler a little bag with a coloring book, crayons, a child's toothbrush and toothpaste, and slippers. There are six elevators that serve rooms on about 37 floors, so the elevator lobby is always busy and sometimes you have to wait for a second elevator. Our room was on the tenth floor. There was no special view. The view from the window was of some nondescript buildings. The Crabtree & Evelyn Verebena & Lavender toiletries were a lovely touch. The windows had a Japanese type sliding cover, and for black out purposes there was an even heavier shade to slide over the windows. I appreciated both shades and used both quite a bit. There were disposable white slippers, an iron with a cute plastic cover, fresh white bath towels, and two bottled waters replaced at no charge each day. The bed was comfortable. The room is small by western standards, but I was still able to fit 5 large pieces of luggage, a stroller, and set up my toddler's pack and play in the corner. It was a tight fit but we managed. The Hilton is in a good spot for taking the subway. I was intimidated just looking at the subway map, so every morning I would first check with the Hilton concierge regarding my route, and they were all friendly, clear and helpful. We took the subway to Roppongi (four stops away from Shinjuku station on the red Marunouchi line) for lunch one day at the Grand Hyatt to eat Kobe steak. We took the subway and JR train to Chiba, where we watched a baseball game (we passed Disneyland to get to Chiba and saw Cinderella's castle from the train window). In the hotel lobby, you can take the escalator down one level and walk via an underground walkway to the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station. This is how we got to Tokyo Station (about 10 stops away on the red Marunouchi line), which is where we caught the JR Keiyo line. We walked to Shinjuku station one morning to explore. Taxis are not cheap in Tokyo but they are convenient. We've been spoiled by low cost Uber in Southeast Asia. But taxis in Tokyo are safe and clean. The doors even open automatically- just stand/sit there and the driver will press a button to open your door. We took taxis to two restaurants in Roppongi. We took a taxi to a batting cage one morning.I also took the taxi to Shinjuku station (the Keio Department store) one morning when I was in a rush to buy some last minute souvenirs before our flight (less than 1,000 yen). I also took a taxi to the Tokyu Hands store which is next to Takashimaya for souvenir shopping. It was fun walking back to the Hilton at night because the air was cool and the streets were busy and there were lots of shops and restaurants to pass. There is a 24 hour mini supermarket about a 3 minute walk from the hotel. There is also a nice park about a 2 minute walk from the hotel. At the park's southern end there is a children's playground. It's a further walk to the playground and we only stayed for about 30 minutes because the cicadas in the summer are so very loud (loudest insect in the world).Breakfast was filled with options but always very busy. It runs until 10:30 am. There is an omelette station which always had a line, many types of breads, pancakes, French toast, juices, fresh kale juice, smoothies, soymilk, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, an assortment of Japanese breakfast items including salted salmon, and some Chinese breakfast items.I would absolutely stay here again assuming I had the resources. It's convenient location, cleanliness and the friendly staff make it a comfortable choice.","San Francisco, California",101,4.0

We were able to check in early and our room was well appointed and relatively spacious (most hotel rooms in Japan are on the small side but this was quite big).The hotel is very handy for both Tochomae and Nishi Shinjuku underground stations, though you can get a free shuttle bus which runs every 20 minutes from the western side of Shinjuku Station (and wasn't particularly well advertised anywhere). From either station you can actually remain underground as you walk to the hotel, which is a bonus in the heat of the summer.I walked west, into the more residential area of Shinjuku, and found lots of nice places to eat and a supermarket - as well as a really good, 24h, coin laundry, which has a nice Indian restaurant next door.

Not often. Perhaps never. Hilton Tokyo did just that. It delivered and then some. Having stayed all over the world and experiencing so many different tourist destinations, it is not often that our family decides to forego a trip or delay the start of a tour or rush back early from a day of exhausting sightseeing to get back to our beloved hotel. But this was the case here. The executive junior room with the breakfast included for 8 days and 7 nights was pure bliss. The room was spacious and oh so clean! And those remarkable Hilton beds. Sinking into it at the end of a hot summer day in Tokyo was exactly what the doctor ordered. The next morning we would rush to the marble lounge for breakfast. My kids who never wake up early did so for this hotel's amazing breakfast. And did I mention the subway is attached to the hotel?! Attached!! From that subway we traveled like true Tokyo natives all over the city and even to Kyoto! Want to shop when it's raining outside? Don't worry. Hilton Tokyo has you covered literally. They not only have the subway metro right under your nose but they also offer complimentary shuttle buses to Shinjuku, a thriving shopping district. My husband and I woke up early each morning for the marvelous gym(food in Tokyo can add up to those calories!) and my family so enjoyed the pool. Every request we had and every whim was granted. And the concierge was perhaps the best I have ever experienced. Especially Sato. She gave us the best restaurant recommendations and they were spot on every time. All in all, we would never stay anywhere else. Hilton Tokyo- you are a winner in this family's eyes! ",,4,5.0

We loved the special Japanese breakfast as well as the huge buffet breakfast selection at the lobby. Checking-in at the lobby was swift. And checking-out at the lounge was even better. The hotel has a regular shuttle bus to Shinjuku station. Just that the bus was very crowded, especially if you happened to be there for the weekend, since the bus is not reserved strictly for hotel staying guests only. We realized that many Japanese take the bus to the hotel for its restaurants and events. Fortunately, there are 2 subway stations within walking distance.

The service was top of the class from the very moment we stepped into the property, someone pointed us up to the executive lounge on the 37th floor to pick up our room key cards as online check-in was already done the day before. The staff were all very courteous and most helpful and never failed to greet you warmly. There was a good selection on the buffet breakfast at the Marble Lounge. There was also an option of breakfast at the executive lounge and Japanese breakfast at Junisoh, the Japanese restaurant. Needless to say, we really appreciated all the extra space in the bedroom (44sqm). The room and furnishing looks new except for a few minor brown stains on the carpet. There is a free shuttle bus to/from Shinjuku Station. It tends to get quite crowded coming from Shinjuku Station because the hotel runs many special lunch/afternoon tea promotions. There were one or two occasions where we almost couldn't get on the bus. The hotel could possibly consider utilising a bus with a larger capacity during anticipated busy hours. Alternatively, it is a pleasant 3-5 minute walk underground to the nearest metro/subway station from the hotel. The Airport Limousine Bus for both Haneda and Narita also come to this hotel which makes it really convenient especially if you have a lot of luggage.On a slightly negative note, there are 6 lifts that service 38 floors on this property and they get very busy during peak hours. Imagine trying to get down from one of the higher floors, in a very full lift and stopping at every other floor. And the swimming pool was rather small and nondescript for such a big hotel but who comes to Tokyo to swim right? In summary, the Hilton is an excellent hotel with impeccable customer service. We would definitely come back when we visit Tokyo again. ","Sydney, Australia",28,5.0

This was by far the best and largest room we had in travelling to six cities in Japan. It was a good size and all amenities were provided – including a little pack of toiletries and bedroom slippers for my child. The hotel is in a great location! Conveniently located across the street from a lovely park (Shinjuku Chuo), if children are in need of a good run around. Although the hotel is in Shinjuku, it is actually closer to the business district (‘Skyscraper City’) and away from the bright lights and craziness of the station area. The hotel is also connected via subway to Nishi Shinjuku station, which is on the Maranouchi line, so you can avoid Shinjuku station if necessary and the Airport Limo bus will drop you right at the doorstep. Also the Metropolitan Government Offices, which are right across the street, have a fantastic observatory with free entry offering wonderful views of Tokyo.Breakfast is excellent – the chefs at the egg station in particular are so impressive at multitasking and making fantastic omelettes. Great variety of Western and Japanese food – we would often skip lunch from being so full from breakfast. The concierge was also very helpful in forwarding our luggage to Kyoto and directing us to many conveniences around – including a laundromat and chemist. A great stay and good base to explore Tokyo, especially if travelling with kids. Although a business hotel, it suited our needs as a family perfectly.","Singapore, Singapore",57,5.0

The location is very close to Shinjuku station which made traveling around very easy! The hotel room and gym area were very nice and clean. Luckily we were upgraded upon check in and were able to visit the Exec lounge for a free breakfast but if you do not have access here, like our traveling companions, breakfast can be quite expensive ($30 a person). This is mostly a business area so there aren't many options around to opt to for a quick breakfast either. Two other notes:-The cleaning lady came in and cleaned while we were still in the room...I'm not sure if this was a language issue but it was very awkward as we were still dressing and getting ready.-We asked the hotel for a recommendation to a nice steakhouse for a splurge dinner. Unfortunately, the place they recommended did not speak any English which we found strange for a upscale restaurant. As a result, we had complications with our orders and spent quite a lot of money on food that was only so-so and not exactly what we thought we ordered.",,6,5.0

I especially want to call attention to the GREAT concierge service. They will help you with literally everything; from directions, to navigating the transportation system, to making reservations for you etc. They go far beyond expectations and go out of their way to get you set up with maps, information so on. Thus definitely make use of their friendly service and help.I would advise against paying for the included breakfast option. It is a buffet that is something like $30 a person, while the property has several breakfast options within a five minute walk, from a Denny's, to a café called the Royal Host, to a Starbucks. At these locations we would get a full breakfast for three for only around $20 U.S.The property is in a great location, less then a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku Station, and a 15 minute walk to the center of Shinjuku's daytime shopping and the center of the evening and night activity.You can't go wrong choosing the Shinjuku Hilton for your stay.",los angeles,97,4.0

My favorite parts about the hotel is the assortment of restaurants located on the lower floors and the convenient free shuttle that comes every 20 minutes taking you to or from Shinjuku station to the Hilton. While pricey, the restaurants served fantastic food and was a great dining experience. Choices include a western BBQ place, a Japanese restaurant, and I believe a Chinese restaurant as well, in addition to their dessert shop. The shuttle will quickly take you to Shinjuku station which allows you to essentially travel all over Japan. Luxury certainly comes with a price, but it's well worth it.

Views out over Nishi (west) Shinjuku, and about 15 minutes walk back to JR Shinjuku although the Maranouchi line has a stop just next to the hotel and can be reached in less than 10 minutes. The hotel has a shuttle bus to ferry you back and forth to the station also. The executive lounge on the 37th floor is huge and caters for mainly executive room guests with a separate gold/diamond lounge located on the same floor looking after Hhonors members. We enjoyed the superb service from Waki who hosts the gold/diamond lounge. Both lounges offer a great selection of food, with a chef making omelettes in the main lounge in the morning and supported by friendly English speaking service staff. The pool and fitness centre is located on the 5th floor and has a lovely pool, sauna and onsen which is a real treat.

While nice facilities are all well and good, the true high marks go to the staff who were some of the best I've encountered.

Two in particular (Hilton, this is where you take notes and reward them) - Mami (didn't get her surname) who worked the breakfast buffet went above and beyond, recognizing us and customizing service to our preferences each subsequent day. In the afternoons, I didn't get her name, but she attended Temple university and spent 4 months in Philadelphia.. her English could easily pass for a native Californian, and her personable attentiveness and charming conversation made for an outstanding experience as she offered tips on what we might enjoy seeing.

A 5* room. - Executive lounge wasn't overwhelmed - food options at breakfast were decent, not spectacular. Would probably try the restaurants instead. For light snack, it was a bit sparse but quiet and comfortable. - Of course, the staff was quite welcoming. Got a late checkout. - The health club is solid - 24/7 access, decent equipment. Lots of cardio, weight areas are smallish but workable. - Proximity to transit - walk to the Hyatt Regency across the street (about 5 minutes) to get to the subway - Shinjuku lines are ~10 minute walk away. Depends what you're carrying and your tolerance for heat. Cons- It was a bit of a nuthouse in the lobby - I thought maybe the pricing would keep out the riff raff, but no such luck.

The rooms are absolutely great, my family was fortunate enough to be served by an excellent hotel manager by the name of Ernesto Bressan, a very kind manager that is a hardworker and goes beyond the call of duty. If you have trouble with anything, just ask for him and he'll solve your problems. The maids at the hotel are great and do great jobs cleaning your hotels. The rooms with the views are gorgeous as they show the bustling city of Tokyo. The toilets at the hotel are quite hilarious but get the job done. Cheers to the hotel. I also have to add that when you walk into the hotel, the smell is absolutely fantastic! I can't even explain it in words, it's just so good! The hotel has a gym and a pool. The gym has everything you need, training your biceps and core and such. The pool also has a view of the city and a window on the top of the roof where you can see the sky. The hotel is very convenient and is around many areas such as Tokyo Station (you will be needing this), restaurants that are fantastic, and walking distance to the Metropolitan Government building where you can access the top floor where you can also see Tokyo, free of charge!

We called the guest service hotline for assistance, a staff arrived and ""instructed"" us to turn the air conditioning to the lowest temperature and then highest temperature, ""the sound may disappear if you don't change the temperature"". It's a known problem for the hotel and we kept doing this for 3 nights already. We still need to stay with such ridiculous problem for 3 more nights which made us sleepless for whole night. Besides, the design of bath room was terrible. There's no ventilation inside it that made the floor and everywhere wet and slippery. The glass blocking the bath tub is useless, all water came out to the floor after taking a shower.

The bus ride is about 45 m (with jam), and from Haneda, about 1000 yen. (it would be 3100 yen from Narita). Separately, the hotel is 20 min walk away from Shinjuku station, so they provide a free shuttle service for residents. I think the shuttle ends it run at around 9 pm. If you need to take a cab back from Shinjuku after dark (which we did), it cost USD10 for about 4 min of cab ride. (yes, cabs in Japan are expensive). Right beside the hotel is a metro station, but I would think the main Shinjuku station is more convenient in getting you around. There is also a convenience stall right below it. We took the shuttle bus back to the airport, and that bus does have limited space for big luggages (maybe around 4 - 5 max). Overall, the room size is not fantastic, given the price that we are charged.","Singapore, Singapore",17,4.0

The entrance/reception area are spacious but also the old world glamorous. Not updated and modern. Being a popular chain, it was definitely crowded.Room: We booked the Executive King Junior Suite which was 44sqm and it was luxurious and very spacious which is so precious in a crowded city. There were plenty of space to put our luggage and walk around. The king bed was comfy and there was a large living area with a huge sofa and coffee table. There was also a counter area with Japanese teapot set and Nespresso machine with complimentary tea, coffee and bottled water. The bathroom was a little small for a large room and the shower area is a little tiny which shares a relatively small bathtub. However I liked the strong water pressure and the Thomas Roth toiletries provided.Lounge: Staying in a suite means we get free access to the club lounge. As a typical international hotel chain, the lounge was big and had lots of variety of food and beverages, including all kinds of alcohol. The only downside was that it was VERY CROWDED. It's almost packed every evening when we were there (around 5/6pm) and this means that it can be a little rowdy. Dining: Other than the typical complimentary buffet or lounge breakfast, Hilton has a special Japanese breakfast (Kaiseki style) and requires reservation in advance and there are also seating timings too. This was unique hence we made an effort to try it at least once. The food was traditional and pretty good (which you can see from my photos) but I could tell that some of the guests were not used to the flavours. My husband and I, however enjoyed the experience.Service at the reception, lounge and all around were excellent hence we will definitely consider staying at Hilton again.","Singapore, Singapore",41,5.0

Here on vacation with wife and older daughter. Had a 1 bedroom suite (sounds spacial, and by Tokyo standards probably is but overall I thought the space was small, especially the bathroom). However, overall, I would say this property excels on service, the overall customer experience, the breakfast offering (both on the executive floor but especially on the main floor), and general proximity to all things in Tokyo.Specifics:- Shinjuku is as reasonable as any location in Tokyo. I know it's known for being a business center but access to the subway is excellent, there are lots of restaurants in the area, and the Shinjuku night district is within easy walking access. Shinjuku train station is a short walk away (or, take the Hilton shuttle bus every 20 or so minutes). You could go to Roppongi, or to central Tokyo, fine, no problem, but I found Shinjuku to be quite high quality.- Asian Hiltons are not the same as Hilton properties located in the U.S. (thankfully).- The Hilton Tokyo has an EXCEPTIONAL level of customer service.- Rooms: We had 2, a 1 bedroom suite and a regular room. Bathrooms are tiny in both. But other than that the rooms are generally fine. I would have preferred a bit better lighting in the suite. Beds were excellent. Showers more than adequate. A/C was fine. Internet very good.- Breakfast is awesome. Definitely get that in your room rate. Truly, this is the best breakfast buffet service we've ever encountered. Massive fruit offerings; smoked salmon; superb Asian fare; and the list goes on. I couldn't imagine how to improve on the offering.- Very convenient shuttle service to/from Shinjuku Station. Also direct bus service to/from Narita airport (although I recommend taking the Narita Express train to Shinjuku - it's faster, but not necessarily more convenient given that you have to navigate the expanse of Shinjuku Station.)- Restaurants on site are exceptional. The Metropolitan is special, but it comes at a price, however it is worth it. There are several other food options, and although I didn't have a chance to try them all, I would not hesitate to do so.- The 2 bars are exceptional, if not expensive (but, this is Tokyo), they are definitely exceptional quality and above average service.- Concierge service: Excellent.- Executive floor: Definitely worth it. The evening program of cocktails (free) and appetizers is an exceptional value.Bottom line: Price/value: Exceptional. Yes, this is a large hotel, generally business oriented, but not overly so. Japanese quality in terms of service and customer orientation. Footnote: There are two subway station entrances within a 3 minute walk from the hotel.Final comment: you will not go wrong on the price-value equation here. The Asian Hilton management (and I've stayed at several of their properties, several of which are 'franchised') across Asia, are excellent. Again, exceptional price-value.","Houston, Texas",110,5.0

As you know, most Japanese hotels are small and usually will only accommodate 3 people in a room. So, our choices were already limited. We are Hilton Honors members and decided to the Hilton Tokyo a try, especially because there was a good deal on suites if I prepaid. So, that's what I did. However, to be frank, as we neared our trip, I was starting to worry about having selected the Hilton, since some friends recommended a few hotels that were more trendy and centrally located. In my mind, I started to compare it to some Hiltons I've stayed at in the U.S. which were not very nice. Luckily, I had already pre-paid and couldn't cancel. Hilton prepay had saved me from myself!!! The minute we walked in, we were all impressed. The assistance and guidance with our luggage and front desk service made us feel like royalty. Accommodations: We had a king suite on the 23rd floor and saying we were wowed is a huge understatement. I felt like I walked into a celebrity mansion on that old MTV show CRIBS. (see our photos attached). Since there were four of us, they had already set up an additional rollaway bed. The shower and bath combo was strange at first, but it all made sense later and we ended up loving it. One of my key evaluations of hotels worldwide is the water pressure and this hotel did not disappoint. The range of water pressure went from gentle spring to all out firehose!!! Wow!!! Let's not even mention the TOTO heated seat toilets and washlets. AMAAAAAZING!!! Everyone in America and the world needs to get a TOTO toilet. There would be world peace just from that alone.Executive lounge: OMG!!! The food and service there were beyond proper adjectives. There's a good mix between Western and Japanese breakfast. Fresh squeezed orange juice on demand. The omelettes were made with so much love, it was a show in itself just watching the Chef create it. Hard to explain, you just have to witness it yourself. (Caution: The eggs there might be too runny for more westerners, but not for us! Perfecto!) Our entire Japan trip could have been spent in our room, the lobby, the shops below the hotel (Hiltopia), and the EXECUTIVE LOUNGE and we would have been quite content.The RESTAURANTS in the hotel itself looked amazing. The pictures of the food shown in the elevator tempted us each time. However, because we had committed to actually leaving the property to see Tokyo, we opted not to eat at the hotel restaurants. CONVENIENCE: The hotel is conveniently situated between the Nishi (a.ka. West) Shinjuku & Tochomae Stations. Both stations can be accessed from a walkway below the hotel. From Nishi Shinjuku, you can easily hop on the Marunouchi line which connects you to the main Shinjuku Station. From the Tochomae Station you can catch the Oedo line to Ginza district. There's also a free Hilton Shuttle that takes you to and from Shinjuku Station. We never used it because it was so convenient to walk there.Cuurency exchange TIP: Getting YEN is more economical (given the competitive exchange rates) via ATM machines at convenience stores like 7-11. The 7-11 brand has their own banks call 7-Banks. Luckily for you, there is a 7-Bank stand alone ATM right below the hotel across from the convenience store. Hotel Pool: Was not open when we were here, but who comes all the way to Tokyo to sit in a pool??Getting to the hotel: You can easily get to the hotel from Narita Airport in comfort aboard the airport limousine. The bus driver and the hotel bellhops will handle your bags. Sit back and relax.Hotel location: The hotel is situated on the western side of Shinjuku. The western side is quieter and away from the madness of Shinjuku's eastern side. Great for a little respite from the crowds.Summary: During our 8 nights in Japan, we actually stayed at this hotel twice - the first 4 nights, then 2 nights at Hilton Osaka, then right back to Hilton Tokyo! Hilton Osaka was very very nice, but we all missed the executive lounge at Hilton Tokyo! We've been back two weeks already and my sons keep asking if I could make breakfast like the executive lounge? NO, I can't!!! I know everyone has different budgets, but I'm sure every room at this hotel is spectacular. Try to get access to the Executive Lounge. Even though it may appear to cost more, you save money by eating their complimentary and hearty breakfast/brunch. You can save money other ways with good cheap eats all around Tokyo too. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone!!! We will stay here again on our next trip to Tokyo!!!",NorCal,62,5.0

The view from our room, not as great. The Executive Lounge was a huge perk. Additionally, being a Diamond member at this Hilton had its advantages (where some Hiltons don’t even acknowledge that). Our room was not able to be upgraded so they sent up a ½ bottle of wine to our room. Our breakfast options were the Executive Lounge or the restaurant in the lobby. We ate at the restaurant each morning. This hotel is one of the busiest Hiltons I’ve stayed it. However, it did not impact the level of customer service. Everyone we ran into were very attentive and wanted to make sure their guests were happy. Would I stay again? When we went their room prices were quite high. I’m not sure it’s worth the cost, in all honesty. The hotel is a bit dated. I have no problem spending a lot on hotels. But I do if the room itself shows a lot of wear and tear, as ours did.

Shinjuku is a great neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants. We had a family of 5, with one triple room with three twin beds, and one double room with two twin beds. The rooms were pretty standard, with a little Japanese flair, with nice views, comfortable beds, and nice amenities. The hotel is a big, bustling, Western-style luxury hotel, at the high end of the various Hilton properties around the world. I often stay in a Hilton Hotel in NYC, and I noticed right away that the lobby smelled very similar to the NYC hotel. We saw where they piped in the scent. I wonder if it is the Hilton signature scent? It was funny, but it did make me feel at home. We had some confusion with our check in, because we had reserved the two rooms separately, one with Hilton points and one with Amex points, so it was difficult linking the two reservations. I had anticipated that, and tried calling in advance to explain, but we had to work it out when we arrived in person. This led to some difficulty in getting a package delivered later, but that sort of thing is to be expected in a big hotel. The staff were very attentive and eager to help, and everyone spoke excellent, perfectly fluent English, as I would have expected in a Hilton hotel. The concierge staff were helpful in giving us directions and making suggestions. The hotel has a big breakfast buffet in the lobby, which had many Western and Japanese selections. Our kids really loved it. There were several restaurants on site, which we did not get to sample, although two kids downed by jet lag did get room service dinner one night, and it met with their approval. We did peek in on one of the restaurants, I think it was a Chinese restaurant, and it looked very nice. The hotel runs a frequent shuttle bus to and from Shinjuku Station, which is very convenient. It is a good way to get around. We had planned to take the Romancecar Train from Shinjuku Station to Hakone, which is one reason we chose this hotel. Unfortunately, the day we were scheduled to take the train, there was an accident, and the train was cancelled, but we got there on a regular commuter train. Best laid plans and all. The hotel also sits above an underground shopping arcade, and the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station, which is also quite convenient. There was a coffee shop there, where we got coffee one morning, and a convenience store as well (maybe a Family Mart?) The subway station is not directly below the hotel. It is at least a 10 minute or so walk underground, but it worked out well for traveling by subway around Tokyo, which is very large. Shinjuku Chuo Park is a short walk from the hotel. It has a shrine, a waterfall, playgrounds, sculptures, etc. My husband enjoyed running there in the morning, and we enjoyed walking there as a family. The hotel is convenient to many other interesting sites. Overall, we had a great experience at this hotel and would stay again. I highly recommend it.","South Orange, New Jersey",72,4.0

We took the free shuttle from Hilton each day, that takes you to the Shinjuku station ( and back). It runs in 20 minute intervals. The drivers are friendly and always on time.

There are hot tubs (onsen) in the locker rooms. There are two tennis courts.There was a refrigerator in the room, but it was packed tight with minibar items. I went to one of the Hilton hotel restaurants my first night and I couldn't believe how high the prices were. So every night thereafter I just grabbed takeaway from ground level of department stores (pro tip - you've never seen department stores with food displays like they have in Japan) and ate in my room. There is an ATM in Hiltopia (the small collection of shops and restaurants in the basement of the Hilton) that has a 7-11 ATM (one of the few which allow you to get cash with your American bank card).I did splurge on room service breakfast each morning, and it was first rate.

One other evening I stopped by for a drink but otherwise I was busy with business meetings each evening – still I was pleased with the food and service. The Executive Suite was busy but the hosts controlled things with assigned seating.I did have breakfast one morning in the Executive Suite and was very happy with the choices including cooked to order eggs/omelets. But all of the other mornings I chose to eat downstairs at the Marble Lounge that has a fantastic breakfast buffet – this was complimentary as a Hilton Diamond member. Having an early breakfast helped avoid what appeared to be fairly large crowds later in the morning.One evening a colleague and I got back to the hotel after the Executive Lounge had closed and we met for a nightcap at the Zatta Lounge. The setting was great and there was a small jazz combo playing which set a comfortable mood.The hotel is within easy walking distance of the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station and there is an underground connection to the main Shinjuku Station – just take the escalator from the lobby down and it’s an easy 15 min walk – all underground in easy to navigate pedestrian walkways.Getting to the hotel from Narita is cheapest by taking the Airport Limousine service directly to the hotel. Be sure to book your return bus trip ahead of time.I recommend the Hilton Tokyo hotel.","Albany, NY",78,5.0

Overall, we were very happy with the hotel. The room was nice and we had a great city view. The only English-speaking TV channels were news shows, and rather repetitive ones at that. The concierge team was outstanding. They didn’t just have one overworked concierge, they usually had three people and we never had to wait long. We asked them questions at least four times and every time they were great.There isn’t much in the immediate area, but there is a shuttle that comes every 20 minutes or so to Shinjuku Station. We tried walking, but immediately got lost, plus it was freezing. We found that having to take the shuttle cut down on our spontaneity because everything needed to be planned out, so that was one thing we didn’t like.Breakfast was included in our stay and it was excellent. It was thoughtful of them to start the continental breakfast before the cooked breakfast so those who needed to leave earlier than the posted breakfast hours could eat.

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE from the concierge and front desk team.My new husband and I stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 6 nights on our Japan honeymoon and they made sure we wouldn't forget this hotel in the most negative way possible. On our last night, we decided to stay in and order delivery from an outside service. Our delivery arrived at 10:30pm and we received an email stating the hotel would not let them in and the food could not be delivered. What's troubling to my husband and I is that no one contacted us to tell us they turned our delivery away when we could have gone downstairs to pick it up. We called the front desk and they blamed concierge, then proceeded to transfer me to room service. We went downstairs to the front desk and the front desk told us to go the concierge. The concierge, Motohashi, tried to ""help"" us by fiddling with his computer and calling the delivery service back. After 35 minutes of arguing with the delivery service, they decided the company was not going to redeliver. I asked the concierge next to him, Murakami, if he could call the manager. He got on the phone and started talking in Japanese and laughing. This made me feel very terrible and I made sure to tell him that and he smiled. Murakami was of no help and went on his computer to stay away from our situation. My husband stayed with the concierge and I went to the front desk to ask for a manager. The night manager, Taniguchi, came out 10 minutes later and seemed as if he already knew our situation. The concierge told him that they already allowed the delivery service in, which was NOT AT ALL what happened and there was a serious miscommunication. By this point, it was close to an hour since our food had originally arrived. Taniguchi offered to give us 50% off the room service menu. This angered us even more because we made a conscious effort to not order from room service because of how expensive it was. Then after some argument, he offered us a better deal that would feed us for the night. He walked us up to our room and awkwardly invited himself in to watch us look at the menu and reiterate the situation by saying it was miscommunication between the concierge, him and us. Wtf. It was terrible and this is our lasting impression of the Hilton Tokyo. Our food arrived at 12:15am.Along with this situation, the shower door is a terrible design; a less than half glass door that allows all the water to fall on the floor while you shower. The bidet is great, although it doesn't have the seat warmer unlike the Hilton Tokyo Odaiba and Sheraton Grande Bay Tokyo. Some good things about this trip, we were gifted a bottle of wine to celebrate our honeymoon and had a king bed on the 33rd floor. The shuttle to shinjuku station is helpful and the underground tunnel passage to the train station is a great perk. Location is away from the crowds.All in all, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone celebrating anything. They will find a way to make your stay an unpleasant one.","San Diego, California",5,1.0

The elegant well dressed staff welcomes you at the door. The Front Desk staff is very friendly and helpful. The luggage was brought up as soon as we checked in. I mentioned it in my Conrad Hilton's review: don't be surprised if a girl delivers your bags. They are mostly girls taking care of luggage and they seem to enjoy it. The standard rooms are cozy and sufficient. Not big rooms but exactly what you need in Asia. Clean and well maintained which is important. I enjoyed the bathroom and how cool the shower is! Great city views from the rooms. This hotel has a fabulous selection of food. From the bar to the restaurants and the desserts, everything is really good. The breakfast was my favorite time of the day. Wonderful selection and service. The hotel has a tennis court and even in February people were having fun outside hitting some balls with the rackets. There's a free shuttle service to the main metro station. You can walk around this area and go shopping or walk to the nearest park. The location is absolutely great for walking and seeing the most of downtown.If you are a Hilton Honors member and have access to the Executive lounge, I really enjoyed this one. They have a great area and the view from there is outstanding. We saw the most beautiful sunset of the trip. If you don't have access to the lounge just try to get an even number room (opposite to the entrance). Our room was facing the entrance which was still a nice view. I loved this property and the staff was the best! Ernest at the Front Desk made our check in smooth and enjoyable. He has a great attitude all the time.A very special thank you to Ari, who made our trip just Memorable. He gave us the best tips and suggestions on how to enjoy Tokyo to the max.

So good! *Room: Perfect blend of Japanese culture and modern décor. One of the best in the Hilton system. The room has a contemporary Japanese style that feels both luxurious as well subtle. Honestly, the Hilton hotels in Japan have some of the greatest appeal to me. From entry into the room to the rice paper window coverings and hard black out shutter doors, the room feels like you are getting what you are paying for but also does not boast. The luxuries are subtle but most definitely there. As far as plugs go, there are two US compatible outlets behind the table and also one next to the bed. There are two additional USB power slots. The iron is awesome, but is labeled in Japanese. Have Google translate app loaded on your phone! If this reads just like my Osaka and Nagoya review because…the rooms are identical. *Bed: Firm but not too “Asian firm.” Very comfortable with a medium firm pillow and a medium weight comforter. *Bathroom: Love this bathroom as it continues with the contemporary luxuries of the room, but again, does not seem over the top. There is plenty of counter space, one outlet, a hair dryer, a western style shower head AND an Asian style wand. The best part of this bathroom is the fully electric TOTO toilet/bidet with a heated seat and remote control. One disappointment was the towels. They were far too rough and scratchy for a ‘luxury’ brand hotel. The best part of this room was the high quality wireless iron and the hard, sliding blackout window shades. The outlets are also US compatible. The air condition was very sufficient. *Bed: The bed was a little on the hard side, but still very comfortable. Comforter was light to medium in weight. *Bathroom: Clean and modern. My room had the Japanese electric toilet seat with bidet and heated seat. The shower uses the Asian style shower wand. *Gym: -Free weights: Dumbbells -Cardio: 4 Treadmills, 3 bikes, 2 recumbent bikes, 4 ellipticals-Olympic: None-Functional: Ab Balls, mats-Machines: Smith machines and full complement of PRECOR machines for a full body workout. *Dining: Did not try.*Location: About a 10-15 minute walk from Shinjuku station and the restaurant, shopping, bar district beyond the station. There is not a lot in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. *Recommend restaurant /bar/ site: Robot Restaurant. Google it!! **** Most local restaurants and bars accept cash only. The ATMs are in the Family Mart and 7 Elevens. It is NOT convenient to test all the ATMs for compatibility. Recommend bringing cash from the airport. There is an ATM at the hotel, but I did not try it. ","Irvine, California",34,5.0

The bathroom was spacious, and the sofa / living room area was sufficiently large as well.When I thought I'd drop by the executive lounge for a quick drink around 6pm, I was rather surprised to find a queue of approx. 14-15 people waiting outside the exeutive lounge.Upon having a closer look, this was the queue to check in with the executive lounge desk, and then there was another queue sort of inside the lounge with people waiting to be seated.The hotel representatives as the desk were very apologetic, and provided me with a voucher so that I could enjoy my cocktail hour in the hotel bar instead. Fair enough, but I missed out on the nice views of the city from the lounge.My 2nd stay:My friend and I had booked a two bed standard room and we got upgraded to a Deluxe double bed room. Fair enough, as I understand there aren't that many hotels with higher room categories that have two beds.Again I was very happy with the room, which also appeared to be quite new and was sufficiently spacious (at least by Tokyo standards).Just before 6pm I went up the the executive lounge, thinking I'd secure a nice table for my two colleagues and I. Again, the lounge was packed, however luckily there wasn't that many people queueing this time.I was seated at one of the high tables (with bar stools) and made an agreement with one of the representatives that I would be granted a nicer table once one opened up.Having been sitting there for only 6-7 minutes or so, one of the tables (with comfortable lounge chairs and a sofa) close to the entrance to the lounge became available.I immediately proceeded trying to get eye contact with the hotel staff member I made the agreement with, thinking my two friends who had yet to arrive would be very happy with our seating arrangement.What happened next baffled me. A group of four young (twenty something) Japanese people arrived at the lounge, and they were promptly seated at the available table in question.I am aware that Europeans / white people are not welcome in e.g. all kinds of restaurants / night clubs etc. in Japan, however I thought this could not happen in an international hotel of a certain format.On top of this, it seemed as if the warm food buffet was never replenished. At least all three times when I checked, the trays were empty for the duration of approx. an hour or so. Of course I could have been unlucky with my timing visiting the warm food buffet...While waiting I also overheard the front desk staff telling arriving guests that the lounge was at capacity and they suggesting the guests waiting in their hotel rooms for the exeutive front desk to call them if a table opened up. This is an abysmal way to treat paying customers in my opnion, keeping in memory my first visit when at least I got a voucher with me for the hotel bar!Location wise this hotel is nicely situated in the Shinjuku area.Personally I think the most convenient way to travel from Narita Airport to the hotel is the hotel's shuttle bus service. It takes 80-90 minutes, and costs 3100 JPY (if memory serves correctly).On the airport is first come first served, however there was never a shortage of available seats. If you want to take the shuttle bus back to any of the two airports, you need to book in advance with the hotel.To sum things up:- It is not worth the extra money to pay for rooms with executive lounge benefits- Rooms are nice, clean and provides the necessary space for a wary traveller- I'm a bit concerned as to whether or not Europeans receive the same respect as people originating from the countryWill I be staying at this property on my next visit to Tokyo? No - most likely not, and mainly due to my experiences in the executive lounge. Instead I will probably see how e.g. the Conrad Tokyo hotel treat their Hilton Diamond members on my next visit.","Trondheim, Norway",121,2.0

We are partial to staying at Hilton Hotels and our stay here only reinforced that idea. Thanks to his being a rewards member they upgraded us to a nicer room in a very quick process right when we got to the hotel explaining everything very efficiently. The dining selection was good but the highlight was the exclusive dining options offered to Hilton Gold status members. We had our own quieter more intimate dining area on like the 27th floor and nearby we also had a smaller exclusive bar area as well. Be aware that the restaurants on the bottom floor are a little on the pricier side but that's about par for the course in most Tokyo restaurants of that quality. On a different note all of the areas had these cool automatic air freshener dispensers that dispensed the best smelling air freshener ever.The hotel offers a swimming pool, a nice work out area that includes a smith machine and free-weights, and to my surprise a tennis court (though you need to have your own racquets). The room we stayed in was a suite that had a spacious bathroom, a large sectional couch, and two slightly larger than twin sized beds that were probably the comfiest beds I've ever stayed in and I'm not just saying that because I was sleep deprived. The bathroom was pretty sweet with a tub and a shower but most importantly it had a futuristic Japanese toilet with a heated seat and a function that sprayed deodorizer into the toilet after every 5 minutes of sitting there.Last but not least the concierge was exceedingly helpful with all the strange requests and question we had for him on our first trip for Tokyo whether it was finding out about where to buy certain things to which local sites to visit. Most impressively he was able to map us out clear directions from our hotel to Tokyo Disney by way of the subway.I would highly recommend the Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku.

(We had originally planned to be at a more centrally located hotel like the Century Southern Tower.) Anyway, we followed suit and booked a king suite for my brother and a junior suite for my mum and me, and we paid upfront three months in advance for our 10-night stay (26 January - 5 February). I kept my fingers crossed as it was my first time staying at a Hilton hotel (a restaurant experience at the Hilton Paddington in London some time back had left much to be desired); however, several years ago, I had stayed at the Conrad in Bangkok and that was lovely.The pros:- A welcome note from the GM Michael Williamson and a generous fruit platter of strawberries and blueberries, a small box of chocolates and some madeleines. - Spacious rooms with all the usual amenities and a nice city view. I liked the impressively expansive sofa which was perfect for lounging around. - The Executive Lounge on the 37th floor that provided a more exclusive space for guests, with great views of the city and Fuji san (Mount Fuji) over breakfast, afternoon tea and pre-dinner drinks and snacks. (My mum enjoyed the onsen egg and free-flow of champagne, while my favourite was the superb dashi that went with the soba served on certain evenings!)- As it got quite monotonous after a few days and nights of having almost identical meals at the Executive Lounge, it was wonderful of the staff to offer us an additional option of having the delightful Japanese breakfast at Junisoh on the second floor.- Professional, English-speaking staff on the 37th floor. One evening, as the older folks were just too tired to do much, we had the help of a most obliging lady who arranged to have a few dishes delivered from Chinese restaurant Dynasty. (I think she was bespectacled and I can't remember her name, but she really smoothened matters by acceding to our unusual, last minute request.) Two others with easier names to recall were Andrea and Makoto, who also helped with occasional requests such as restaurant reservations. The concierge staff at the lobby were also helpful with tour bookings. - Hiltopia with its shops and the 24-hour convenience store as well as the Hilton shuttle bus were especially useful for the senior folks to explore and get around comfortably. The shuttle bus would pick up and drop off hotel guests between the hotel and the Shinjuku station area at 20-minute intervals.- Two subway lines (Marunouchi and Oedo) for quicker access to other parts of Tokyo. - Many restaurants in the vicinity, including a few within the Hilton itself. We not only had breakfast at Junisoh but also enjoyed two delightful Teppanyaki dinners there. The cons/""areas for improvement"":- We would have loved a higher floor for our junior suite. A room three levels higher on the 14th floor wasn't ready upon check-in, and interestingly, it ended up being our cousin's when she arrived a day later. The king suite was on the 18th floor and that was fine, although the hotel has close to 40 floors.- The bathrooms were a bit small, although I know we're talking about Tokyo here. All the same, I can't help thinking that the rooms at the Granvia Kyoto were a lot more spacious (bathrooms and wide-ranging toiletries too!) and they weren't even suites. - Whilst the cleaners were obliging the couple of times we bumped into them, we found the cleaning somewhat inconsistent in terms of thoroughness. The bin under the writing desk was sometimes not emptied. - While a crowded hotel lobby may have been evidence of a popular hotel, I found the area could have benefited from better crowd control. - We telephoned from our room for help with our luggage as we prepared to leave the hotel on 5 February, but the bell hop never came. We waited a while but ended up struggling a little with the luggage as we didn't want to miss our prepaid limo bus ride to Narita airport. (I say we struggled because I had my 77-year-old mother with me and we had four pieces of luggage.)With hindsight, literally for ""a change of scenery"", we could have, at least for a few nights, tried a more centrally located hotel that makes time-consuming shuttle bus rides unnecessary. We also could have stayed a couple of nights in Hakone or some place more scenic and tranquil, away from the mad rush. All in all, we enjoyed our stay. It certainly helped that the rooms were pleasant and comfortable, that there was Executive Lounge access, that there were obliging English-speaking staff and that there was enough in and around the hotel to keep the senior folks in our group sufficiently entertained. ありがとうございます！",,105,4.0

Always attentive to guests requests and all staff are very proficient in conversing in English. The Lounge in the evening can get quite busy and Diamond members are also provided the option of utilising the ""Presidential Suite"" as another quiet option for canapes.

It was a feast for eyes and there were extensive queues.The location is good with a 7-8 minute walk to the main shopping area of Shinjuku and the Shinjuku station. We arrived from Haneda Airport via the train and used the Narita Express from Shinjuku station to Narita Airport. It was relatively easy. Added to this we used the Hilton free shuttle bus to the station. This was a good service, but this service was very busy and it is best to queue 10 minutes before to ensure your spot and your luggages.

If you are looking for a centrally-located and internationally-branded property to stay in Tokyo, I cannot recommend the Hilton Tokyo enough. It is located to many attractions around the city and if you are going somewhere a little further, the underground pass right outside the doorstep of the hotel will take you to the train station. The hotel's location is perfect and while it is definitely not a cheap hotel to stay in, you will definitely appreciate how near everything is - there is also a big FamilyMart about 3 minutes away so it is fairly convenient. There is a Presidential lounge for Hilton HHonors Diamond members to enjoy a more private evening cocktail experience - the food and drink selection is pretty much the same as executive lounge though.

On the back end, Guest Relations Manager Ernesto Bressan was just as helpful and professional in getting us to an proper room. So you know, only certain King rooms are large enough to accomodate a rollaway. My assumption that a more expensive, higher level Executive King room would also accomodate a rollaway when a lower level King room was able to do so was the root cause of some issues, in conjunction with the fact that they ran out of rollaways irrespective. As a Hilton Honors Gold member I was treated to breakfast for the the family (2 adults and 2 teens) and no charge for the first rollaway. A helpful point, to get Elite benefits any longer you must book your reservation directly via Hilton or a higher end travel agent, you will not get them if you book through the online discounters (expedia, priceline,etc); ie, booking via the discounters, whose pricing was the same but only with a longer cancellation window, would have cost me in real dollars an extra $200 nightly between breakfast and the rollaway. Gym was nice, tried the Japanese bath once (fyi, at the bath a sign says that wearing a bath suit in the bath is not considered appropriate). executive club was nice, they are strict on the dress code however; we showed up in flip flops in the am just to have coffee and were asked to wear shoes and no gym type clothes (wear wearing shorts and a t-shirt). ironically, we ended up in 2 junior executive suite rooms during the 2 stays, the first room on the 25th floor was much more modern and updated than the same room type on the 35th floor; irrespective, both were identical in layout and very spacious. lastly, the hilton booking engine did not allow you to put more than 2 adults, 1 child in a king, I called the hotel via skype and the front office clerk told me that she would add the 4th person (but call and make sure that the room you are booking can accomodate this, as above).","San Diego, California",60,5.0

Even though its renovated, their rooms are not comparable with Hilton Osaka. Lets take an example of their Standard & Deluxe Room, the bath tub were Yellowish and smells. The first stay with Hilton Tokyo, I wasn't upgraded despite being a Diamond Member. The second stay which I came back after 2 days in Mount Fuji and Hakone, I was upgraded to Executive Room using 2 Diamond Members Card. The Executive Room are much more stylish and well maintained meaning cleanliness, view, high floor, service etc. The room is big enough & better than Expected Japan's Standard. Service is superb as after a long walk outside, my leg was bleeding because of the Nike Shoes when requested, they patiently asked about it and took plasters from the First Aid Box. Service at the Breakfast area and Executive Lounge was better than the Check-in Counter. The downside is being some parts of the hotels are rundown and the check-in counter is alwayd crowded.

It was a good size with adequate storage for one person, but two people sharing the space may find closet and bathroom space somewhat limited. The lounge chair in the room was particularly comfortable... Great for reading or catching up on email. All standard amenities were present and in good working order... For those who always want to look their best, the iron and ironing board were of particularly good quality (much better than what you generally find in western hotel rooms). The only downside to the room was the shower/tub combo in the bathroom... The bathroom is a bit small to begin with and having just the shower would likely have been a better use of the available space. That said, the shower itself was quite good, fully stocked with all necessary grooming products.One of the best things about the Tokyo Hilton is the Executive Lounge... Not only does it provide Executive room guests a full selection of breakfast offerings (both western and standard Japanese breakfast cuisine) and cocktails, it offers a beautiful view of Mount Fuji, especially in the morning.Getting around to and from the hotel is very easy: The hotel's location in Nishi Shinjuku is very good and their shuttle bus to/from the Shinjuku Station was consistently on-time.

We ended it with three nights in Tokyo. I spent a lot of time trying to decide where we would stay for those nights. I had reservations at three hotels - the other two were the Mandarin and the Park Hyatt. In the end, we ended up at the Hilton because I felt it allowed us to stay in a very nice hotel in a good location in Tokyo and still leave us money we would have spent on a room at the other two places for dining and sightseeing.Rooms are nice sized, esp for Tokyo. Nice bathroom with great water pressure. We were on 24 floor and had city view which was enhanced by overlooking a beautiful park whose leaves had turned so many beautiful colors. We had access to the executive lounge which is very large and on two sides of the building. On two of the mornings we were able to see Mt Fuji which was great. Loved the access to adult beverages in the evenings. Thought food in mornings for breakfast was significantly better that the appetizers offered in evening. There are three restaurants on the mezzanine level above the lobby. One is Chinese, another is Japanese, and the third is like an American steak house with Fire Grill. We chose that option as we had been given a 30% off coupon upon arrival. We were very tired and hungry and order the three different steaks with a couple of side dishes. We also had a couple of glasses of wine each. The meal was fabulous. It also was pretty expensive. After the coupon was applied the meal still exceeded $200 USD. Saying that, I think have to factor in that finer dining in Tokyo is expensive nearly anywhere you go.The hotel offers a shuttle every 20 minutes to the Shinjuku train station. We only did this once and I wish we had done it all least one more time. It's very convenient and that's such a crazy part of Tokyo to experience. Paid for the upgraded internet. Worked great and it's fast so I thought it's worth the cost.We flew back from Haneda and there is an expresss bus that picks you up at the hotel. It's a great purchase at $12 a ticket. On our next trip the only reason i might consider staying elsewhere would only be due to choosing to stay in more of a downtown setting near the Imperial Palace and Tokyo Station. Finally, I didn't notice until our final day that there are bikes in front of the hotel that are available to guests. There is a beautiful park adjacent to the hotel that would be a great place to ride. ","Parker, Colorado",3,4.0

After the quake, the elevators were shut down and we didn't want to walk down 32 flights of stairs, so we stayed put. The staff came on the loudspeaker to assure everyone that there had been an earthquake but that the hotel was safe. They made an announcement again after the hotel had been checked and the elevator service restored.During that time, my husband and son went to the Executive Lounge to see if there was anything to drink and were astonished to find a staff member emerging from the stairwell. He had climbed 32 floors to bring up a tray of bread to the Executive Lounge to make sure guests had access to food & drink. Amazing!A few hours later we went to the buffet breakfast and it was as if nothing had happened.

We arrived much too early for our check in time (about 6:30am), but the staff were very, very friendly, and allowed us to access the Executive Lounge (we'd booked a Executive Junior Suite King room). Upon accessing the Lounge, we were sat down, and asked if we'd like a view of Mt. Fuji, at which point the screens were opened and there he was in all his glory! What a fabulous start to the holiday!As I said, we stayed in a Executive Junior Suite King room (Room 2425) which was great. There was a nice big couch (which allowed both of us to lie on it and watch TV) and a view over Shinjuku. There's only one of these rooms on each floor (looking at the floor plan on the back of the door) and it's right next to the lift lobby - but honestly - we didn't hear a thing the whole time we were there.The bedding was fantastic, and the air conditioning very cool. The yukata's were comfortable, and the bathroom was good. Our only gripe would be that the bathroom was very very small, and the arrangement of the shower door meant that we actually had to step out into the room while we were wet to close the door behind us and then go back into the bathroom to towel off. Not a big deal.The Executive Lounge was lovely, and the staff very, very accommodating. We had the option of breakfast either in the Lounge or in the main Lobby Restaurant (which was interesting, because often at Hilton's it's ""one or the other""). I was initially concerned about there being a possible 'lesser' breakfast in the Lounge, but in all honesty, other than pancakes and French Toast, the offerings were pretty similar. The main restaurant was large and hectic, and of our six breakfasts, we ended up only having one down there.The location was good. We quickly got into the knack of catching the free shuttle to and from Shinjuku Station and the wait was never a bother. Only once did it look like the bus would be full, but we squeezed on anyway. The staff was great, from helping us post postcards (old school!), making and confirming dinner reservations and even organizing the shipping of our luggage on to Kyoto they couldn't have been more accommodating - and language was never a barrier (if you talked clearly, slowly and not hysterically like some people next to us one morning!)We were only there for 5 nights, and in reality I couldn't suggest if it's the best location or not to stay in in Tokyo - but I'd certainly recommend it for anyone who wanted to stay in Tokyo.","Adelaide, Australia",74,5.0

We ended up spending so much time at the breakfast buffet that we started couple of our days late. Room is very big for Tokyo standard. We also used their business center to print Disney tickets for free. We used the JR pass so we always go to JR Shinjuku station although the closest subway station is actually Nishi-shinjuku station or the Tochomae station (both non-JR stations). JR Shinjuku station is a very large and confusing station with a bunch of exits. If you exit the wrong one, it may take you a long route to get to the right place again. We took advantage of the free hotel shuttle (in front of the Keio department store) which comes every 20 mins between hotel and Shinjuku station. Definitely helps save some walking after a long day. Tokyo was our first stop and then we were heading to Hakone for one night then Kyoto. Hilton offered takkyubin (luggage delivery) service at the lobby so we simply shipped our two big luggages from Hilton straight to our Kyoto hotel so we didn't have to drag the luggages on Shinkansen.

There is a good gym and a small indoor pool (I didn't use the facility but again, the equipment seemed new). Breakfast was a little problematic for me. The space was very tight and because breakfast seemed to be included with the room, it felt like every single guest in the hotel was there at the same time. The breakfast selection wasn't bad but I did get the odd patron who shoved his/her way into my queue. It wasn't the most pleasant eating experience but the hotel isn't to blame. The location is a little off the main drag, which I like since Shinjuku is just too crowded for me. (If truth be told, I am probably too old for Shinjuku.

This is shameful and at least we should have been offered two drink coupons to use at the second floor bar. The ""upscale"" restaurants on the second floor of the hotel made up one vast venue, which felt far from relaxing or exclusive. The breakfast buffet in the Executive Lounge was ok, but nothing great, and the ground floor breakfast buffet (which I was entitled to use as a Gold Member) was large and noisy with many tables a great distance from the buffet but bordering on the hotel lobby. The room was clean as expected, and service throughout the hotel was courteous, but lacked the warmth and sincerity one finds at similarly priced hotels in Tokyo.

Reception was very helpful in ensuring that housekeeping cleaned the room as soon as the previous guests checked out so we could have a shower. We were able to wait in the Executive Lounge and the room was ready for us at 12.The room was spacious, modern and one of the cleanest hotel rooms I have stayed in. The bathroom has a separate shower / bath wet room and the bed was very comfortable. We stayed 3 nights and we would happily have stayed for longer.The hotel is conveniently located and is only around 700m from the Shinjuku railway station, shops and nightlife. There is a shuttle bus that takes you there and back however the walk only takes around 5 - 10 minutes depending on your walking speed. There is a metro station just around the corner from the hotel which connects to all railway lines. Wi-FI speed is one of the fastest I have encountered at any hotel and connectivity was never lost even when moving between floors.We used the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor each day for breakfast. We had the option of eating downstairs as well where there is a greater selection however the range of breakfast in the lounge was still extensive including eggs and omelettes.Service levels are exemplary and all facilities are regularly cleaned throughout the day.On departure we were able to arrange a late check out at 2pm and we were able to use the lounge until we left for the airport at 4pm.

But they have impressed me more in 16 hours than many hotels have done in 16 days, and I had to come here immediately to share that fact.We are in Japan for our honeymoon, but it honestly feels more like we're on a royal visit. From the moment we arrived, their hospitality has been absolutely outstanding. We were warmly welcomed in the lobby by a hostess who took our bags and showed us to the front desk. The receptionist was very kind and helpful, and wished us a ""Happy Honeymoon!"" before offering us a room upgrade on the 28th floor with a great view. She also offered us complimentary early check-in (at 9am!), which - after having just gotten off an 11-hour flight and being desperate to freshen up - we could not have been more grateful for.And this may sound like a silly thing to comment on, but the lobby smells wonderful!! The Guest Relations Manager here at the hotel overheard me telling my husband how amazing the lobby smelled, and went out of his way to tell us all about the Sencha Green Tea fragrance and that it's available to purchase. I won't be leaving Tokyo without it. We arrived in our room (which is HUGE - especially by Japanese standards), and our bags were brought up shortly after. We decided to order room service from the 24-hour breakfast menu to fuel up for the day ahead, and not only did it arrive promptly, but it was also set up beautifully on a rolling table, delivered by a server who genuinely wanted to make sure our every need was met, and tasted incredible. It may be the best French Toast (and bananas!) I've ever had.A short while later we received a knock on our door, and were surprised with a beautiful fruit plate and an assortment of small cakes to enjoy, along with a note once again wishing us a ""Happy Honeymoon!"". And enjoy them we did. I have never been so floored by the taste of grapes before, and I mean that in all honesty. They were the size of golf balls and tasted like they were made of pure joy and magic. And that's just the grapes. Did the welcome stop there? Heck no, it didn't! We had another knock on our door shortly afterward, and were presented with lovely flowers in a beautiful little vase, as ""a gift from everyone at Hilton"".Seriously, just stop your hotel search right now. This is the one. I could tell you all about how convenient and central the location is, or how close it is to the metro/trains, or how beautifully decorated it is, or how amazingly comfortable the room is, or its fantastic value for money, but the level of service and hospitality has exceeded our expectations to the extent that I really don't need to. It's really just that good.I've been an HHonors member for a while now, and have stayed at Hilton hotels across the globe, and I honestly believe that the Hilton Tokyo is far and away the best one in the world.

However, if you are planning on coming for business - don't. I have tried to split my review as a business and non-business visitor, so at least it is balanced. We chose the Hilton as we are members of Hilton Honors. As such, we expected the Tokyo Hilton to be business centric. It is not. In fact, I would go as far as to say, that if you come to Tokyo on business, do not stay here. It simply isn't suitable. Upon checking in at midnight, we were advised that the Business Centre would be open in the morning, and able to provide translation services for us. This wasn't the case. The ""Business Centre"" isn't actually a Business Centre at all. It is simply a large open-plan floor area with a few PCs and desks.This might suit some, but when business guests need assistance to resolve business queries you need staff, but the hotel doesn't employ any in the Business Centre. Not even one. Also, you would expect a Business Centre to at least have a phone, yet this one doesn't.Similarly, it doesn't have any meeting rooms either, so if you want privacy you can't get any. Rather bizarrely, privacy is a mute point at this hotel. It is simply not on the managements agenda when it comes to the Business Centre or indeed anywhere else in the hotel. There are simply no private areas business people can work from, as the hotel is so busy. I have posted a picture of us trying to work at the same time as the flight crew of a Lufthansa jet were being checked in around us. How bizarre - especially when you consider the check-in desk is some 100m away. As there were no dedicated Business Centre staff, we had to hire in a translator to help with the communications. Not ideal, but on its own not a deal breaker either. However, without a quiet room to work from or a phone to work with, we were forced to retreat to our bedroom to make the calls. Now this was a deal breaker and unacceptable having strangers in your room plus other work colleagues perching on the edge of the bed. In defence of the management, they did offer to help out using Guest Services and the Concierge - so they at least tried. However, the hotel is simply not equipped to run as an effective business hotel. On the non-business front, the hotel is great. It is approximately 30 minutes drive from Haneda Airport. Is centrally located and next door to a subway station. Taxis are easy to get and the concierge desk runs a very helpful service. A large number of restaurants and cafes are situated right next door, so you can sample a number of different styles of Japanese food at reasonably good prices. The breakfast buffet is okay, but nowhere near as good as an Intercontinental. Rooms are okay too.

The hotel is crowded, has a lot of guests, and as a result, value of HHonors seems to have reduced over time. Despite HHonors Gold status for 3 years, I was not given a room upgrade on check-in, and even after I was told I would be upgraded on my last day, I was upgraded to an executive suite only with basic amenities and the same size of the room. During the entire time, it was almost like they were doing me a favor. My father joined our family in Tokyo and I made him change his reservation to this hotel, given its reputation. He is also a Gold member. He was upgraded to a two single bed Executive Suite. I got a feeling this hotel does not truly want to upgrade Gold members. Possibly the only place I felt well-treated on occasion was in the Executive Lounge. It is peaceful and calm, with great views, good drink options (juice, non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages, tea and coffee). The snacks are a nice touch. Its a great place to get away from the otherwise crowded hotel. Public bath and pool are nice. Lap pool is indoors and relaxing. Their massages (both in center and in room) are a bit pricey but certainly are very good and professional. The breakfast is very good. However, the staff are unable to control people who are in there. For all three days we were in the breakfast area (Marble Lounge), there was an odd-looking man wearing a pink-colored jumpsuit, who would sip tea for hours staring at people. Once he even randomly screamed at the top of his voice without provocation. On the last day, he kept a teddy bear on his table. My infant daughter was attracted to his teddy bear and kept running towards him. When I discussed this with the staff, they were sympathetic, and told me ""to keep my daughter far away from him"". They could not do anything to stop his strange behavior, though they told me he had been coming there before, and appeared to not be happy with him. I feel sorry for the staff, but the hotel really needs to control the kind of people coming in, and certainly treat HHonors guests better. It really did not feel like a good use of my points, and I will likely stay in another hotel in Tokyo the next time around.","St Louis, United States",0,4.0

Here I was told that I could either take breakfast in the club lounge or enjoy the full HUGE breakfast buffet in the hotel's main restaurant. We went to the club lounge on the first night and while it is the biggest lounge I have ever been in, they told us that Diamond members get to go to a second smaller lounge as well. It was incredibly upscale with fantastic free drink and food options. For breakfast the next morning, we went to the buffet in the main restaurant. It was huge and the food was great.

The rooms are spacious by the Japanese standards, and the location is good--within walking distance (10+ minutes) of the central areas of Shinjuku but not in the middle of the craziness. Also, the hotel offers a range of restaurant options. The shuttle service to JR Shinjuku Station, Airport Limousine Bus, etc., too, are quite useful. Also, the recent renovations made their rooms more pleasant.With this said, I feel compelled to point out that they aren't what they used to be. I miss the smooth transactions I used to enjoy at the reception desk, for instance. Although there is a person or two directing guests, the U-shaped reception area can now create a chaotic impression--with a dramatic increase in the number of non-Japanese Asian guests who do tend to be quite loud and ignore the line(s)/staff directions.The breakfast is the same way. Although the selection is a little limited, if you have lounge access, it would be wise to utilize the Exec Lounge for breakfast because the 1st-floor restaurant can get absolutely chaotic--and I don't remember this happening until a few years ago. Perhaps it's time for them to implement some serious crowd-control strategies.The quality of the front desk staff, too, has become a little inconsistent in the recent years, in my view. For instance, the last time my same-sex spouse and I checked in, the Japanese male agent wanted to confirm a couple of times that we knew our junior suite only had one king-size bed. When he realized that we were a couple, his attitude changed completely. It's 2016, and it is Hilton. Maybe the manager needs to remind the employees that, at times, they may get same-sex couples whom they should treat with equal respect? This was shocking to me because, in my 20+ years of visiting Japan frequently, I've found the Japanese--male or female--to be very gay friendly. More importantly, my spouse and I have been staying at Hilton Tokyo since the 1990s, and this has never happened before.On another recent occasion, a European male employee took care of the check-out process. For some reason, he rushed us so badly that he didn't even tell us the total charges and merely handed over an envelope with the folio as he asked about our credit card (it wasn't even crowded). Although he had been friendly up to that point, he made his discontent somewhat clear when I asked him to go over the charges. I should have perhaps pointed out to him that this entire transaction could have been prevented, had he done his job and taken an extra 6.5 seconds to inform us of the total charges.Just 10 years ago, these things would have been unthinkable at Hilton Tokyo.There are so many nice hotels in Tokyo that offer more updated infrastructure, good meal options and great service these days (heck, in Japan, the cheapest of the hotels would give you pretty good service!) but, as an HHonors elite member, I prefer to stick with Hilton. Luckily, another Hilton, Hilton Tokyo Odaiba, has recently opened in (relatively) central Tokyo, and I find its infrastructure, service and meal options to be far superior--although it is in an area that COULD be slightly trickier to navigate. I really WANT TO like Hilton Tokyo and WANT TO stay with them because I prefer Shinjuku over Odaiba, but they have been slipping a little in the recent years.","New York City, New York",38,3.0

Check in was pretty quick, however there's no signages to tell you where to stand and wait for check in or out. So guests are just standing anywhere and everywhere. A little confusing. Room was decent and big for Japanese standard but a little worn out. One downside of the room that I really need to point out is the carpet, it looks and feels filthy dirty. I stepped on some sticky residue 3 times and god knows what it is, I had to place napkins on the spots so please do wear the bathroom slippers provided. I got them to clean the carpet twice !! Generally all the Japanese staff were friendly and helpful I really appreciate it. But this particular staff ""Mari*a"" at the concierge was not very sincere in helping when I asked for directions and informations, she doesn't even look you in the eye and I felt she just wants me to leave her alone. So I approach a Japanese staff later and she made it all very clear. I was staying at the Hilton Narita earlier in August, I must say Hilton Tokyo Hotel and the one at Narita are worlds apart!! I will never ever stay at Hilton Narita again , service was really at the rock bottom and that was my first Hilton experience they totally ruined it.

As a HHonors Diamond member was upgraded to a beautiful 1 bedroom suite; very comfortable for the 3 of us. The executive level lounge has great views of the city, ample amount of beverages, wine, champagne and booze to choose from. The food is a little light but it's enough to eat a bit before heading out in Tokyo for great food. The service that we received over the 4 nights was above and beyond. Again, as HHonors at check in they are aware of status but concierge and staff had no idea and they treat each guest with great respect. If you do stay at this property, please visit the concierge and ask for Marina. This lady is awesome!! As this was my 1st time in Tokyo, I had many questions and things to see/do on my list while in town. My 1st morning I approached her with my list and she took the time to break down what I should do day 1 and not only what I should do but in what order and gave me directions of how to reach each destination. After an extended discussion, Marina told me don't do more than we scheduled for the day and to come visit her tomorrow for her to map out my 2nd & 3rd day. Well, with her guidance and great knowledge of the city, within our 4 nights we were able to see everything within Tokyo that we were interested in and had enough time on our final day to get a day trip to Mt. Fuji/Hakone. Marina is a tremendous asset and it doesn't stop with her. Upon check in, we had the pleasure to have Sophie (from the UK) bring our bags up and she took time to sit with us and give us a break down of the property. After explaining all of our benefits she reviewed a city map with me and explained where we were in location to the city and also provided a locals view of the major attractions. The morning breakfast at the lobby level always had a wide range of choices and terrific service. There is a reason that I'm a loyal Hilton Member because of experiences like this.","Los Angeles, California",49,5.0

I was on a high floor and had a good view over the skyline of Tokyo. Comfortable bed and Japanese style deep bath.The Executive lounge is great and served really good canapes before dinner, and other guests were well behaved, a change from some I've been in where people attack the buffet as if they haven't eaten for a month.

Upon arrival to the hotel we saw the driver talking to the concierge. A couple of minutes later one of the staff approached me with flyers about an upcoming festival and good spots I ought go to, to check the fireworks. This foreshadowed our stay at Hilton Tokyo. Everyone, without exception, went out of their way to help and serve. We had booked two rooms, a twin deluxe and a junior suite. The junior suite room was very spacious. The rooms were spotless and modernly furnished, and the bathroom was very clean. Both rooms and bathrooms were equipped with the usual essentials. I especially liked the fact that we each had a clean pajama that we could, not to mention Japanese Yukatas were available as well. We had fun taking photos posing in them. The breakfast buffet boasted a variety of western and Japanese style dishes. The Japanese vegetable curry was delicious. The hotel is well located atop Nishi-Shinjuku metro station. There are a couple of convenience stores behind the hotel. As for restaurants, there is a good number of establishments right next to the hotel. We never ran out of bottled water, after a long day of sightseeing we always came back home to find a couple of them supplied. I really can’t fault the hotel, as everything was up to par with Hilton standard. If I ever get the chance to travel to Tokyo again, I’d choose to stay here again. Oh, one more thing, the day we were supposed to leave for Osaka I asked the concierge if there are any lockers at the station that we could stash in one of our extra luggage (which happened to contain items from our shopping spree in Shibuya) the concierge asked me where would I be staying next and I said Hilton Osaka, and Hilton Odaiba after that, she then told me that instead they could send our luggage to our last hotel stay which is in Odaiba and we wouldn’t have to worry about it. I opted for that and they sent our luggage to Odaiba for around 1400 yen (if my memory serves me right).","Dubai, United Arab Emirates",36,5.0

It is hard to fault the hotel as it provides a typical Hilton experience which is always enhanced in Asia with the amazing helpful and gracious service. Rooms are very spacious by Japanese standards, extremely comfortable and subtly decorated. The concierge service is really, really good with lovely engaging and helpful staff. Breakfasts are always a treat with great choices for Western and Asian travelers. The foyer and lobby restaurant are always buzzing and are a local 'place to be' with weddings on weekends and high teas etc served in the afternoons. The pool, gym and spa are of high standard with a lovely Japanese bath which was quiet and relaxing. To be honest though, we would only stay here again if in Tokyo for holidays for the Hilton Honours extras or if there for business. Even though it is in Shinjuku, it is away from the sights and night life in the area although Shinjuku station is near. The location itself felt more business than fun and the hotel gets a little crazy with people there for weddings, restaurants etc which can be a little confronting as a staying guest. As I said up front, nothing at all wrong with it and many things right, but for the location and a more colorful experience I would probably look at different options in the price range next time. A call out to the concierge desk again however as they managed to get us into some pretty awesome restaurants at short notice. A note to first time travelers to Japan - the hotel to hotel luggage forwarding service between cities is extremely reasonable from a cost perspective and really efficient. It makes traveling hassle free. See separate review of the Hilton's Grill restaurant. ","Sydney, Australia",37,4.0

For the reason we didn't understand, Airport limousine shuttle could not stop in front of Hilton. So we needed to get a taxi from another hotel to get to Hilton. We unloaded 6 baggages on the sidewalk in front of Hilton around 11:30pm by ourselves. We were the only guests there. There were 2 hotel staffs at the porter booth, chatting and not looking up to give us eye contact for a few minutes. I finally walked up to ask them to help us with our luggages while we checked-in. One of them did. We were appalled by the rude and unhelpful attitude of the porter staff.We are gold member and usually get upgrade and access to executive lounge. Since we had 3 people and required a rollaway bed. We were told there was not a big enough room for us on the executive level. Since our room will not be on executive level, we cannot access to executive lounge. This is the perk that we remain gold member for. It seems useless here at least for the first night.

The lobby was busy but this didn't bother us, it wasn't overly so. We were checked in straight away and the staff spoke excellent English- I tried Japanese but honestly I'm pretty rubbish. It appeared there were many dual linguists among the staff members who we saw dealing with people from all over the world.We stayed in a suite so we took the elevator up. The common spaces are fantastically looked after and clean. As was our room. It was spacious and had a sitting area, bathroom and shower and bath tub as well as tea and coffee making facilities and storage. The beds were extremely comfy and the amenities provided were second to none- even the shampoo, conditioner and shower gel were good brands that we were familiar with.Being suite customers we had use of the top floor business lounge which was fabulous and an absolute treat. This also hosted breakfast and evening snacks including beverages- people were even drinking champagne at breakfast! It was great to be able to go up and grab a coffee or a cold drink during the summer heat. The staff were professional and friendly and the evening snacks were good, one night we had satay skewers which were good! We also had the buffet breakfast which was phenomenal, one of the absolute best we've had. Massive thank you and commendations to the Maitre'D who looked after us, whose name I unfortunately did not get but he was excellent with everyone (I think he's half Brazilian half Asian!). A real treat to speak to in the morning. As well as the egg chef who always had a great smile on his face. The selection is good- western items, hot items, cold items, an entire Japanese breakfast room, pastries etc. You could eat whatever you liked. There was also coffee, speciality coffee, juices/water, a selection of teas and a Nespresso machine for a great morning espresso. The hotel itself is a five minute walk down to Shinjuku, to the station and shops, from this hotel in the skyscraper district. It is a safe (well this is Japan, it feels pretty safe everywhere!) walk over to Shinjuku but if you wanted to go elsewhere there was direct access underground through the mall into the underground system. As a young female traveller I even made this walk alone a couple of times. It was great to be in the midst of everything, but to not have to deal with smaller rooms and louder neighbours of extremely centralised Shinjuku hotels. I was totally impressed by this hotel and the service was fabulous.

Each side of the bed has a small table, a table lamp, a reading lamp and an under-table night light. There is a chest that doubles as a luggage stand for a single suitcase with two very large drawers below. The top drawer had two robes that are replaced on a daily basis if used. I was most impressed by the window coverings. The room had a great view and large window. There was a sliding covering that was designed to look like traditional Japanese paper walls. It would let in some light. In addition there was a solid panel that could be slide over the first one giving the room almost a total blackout. I have never seen this before but, having now seen it, can’t imagine why all hotels in the world don’t have it, especially ones near the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. The bed was comfortable and came with four pillows – two soft and two firm. When I booked I’d ordered two other pillows that were not present when I arrived at my room. I told the front desk about it the next day and they were promptly delivered. The TV was fine, though not a lot of English programing and the only English news channel is BBC. The mini bar was well stocked with beverages and a few snacks. There were two complimentary bottles of water and plenty of free tea and instant coffee. There was an electric kettle and a small tea service complete with a tea pot and Japanese tea cups. The bathroom was very nice with plenty of vanity space around the sink. It had large, thick, bath towels, hand towels and wash cloths. There was a decent sized bar of hand soap at the sink and a bottle of shower gel for the bath. There were also containers of shampoo, conditioner and body lotion in addition to a shower cap. The tub was large and deep with a grab bar to aid in a safe entrance and exit. The shower felt very forceful. There wasn’t an exhaust fan but the mirror was heated, so didn’t fog up. The vanity was very well lit and there was a large magnifying make-up mirror mounted to the wall on the right of the sink. The toilet was outfitted with a Japanese washing toilet seat.

Plenty of parks, restaurants and shops nearby making it suitable for a broad range of travelers. As you would expect inTokyo, the rooms are small. Traveling with a 5yo, we were all able to sleep in the same king bed but after a week we were craving more space. However, we were out exploring most days so it suited our needs. Hotel staff generally speak English to a high standard which helped with our queries and service needs. The lobby restaurant serves an excellent breakfast albeit very expensive. The dinner buffet wasn't quite up to the same standard and more variety would have been appreciated. The desserts, however, are a highlight with some incredible and creative treats. One evening we had a table that was more of a lounge set up and right next to the open lobby which made dining slightly uncomfortable physically and mentally. Ask for a table towards the back of the room. Fittings, furnishings and facilities were to the normally high standard you would expect from Hilton. My only gripe would be that as a older building the rooms are not fitted with usb chargers which means overseas travelers will need to rely on power adapters. ",,3,5.0

The hotel was chosen mainly due to its central location and the room size that appeared to be sufficient for the four of us. The room had a king size bed and we asked for a roll away bed which was twin-size at no extra cost. The room also had a modular sofa and was large enough to lay open our four suitcases. One slight issue was with the size of the bathroom. There was not much counter space, and I never understood when hotels choose to use a piece of glass that covers less than half the shower instead of a shower curtain or other means to block water. The obvious result was the wet bathroom floor. Other than that, it meets all our travel needs. There was a convenient store in the basement that opened 24 hours; it was (strangely) a hit for our kids and the items appeared to be regularly priced.The hotel is close to Nishi Shinjuku and Tochomae subway stations (short walking distances). Shinjuku (different from Nishi Shinjuku) is the main station there and the hotel has free shuttle services every 20 minutes (schedule available in the lobby). We walked back from the station once; there was an underground tunnel which became quite confusing for us so it turned out to be a challenge especially after a long day of walking already. I therefore recommend the shuttle service which we utilized several times; it was NEVER late which was impressive. In case one wishes to use the shuttle from the Shinjuku station to the hotel for the first time: It stops at Stop 21 (there is a sign) which is between the west and the south exits of the Shinjuku station, in front of the Keio department store. The bus has room for luggage.We arrived in Japan via Haneda Airport and didn't have any problems getting Airport Limousine tickets at the airport after getting off the airplane, and Hilton is one of the stops for the Shinjuku line. We left from Narita; the Airport Limousine tickets could be purchased at Hilton but the one we wanted to book was sold out the night before. We ended up taking the JR Narita Express train which cost almost the same. The train leaves from the building across from the south exit of the Shinjuku station. It is a shorter ride than the bus but do take into consideration the extra time needed to get from the hotel to the station.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",11,4.0

We were so full from breakfast, we typically skipped lunch. Quality and variety was very good.Tip: the 2nd floor location seemed to have the same variety as the 1st floor, but without the crowds. The 2nd floor was for Honors members only.Location: Great base location for exploring Tokyo, as there are two subway stations connected to the hotel via and underground walkway (Nishi-Shinjuku and Tochomae). We started all our travel from these stations, and not the main Shinjuku station, which is huge.TIP: when arriving in Tokyo at Tokyo station, the hotel recommended taking the subway to Shinjuku station, and then catching their hotel shuttle to the hotel. I would recommend another option. We took the subway to Nishi-Shinjuku station and walked about 5 minutes to the hotel via the underground walkway. Unless you are familiar with Shinjuku station, it will take you twice as long just to find the location of the hotel shuttle. Also, the hotel shuttle runs every 20 minutes, so you could be waiting a while.The hotel seemed pretty crowded, but the level of service did not suffer. The main desk and concierge desk were very efficient and helpful. The only minor complaint was that in the mornings, the elevators were crowded bringing people down, and sometimes we had to wait for the next one. This is not uncommon in large multistory hotels.

The AC worked very well, considering the 95 degree F temperatures during our stay.Overall a great hotel that contributed to an excellent family vacation in Tokyo.

And when we could find a hotel room that would take 4, they were usually very pricey as the room rate is charged on a per person basis. The Hilton Shinjuku was no exception, it was quite pricey, but we chose it because it had a hotel shuttle that would drop and pick you by Shinjukuku Station. We had booked a junior suite. When we arrived to checkin, they offered us an upgrade to a club room which was a bigger suite that included a seperate bedroom and living room, and access to the club lounge for breakfast and canapes. It was going to cost extra, but decided to go for it. The room was amazing, and so big. Bed was so comfortable. Kids had roll aways to sleep on, and they said they were very comfortable. We had a view of Mt Fuji, and fantastic views across Tokyo. We really enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the lobby, and enjoyed the canapes at night in the club lounge. The shuttle to Shinjuku was very reliable. The only let down was when we tried to book a transfer (airport service) to Haneda airport for our flight to Sapporo the guy at the transfer desk told us it was alredy booked out. Friends of ours that were also staying at the hotel were told to book when they checked in, it would have been good if we were also told, so that we could all get to the airport together. In the end we took a cab, which turned out fine, as it was a Saturday morning and the traffic was not too bad. The cab to Haneda was about 8000 yen. Would really recommend this hotel, although it is not a cheap stay, it is nice to have a bit of luxury to come back to after hitting the streets of Tokyo.

The 'Limousine Bus' service from Narita airport was so convenient and inexpensive and it dropped us right outside the hotel. The trip takes about 1.5hours. We had the option of the Narita Express train but the thought of navigating our way through Shinjuku with all our luggage meant the bus was a far better option. I'm sure this must be one of Hilton's signature hotels. It has a commanding presence on the street with a grand lobby entrance. It is located a short walk from central Shinjuku - probably about 20 minutes. We stayed in an Executive Deluxe King, which included access to the Executive lounge on level 37. The room was a decent size by Tokyo standards with a bathroom with separate bath and shower, however, the design could have been better as most of the water from the shower ends up missing you and falls in the bath. Of course, we all love Japanese toilets - so high tech. A higher floor would have been a bonus given the fantastic views over Tokyo the higher up you are. We could see Mount Fuji in the distance from the Executive lounge on level 37. Concierge were out best friends here - the staff were superb. They had recommended an excellent, affordable sushi restaurant even before we arrived. They also recommended a 24-hour metro pass that we could buy directly from the hotel for 8000 Yen (normally 10000 Yen). The subway system was easy to navigate. All their advice made our short stay so efficient and hassle-free. I thought breakfast in the lounge was fairly standard. The hot breakfast options were limited and didn't look that appealing.

The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the blackout sliders worked super well and we didn't hear a single noise during our stay (a wonderful bonus if you're jet lagged). Also appreciated the free bottled water in the room that was replaced daily as it was warm during our stay.Breakfast was very nice with three full sections: Japanese (including a custom omelet station), European and American. The American section was a little atypical for breakfast (ex: steamed broccoli, baked beans) but everything else was really nice.

Japanese hotels tend to set the air con at 24 Celsius or so and therefore it was refreshing to have a hotel that does not reset to the higher temperature and that also can blast truly cold air con. The window had a sliding shoji screen type covering as well as full sliding wall type covering to block out both the light and heat of the sun. While there was lots of room in the hotel room and a nice chair in the corner, what was missing was a little side table or something on which one could rest a drink or some snacks while sitting back to watch TV. Lots of channels on the TV including several English language news, movie and entertainment channels. Service is polite and friendly as is typical with the Japanese. I did have some problems with an in-room safe that was not working that took several reports to housekeeping and reception to finally get fixed. They fixed it twice but each time, it only worked once before being locked and unable to be opened again. I think language was a problem with some staff except the concierge and front desk staff as the person sent to fix my in room safe indicated in broken language after fixing the safe that it was not reliable to use and then carried in a smaller portable safe that weighed maybe 15 lbs or so which he suggested I use instead. I then went to reception and explained to a very helpful Mr. Hiroyuki Ohashi, the front desk shift leader for the evening, the humour of leaving me a portable safe and, notwithstanding I said it was no longer important as I had only one more night to stay at the hotel, Mr. Ohashi very efficiently arranged for the safe to be fixed properly on the third try and in addition advised the Executive Housekeeper Takao Kuroda who left me a very nice letter apologizing for the problems with the safe and also complimentary wine and chocolates.I had the buffet breakfast in the lobby restaurant each day as it was included in my rate. There was a very large selection of food, an omelet station, the usual bacon, eggs, sausages, some Japanese breakfast foods including one grilled fish item per day, and one Chinese item per day (shrimp dumpling, then pork siu mai and then sweet buns for the 3 days I was there). The breakfast restaurant can be very busy on the weekend with a bit of waiting to be seated even at around 8 am in the morning. A bit disappointed though the coffee tends to be American Starbucks strong and bitter but without much taste, as generally Tokyo restaurants and hotels serve really good tasting coffee as the Japanese are pickier and willing to pay more for coffee beans than other nations. Clientele is very international at the Hilton Tokyo with lots of business people but also lots of families and international vacationers. The hotels seems very busy at all times and seems quite full. Overall a good hotel with great facilities but a bit far in terms of walking distance to Shinjuku station if you are more of a leisure traveller rather than business traveller. I noticed in walking to Shinjuku station that I passed the well known Keio Plaza Hotel on the way and that it is several blocks closer to the station.",Vancouver,137,4.0

We were given early access to our room which was very nice (check-in time is 3pm) Both suites provide guests with complimentary access to the Executive Lounge which provided good breakfast, afternoon and evening drinks. We mainly used it for breakfast. The room was well appointed with a spa bath tub and Peter Thomas Roth amenities (similar to other Hilton's around the world), water bottles, tea, Nespresso coffee machine and a well stocked mini bar but did not use as the Executive Lounge is just downstairs. In-room dining was quick and nice (standard international pricing for in-room dining including service fee so not cheap but very convenient especially when the kids are exhausted from a long trip to Hakone). Buffet dinner was in the form of a lounge setting and atmosphere so very comfortable. The variety of food is not as extensive as you would expect from an international hotel but it was enough for us. It did however have an impressive Alice in Wonderland dessert spread. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeeper, were excellent. The female staff in the executive lounge were friendly and welcoming. The hotel also offer a well equipped gym (we did not use the gym but can view it from the swimming pool - which is a reasonable size pool but not large). Whilst the hotel is walkable to Shinjuku station, there is a complimentary bus every 20 mins to and from the hotel so makes the visit to Shinjuku station very convenient. Unlike the Four Seasons in Marounouchi, Hilton Tokyo does not have a stroller to borrow (something that they can consider). Overall a very pleasant stay at the Hilton Tokyo and we will certainly return if visiting Shinjuku. ","Sydney, Australia",29,5.0

We caught the bullet train to Shinagawa and transferred to the Yamanote line to Shinjuku. We then walked the 10 minutes to the hotel. it was an easy walk, even with luggage and most of it is undercover so it is manageable also in wet weather. The hotel is very busy and relatively impersonal but there are a number of very good restaurants (which we enjoyed), There is an arcade of shops underneath the hotel, if you are so inclined. We had a junior suite, chosen because our 21 year old daughter was traveling with us. An extra bed was added to the room. Even with three adults we had LOTS of room, including a desk, lounge and chairs. We were very comfortable and had ample room for all our luggage - we were not falling over the top of each other trying to move around. The wi fi is very good, although the room is short of powerpoints for charging multiple smart phones, laptops etc. Complimentary water is provided each day also. The breakfast spread is very good. The airport limousine bus service stops at the hotel so departure to Haneda or Narita is convenient, if you do not wish to juggle luggage on the airport train (so lots of options for getting to and from this hotel). The hotel is very conveniently located - its strong point. The only reason I gave this hotel four rather than five 'circles' for its rating is that the room, whilst spacious, clean and functional, is looking a bit tired and old fashioned, as were the corridors. At times, you may have to wait a while for the lifts, Having said this, these are not 'deal breakers' and I would happily stay here again, It is a great spot for getting around Tokyo.","Sydney, Australia",49,4.0

This hotel is bustling with people from all over the world and even the Japanese rugby team staying there at the same time. Rooms We were upgraded to an executive Junior suite and an executive king room. Both rooms were very lovely with nicely appointed bathrooms and toiletries and little extras in case anyone forgot toothbrushes etc. we are on one of the higher floors and had beautiful view of Tokyo's skyline. Hotel It was more polished and refined than I would've imagined and everyone was smartly dressed throughout. This seems to be true in the general area that the Hilton is located in and we did not see many people who were casually dressed. Concierge They were very helpful in getting us on special tours and information on how to get around the city for our family. Dining We especially enjoyed the executive lounge with The fresh pressed orange shoes you can make yourself in the mornings as well as oatmeal and traditional Japanese breakfast and American breakfast items. Downstairs in the lobby however there's also a much larger breakfast which we had for free which was immense in variety and we took full advantage of that before making our way in Tokyo each morning. They had omelettes and eggs to order as well as traditional Japanese breakfast items of all kind and English and American breakfast items as well. Tea timeAt the time we stayed there they were offering and Alice in Wonderland type of teatime with a beautiful little cakes that said eat me and little yogurt cups that were beautifully decorated that said drink me on them, etc. seemed to be a huge hit so make reservations if you'd like to partake. Mall/shopping Directly downstairs and still within the hotel you can take the escalators down to a labyrinth of shops available – mostly high-end but even a convenience store and souvenir shops located just downstairs as well for any snacks or items that you'd forgotten from home. There's a few restaurants down there as well for a quick bite to eat and a coffee shop. Metro-also located just downstairs with and at the Hilton complex is a metro station – but be aware that there are different companies of metros and trains and they're all not the same so your ticket may not work for every stop. It's best to check with the concierge on where you're going if you're unsure. My family very much enjoyed this location that was in downtown Tokyo near everything!","Portland, Oregon",78,4.0

This is not the hotel's fault. The lounge breakfast was sparce, but we were allowed to use the main restaurant on the first floor or the somewhat quieter and more personalized restaurant on the second floor. The breakfast buffet had a huge range of hot and cold western and Japanese dishes, juices, and a made-to-order egg and omelette station. The second floor had less variety but everything you could want.The bed was comfortable. Japanese screens blocked the 04h20 sunrise very effectively. Cable TV and wifi worked very wellConcierge and lobby staff were helpful, well-informed and gave good directions and free time suggestions.

One of our group did not know that he had a strong allergy to buck wheat found in soba noodles. Two bites of soba and additional bites of udon noodles had him swelling up in hives all over his body and constriction of his airway, although not immediately life threatening but was headed in that direction. What does one do in a foreign country where one does not speak Japanese? Call the concierge desk and seek help. Mr. Sakamoto who spoke English acted as our interpreter ensuring the sense of medical urgency, medical questions and clarity of the situation was understood by the hospital emergency room staff who did not speak English very well. He was patient, understanding, compassionate yet firm when the patient's health was discussed. He directed us to the nearest emergency room and accompanied us. He stayed with my daughter's boyfriend well beyond his working shift to ensure that he was being properly treated and was on the road to recovery. Before he left he made sure we knew the status of his condition and what was being done for him. The next day he offered to help us get his medical records from the hospital that would help our him get partial reimbursement from his medical plan when he returned home. Such service and the depth of the concierge staff coverage that would allow the Chief Concierge to stay with us while his staff took care of anything else that came up at the hotel shows you how Hilton trains and develops their staff to be able to address situations such as this without skipping a beat. The personal service provided by Mr. Sakamoto was above and beyond the call of his duty at the Hilton or reflects the value the Hilton has for their guests.Overall the service from the Hilton was extraordinary, they anticipated our needs before we could express them and that was from everyone from the front desk, bell desk, concierge, executive lounge, housekeeping. Some of them remembered our names after our first encounter.One of the best things we like was the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor. The spacious arrangements and quaint tables with a breakfast spread that included both Japanese dishes as well as American. Dinner was the same and delicious. All was included in the Executive benefits.The bathroom was Japanese designed with a deep bathtub and an area where you could shower separately before sinking into the hot waters of the bathtub. Aaahhhhh!!!!! One thing I would recommend is to include a small stool so that you could take a shower sitting down, prevents the chance of slipping on the soap suds on the floor. Inclusion of the small stool would make the bathroom more of an Onsen - traditional setup.We appreciated the two complimentary bottles of water Hilton provided each day we were there. They came in handy when you are out discovering Tokyo.",,2,5.0

A regular free shuttle bus service operates between the hotel and Shinjuku station (the bus stop is outside the Keio department store), which is very convenient and was well utilised during our stay. A family mart, 7/11 and McDonalds are located nearby and there are several places to eat within walking distance from the hotel. The hotel room itself was clean, comfortable and a decent size by Japan standards. Noise was not an issue during our stay nor was light shining through the windows first thing in the morning, which allowed for us to get a decent sleep. Free wifi is provided if you are a member of the Hilton's HHonors loyalty scheme, otherwise you need to pay. However, you can sign up for this free of charge on arrival and get instant wifi connectivity, which was really good and worked well.The hotel offers an airport shuttle bus service at an additional cost, which although a convenient means of getting to the airport, the first 40 minutes of the journey is spent collecting additional passengers around central Tokyo. Even though the hotel requests reservations for this service to be made 3 days in advance, they were kind enough to let us make a reservation only 1 day before our departure date.We did not use any of the other facilities at this hotel so cannot comment. The staff were really helpful and friendly, particularly one of the girls at the concierge (Sophie) who went above and beyond her normal duties to help us with our coach trip to Kawaguchiko.

You have the option of enjoying food from outside of Japan or enjoying a traditional Japanese breakfast. The fact that they can appeal to just about everyone (even us folk who don't appreciate breakfast as much as we should) gains my respect. I like being able to enjoy fresh smoothies with my meals and even detox water. They offer about 4 different kinds of milk; banana milk included (recommend trying it!) They have an egg station where you can get yourself anything from an omlette to a simple hard boiled egg. The cold cuts and cheese was a great spot for those who want to either kick up an appetite or keep it light. It's great that they have it set up next to the fruit with humidifiers so they food doesn't dry out and get gross. I thought that being in Japan it would be hard to fjnd some good food that reminded me of home but when I tried their french toast and hash browns I have to say that they far exceed what I've had back in Canada. Everything just seems to be on point. Despite being from another hotel, the staff were very kind to us and made us feel welcome. I overheard a young boy asking whom I believe was the manager if they had hot chocolate and he promptly set off to find some for him. That is someone dedicated to customer service and it's the little things when you see how happy the patrons are. I wish I could take this home with me so I can continue to eat the amazing food offered at the Hilton. Even if you're not staying at the Hilton, I highly suggest making the trip over there one morning if you're nearby.Bravo! ",,18,5.0

We had a problem with noise though. It seems either the walls are paper thin or the ceilings are because for our five night stay - during two nights we heard non-stop stomping above us. Finally after the second night the hotel manager moved us to the top floor which eliminated the stomping above us. The hotel goes the extra mile as it acknowledged our anniversary with wine, chocolates and cookies and when we had to move rooms they gave us more chocolates. We ate dinner at the Metropolitan Grill and the price for two was close to $400 Canadian so not cheap! The food was good of course.

Considering they called it a suite, it could use a Nespresso Machine. Also, the shower was not built well that every time we would shower, the outside area would flood, and the water would go into the toilet stall.We would order room service quite a bit for the kids, and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it. Desserts were excellent, and room service was quick and efficient, and the food pretty good.Buffet breakfast could use a bit of sprucing up, as the three mornings we had breakfast there, all hot foot remained the same.

I was plagued with a stomach virus that wiped me out on the only weekend I had to explore Tokyo. Perhaps I was the unlucky candidate but I don't blame the staff at all. It was just very unfortunate. Another issue that actually bothered me was this: I found this hotel through Trip Advisor and booked it through them. If you wanted to earn Hilton points, never book through a 3rd party website because you won't be able to earn any of the hotel points. Had I known, I would have booked directly on Hilton's website. This was frustrating, but I guess you learn by experience.","Los Angeles, California",27,4.0

I am Hilton Honors Gold for many years and i visit this hotel often, in spite of that they are always playing little games at check-in, try to slot me into a smoking room or a room with two double beds as opposed to the King size non smoking room I always book.More than once they even said we will upgrade you to exec room with lounge privileges but then when i get to the room it is two double beds as opposed to a king bed. I go all the way back downstairs, wait in the ling again and then tell them I booked a king. Their response ""well we upgraded you"" I said, I would prefer the standard king with no lounge over sleeping in a tiny bed. They said, they couldn't change me back to my original king size preference even without the lounge access since they already gave my king size room to someone else. They tried this bait and switch again on me during my last trip there as well but when the front desk lady gave me the key card and informed me of the upgrade I told her I only want it if the room is a king size non-smoking...then she said no it's two small beds. Then I had to wait while she ""downgraded me"" and talked to management about finding a king size bed. After a long flight and being tired they should not put you through all of those hassles.

We were told there was a separate dining room for Diamonds during breakfast at the restaurant, but we wanted to eat early and the Lounge served breakfast at 6 compared to 7 (I think it was 7) for the restaurant.The location was good. If the timing works for the shuttle, then that was very convenient to get a ride from the hotel to Shinjuku Station. Otherwise, it was a 10-15 minute walk, which was fine as long as the weather was good. We also liked the fact that the shuttle bus stop for the Hilton at Shinjuku station was next to the ticket office for the Airport Limousine Bus. We had arrived from Hakone by train, so we were able to purchase our one way bus ticket / one day subway pass combo ticket before catching the shuttle to the Hilton.We were allowed to check in early around 1pm.The hotel had a very nice spread set up for my partner's birthday (Voss waters, fruits, chocolates, Japanese sweets, card from the GM)! Thank you so much!Things that could improve. The guy that checked us in was good, but he never once mentioned that we had been upgraded to a Jr Suite. IMO, he should have mentioned it and let us know why (either because of our Diamond status or because we were celebrating my partner's birthday). Just seemed like a missed opportunity to not mention our upgrade to us.We communicated with the concierge team and asked many questions. Unlike the Westin Kyoto and the Conrad Tokyo, who were super nice and helpful, we felt like the Hilton's concierge team's responses at times were short and they gave us the impression we were bothering them, so we ended up just asking Mieko at the Conrad for help.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay, and would choose the Hilton over the Park Hyatt if staying in Shinjuku!","Dallas, Texas",101,4.0

Breakfast buffet includes both Asian and western items of excellent quality. Egg dishes are made to order. Juices seem fresh squeezed. We really enjoyed it.

When I wanted tickets to football or restaurant bookings, they told me how to do it but didn't do any of it themselves which meant a lot of running around on my part.

It was good value for money as we enjoyed the afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks and snacks. This is a nice luxury to have especially if you are spending more time at the hotel. However if you are sightseeing then maybe reconsider staying in the executive suite. The room was great and the view from the 30th floor fantastic. I found the bathroom a bit small with the bathtub and the shower all together. There are two breakfast areas -on the ground floor and on the 1st floor. We preferred the 1st floor as it seemed quiet. The Japanese breakfast was very good-especially the prawn dim sum. The waiters spoke English. I must admit though after being in Japan for over 3 weeks and travelling through the country, I missed the traditional Japanese greeting of Ohayo gozaimass in the morning ! The waiters in Japan almost sing the traditional greeting and when you leave the breakfast area I missed the traditional goodbye, the bows and the smiley faces. I stayed at another hotel in Tokyo and loved the friendliness, respect and proper Japanese hospitality that I was accorded with. The staff at the Hilton are friendly and hospitable but they need to be more ""Japanese"" because in my opinion the Japanese take hospitality and respect to another level. They take it to a level that I have never seen anywhere else in the world and it is that traditional respect that they should nurture and encourage and not try to change to suit a Western perspective. This could be a Hilton hotel anywhere in the world-I wish it had more of an authentic Japanese feel. There are many travelers who may actually see this as a positive. I also enjoyed a massage by Sukakada at the spa and this was the best massage that I had in Japan. The spa was also good and I wished I discovered that earlier so that I could use it more frequently. The hotel has a shuttle to the Shinjuku bus terminal. There are 3 huge department stores ; Lumine 1,2 and 3, Odaiko and Keio. The train station and subway are easily accessible. We found the shuttle very convenient.If you need to book high tea or dinner at the hotel its best to make reservations as we noticed that the hotel is extremely busy. My opinion is that the Hilton is fabulous and intercontinental but not true authentic Japanese accommodation. If that is what you want, stay in a Ryokan with tatami mats and a fabulous onsen. All in all, it was an excellent stay in Tokyo at the Hilton.","Johannesburg, South Africa",49,5.0

Additionally, I have been referring friends, colleagues and associates for this duration too. Sadly, I will no longer stay nor recommend that any of my family, friends, colleagues nor associates stay at this disappointing property. The gentleman that introduced me to this property back in 1996, passed away tis past February. My friend, Mr Gotoh, was not impressed with the hotel or the location but the service as well. I was able to see this first hand and began introducing it to my close circle of business friends and colleagues too.Over the years, the Shinjuku Hilton provided comfort and ease of access while traveling for business in Japan. Sadly, this ended this past February...As I stated, my friend, Mr Gotoh introduced me to this property. He passed suddenly and without warning in February. I only found out days after he past and without hesitation booked a ticket to Japan to attend his funeral. He was a brother to me and treated me and my family like his family. Not only was Mr Gotoh a loyal friend and colleague but he was also loyal to businesses and services that were good to him.I made a reservation to stay at the Shinjuku Hilton after the conclusion of Mr Gotoh's funeral to relive and enjoy memories that I shared in the past. Unfortunately, the reservation system stated that I made the reservation for the night prior to my desired stay of Feb 10th. Upon my arrival, the reception clerk tried to explain the issue to the reservations manager several times but was ultimately told to charge me for a night that I did not stay nor reserve. Additionally, I was told that I would have to pay full price for the evening that I was checking in.After an exhaustive back and forth, after already mourning the death of my brother like friend, I was told I would not get a refund and that I would have to pay for the current nights stay! I was in utter disbelief. What does the word HOSPITALITY mean to you anyway Mrs reservations manager? Does a full house and Numbers mean more to you that a pleasant experience for someone that has been staying at your property for more than 20+ years?Needless to stay, I will never again stay at the Shinjuku Hilton nor will I will refer my vast network of business colleagues or associates to stay there either.

I had previously stayed at the Hyatt just across the road and was thoroughly impressed. However, as it was fully booked I went for the Hilton this time.The service at the front desk and bellhops was just OK, but not as warm as I had expected. The only exception I would say was the friendly tour desk guy (don't recall his name now). Housekeeping was definitely subpar. They took away my in-room coffee cups(multiple days) and didn’t provide new ones until I called; toilet amenities were not replaced adequately. There was a chocolate spot on the table from something I had eaten earlier and left in a hurry. Housekeeping conveniently cleaned around it but missed the big spot. It took me all but a few seconds to wipe it off with a cloth. If I had to rate the housekeeping I would give the hotel a 2 star rating, considering the class of hotel. Room service prices were exorbitant but the portions tiny. I don’t mind paying, but the portion should be worth it. The hotel is in a fantastic location with an underground passage straight to the Tokyo metro(Nishi-Shinjuku station), which is very useful. The Shinjuku garden is also a few meters away and is a hassle free way to see the Cherry Blossoms. It has a shrine as well which is not as crowded as the other famous ones. There is a 24 hours Denny's just across the street if you want to avoid the room service.

During this time, they weren't returning our calls and we felt like we were imposing on them so we gave up, which was not a good feeling. But eventually, they called us back with a reservation at a great restaurant that we had to rush to, but it was worth it!During this process, out of frustration, I got in touch with a service that charges $35 to help tourists get reservations at top restaurants, and they responded within 5 minutes with an incredible Michelin star restaurant for the very next day. The Hilton concierge chastised us, saying that we needed to reserve the top places a month in advance (we had actually asked them a month in advance to help with a Jiro reservation that they were unable to get), and yet this other service called go-voyagin got us a reservation super fast. Go-voyagin called me with a place within 5 minutes of my initial request, versus 2+ hours from the Hilton concierge.

The area around the hotel is seemingly quiet, but still has a great energy. There are many excellent restaurants within easy walking distance, highly recommended to ask the front desk for suggestions.We stayed on both the 27th floor and the 37th floor, as we had club access. Our room on the 27th floor was lovely, modern, and looked to be recently renovated. Great views and sufficient space for a short stay in the city. Our room on the 37th floor, being on club level was surprisingly not as modern/renovated, the bathroom being far older to the room on the 27th floor. Bit disappointing considering this floor is exclusively for those who have paid extra for Club Access. The Exec Club is lovely, well appointed and with great views. The service we received from staff in the lounge was excellent, giving us advise on restaurants, sites and even making dinner reservations for us. It was a great experience. We had drinks there every night of our stay and were pleasantly surprised by the choice of food and drinks on offer. We had breakfast (included in our stay) at Marble Lounge on the 1st floor a couple of times. Although having to wait for a table to seat our party, the breakfast is very well appointed, and we all enjoyed it. Prior to arrival, we received excellent service from the Concierge, with regards to booking transfers from the airport to the hotel, dinner on arrival and advice on sites to see during our stay.However the service in general was not great, and not what was expected of a 5 Star Hotel. We arranged a week in advance for an airport transfer to take 8 people and luggage from the hotel to Narita airport. It was confirmed with the front desk on the morning of departure. Our full party arrived in the lobby with luggage to await the arrival only to be told after standing outside for 20min, that the car service company even though having confirmed the transfer did not have any cars. And it turns out the hotel did not confirm the transfer on the day of departure. We were also misinformed about the time it would take to get to the airport, and after much back and forth had taxi's arranged for us at the price of the transfer. We almost missed our flights, and after such a great holiday it was a disappointing way to end, and something which had the hotel service been as it should have been easily avoided.Marina and Sophie from the front desk, were excellent both prior and during our stay and we thank them for their great hospitality and service.

When we arrived at the hotel after a long train ride from Kyoto, we found that the hotel had us booked for a deluxe twin for only three nights. This was the original reservation before modifications. Luckily I saved all the paperwork regarding this reservation, and it clearly showed that I had indeed booked a jr. executive suite for four nights. The receptionist and her manager tried very hard to resolve this situation. But because it was peak cherry-blossom time, no jr. executive suites were available for four consecutive nights. Unfortunately the solution involved changing rooms twice, but for three of four nights we were upgraded to first a city suite for one night then a tower suite for the last two nights.

I stayed nearly a week at this hotel, and really enjoyed my stay.I arrived very early in the morning, so they registered me, told me even what room I was getting (#2714) and took my luggage promising to deliver it to my room as soon as the room was ready. Later that evening, when I got back to the hotel, they just gave me the card keys. Make sure to keep the card key jacket as it usually has information regarding corporate discount, which comes in handy when you have to pay for breakfast.Speaking if breakfast, it was excellent. It had a full complement of choices for Japanese, Chinese, European, and American type breakfasts. They all were of top quality. They also had a coffee station where you could get a cup of coffee to go. It can get crowded mid-morning, though, so try going earlier if possible.My room on the 27th Floor had a lovely view over Shinjuku and further the rest of Tokyo. It was very quiet, with perfect sound proofing. The Wi-Fi worked great, and the room had everything for doing work on your laptop, from a comfy desk to a comfy chair. The bed was very comfortable, and the lighting choices were excellent. There were enough outlets to charge. The bathroom had every convenience, including a heated toilet seat, which is not common in the West. The toiletries were the standard Hilton choices.There were a number of restaurants, as well as pastry and chocolate stores at the hotel. On the second floor, a jazz band performed in the evenings, and they were quite good. The Hilton Tokyo hotel is linked to Hiltopia, an underground shopping arcade with a great variety of restaurants and stores. One of the restaurants there specialized in Unagi (eel), and it was excellent.The hotel has a free shuttle that goes to Shinjuku station every twenty minutes. There are always taxis available outside the hotel as well.The concierge is very knowledgeable and helpful. The elevator area in the lobby smells fantastic with what appears to be a white tea and ginger smell that is specific to really high-end Asian hotels, such as The Langham in Hong Kong.Overall, this is a lovely hotel, and a very dependable choice.

I feel like they could have taken a touch of space from the bedroom and put it in the bathroom. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and all spoke English. They helped us with directions, buying stamps, navigating the subway and anything else we needed. The hotel is within walking distance to some things and they also offer a shuttle bus to Shinjuku station so that you can easily get around to via the subway. Taxis are also readily available. The hotel offers breakfast buffet style only, no a la carte. The second floor breakfast is for Hilton Honors members only and that was less crowded than the larger one in the lobby restaurant.

I wish we could have stayed longer! We had been traveling around Japan on a JR Rail pass and decided to stay in Shinjuku for our last night after staying in Hiroshima the night before. The Shinjuku Station is quite close to the hotel, about a 10 minute walk, however it was raining, we had luggage and we decided to take a taxi. There is a free shuttle bus, going every 20 minutes to and from the hotel but I was not sure how to find it. Shinjuku Station is like a city in itself so we decided on the easy option of a taxi. Taxi drivers in Japan are lovely and never seem annoyed by a cheap fare so I would recommend a taxi to get your bearings if you arrive by train. We took the shuttle bus back to the station the next day and the driver grabbed our luggage for us and took it out again when we got there. With a smile. There are smiles all round at the Hilton. As soon as we arrived, we we escorted to a check in desk, no waiting and the gentleman who checked us in offered us a better room than I chose on the Hilton App that morning. We stayed in a Queen room, on a high floor and had a beautiful view of the city. The room was immaculately clean and the bed was very comfortable and more than big enough for two biggish Aussies. I loved the kimono robes. I especially love the Hilton mirrors in the bathrooms. There is a magnified mirror which makes putting make-up on super easy and there is plenty of light. The colours of the room were relaxing and you can sit right up close to the window and watch over the city. The staff were exceptionally friendly, especially our English concierge who took our luggage up to the room and helped us find the Godzilla Head later on our walk into Kabukicho. She gave us a booklet with a map on it and her directions were spot on. It's a short, safe and fun walk to the red light area of Kabukicho. Afterwards, we had some delicious drinks in the Hilton Zatta Bar. The bar has an ambient red glow and they served some delicious pecans with our drinks. Totally chillaxing. Apart from the bar, we sadly didn't get a chance to try the restaurants or room service. I did buy some Hilton chocolates down stairs to take home. There are heaps of shops nearby, not just the high end shops you expect near a Hilton (Hiltopia shopping arcade under the Hotel) but 100 yen shops and convenience stores just up the road. We had a late flight the next day and were given a complimentary late check-out. Also free bottled water and internet. I even received a nice email from the Guest Relations Manager when I got back to Australia. This hotel knows customer service!

All in all not a bad place to get your bearings in Tokyo.As you would expect from Hlton, it's dependable, clean, professionally staffed, and a bit bland. But sometimes, Bland is just what you're looking for. We found it a good base to explore Shinjuku and the surrounding areas. (Two stops take you to the Shibuya shopping district, for example). If you stay here, be sure to walk over to the famous (notorious?) ""Memory lane"" --- Google that and you'll get its other, more colorful name as well. Anyway, lots of tiny little old shops selling beer and yakitori, some grilled on charcoal, some over butane.

This is my third review of this property, I encourage you to take a look at my other reviews which will provide more info.I have actually lost count of how many times I have stayed here over the last two years or so - this might be because I always feel like I am at home when I am here. This trip was a bit special for me as my cousin who lives in England was joining me and it was her first trip to Tokyo! It was an early morning arrival for her into Haneda which meant after a quick trip on the bus we arrived at the Hilton around 10AM. Fully aware that we were early and check in did not start until 2PM we were just going to drop our bags and go explore a bit of the city until we could come back and check in. Quite unexpectedly a very nice gentleman at the check in counter (who's, quite shamefully and embarrassingly, name I have forgotten except for the fact that it started with a T and he wore a grey suit) invited us to a computer terminal so he could see if there was a room available and if we could get in right away. A very friendly character, he took the time to welcome us, thank me for coming to stay with them again, and even thanked me for one of my previous reviews of the hotel! While he was working on the computer another one of the hotels amazing staff came a long with a cart and put all of our baggage on it so it could quickly be brought to storage or our room. I had booked a Twin Hilton room with a rollaway bed as, along with my cousin and myself, my friend decided to join us as well. The gentlemen who was helping us (again, i'm embarrassed i have forgotten his name) saw that there were the three of us and took a few minutes to look over what was available and much to our surprise and enjoyment advised us that we could be upgraded to a Junior Executive Suite if we were willing to wait as the room was still occupied. Of course we couldn't say no to that! After a quick few keystrokes and some friendly chit chat our bags were whipped away to storage and we agreed on coming back around 3PM to finalize check in and get our room keys. In the mean time it was down to Shibuya for some sightseeing and shopping!Coming back to the hotel to pick up our room keys was a breeze. Everything was already prepared for us and within 5 minutes of arriving back into the hotel we were on our way to our room. Arriving in the room everything was prepared for the three of us. The room had two twin sized beds plus a couch but they also brought the rollaway in for my friend and had it set up in a very nice spot by the window. A quick call to the concierge to let them know we were there and our bags were being brought up almost instantaneously! The Junior Suites feature the new, modern bathrooms with plenty of amenities, two twin beds, a couch/siting area, a nice wall mounted TV, a place for your luggage, and a reasonable closet to hang jackets in and place your shoes. All rooms also include bathrobes, day robes, slippers, and a safe.One of my perks with the upgrade, thanks to my HHonors Gold status, was the executive lounge. As I said in my other review if its not too much more to book a room with the executive status it is worth it however I feel that if its quite a bit more you have to take very good advantage of it to make it worth its while. I generally take the chance on an upgrade and so far I've been lucky with about 3 our of 4 stays getting it. After our check in we all freshened up and headed up to the lounge to enjoy some drinks and snacks. We got there just before it transitioned from afternoon tea to evening appetizers so we started out with some sweet snacks and a drink before having gyoza, soba noodles, and other assorted appetizers. The food selection is light, but very good - everything we had was very tasty! The drink selection is also very good with a wide variety including soft drinks, beer, champagne, spirits, and bottled water. The highlight of this experience was one of the employees in the lounge, Naoto. As he was clearing our table of some of the dishes and drinks he took the time to ask us where we were from, what brought us to Tokyo, and if we were enjoying ourselves. When he found out that I worked in the aviation industry we discovered that we share a similar passion in airplanes and aviation! Every time he stopped by to check in on us we would have a quick discussion about things aviation related and this made our entire party feel warm, welcome, and valued. Naoto made our lounge experience go from great to excellent. A very big thank you to Naoto, I hope he can be recognized in some way for his amazing customer service!Our entire stay at the Hilton Tokyo was, as usual, absolutely fantastic. The housekeeping staff kept our room amazingly clean and fresh, the lobby staff always made us feel warm and welcome, and the concierge desk was a great help in taking our bags up to the room, bringing them down when we departed, and answering our sometimes random questions about where to find things. The upgrade is a bonus and never expected but we still talk about it to this day! While we didn't try the new food options they did look amazing and one of the other guests said their meal was fantastic.Overall I just have to say it was another amazing stay at my home way from home. I'm staying again on the 17th of February and I can't wait! Thank you to all the staff for treating me and my travel companions so well, see you soon!","Vancouver, Canada",15,5.0

I stayed May, 2014, and chose to return last week. It was a tough choice to burn all my Hilton points which I value so highly, but this 3 night stay was worth it. We had a lovely, spacious king bed junior suite which allowed an early bird and night owl to harmoniously exist.I love having a Hilton credit card which gives automatic free wifi and breakfast for us both. In Tokyo, for two, that can be very expensive daily. I think the yummy breakfast buffet is about $40. The lobby is bright, although the music in the morning was a bit too loud for me (night owl) during breakfast. I liked the Japanese and western offerings and enjoyed experimenting. The credit card allowing gold status also allows access to the executive lounge if the hotel isn't at capacity (when I understand that they may limit to platinum), which provides such a divine respite from the hectic city. The lounge was perfect. We drank champagne, had a light dinner and even played backgammon on a quiet evening there.We didn't get to try out the beautifully newly renovated bar and restaurant, opting for local meals out instead. (Go for late breakfast/early lunch at Tsukiji fish market! I rarely stand in a long line for a meal, but this was great.)The staff is absolute perfection. From our arrival, Alberto and Ernesto (I hope I have Ernesto's name correct) at the front desk were lovely. We were tired after a long flight and ready to check in. Our room on the 22nd floor was soon ready. The king bed is extremely comfortable. I planned to take baths in the deep soaking tub, but stayed happy with the shower. The bathroom has a sliding Japanese style door to open to the suite for more light, but we preferred it closed. Housekeeping was great. The concierge spoke excellent English and was quite helpful.Arriving from Narita on the Narita Express, you're dropped at Shinjuku station. Watch carefully for Bus stop 21 outside of Oedo department store. Both trips, I missed the sign and walked down long passageways killing an extra 45 minutes or so. I agree with other posters that its downfall is location. There's really nothing of interest within about 10 blocks. However, the Tocho-mae station is 2 blocks from the Holtin and far easier to deal with than the enormous nearby Shinjuku station (where I seem to always get frustratingly lost).There is also an airport bus that goes directly from the hotel's front door to Haneda airport. Try for a higher floor facing the city rather than the side with some construction. Especially for those of you who are gold or platinum Hilton Honors members, I consider this hotel a fabulous value.",Massachusetts,147,5.0

The hotel has a free bus shuttle to shinjuku station, though, so it might work for those inclined to this kind of thing. 2. The hilton is connected to the subway but it is quite a walk and we could not find elevators or escalators that you can use if you check out and want to get to the airport via the metro. Big negative if you have heavy luggage on your way out. Getting TO the hotel however is relatively easy but a bit tiring, head for exit A7 at tochomae station, then when you see a few stairs on your right go down (no escalator) and head straight ahead for exit C8.

We booked rooms which included breakfast. Upon arriving we were ""super sized"" or up-sold to an executive suite and made Hilton club members. This is slightly better than a normal room and has the perks of access to the executive lounge and a special room away from the others at the 24hr buffet in the lobby. We were impressed with how well we were taken care of and the staff were extremely helpful. The executive lounge has different meal and snack periods throughout the day (incl. happy hour 6-8) and has a variety of vegetarian options and unlimited alcohol/drinks from the fridge. This was great when we came back from long day trips and wanted a quiet drink and snack before dinner. The area is kid friendly and has wifi access. Everything was going quite swimmingly until the second night when we decided to have dinner at the buffet downstairs (the same buffet where our included breakfast was served) because we were too tired to walk anywhere. We were seated in the special executive lounge area (where smoking is allowed - yes, smoking is allowed indoors in this spot so keep this in mind). For breakfast we had wandered out to the buffet freely, got our food and ate it where we were seated (exec. area) so when we came for dinner we assumed the same rules applied - apparently not! We went and got our food and wandered back in when we were abruptly stopped by a staff member and informed that we are not allowed to eat the food from the dinner buffet in the area where we were seated and that we were only allowed to order off the executive a la carte menu! (You can imagine what this was like - ludicrously overpriced and silly considering we had been drinking Chandon upstairs for no extra charge as executive suite guests).She stood there waving her hands at us like we were lepers in front of other guests, motioning for us to leave. One of our party spoke up and said that was ridiculous, and the staff member got her supervisor who ushered us, with no apology whatsoever, out to the main dining area. Oh and to top it all off - a buffet dinner will cost you more than 70 AUD per head - so for our party to eat for one night is was nearly half a grand for a serve-yourself buffet, which is a joke. Where we are from, you can eat at the swankiest restaurant in town for less than that.This event put such a downer on our night and we are disappointed that we were treated this way. Beware that, like most of these sort of places, they will extort as much money out of you as they can via. super sizing, bogus rules and up-selling.The pro's of the place were: - wifi access- good food quality, vege options - (for the most part) friendly staff- good location- seriously comfy mattresses","Lake Macquarie, Australia",4,2.0

We arrived via taxi van after staying in Hilton Tokyo Bay and were so warmly greeted by Ms Hiroya-san that she made us feel like we were her own family !! The hotel had either remembered or documented that I like normal milk to make my coffee in our room with, so a silver jug of milk was already in the bar fridge upon arrival-excellent. We stayed in the interconnecting Executive suites like last time so felt right at home straight away with this also. There were 2 new staff that were very funny, friendly and helpful-Ken Shimano and Hero. The Hilton has just started opening up a 2nd Executive Lounge, presumably as main one becomes full and people are turned away. We were lucky enough to be able to go to the new lounge one evening and discovered it was mainly Australian guests in there so we all chatted and laughed together. The hotel is very conveniently located to the rail system or you can take advantage of the free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station like we did. It is also very convenient if you have an organised tour with Sunrise Tours as they pickup from the Hilton. We didn't look at the new restaurants on the 2nd level as we were more than happy with the buffet restaurant.On New Years Eve, we saw an amusing site of 5 well dressed male Hilton staff pushing a very large grand piano along the path in front of the hotel and into the hotel for one of the News Years Eve events that the Hilton had organised. I did take a photo but unfortunately it is too blurry to attach here which is a shame as it was quite funny to watch and the staff were also laughing.Even on New Years Eve when the staff must have been very busy, I noticed that they all still took the time to chat with guests when assisting them with enquiries or check ins and did not rush people. The staff also organised our Shinkansen (Bullet Train) tickets to and from Osaka well before our arrival which I greatly appreciated.

The hotel offered a free shuttle service to Shinjuku Railway Station, it is also within walking distance from the next Metro Station. However, if I had a question, I found that neither the Receptionists nor the Concierge understood/spoke very good English. Considering that most of the guests are international (including many Airline Crews) the spoken English of the front desk staff should be better.

From the airport the hotel is the last stop, and took us two hours during rush hour traffic on a Friday. The bus stops right by the entrance to the lobby. For your return bus, make sure you reserve the bus in advance as it fills up quickly!OK, that's the basics covered for the hotel. We didn't spend much time in the hotel as such, but I will say that the two primary room-related negatives is that the walls are quite thin. You really notice this when at 2am your neighbours are calling their homelands whose timezones places them in the middle of the day! The other annoyance is that the bathroom has a clear window'd wall into the room itself. You can pull a shutter to cover this up, but the shutter is essentially a paperscreen that allows bathroom light to stream through. That means that anyone turning on the light in the middle of the night will flood the room with light too. if you're a light sleeper this will definitely cause you to wake up!","New York City, New York",94,4.0

Lovely good sized bathroom with a large full size tub and separate shower though tub and shower are in one wet room area. Very comfortable bed. We sprang for an executive level room and very glad we did. The breakfast in the executive lounge had good variety and more than enough to start the morning. We went to the evening receptions and for the most part it was sufficient for dinner. We felt that the value we received from the executive lounge and staff more than made up for the difference in price. Eating in the hotel was good but quite expensive. We had drinks and appies with our tour guide both evenings after our full day tours as well as had lunch there our last day and it was pricey but probably not unusual for a major hotel in an expensive city. Like every place we visited in Japan the staff were gracious, helpful and wanting to do anything to make your stay wonderful.

I would not recommend the restaurant.  The sushi was overpriced and mediocre quality. Overall, the hotel was clean, comfortable, modern and in a good location - but that is all.  The service was poor and not up to Hilton standard.  The staff were cold, indifferent and unwilling to help.  On this basis, I definitely would not recommend Hilton Tokyo.  The Shinjuku area, while convenient and lively, is not the most upmarket area.  Next time, I would stay in Ginza or Rappongi - and definitely with a different hotel chain.","Melbourne, Australia",139,2.0

While checking in I was told the upgrade is accepted and my wife and I would have an executive room for an extra approx 10,000 yen per night. However as we were doing the paperwork the two different people checking in on either side of me were also offered the same upgrade to an executive room but for free. I asked why it was free for them but around 10,000 yen a night for me and was told the difference was that I had selected the upgrade option when booking and they hadn't. So because I ticked a box on my booking I had to pay 10,000 yen/night while the two other groups got the same thing for free...I therefore told the lady I didn't think I was really getting very good value for that and I would just stick with the original room I booked (I didn't want the upgrade). I was then told that was too late I couldn't have my original room because they had already made up the upgraded room for me. I was then asked to go to the lounge and wait because they were just waiting for people to leave my room so they could make it up. I then queried why it was too late to go back to my original booking then if the upgraded room wasn't actually made up as they had originally claimed. Finally after checking with the manager it was ok they agreed to let me have the original type of room I booked - and not have to pay an additional 10,000 yen/night for an upgrade I didn't want.After the fun of checkin I thought id let off some frustration by playing a game of tennis. On trying to book the court I was told there is a court booking fee, a racket hiring fee, and the best part was a fee of 900 yen if I wanted to borrow a tennis ball (4). Really Hilton if you are advertising features like a tennis court as amenities on your website is it too much to ask to borrow a few tennis balls to play tennis!

Everything from the people to the cuisine is phenomenal. Nowhere else (and we’ve traveled quite a bit) are people more hospitable, kind, organized and civilized. In fact, every country should strive to be more like Japan!Unfortunately our stay at the Hilton wasn’t as great. We checked in on January 1st and the hotel lobby was a complete MAD house, granted it was January 1st but the crowds were ridiculous. Already a little hesitant due to the amount of traffic at the hotel, we moved on in the hopes our room would be worth the crowds, especially after being told we had been “upgraded” since we are Hilton Diamond members. Our so-called “upgrade” was simply getting a room on the executive floor, nothing more. The actual room (booked using Hilton honor points at a whopping 50,000 points a night) was EXTREMELY small…so small that my medium sized suitcase blocked the door when I laid it on the pre fabricated mounted wall suit case shelf (serious design flaw). The other suite case had to be tucked underneath the television because there was absolutely nowhere else to put it. The bathroom was outdated and the bathtub had several hairs in it, the AC wasn’t working very well and throughout the night we heard people coughing and walking across the hallway. The room did have a great view of Mount Fuji but I can’t get over how small the room was…That same night, we headed to the executive lounge for some cocktails in an effort to cheer us up and again we were met by an absurd amount of people, the crowd was so large that folks were lining up outside of the lounge. Never have I ever witnessed such a crowd in an executive lounge. I would highly suggest the hotel invests in a larger lounge if non-Gold and Diamond members are authorized to use the lounge through certain room packages/deals.The following morning, after a dreadful night, we contacted the front desk and after explaining everything they quickly upgraded us to a suite acknowledging that the so-called “upgrade” wasn’t really an upgrade that they had simply put us on the executive floor…the suite was gorgeous and we were very grateful for the upgrade!Sadly my ordeal wasn’t over yet however, this time it involved the concierge desk. That evening, as a result of inaccurate directions, I spent 60 minutes (and $30 on a taxi) searching for a restaurant on a map printed out by the concierge folks that didn’t exist at the address provided. Several neighborhood residents were kind enough to walk me to the address listed on the map but each time we ended up at the same apartment building (no sign of a Japanese restaurant). Eventually I stopped searching for the restaurant, hopped on the metro and had a quick ramen meal. Ironically enough, while I received directions and a map from the concierge desk (before departing for the restaurant with a reservation), an older gentleman stormed into the hotel and demanded the concierge desk contact a manager ASAP. It seems that he had been provided (by the concierge desk) incorrect directions. Right before I stepped away from the desk, he stopped me and forewarned me about his ordeal, little did I know the same would happen to me! During my check out I was hoping someone would ask me how my stay was but no one did hence my review on trip advisor. As a diamond member, I would have expected a lot more.The only reason this property is getting three stars is because of how amazing the Japanese people are and how pleasant it was to deal with them on a daily basis, though I must admit some folks at this Hilton are clearly “burnt out” from dealing with tourists (I don’t blame them). My overall advice is to book your stay somewhere else if you want a more personal and intimate experience. This property is a tourist black hole with a lot of traffic. As a diamond member I would have expected a lot more…Hilton, you can do better than this!","New York City, New York",27,3.0

There was no personalised service and the experience left us feeling a bit flat and cold. The room was tastefully decorated and had a nice view of the city, but there was no soundproofing. You could hear the kids runnings in the hallways and talking in other rooms. This contributed to a great lack of sleep. The hotel kindly organised xmas card, chocolates and wine, the gifts seemed to be generic and without care. The card was also printed out poorly with lines across the sentences showing the printer was running out of ink.

The hotel does have the 5-star feel to it, and lives up to the Hilton brand name. There are not much food options around the hotel, so best to take the shuttle to Shinjuku for food. It is also within walking distance there, about 15 minutes walk. There is a basement walkway to a Metro station which is also very convenient. The walk to that is about 5 minutes.

The double rooms were actually cheaper and there were plenty available. They refused to help even thought I'd prepaid for the rooms.

Two days before we arrived they emailed to ask if I wanted to spend over a thousand dollars a night upgrading my rooms or whether I would like to downgrade my rooms without a refund. When we checked in we were kept waiting for over half an hour while someone tried to help us. When we asked for a late checkout they refused.

There are 4 in our family and I approached the hotel by email before the booking enquiring whether it was ok to book the King Jr. Suite as a HHonours gold member using the spouse stays free option. I received a prompt reply from the hotel saying no problem at all, the room can accommodate 4 of you. On arrival for our stay the lady at check in was quite adamant you can't have 4 in the room but was not providing any other options. There was a bit of a Mexican stand off for a while and I couldn't access my email to show her. Anyway, after she made some calls she upgraded us to a King Jr. Executive suite on the 27th floor and 2 roll away beds were brought in as planned in the first place. After we finally checked in the head of guest relations, Albert, came and introduced himself personally and apologised for the inconvenience. Apart from the shaky start the rest of our stay was faultless. It is a great hotel. Fantastic staff everywhere. Beautiful rooms. Breakfast was great. The first 2 mornings we ate in the lobby which is quite busy. The next 2 as HHonours members we were entitled to have breakfast on the second floor. Basically it was the same offering but almost private. One morning we were the only people in there. So if your eligible and want a quiet morning definitely go here. We also had access to the executive lounge which is a nice retreat at the end of a day of sightseeing. It can get busy but we never couldn't get a seat for 4 of us. Beautiful selection of hot and cold snacks (mini meals) and a complete open bar to self serve from. One night we were tired and it even doubled as dinner as no one wanted to go out after relaxing for an hour there. Concierge gave us good recommendations for dinner, we got subway passes off them, booked and caught our airport limousine to Narita and other general help as required. We didn't use any of the fitness areas. Tokyo is a bit overwhelming for a first time visitor because of its size but the Shinjuku location is great.

Its about 55mins and the map display and announcements keep riders well informed of their current location and upcoming destination.Once you reach Shinjuku Station, just follow the signs throughout the station that advise of the direction to the Hilton. Once outside, its about a half-mile walk or you could catch the Hilton Shuttle to the Hotel.From the time you arrive at the Hilton the staff is warm, friendly, and very attentive. They are also very well dressed and exhibit very respectful manners. Albert is the Guest Relations Manager and has done a fantastic job training the staff.Once you get settled, be sure to check out one of the excellent dining options on the second floor. Various fine dining options include a steakhouse, japanese, and chinese. If you opt for the Chinese do not miss the Gyoza appetizers. Yes, I know Gyoza are fairly common throughout any part of the world, but these are made from the Japanese Black Pig. Regarded as the highest quality pork in the world, these are hands down the best Gyoza I have ever had. The food and beverage director, Diego, will be pacing about ensuring that guests enjoy a second to none dining experience.

The executive lounge facility on the 37th floor (from which you can see Mt Fuji on a clear day), which comes as an optional, additional charge is well worth considering.

I decide to contact the hotel's GM, who personally replied to my email explaining the reasons for the negative feedback and stating the hotel's viewpoint etc. etc. Consequently, we went ahead and booked 2 rooms for my family (4 people incl. 2 HH Diamond) and were immediately given guaranteed upgrades, one room being a suite ! We were treated like royalty from the moment we checked in until the moment we left the hotel. Both rooms were spacious and had lots of goodies in them - fruit juice, water, snacks etc., all on the house - and the minimalistic décor was perfect. Sleep quality was 100% in the wonderfully comfortable beds. It is a BIG hotel and the Executive Lounge could get very busy at breakfast time and even more so in the evenings. The hotel's management deals with this ""probelm"" by opening a second, more exclusive, lounge in the evenings. The second lounge is normally limited to Diamond members. I have read some negative f/b re. this overflow lounge but, personally, I found it MUCH more preferable to the main lounge as it has a very private feel, is much less busy and noisy, and an altogether calmer ambience, not unlike some of the better First Class lounges at some airports. The food & beverage choice is identical in both lounges. I cannot praise the staff enough : when we checked in (in the Exe Lounge) it was smiles and bowing all round, very friendly and, of course, efficient. Check-out was the same - we were treated like a cross between Royalty and life-long friends - and when we exited the lift on the ground floor, there was a reception committee waiting for us with parting gifts and hotel teddy bears and asking us to come back soon.

There is also a shuttle bus every 20 mins from Shinjuku station, which takes about 15 mins to reach the hotel.The room sizes are quite consistent with international hotels, as compared to typical Japanese rooms which are small.

However whenever there were vacant suites, I would be upgraded when I asked at the check in desk.

The rooms are a tad small when compared to similar hotels worldwide, but I guess the fact that this hotel is located in Tokyo makes it OK. However, there is nothing lacking in the rooms and everything is well provided for. The hotel offers a large breakfast spread and a well appointed lounge that serves drinks + snacks almost throughout the day. The lounge does have different meals for breakfast/afternoon tea/evening etc... but it serves its purpose to catch a quick snack when you are hungry. (Lounge entry is complimentary for Hhonors Gold and above) The hotel also have a 24/7 convenience store at the basement which is extremely helpful for a quick midnight snack (and you do not want to order room service). There is also an ATM just beside this store.The staff was remarkably polite and extremely helpful (just like most Japanese we met).

As we were checking in for a special occasion, Ernesto informed us that he had upgraded us from a standard double room to a City View suite. This was very much appreciated, and once we got to the room, we really got to grips with how very generous the upgrade was. The room was brilliant - modern, contemporary but with nuances of Japanese tradition. The room had a seperate lounge area, a seperate bedroom and a very generously sized walk in shower. We made use of the executive lounge for a day (to experience it) and this was also exceptional. The canapes were tasty and the drinks selection was varied. We also had breakfast at the St George's Bar, the choice of food was vast and the quality was very high.The hotel offers a shuttle bus to Shinjuku main station which is very helpful, and it runs every 20 minutes. Alternatively, the hotel also has an undergound passage to two subway stations which run two different lines depending on where you want to go. Although daunting at first, the subway is the ONLY way to travel around Tokyo in my opinion. It makes things easier, cheaper and quicker. You can purchase travel passes from Concierge, I purchased a 3 day travel card which is 1,500Y (£8) which is a bargain for the amount me and my wife used the underground.The hotel is situated in an ideal position for seeing all of Tokyo, but also has some local based points of interest such as the Government building. it is also build above an underground shopping area which is ideal and means you don't need to leave the hotel for things like convenience goods.The indoor pool and gym facilities are very good and empty if you use them later in the evening. The pool is fairly sized and everything is kept emaculately clean!I could go on all day about my experience at this hotel, but in short, WHEN I go back to Tokyo (because it is a city that is deserving of around 2 weeks and not just the 4 I gave it) - I will not hesitate to stay here again.","London, United Kingdom",211,5.0

It is also an easy 4 stop train journey to Tokyo's central station where you catch the Bullet Train.The hotel itself is great. Clean, modern, helpful; everything you want. We decided not to pay for breakfast as we didn't want a big buffet but walked to Starbucks round the corner each morning. We did have the buffet in the evening on our first night. We had missed a nights sleep and were at the end of our tether so probably not in the best condition to judge it but it seemed about a 6 out of 10.The front desk and concierge were very helpful and extremely polite.","London, United Kingdom",91,4.0

We had the pleasure of talking to her every day during our stay - she was there to help out with places to go shopping, suggestions on things to do, etc. When going to the lounge for cocktail hour, she would even ask about our day, if we found what we were looking for while shopping. I really appreciated that. She truly made us feel special and valued as guests. Hilton Shinjuku is very lucky to have her! The hotel's location is great - you can walk to Shinjuku Station, or take the hotel's shuttle. There's also easy access to the Nishi-Shinjuku and Tocho-Mae metro stations under the hotel. If you have luggage, I'd strongly suggest using the airport limo bus to/from. It may take a bit longer than the train, but it's so much easier than have to navigate the subway with luggage.

I understand that the hotel has several restaurants; we ate there only one time for the dinner buffet which was really good although a bit pricey. In the lower level of the hotel is a shopping mall with a number of very small, quaint and traditional Japanese food restaurants along with a well-equipped convenience store. The latter was much appreciated so that we didn't have to scout around the neighborhood looking for snacks and water. Although the area around the hotel is pretty quiet after 6:00PM each day, there are enough restaurants close-by that it was easy to find something decent to eat. There's even an American/Japanese Denny's across the street behind the hotel. It was rather unique and I'd suggest it to those who stay here.

Have previously stayed here multiple times and like its proximity to Shinjuku. A shuttle bus is available every 20mins but the walk (10mins) is also a very easy one.Hotel was at capacity during our stay due to some holidays around Asia as well as a public holiday in Japan.I would like to share a positive and negative feedback. Starting with negative, I personally experienced some attitude from one of the staff during breakfast at the Marble lounge. Monday was a public holiday in Japan and therefore the hotel was at capacity with waiters running around clearing tables for other guests. I only needed some milk for my tea and an extra tea bag. Instead of disturbing the waiter, as I had to get breakfast from the buffet, I made my way to the coffee making area. I noticed that the pitchers had syrup in them and when asked the 2 members of staff at the coffee station, Mr Ito pointed using his finger that milk was behind him. I acknowledged and asked whether I could have milk in a pitcher for my tea at my table. The other staff member gladly grabbed a pitcher and filled it up with milk (simple task). As this was a tea/coffee station, I asked the same member of staff for kindly assisted me for an extra tea bag, Mr Ito seemed annoyed and make some comments in Japanese to the staff. This left me with a bad taste. As I headed to my table, I shared this experienced with my mother in law (she's Japanese) and she decided to get some mineral water from the same area. When asked for water, she received a totally different service (from grabbing a glass to pouring the water for her when everything is self serve and in front of her). Is it because she is Japanese and I'm not?? I observed Mr Ito over the next couple of days during breakfast and can clearly see that his motivation towards customer service is not his priority (No Omotenashi).On a positive side, Ms Kobayashi showed great interest in making sure that every guest within her area were well looked after or needed anything. She was always checking for tea/coffee and clearing the table for empty plates. She would engage with making small conversation although she admits her English is not great. This was well appreciated and the effort should be recommended. Ms Kobayashi is an individual with full or energy and takes great passion in what she does. A very great asset for this hotel with great potential of doing very well.I do hope that this is the exception as this surely does not reflect the Japanese Omotenashi.",Australia,21,4.0

My last review gives great detail to my first (and continually ongoing) experience at the hotel, this review will cover my Executive Room upgrade and the benefits that go along with it! This review is a little late and I do apologize! It was written right after my stay and stuck in a save file until now!As expected, my stay at the Hilton Tokyo has been fantastic! From check in to check out, the staff have been amazingly friendly and the service has been nothing but top notch. My room has always been clean upon arrival and after the housekeeping staff have attended. The Hilton Tokyo has set my standards for what I expect from any property I stay at - worldwide!This time around I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to an Executive Room with Executive Lounge access, thank you Hilton Gold status, and I can't tell you how amazing it was. While I felt that the room itself and the quality of service I received was at the same fantastic level as it always is, the big difference to my stay was the Executive Lounge access.On my first night at the Hilton Tokyo myself and my travel companion returned to the hotel after a day of exploration to enjoy some great snacks and beverages in the Executive Lounge. The lounge itself was on the 37th floor and provided some amazing views of Tokyo at night while we snacked on a variety of hot and cold snacks along with a few beverages. There were plenty of finger food options (gyoza, small samples of soba noodles, etc,) and my travel companion stuck to soft drinks while I enjoyed a beer or two (or three, or four...) before heading back out into Shinjuku to find an izakaya for our main dinner.On the second night we went to the lounge right at opening time and the concierge invited us to a secondary lounge that at the very least I could call a VIP lounge. Smaller, more intimate, with a different selection of finger foods, including caviar, this was an absolutely amazing experience. We spent the whole two hours eating and drinking while we chatted away, to the point where we felt that we really didn't need to go have dinner! The beverage selection was fantastic and included soft drinks, beer, and a fine selection of hard alcohol choices. Time flew by as we ate and drank, and before we knew it we were the last ones in the lounge still enjoying our drinks...30 minutes after it closed! Very sheepishly we apologized to the remaining staff members and made our way back to our rooms to relax for the rest of the evening.Another big bonus of my Executive/Gold status was the complimentary buffet breakfast in the morning. Hilton Gold will allow me to enjoy the buffet breakfast complimentary in the Marble Lounge on the first floor, the Executive Room will allow me to enjoy it in the Executive Lounge as an alternative. The breakfast itself was fantastic with a wide variety of both Asian and Western selections for breakfast. While I was a bonus to have the Executive Lounge breakfast, I actually enjoyed the selection and atmosphere of the Marble Lounge buffet more. Overall my stay at the Tokyo Hilton was nothing short of fantastic, as usual! My Hilton Honors Gold upgrade entitled me to an Executive room with Executive Lounge access which added to my experience, thanks to the free evening beverages and snacks and an alternative place to have my morning breakfast. In all honesty would I book a room at additional cost for Executive access? If it was a corporate booking and the company was paying for it, yes. If it was a personal booking and I was paying for it, no(I would hope my status got me the upgrade at no cost). While the free food and drink from the lounge was enjoyable I would have to make sure I drank/ate the difference in price between a regular room and an Executive room - Which quite possibly could easily be beaten by a reasonable night of food and drink at a local izakaya. I don't want to take anything away from the amazing staff at the Hilton Tokyo - There is a reason I am loyal to this hotel - however as a casual/personal traveller I would find it hard to justify the difference between a Executive room and a standard room unless the price difference is very minimal(less than $30/Y3000 per night).Overall my rating of the Hilton Tokyo remains 5/5. I'm always recognized as a return customer and a Hilton HHonors Gold member. ALL the staff are extremely polite and courteous. The hotel itself has always been clean, comfortable, and enjoyable. Is the Executive Room/Lounge worth it? Depending on the prices difference and who is paying for it,maybe. There are lots of local eating options which could meet/beat what the difference is between the two, depending on how much you can eat/drink!Do I recommend the Hilton Tokyo? Absolutely! As I've said many times the staff are amazing, the location is fantastic, and the rooms are always clean. When it comes to a basic room vs an executive room its up to you to compare the prices and decide what is a better value.My next goal for the Hilton Tokyo - Finding out what the Golden Key Club is all about, and how I get invited to it!","Vancouver, Canada",15,5.0

True up to a point, but a Japanese Hilton adds that little touch of extra. The standards were as you would expect and the restaurants are particularly nice. Try the Japanese restaurant for a terrific taster through sushi/sashimi and also a decent teppanyaki experience. Try the Chinese restaurant for the slightly more challenging sea-cucumber (aka sea-slug) and jellyfish. Breakfast is a decent mix of local and Western, although don't expect a full English as nowhere but here does a good sausage. Having said that, I much prefer to try to eat the local cuisine whenever possible. Service was excellent and if you have other destinations in Japan (as we did) then I recommend you use the luggage forwarding service that most hotels use. For about £7 to £10 you send your suitcases the day before, and then travel light. When you arrive, your suitcases are waiting in the room for you.

It's is near NishiShinjuku. it's 15 minutes walk to Shinjuku and the Marounochi line is one of the slowest lines in Tokyo. There is a significant walking to the cool/nightlife part of Shinjuku.2. A bit of a mishap with our reservation. We booked one reward night as a HHonors member and one paid night. Turns out the reward was for a King room while the paid night was for a Queen room. They couldn't find a room for us for both night (Queen or King, we didn't care). We were asked either to upgrade to a suite for additional 20,000 JPY or take a Twin room. We took the Twin reluctantly. which is not great for a couple on a vacation.",,3,4.0

They helped me get scarce baseball tickets and arranged a tour and reservations.The bell desk sells Metro passes and a station is adjacent to the hotel.

The yacht wasn't there but we discovered it in a drawer as we were checking out so should have searched a bit harder!Although we had initially arrived via Nisei-Shinjuku Station, we only rediscovered it as we left on the last day. We should have used it more - changing lines at other stations - as it really was the shortest walk to the hotel. It's down a funny side street though so as you come out of the main doors, you tend to head off towards Tocho-Mae which is signposted. We used the questions function on here and subsequently emailed Sam Fan at the Hilton as we wanted a room with a certain view. We searched on TA reviews to find photos of the view we wanted and emailed it to the Hilton man. We were stoked to find that we had a room with almost exactly that view.

Hotel is close to Nishi-shinjuku station, or a short walk to Shinjuku 'main station'. There is also a free bus shuttle service which runs every 20 minutes which is really useful if loaded up with luggage or shopping. My checkin was pretty chaotic on both occasions. I'm not sure if it's a new thing with Hilton where they no longer have a dedicated HHonors counter, but I had to wait ages, which isn't what I want after a long trip (I had the same experience with the Osaka Hilton). Room was the usual modern Hilton style, which I like, clean and spacious feeling. I had a king room, so the bed was big sized. It was clean, the bathroom was spotless, and the bath shower was 'wet room' style, but with a few design faults, the shower head didn't have the adjustment to spray downwards where you're standing. Not an issue, but not very Japanese design standards! wifi was free, and it was fast and reliable. Also didn't seem to have the annoying habit of continually asking to re-login. Breakfast was downstairs, I had it two times, and had a good selection of both western and Japanese style food. Lovely buttery croissants which I like. Possible to order eggs and so on, and they have decent coffee like lattes if you order it. (you can also order one to take away if needed). One morning I did get somebody else's bill! The downsides: I already mentioned the chaotic check in. The hotel is close to a hospital, so there is the noise of sirens from the ambulances arriving. Could be a consideration if you are a light sleeper to try and get a higher up room. The walls were not particularly sound proof, I could hear the lady in the room next to me having a skype conversation home.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands",70,4.0

It operates a courtesy bus to/from the station, every 20 minutes from 8 am or so to 9.30 pm. Otherwise it’s a 10-15 minute walk. An escalator in the lobby leads to underground passages to Shinjuku and the two nearest subway/underground/Metro stations (something I only discovered part way through the stay). The six lifts are effective, with no long waits during our stay. The free Wi-Fi was satisfactory for our needs (internet surfing and sending messages/pictures to family).I cannot think of any significant negatives. Laundry prices would have been expensive but the hotel gave me a map to a coin laundry, about ten minutes’ walk, where I washed and dried a full load for less than the price of a T-Shirt at the hotel. We did not eat in the hotel, again partly due to cost, but also because we wanted to eat in the city.

If you don't like walking too much, the Tochomae staton is right under the hotel (again, a short walk). This line goes to many of the areas you'll want to see either directly, or with some transfers. The breakfast buffet is a good way to start the morning, and the selection is good. The staff is really helpful and very kind and considerate. They are genuinely nice people who have no problem helping tourists. The only problem we had at the hotel is the internet, and this is a problem we've had with many other Hiltons. Once you log on, and if you don't use your device for even a minute, and it goes into sleep mode, you will have to log in all over again!It's extremely frustrating, and this policy should be dealt with by Hilton.

Thanks to Hilton Tokyo's Shinjuku location and helpful staff, we were able to see and do everything we wanted to do in Tokyo. We stayed with Hilton Tokyo (Shinjuku) for 9 nights. We only were able to use their complimentary wi-fi for seven nights as that is the limit of what they provide. While we were able to use their wi-fi, it worked well and without fail. On multiple occasions we used the concierge desk, and it was due to these interactions that we were able to do everything we wanted to do in Tokyo. There are multiple restaurants (such as Alice's Fantasy Restaurant and The Final Fantasy Eorzea Cafe) that are very hard to book online if you don't speak Japanese, or simply won't let you book until you are in Japan due to the need to pick up tickets. The concierge desk worked with us on multiple occasions to not only call restaurants to help us make reservations, but to also help us book tickets on a website in Japanese that we couldn't read. They also printed us confirmations and gave us maps that directed us where to go. As we were preparing to leave, the concierge also helped us to book tickets on the Friendly Limousine bus that drove directly to the Narita Airport (This drive takes about an hour and there are bathrooms on the bus!), and helped us mail back our pocket wi-fi we were renting for our stay. We deeply appreciated their help as they made our trip everything we dreamt it would be. Another great perk to this hotel is its connection to the Nishi-Shinjuku Metro Station. To get to this station requires about a five-10 minute walk above ground or the same underground. We were able to walk from the station to this on hotel on multiple occasions without ever emerging above ground. The Hilton also has an underground mall connected to it called Hiltopia. This mall has a shop that is open super late. This is a great place to grab drinks, snacks, or quick breakfasts. Hiltopia also has an ATM machine my husband and I used on multiple occasions. As for the room, we had plenty of space. The bed was comfortable. The TV has a Blu-Ray player attached to it. We found this to be a great feature! On one of our first nights, we bought cheap Ghibli/Anime DVDs and watched them throughout our stay. When in Tokyo, watching Naruto and Howl's Moving Castle is kind of in the rules. The bathroom looked very nice and the hotel kindly provides many amenities (toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, face soap, hairdryer, etc.), but we struggled with the shower. We had come from the Disneyland Hotel that had a shower room, which meant the expectation was the water was going to fall directly onto the floor and go down a drain. In the Hilton Tokyo, there is only a tiny glass divider provided directly next to the shower head, which does not do a great job of stopping the water from getting on the floor. The floor does have a drain, so maybe this is expected? We were entirely confused. The water pressure and temperature were always nice though, so this was just a minor inconvenience. A note for vegetarians: Their buffet breakfast does provide many options including pancakes, french toast, an omelette station that is made to order, plain rice, potatoes, cereal, etc. The only ""disappointment"" is that all the edible options for vegetarians are very westernized, which means we miss out on all the delicious looking Japanese options. We enjoyed this breakfast once during our stay, but as we could not eat enough every morning to justify the cost, we instead began eating our breakfast at the Royal Host right outside the hotel. This is Tokyo's version of a much nicer ""Denny's"" that is reasonably priced and also provides basic breakfast vegetarian options.Overall, we were completely comfortable our entire stay, even with knowing only a little Japanese, and were able to focus on enjoying our time in Tokyo.","Santa Cruz, California",139,5.0

When I entered her room, I noticed her room was totally different from my roomWe went down to the front counter and met the front desk shift leader to clarify the matter. He told us that the night shift staff informed us about the condition of our rooms before they given the rooms to us, and we accepted. This message had made us very disappointed because none of the staff informed us about that. We really can't believe the night shift staff even made up the story about their arrangement. Which mean their intention is very clear to cheat us with the standard rooms for executive rooms. After a long talk, the shift leader tried to offer us a dinner at the hotel to settle the complaint, we rejected as we already had other plans. As we were short of time for our other activities on that day, we told him to discuss with his higher management on this issue and we will meet him in the evening for the answer.We felt very disappointed and regretful not only we had to waste time complaint to them, the irresponsible night shift staff even made the story to cover their action.Although in the evening on our return, the hotel told us that they arranged to upgrade out rooms to suite rooms.

I had to bring it to their attention twice. Then the problem was resolved.I wasn't feeling well one day. I thought I would make it through dinner at the restaurant, but couldn't. I wanted to take my food back to my room to finish as I had barely touched it. I was told no. Now, that was the only thing that really bothered me. The food was expensive and average-tasting at best, but it was what I had. I understand that it is not the norm there to allow carry-out, but I was staying in the hotel for an extended amount of time. If I hadn't been so tired, I probably would have pressed the issue.Overall: the hotel is okay. I would stay there again given the price and access. I have ways to deal with the minor inconveniences I experienced.","Cambridge, Massachusetts",36,3.0

This was unexpected delight.The hotel is nicely located, you are a short walk from a lot and a 15 minute subway ride from Downtown. The best part is an underground tunnel system that leads you to 2 subway stations, so you can easily find where you need to go.I was not here on business, but on pleasure for 4 days. Key points:- Friendly staff, accommodating to a Westerner.- Great concierge, very helpful- Close to subway stations and convenience stores and casual restaurants- Inside there were two bars a few restaurants.- Direct delivery from Narita via the limousine bus shuttle....door to door, helps when you are jet lagged vs. the subway.- Clean spacious rooms- Great amenities in the room.- Polite and professional staffTake my advice and stay here.

Situated in the hotel district, it is walking distance to Shinjuku itself and the main train station. If walking is not an option, the hotel offers complementary shuttle buses to the station, however we did not use this service.We stayed in a standard room which, while small, was noted as being large by Japanese standards. The bed was comfortable and while we did not select a room with a view, still had a decent lookout at Shinjuku. The bathrooms were very small however, and do not fit two people at the basin.The lobby is grand and smells heavenly upon entry. Included in our rate was daily breakfast, which boasted a large selection of hot and cold items, both Japanese and Western. We did find problems with breakfast service however, with our entire table, full coffees included, being cleared while getting up to grab something else from the breakfast selection. Upon return, having to be seated and asked for coffee all over again. Even after trying to leave a coat or a personal item at the table, this still continued to us and other tables around us.Checkout and checkin both went smoothly, however as the Hilton is notably a large hotel, we did on occasion feel like 'just another number'.In saying that however, there is no other hotel that we would have preferred to stay, and will likely return to the Hilton when we travel to Tokyo again.","Melbourne, Australia",15,4.0

I chose Hilton.My Hilton Hhonors gold membership card had not arrived with me prior to departing for my trip, but I had my member number in one of my email accounts.Hilton Shinjuku was my last - and longest stop - on what was my first ever visit to Japan and I'd just received the most amazing service at each of the hotels I'd stayed in in Osaka, Kyoto and Hiroshima. And to be honest, I was actually looking forward to staying at Hilton Shinjuku.After an officious “welcome” by the staff member on check-in (she was seemingly perturbed that I was unable to locate my Hhonors member number during the check-in process and became dismissive when she couldn't find it herself on the computer system), I was presented with the card to my room.On entering the room I discovered that they’d put me in the incorrect room; a King Deluxe, instead of the more expensive King Hilton I’d paid for. I then called down to reception to both let them know that I was in the wrong room and my member number, which I’d managed to locate in an email.As soon as said staff member entered my details into the system, her demeanour changed instantly and she became incredibly apologetic, seemingly surprised that I was a gold member, referring to me as “sir” etc. She advised me that there were no King Hilton rooms available for my first night, but that she would upgrade me to an Executive Suite for the remainder of my stay with full access to the executive lounge to make up for it. I was to leave my room card at reception and my case in the room and pick up the new room card when I arrived back at the hotel later on my second day, which I did. For the remaining five nights, yes, I did have access to the executive lounge, but was accommodated in the King Hilton suite which, though comfortable, was the room I’d paid for in the first place and not the Executive Suite I was promised (Gold Hhonors members are also meant to receive ""space-available upgrades"").I didn’t used the executive lounge, I didn’t use any of the facilities in the hotel as part of my stay. I wasn’t given the wifi password, I didn't receive the complimentary continental breakfast (also supposedly a perk of being a gold member), nor did I visit the restaurant(s). I felt relatively unwelcome from the moment I stepped foot in front of the reception desk and spent as little time as possible in the hotel as a result.On my return from Japan, and on finding out that I'd not earned points for my stay due to booking the room via a third party website (one must book via Hilton's own website to earn points, I later found out), I sent emails to the Hhonors Guest Services team to cancel my membership. To be fair, the staff members at Guest Services were pretty good and though incredibly apologetic about my experiences and offering various forms of compensation to keep me as a member, their responses were cut and paste jobs and therefore smacked of insincerity. Not exactly the type of responses you'd expect as a gold member.The last email I received from them started (quote);""Thank you for contacting Hilton Guest Assistance. My name is ******(edited to protect identity). It will be my pleasure to assist with the room suite type unavailable, front desk staff, disappointed with over all experience during your stay and did not earn HHonors points due to third party booking at the Hilton Tokyo on April 12, 2015.""At the base of each of Hilton's emails to me was the sentence, ""Hilton Worldwide strives to offer the world’s best customer service in every interaction.""At both the hotel check-in and with my later email dealings with them, they failed to deliver.Suffice to say, I'm no longer a Hilton Hhonors member and will not be staying at their hotels in the future because of my experience at Hilton Shinjuku.I think the real kicker about my experience was that... I stayed at ANA Crowne Plaza in Osaka, Hotel Anteroom in Kyoto and Sheraton Hiroshima during my Japanese visit, am not a member with any of those hotels, but was treated infinitely better as a customer in each of them than I was as a gold member at Hilton Shinjuku.To me, that speaks volumes.The hotel itself? The rooms are well appointed, compact and comfortable, though I stayed in better and more modern during my visit to Japan. There's no free wifi.Location's pretty good, with a connection via an underground passageway to NishiShinjuku subway station. Though if you have trouble walking for more than ten minutes, it might be best to catch a cab out front.There are restaurants and convenience stores close by.I'm not going to totally shaft the Hilton Shinjuku by giving it just one 'star'; it does everything a modern hotel should do in providing reliable, comfortable accommodation. It gets a 'star' for delivering on that and another star for the amazing service I received from the man at concierge as I was literally leaving the hotel for the very last time, who was friendly, helpful and courteous. If Hilton Shinjuku had more people like him working for them and if only he was my first impression instead of my last, they would be dazzling here with more than the two stars.As it stands, however, they've lost a customer for life.","Melbourne, Australia",57,2.0

Furnishings and bathrooms were top notch. The bed was very comfortable if you like beds that are a little bit on the firmer side. Service was great in the room, in the breakfast restaurant, and in the Executive Lounge. For Hilton Honors members at the Diamond level you will be very happy with either of the buffet breakfasts (in the main dinning area on the first floor or in the Executive Lounge) which both include American style (eggs, bacon, pancakes, cereal) and Japanese style (fish, miso, pickled items, tofu) breakfast items. Dinner in the executive lounge had enough substantial food to keep you from paying elsewhere or was a nice place to grab a few appetizers and a beer before going out. The shuttle bus to the Shinjuku Train Station was extremely convenient and taxi rides to Shinjuku restaurants were about $7-8 one way. As many may already know, you don't need to tip at the hotel or in the taxis which is quite a nice change from the US and many other places abroad! English was spoken well by most of the hotel staff. I had Japanese friends in town and did not need to use the concierge so I can't comment on that. We went off to Hakone for one night by train and the hotel was very happy to store our excess luggage overnight for us. As it seems with most Hiltons, the free wifi is available, but very, very slow (to the point of being almost too slow even for web-browsing) most of the time, but the paid premium wifi worked well.

Few failures. No excuses. It's part of the culture. So when you go to a downtown Tokyo hotel -- especially a Hilton -- you expect excellence, and this facility delivers. It is within walking distance of the Shinjuku station and is connected by tunnels to the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station. You can eat, sleep, and go with near zero hassle. The hotel is expensive and the breakfast buffet, though excellent, is nearly $30 with the discount you can request at the front desk. The place gets a 10 for performance on all dimensions, but expect to pay for that high level of serviceEnglish in the hotel is the best in Asia, not native, but perfect comprehension even for idiomatic expressions. The staff are friendly and efficient, a rare combination. You can get to the hotel as a direct stop using the airport limousine bus from either Haneda or Narita airports.

The hotel is well located in one of Tokyo's trendiest districts, Shinjuku. If you are able to find the free hotel shuttle bus from Shinjuku station, it's a very quick 5 minutes ride to the hotel. Otherwise a cab ride from the station is just as fast. Having last visited in 2008 I noted that the hotel's interior has improved through renovations. The rooms are comfortable with hip vintage looking furniture, newly produced. Shoji screens on the windows and tactile wallpapers and finishes in the rooms interior convey typical Japanese design touches. The bathrooms are a bit on the smaller side, but this is typical of Japanese hotels.I used the gym and it is adequate for a one and half hour cardio and strength training workout. There is a small indoor pool adjacent if you prepare to swim laps. The breakfast in the main lobby has excellent choices and should be included as part of your reservation plan.

I think it makes a huge difference when you walk into a hotel and feel like the lobby is a bit more of an oasis that has a real sense of place (in this case, Tokyo, Japan, etc.). As for what I liked about the hotel: It is in a good, really accessible (2 subway lines) location (allowed me to do a lot of sightseeing during my spare time), the rooms were clean, modern and comfortable, the service was good (Concierge desk was always busy, but they did a good job in not making me wait too long and being helpful), and the food was very good.

I would not know about the ""executive breakfast"" upstairs, but the breakfast at the lobby level was not to my satisfaction.

I booked a Blacklane Limo from Tokyo Haneada to the Tokyo Hilton since our flight was already late and our baggage problem further increased our arrival later to the evening. My expectation was that a Lincoln town car would turn up and drive us to the Hilton. Oh boy, was I wrong. A Maybach Mercedes arrived with a white gloved driver to escort us to the Hilton. He carried our luggage to the check in desk and refused a tip. This was unbelievable customer service, the likes of which is very rare in our good old USA.The Hilton was wonderful. It was clean, polished, glitzy, and comfortable. The check in staff was multi-lingual and polished. Check in was a breeze and we were off to the room sans Mom's luggage. The room was sparkling clean. It had fast Wi-Fi. The shower was interesting. It was more like a broom closet that sprayed on the floor, but was adequate with nice pressure and hot water.

That pretty much sums up the staff of the hotel - they're friendly, professional, welcoming and an example of what hotel employees around the world should be. Wherever we went in the building, we were greeted by smiles and offers of help. But like all chains, the hotel felt a bit clinical and corporate - lacking charm and individuality.Our room was on the 28th floor with views out to the east of Shinjuku. The hotel itself is on the western side of the district, surrounded by towers representing government and commerce. In this area, bars, restaurants and shops are largely found either underground or at the top of the buildings. The eastern side of Shinjuku, famous for its wild and colourful nightlife as well as the rail station, is about 10 minutes walk away. There are several metro line stations within a few minutes walk of the hotel and you'll need them to get around this giant city.Our room was clean, of a good size and with good air con and facilities. Maid service was excellent. The bathroom was on the small side and awkwardly designed but had a great shower.Breakfast was in the Marble Lounge on the ground floor - a barn of a space that lacked atmosphere and itself merged into reception. The quality of the buffet was good with a mix of local and Western offerings. As a loyalty programme member, we were able to have breakfast on the 2nd floor restaurant but it was more chaotic and the re-stocking of food wasn't good.There's an English-style pub on the ground floor but we didn't really like it - partly because it seemed a lot smokier - and preferred the bar on the stylish 2nd floor. This floor also had three restaurants - all of them very expensive. We tried the Metropolitan Grill on the first night but ate out the rest of the time, finding food of equal quality but a lot cheaper.We stayed four nights and that was about long enough in Tokyo for us.","London, United Kingdom",131,5.0

(My husband had breakfast each morning, and we visited the lounges several evenings. However, I am total vegan, and there wasn't a lot for me. The staff always graciously provided my husband with a box of soy milk and a banana for me to enjoy in our suite with the vegan items I'd brought from home.) Loved the beautiful yukata plus lovely bathrobe, the multi-function toilet, the shower ROOM with deep soaking tub, and the Japanese decor, including sliding screens, along with modern desk and seating.STAFF: We experienced genuine graciousness and efficient expertise throughout: from the porters to the receptionists to the concierges & servers at the private lounges to the restaurant staff. (We dined only one night--in their Japanese restaurant, which is one of several options--to entertain guests, as none of the restaurants could do full vegan meals, but the staff went out of their way to provide items that did work for me, and my husband and our guests found the food outstanding and beautifully presented.) The bell desk staff also took excellent care of having our luggage forwarded to our Osaka hotel (a totally different chain), for which we could put the charges on our bill--and our luggage was in our room at our Osaka hotel when we arrived the next day via bullet train.TIP FOR VEGANS: You can get a good enough breakfast at the Executive Lounge or Gold Lounge--and there's a charming little Indian restaurant in the basement-level shopping arcade.We plan to return to Japan and this hotel will be our first choice!

The Executive Lounge has a really quite decent layout in the evenings with hot and cold appetisers and a good selection of free drinks. The lounge was quiet and had wonderful views over the city in the setting sun. The breakfast was ok - with the omelette station as the best feature. We recommend Hilton to anyone who wants to stay centrally with some creature comforts for a decent price!","Stockholm, Sweden",19,4.0

No complaints about the room generally. They offered us an upgrade to the executive floor (36/37) for $100 a night, but that didn't seem worth it.This hotel does everything it's supposed to do - it's relatively central (although definitely not in a cool neighborhood as it's on the quiet west side of Shinjuku which has a CBD vibe), it has all the facilities you'd expect, but it is a little dated and there's no real wow factor. It's a solid 4 star. When we travelled, however, it was also quite good value. So the message is - make sure you pay 4 star rates. A couple of minor quibbles (none of them major):* The breakfast was pretty average - you can tell most things are frozen - but it did have an omelette station and very nice baguettes (made by their in-house French patisserie). But I'm very food focussed so for most people it would be totally fine. It gets very busy, especially between 8 and 9 as there are a lot of business travelers.* This hotel is BIG and BUSY. The lift ride from the 34th down to the lobby almost drove me crazy as it would stop on average about 5 or 6 times on the way down.* Gym and pool are average.* There is not much immediately around the hotel - but there are two subway stations 10 minutes walk away. * The hotel floors smell of smoke.These were all not major issues, but just be aware that the experience just generally lacks the wow factor that might make it 5 star. This is partially because the hotel is just too big to offer that next level of service. On a more positive note - we ate at the Metropolitan Grill on a couple of nights, and the staff there is ridiculously nice. Everyone chatted to us, and the chef actually came out and talked to us for 20 minutes on the second night. Really nice people. Can highly recommend. Food was good too (although not cheap).","Edgecliff, Australia",1,4.0

The hotel was in a fairly good location, not too far from shopping attractions etc, though the subway station was a bit of a walk when you have all your luggage. The room was clean and modern with a splendid view of the city. We initially had some difficulty getting the room we booked despite giving plenty of notice, in the end to get the King bed (which is more like a queen size in the western classification) we were eventually upgraded. The gym and pool are quite good, just brief yourself on Japanese hyper-cleanliness etiquette before hand to avoid embarrassment! We had one breakfast at the hotel which was good, no poached eggs at the egg station but they are more than happy to have some made in the kitchen. We didn't try anything else as we had a long list of establisments to visit. The concierges were very helpful printing maps etc but unfortunately could not narrow down the exact locations of several restaurants. While I realise there are thousands of restaurants in Tokyo, not so many have three Michelin stars.

Good toiletries provided.Bathroom small, but very well appointed. The toilet was a modern Japanese one with the bidet function. Also the mirror had a heated centre which didn't fog up, and was necessary with 4 showers in the morning and not a lot of ventilation.Air conditioning was useful, and very quiet.The toiletries and extras that are provided daily are very good quality and should provide you with everything you might need in that area.There is a TV and DVD player, but tourist don't really get the chance, other than a quick laugh at some Japanase TV antics.The lighting in the room is well though out and will accommodate a number of scenarios.Free bottled water every day again a nice touch.Beds were comfortable, even the pop ups.Shower over the bath was ok, maybe missing a little pressure or different setting as a luxury.Tea and coffee facilities were great - the little pod coffee machine made pretty good coffee.Check in and out we're easy, and all staff encountered were friendly, polite and helpful.Most spoke a little English, which was greatly appreciated.The concierges were real winners, with excellent knowledge and suggestions for things to do, places to shop and eat.The free shuttle to Shinjuku Station was a great, easy way to start the day.I'd love to stay here again...If you stay, sign up with HHonour for additional benefits.Only negative for us was the rigmarole to have a swim. It's only a small laned pool, but I love having a swim at the hotel after a long day's adventure.

From Shinjuku station you can get anywhere! I heard there is also a subway station very nearby the hotel, but we did not avail of it. We only had two short days, so hopped the train and subways to try and cover as much as Tokyo as we could, so we did not take advantage of being in Shinjuku. Right near the hotel you have the Metropolitan government building with a free observation deck (I heard it is nice) and there are some interesting areas surrounding the train station (red light district - we didn't have time to see it). We stayed in an executive room. It was marvelous. The perfect place to come back to after a long day of sightseeing. The view from the lounge was of the entire urban area. We took our breakfast in the lobby buffet, which was very diverse and clean. You can eat at the lounge but it has less options (but also less hectic). They offer soft drinks all day and delicious appetizers and quite a bit of alcohol for happy hour. I understand they have also have afternoon tea. Lounge also has free wi-fi. To Narita we ended up taking the shuttle bus not the Narita express, because Shinjuku station is huge and we didn't want to lug our suitcases around. Here the bus picks you up at the hotel, it is much more convenient.","Irvine, California",35,5.0

On arrival on 28 th April we were advised the room I had confirmed was not available and had been given to other guests. Initially we were not given an apology or other options until we then had to log onto Wi-Fi to show email that we had in fact had written confirmation. I was travelling with family from Australia and this really was upsetting. I have never had a hotel confirm in writing that an disabled access room will be provided and then it is not provided. Unfortunately this overshadowed our stay and the subsequent attempts made by staff ( once we insisted that no in fact I can't walk, use a bath over a shower etc) to make up for this major issue, ie provision of shower chair etc. I did raise this issue with the front desk, however on check out my husband was not asked about our stay. I am happy to be contacted by management to discuss further as Im not confident that I could book with hilton hotels again.

Main area's, hallways and elevators look like the have just been redone. The standard rooms could do with an upgrade though; especially the bathroom (however well-maintained) was a bit outdated, and the furniture shows a few years of experience through scuffmarks. The traditional Japanese yukata's in the room instead of standard bath robes are a nice touch.For me, this stay was a special occasion since it was my birthday! My girlfriend arranged a sweet in-room breakfast to which the Hilton did not only add complimentary mimosa's, but also two nice pairs of chopsticks and a beautiful love story giving special meaning to them. Besides al this, they gave us a larger version of their standard room on a high floor looking out over the Shinjuku district sky scrapers. Thanks, Hilton Tokyo!!The hotel is a short 10 minute walk from the big Shinjuku JR station but you can also take the M subway line even quicker from Nishisjinjuku via the underground tunnel from the hotel to the station.I think the Hilton is a very good choice for a stay in Tokyo and I would surely consider staying here again.

The bar was adjacent to the breakfast area and is used as an overflow for diners. I was not prepared to eat in an area that still smelled terribly of smoke from the night before (stale!!!) so I had to wait for a suitable table in the main area.

We couldn't check-in as it was too early and were asked to come back as late as possible to make it easier for them. I didn't know that the advertised check-in time in Japan is stuck to - they will not allow you to check in early so this is something to bear in mind if you are on a early arrival flight.

It was a great size for a Japanese room and the bathroom was a good size as well. Everything was so clean and there are plenty of toiletries provided in case you need anything. The bed was so comfortable and very big - the bedding was great quality and we had 3 wonderful nights of sleep after long days of sightseeing. There is also plenty of room for storing bigger suitcases and clothes if you are there on a longer trip which was handy so you were not tripping over things like you can in smaller Japanese hotels. The shower was quite powerful and plenty of towels were provided each day. The wi-fi is not free at this hotel but there is a free business centre with plenty of Mac's which you can use just off from the lobby. It also has a little seating and table area which can be handy to use when you first arrive as the lobby is always busy with little seating available.The hotel does offer a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station which we did catch on our first day there but it was full each time we saw it depart so we just used to walk the 10 minutes there instead of waiting for it.

With this taken into consideration, I was surprised at how unhelpful the concierge was in helping us out. Take, for example, their helping with our trip to check out Sumo practice. They had no connections with any tour companies that could assure a spot at a stable from which to watch the practice. They did, however, have a map they assured us we could use to find our own and sit in on practices. So we dutifully showed up in the neighborhood a few days later, map in hand, eager to see things. Turns out the map is completely outdated. Over an hour of frenetic searching and help from local Japanese, who also couldn’t understand the poorly labeled map, we gave up. Wasted a precious morning.What's strange is that such sub-standard concierge assistance could persist. I’m sure these guys get requests for tourist help all the time. Perhaps most than any country I’ve ever been to, it would in principle be *very* helpful to have a skilled concierge that could help you navigate the confusing local Japanese system. Yet these guys can’t help you book train tickets, make tour bookings, or buy a local SIM like I could from a comparably nice hotel in, say, Hong Kong.

Especially the newly designed Executive rooms are outstanding. And the staff is absolutely excellent and always very friendly.This time stayed in a Deluxe category room, which is not as modern as the Exec rooms but still very well appointed and comfortable. Good size with ample opportunity also to work on the large glass workdesk.I do however have one observation that slightly reduces my opinion about this hotel. There appear to be more and more large tourist groups which make the hotel loose some of its appeal. Not only because of the crowded feel in the lobby and at breakfast, but also because of the behaviour of some of these groups.(Maybe Hilton has acquired Nikko Tokyo in the Odaiba area to have that become more of a tourist offering and allow the Hilton in Shinjuku to again became a primary business location.)The tourists groups may also be the reason behind the impression that the breakfast in main restaurant (Lobby) seems to have less variety / class, and the breakfast offering in the Exec Lounge has been upgraded.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands",33,4.0

The first time was for three nights immediately after arriving at Narita. A Limousine bus takes you directly from the airport (where you buy your ticket) right to the front door. Couldn't be easier! This is a modern hotel with excellent professional staff who manage to keep things moving swiftly and with ease no matter how crowded it appears to be. My room was on the 38th floor with fantastic views of the city. It had everything one would expect from a hotel of this caliber (a wonderfully comfortable bed & pillows, good linens, nice bathroom products) but also some much appreciated extra touches such as a coffee machine, sleepwear, slippers and a makeup mirror in the bathroom. However, there are a couple of things I think they could improve upon, one being the lighting. I found it very dim. And the other would be the wifi. It dropped out constantly AND they charge you for it's use when you are using it from your room! I think this is unreasonable in a world class hotel - and the fact that it didn't work well at that. They did deduct one 24 hour period from my bill when it barely worked at all, but still, this really isn't good enough. I didn't have breakfast there but there is a wonderful chocolate/pastry shop in the lobby where one can buy a nice croissant or muffin to have with your coffee. There is a free shuttle bus which runs between the hotel and Shinjuku Station regularly and from there one can take advantage of Tokyo's fabulous (and cheap) public transport system. I returned to the Hilton Tokyo for one last night before flying out. Although my room was the same price as my previous visit, I was a little surprised to find it was significantly smaller (not a huge problem) and that it didn't have a window! Since I was only there for one night I didn't complain, but I would advise anybody booking to insist upon a room with a window - and hopefully a great view.","Melbourne, Australia",33,4.0

Thus, this time we stayed at the Hilton Tokyo to celebrate our anniversary. Encountered some problems at check-in and checkout but I think the root of the problem was the Hilton USA reservation system and not the hotel.From the moment you walk into the hotel, I knew we chose the right hotel. The smell, décor and hotel staff smiles said it all. Stayed in the Executive King and this was just what we were looking for more space, more comfort, and much bigger than those typical hotels in Japan. As a Hilton Honors Gold member, we had access to the regular Honors lounge, the exclusive Gold & Diamond Honors lounge as well as free breakfast at the wonderful buffet. We do not drink alcohol but in the evening wines and spirits were complimentary. The hors d'oeuvres were great! I have read other reviews stating the hotel was old, hotel staffs were rude, or it was inconvenient to the JR station. I saw none of this. I feel the Hilton Tokyo was nicer than any Hilton I stayed at. The staffs were not only just professional & polite; they were very sincere in wanting to help make your stay a great experience. The hotel offered a bus shuttle to/from the JR station every 20 minutes and the airport limo stopped right at the hotel.During our stay, Mr. Tamura, Guest Relations Manager could be seen everywhere in the hotel greeting us and other guests and making sure that everyone was enjoying their stay. I could go on & on how wonderful our stay was or elaborate about the fruits and champagne apology gift but I won’t. Instead, I will mention one thing that made our hotel stay experience go from wonderful to AWESOME. As mentioned, I had a problem at checkout. The hotel could have done nothing AFTER I checked out since after all, I may never return to the hotel again. To my surprise, I received an email from the Director of Operations, Mr. Cook who asked how my stay was and informed me the problem I had at checkout was corrected and that I would be receiving a refund.All I can say, Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku is the hotel we will be staying at in all future trips to Tokyo!!!","Honolulu, Hawaii",4,5.0

The toilet in my opinion was a bit small but I guess that was the design of the hotel. The Shower/Tub had a powerful shower though the angle of the shower a bit off as I prefer the shower to rain. Nevertheless, It had pressure which is most important.The executive lounge upstairs was good for cocktail time and breakfast. With its freshly squeezed orange juice to their hot food, everything was good. Of course, it was busy upstairs and the staff was trying their best to manage/clean as much as they could.Not sure whether the hotel provided a turn down service in the evening but it surely would enhance the experience of guest.Service in general was good.

The room was very quiet and could be made very dark (important for those recovering from jet lag).The hotel has an indoor pool and, as far as hotels go, an excellent gym with a variety of cardio equipment as well as a free weight bench, medicine balls and weight machines. I would definitely recommend upgrading to a room with ""Executive"" benefits as this gives you access to the Executive Lounge, meaning you can drop by whenever during the day for complimentary drinks (soft, tea/coffee, alcoholic) and snacks (mostly fruit), as well as afternoon tea and evening drinks. Breakfast is offered in the lounge as well, although the hotel also allows you to opt to take your ""Executive"" breakfast in the ground-floor restaurant/bar, which is recommended because you then have access to the full breakfast buffet. The buffet is plentiful, offering the usual large-hotel breakfast fare, with staff on hand to make espresso-based drinks and egg-based breakfast items (omlets etc).I chose this hotel based on its location (close to Shinjuku) and because I picked up a good rate in a Hilton promotion. I would stay again and would gladly recommend it to friends.The hotel appears to be a favourite of airline crews and tour groups - so if you are looking for a quiet or boutique hotel experience, the Hilton Tokyo probably isn't for you.

We are leisure travelers who don't mind paying for good service and luxury although we like deals as much as the next person and will try to strike the right balance between cost and benefits. We were originally booked into the Peninsula hotel and were going all out for a luxury experience with Rolls Royce transfer from Narita and the whole nine yards, but as the vacation drew closer we had some money constraints so wanted to cut back on the splurge to some extent. I had seen this hotel from previous research and decided it was good enough given the cost was only about a third.I booked a king jr suite as for whatever reason it was coming up cheaper than a regular king room (bonus) and I chose the non-guaranteed upgrade to executive (space permitting) and when checking in was given the upgrade. The cost for booking in this fashion was quite a bit less than booking executive directly.Ride to the hotel from Narita was done on the busses that proliferate at the airport. Ride was long and interesting but the seats were soooo tiny. Japanese bus seats were just not made for our North American fat butts! Anyway, jet lagged and tired, we had a smooth check-in and went straight to our room to pass out. Room was bigger than we really needed, in fact we never used the couch area at all. Like I said, we only booked the jr suite because it was cheaper for some odd reason. The view was basically of another building. Bed was fine. Bathroom was nice and had the funky wash-your-butt-for-you technology which was fun.We woke stupidly early the next morning and decided to wander the area. We strolled down to Kabukicho which is where lots of the things we wanted to see were located (robot show, cat café, etc..). It was a short 15-20 walk and we easily found the places we were looking for although they were still closed at that hour. Found a Starbucks in the Shinjinku station and had fun watching the trains go by with workers faces smushed up against the glass as they were packed in like sardines. We headed back to the hotel for breakfast (included with the executive upgrade) and thoroughly enjoyed the buffet. It had enough of a variety that I had no complaints. Service for coffee and such seemed prompt. We managed at other times during our stay to utilize the club lounge that came with the executive upgrade and that was a pleasant surprise. While it appeared you could self-serve yourself, there were also wait staff who took drink requests and brought them to you. The view was very nice from there and selection of drinks was more than adequate for our tastes. They had nice snacks as well at times.They had a shuttle to the train station but we just walked to/from as it really wasn't that far.Perhaps the best thing I can say about the hotel happened near the end of our stay. My wife and I had purchased some jewelry while on a tour the previous day in Asakusa (other side of town) at a store that only spoke japanese. We discovered that the jewelry would not be allowed back into our country (Canada) as it was on a prohibited list so we wanted to return it. We explained our dilemma to the concierge and she contacted the store, explained the situation and arranged for us to return the item. She gave the taxi driver instructions on where exactly we needed to go and upon getting to the store the clerk had our refund money ready for us in an envelope which he handed over after examining the item being returned. It was a costly mistake for us as the taxi was expensive but it was far less than the cost of the jewelry and we absolutely could not have pulled off the return of it without the considerable help of the concierge.Sadly the time we wasted on returning the jewelry ate up our last day of sightseeing before we had to scoot off to our cruise ship in Yokohama.I loved Japan so much, I've been itching to go back and we have finally decided to return next year. I wanted to find a nice hotel that was a bit closer to the other areas we haven't seen yet so we could avoid using the trains as they are a bit daunting (at least Shinjuku station was) but after much research I find myself being drawn back to this hotel despite its location being less than ideal for us. Simply the value is just too great. Most of the nice hotels I can find where I'd feel comfortable are very expensive (like $600-$800 a night) whereas this hotel is about half that.When I was there, our friends who were cruising with us stayed at the Shangri'la Hotel (one of those $800/night places) and we went there to meet them one night for supper and I could say that I could tell it was classier for sure. The staff bowed deeper and the service was a notch above too. My friend left her MS medicine on the bus from the airport and she appealed to the concierge there for help. They called the company, located the bag and had it held for pickup, then one of the hotel staff ACCOMPANIED my friend in the taxi to ensure everything went smoothly. That is wow service, and certainly above and beyond what I would reasonably expect any hotel to do. On the other hand this hotel (Hilton) provided adequate and helpful service for my own crisis and I paid $800 less than my friend for the same 2 nights.My upcoming stay will be 3 nights. I could stay at a ""wow, whiz bang service"" place walking distance to the attractions I want to see for $2400 or this ""pretty damn good"" hotel $1200 knowing I'll need to spend a bit on taxi's. For me, I've decided the value of this place is just too good to pass up, plus I know I'll like it.For you other folks out there, reading and researching a place, I'd say that if you're looking at checking out Kabukicho, this is an ideal hotel that has service far above any Hilton, Sheraton, Marriott, etc.. you'd find back in the US or Canada. Wifi worked flawlessly. Food that we had was good. (we didn't use room service this time). Club lounge was the best I've ever had in a hotel (not that I've had many, but I've had some).",Calgary,52,5.0

A complimentary shuttle to Shinjuku station is available if you want to use the JR line. We used it upon arriving from Kyoto, and on times we went sightseeing.The airport limo bus stops at this hotel so instead of taking the Narita express going home (that's what we used when we first arrived in Japan), we asked the hotel to book us for the 9 AM trip.Cons:This is minor but of the 4 hotels we stayed at, this is the only hotel that did not keep the toilet seat warmer on.

In addition, stations leading to the Marunouchi line and Oedo line were within walking distance. Shinjuku is only 30min away from HND airport. I would definitely stay here if flying into HND.Room:The rooms were recently renovated and was well appointed. There is plenty of space, being a suite with good AV appointments. The furniture looked fresh and the style was that of modern Japanese. Notably, the bathrooms were on the smaller side, but this is to be expected of Tokyo. The standard nespresso was also available for use. The TV could be attached to HDMI for guests who are interested in watching videos from their laptop. The in-room wifi is decently fast as well.Executive lounge:The exec lounge serves breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails. The lounge staff are extremely courteous with a good range of alcohol available during cocktail hour. The views from the lounge are also great. This is a good place to relax after a day out. Breakfast at restaurant:Wider range of breakfast items compared to the EL but with comparable quality. Extremely crowded as everyone is having breakfast here. If one was in a rush, the EL would be a preferable place to have breakfast. Items are not especially remarkable.

Very interesting vibe in the lobby with so many different nationalities, flight attendants etc. Concierge offer great quick service. Front desk is very busy but quite often have 6+ staff on at the desk which I rarely see anywhere else. A MUCH faster experience than check in at the Osaka Hilton. Rooms are beautiful, great views. Fitness is great. One of the few hotels that I know of in Japan that do NOT charge a fee to use the sauna, gym, pool. (ALL Starwood hotels in Japan charge $30 or more to use the pool or sauna.) Fitness staff are very personable and friendly. Often hotels in Japan (including American chains) have the fitness WOMEN walking around the men's locker room, baths/sauna etc. amongst all the naked men which can make for a very uncomfortable experience. Hilton Tokyo is one of the few hotels where they respect the privacy and comfort of the guest and only allow male staff to enter the men's locker room/sauna/baths.The club lounge can be VERY crowded and guests are sometimes turned away. They have recently added another room for the diamond and gold members to enjoy the evening cocktails and snacks. Great cocktails, snacks and service.My only complaint about this hotel is that the fitness club has a Golden Key fitness membership for outside/local people (not guests staying at the hotel). A few of these outside members are the rudest Japanese I have ever come across. There are many rules and customs for the Japanese bath and I have witnessed on several occasions JAPANESE (mostly the members) breaking these rules. They are very loud in the relaxation lounge, take 2-3 large towels and 2-3 gowns (what are they going to do with 3 gowns?) from the staff's towel supply locker, they go from the sauna directly to the bath without showering off first (or splashing water on themselves), they wear their swimsuits into the bath, dunk their large towels into the cold plunge bath to use in the sauna, ring their wet towels over the sauna stove/soak the sauna stove with water making it more like a steam room (this is a dry sauna not a wet sauna so I think this is dangerous to do). They also bend over a lot to wash their bums and the water sprays into the baths and onto other guests. A few of these Golden Key members are rude and selfish to other guests as well as to the staff. I think the hotel should limit the Golden Key members time at the gym. For example from 8pm to close only hotel guests staying overnight can use the gym/spa.",Japan,49,5.0

For the marathon it is a great choice since it is very close to the marathon start. Rooms and service are the standard Hilton issued experience. It was a busy time at the hotel and the staff handled it well. Some things that stood out:The concierge staff were extremely professional given the volume of requests during this visit. The hotel shuttle to and from Shinjuku station (used by everyone, not just hotel guests) was convenient (leaves every 20 minutes from the station). A Tokyo metro stop is also attached to the hotel and can be accessed via an underground walkway. Hiltopia - an underground area with shops had a convenience market that was good for getting water and snacks.Service in the Metropolitan grill was top notch with great wine options. In room massage was great, but it is done on the bed which took some accepting. Again the fitness staff was extremely accommodating given the volume of requests for messages after the marathon. They were also kind to switch my coins to paper money at the Front DeskThings that should be addressed:The mold in the window area in the room. I tried two times to grab a drink in the lobby bar/restaurant and both times I was turned away because I didn't have a reservation. They hold a dessert hour in the lobby restaurant that is very popular and always fully booked. Lunch time also seems to be peak time too, I've never experienced this at a Hilton lobby bar/restaurant before-but they should give tips to other locations on how to build demand.Room service menu was very limited- unless my book was missing a page or two. Internet fee was steep, but there is free internet in the lobby-but very few places to sit to try to use it (see note above about lobby bar)I dined twice (one by choice, the other because I was turned away from the lobby restaurant) and they are indeed pricey. They were also popular as well. The area has lots of options for food in the other buildings surrounding the hotel and Shinjuku station can get you to just about anywhere in Tokyo.

My wife and I stayed at this Hilton for 3 nights. I have to say that I do indeed agree with some of the other reviewers in stating that this Hilton is quite busy. Therefore, there are lines to check-in/check-out and breakfast. With that said, it is really no different than most Hiltons in large cities such as Hilton New York and Millenium Hilton in NYC.Breakfast was one of the best I have had in any Hilton hotels. It is a mix of Japanese and Continental breakfast, so a little of something for everyone. I personally enjoyed the Japanese breakfast. After all, I did not go to Tokyo to eat something that can be had everyday. Service was excellent as well, from the front desk to the concierge. Staff was extremely friendly, polite and helpful. Again, better than any other Hilton (or Waldorf) that I have stayed at. Location wise, it is convenient enough for me. There was a shuttle bus to the train station and also a subway stop close to the hotel. With prior research done, I got the Suica pass (pre-paid subway card) and mostly used the subway. It was a life saver as I did not have to figure out how much fare needed to be paid from one stop to another (and the signs were mostly in Japanese). It all depends on what you are looking for. I arrived late on my first night and my wife and I wanted to grab a quick bite. The concierge made an excellent recommendation for a Japanese restaurant (Izakaya style) that was about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The food was excellent and the restaurant was open late (12 am +). All in all, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend this Hilton.

The staff there were extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay, assisting us with all our needs and questions. We were happy with the room and the bed was very comfortable.On our first morning at the Hilton we had breakfast at the huge restaurant in the lobby and did not take to that very much as it was extremely busy and we had a hard time manœuvring back to the table from the buffet with our plates. The choice of food was good but the coffee was on the weak side.We also had, included in our room rate, the option to have breakfast in the Executive Lounge which we tried the next morning. It was a significantly more pleasant affair, away from the hustle and bustle of the hotel lobby and with a great view of Tokyo and Mt Fuji. From six in the evening they also offer free alcoholic drinks/cocktails and light snacks in the same lounge for Executive Floor guests. We started all of our four evenings spent in Tokyo there with great sunset views, charming service and a Gin and Tonic in hand.A special thank you to the concierge service for tracking down an item somebody had dropped off for us without a room number and the wrong name on it.

The bed was ok, if a bit on the hard side.Don't bother with the restaurants in the hotel. We ate at the Chinese one the night we arrived in Tokyo as we were exhausted and just wanted something quick to eat before we went to sleep. The front desk recommended the restaurants in the hotel and the Chinese one was the only one that was even remotely reasonably priced (it was still about $60 pp without alcohol). I don't mind spending money on a good meal but the prices at the restaurants in this hotel were straight up criminal for the quality of food. It really wasn't anything special.The service here was also a little iffy. I am definitely not one of those people who thinks that everyone in a foreign country should speak English but I will say that after two weeks in Japan, it was a bit surprising that the least proficient staff we encountered was at this hotel. We asked to have our bags forwarded to our next hotel in Hakuba (something very commonly done in Japan) and even though we said that there was a similarly named hotel to the one we were staying at in the area and to be sure that the right hotel address was written down (I gave them the correct hotel name and address) they sent our luggage to the wrong hotel. The concierge also told us it may take us two days to get to Nagano which is crazy considering the train ride is 90 minutes on the Shinkansen. I guess he was trying to account for bad weather but even so, you'd think if you're giving travel advice you'd want to be at least somewhat accurate (the weather forecast was fine for the day we were supposed to leave). Lastly, give yourself sufficient time to take the elevator down from your room. Multiple times during our stay the elevators were too full to get on.Overall, I don't think this would be my first choice to stay for my next visit to Tokyo. The location is great but the lapses in service and the issues with the elevators would me think twice about booking them again.",,23,3.0

Our suitcases were taken from us and we were deposited into a lift to the 37th floor to check-in in the executive lounge. Our greeting at the lounge was warm and genuine and we were invited to sit on a sofa during the formalities.Our e-standby upgrade request was honoured and thus room changed from my booked Executive Double to a Junior Executive Suite - and at a very reasonable cost too.It was now 10:00, 4 hours before the earliest check-in, yet to our enormous gratitude we were invited to check into our room immediately. I was aware that a package had been left at the hotel reception for me the previous day, from my Mum, who was a guest at another local hotel. The package was delivered - without any prompting from me - moments after we checked in. We had occasion to visit the Executive lounge several times during our 4 night stay. Each time we were greeted warmly and remembered by the staff (which was appreciated as it avoided us ever having to 'prove' our status by showing the room key sleeve). To me, the above demonstrates perfect attention to detail by the team there. Despite being young and casually dressed (this was a holiday, not business), we were treated equally as well as all other patrons. I cannot speak highly enough of the service provided by the entire Exec lounge staff, absolutely flawless, pre-emptive, and courteous.Our Junior Suite prompted mixed feelings. The space was fantastic, particularly by Tokyo standards, and the decor modern and minimalist. We appreciated the Nespresso machine, iPhone dock and the free wi-fi. Although the wi-fi worked well, I thought it odd that it only allowed us to connect three devices for free, though to the hotels credit, this problem was fixed immediately by a call to guest services who provided me with a complimentary pass-code for more devices (as a couple we carry a mobile phone each, a work mobile each, an ipad each and potentially a laptop each... this is fairly standard I expect, so a limit of three devices is baffling).My constructive feedback on the suite, however, is that the bathroom is shamefully small in a room of that size. To give you an idea of how small I mean, it is no exaggeration to tell you that unless you are rather slim you will not be able to open the shower door if the bathroom door is closed. Once inside the shower cubicle you find it is 'wet room' style. A nice idea, and it looks great, but the determination to squeeze both a bathtub and a shower area in results in a bathtub that is too small to relax in, and a shower whose water flow mostly falls inside the bathtub rather than the shower pan. A really poor design which is frustrating to use and defines the phrase 'style over substance'!Back to the positives, and I'm pleased to say the bed was huge and comfortable, and despite our ultra-last minute room change at check in, our pre-ordered pillow menu requests still reached the new room before we did - kudos to the excellent housekeeping team.Breakfast was very nice. We chose to dine in the Marble lounge each morning so cannot comment on the light breakfast served in the Exec lounge. Although the choice of both Western and Eastern breakfasts was fairly extensive, it did not change at all during our 4 mornings there. What was exciting on morning one became dull by morning 4. The wait staff, whilst lovely, are painfully slow to serve coffee - which I notice has been picked up by previous reviewers - and is perhaps an area for the restaurant management to focus on, and the only English newspaper available is the FT - which is perhaps a tad heavy going whilst on holiday! Besides that, the restaurant itself is beautifully appointed and very comfortable.Overall, this was an excellent experience. We would not hesitate to return, and indeed I am sure we will. With the possible exception of one stern, grumpy egg chef, each and every other staff member we encountered is an absolute credit to the hotel, and made our stay unforgettable for all the right reasons.

We chose the Hilton based upon the many positive reviews from fellow travelers. We were not disappointed. Getting to the hotel was very easy from the Tokyo Hanaeda Airport. There was the airport limousine service that provided route bus transportation to the Shinjuku area hotels. For the price of 1800 yen we had transport fare and a one day pass for the metro system, worth 1000 yen. The airport bus went directly to the Shinjuku bus station area as well as to the front door of the Hilton. We were greeted immediately by the hotel staff who took our bags and escorted us directly to the check in counter. The process was quick and effortless. We arrived in the early morning with regular check in time at 2 pm. They were able to prepare a room early to place our bags a head of check in time, arrange all three rooms on the same floor, and get us oriented to spend some time exploring the Shinjuku area in short order. One of our rooms on the west wing, north facing offered a great view of the city and Mt. Fuji! The hotel also had a regular shuttle that ran to the Keio Plaza hotel area and bus station area, which could also be easily walked to. If you plan to use the shuttle keep in mind it usually filled quickly. The closest Metro station is the Tochomae Station (E 28) for the Marunouchi Line and Oedo Line that was reachable through the underground shopping complex and walkways that network the area. Above ground and underground walkways also connected you to the neighboring Tokyo Metropolitan Government buildings and to the Shinjuku Metro and Japan Rail station. Although it is a little disorienting trying to figure out directions underground and above grounds, all streets and signs were in both Japanese and English and easily navigated. For those using the Metro subway lines, most fares were between 170 to 220 yen getting from here to other points of interest around Tokyo. For those with the Japan Rail Pass, you have access to the Chuo Line, Yamanote, Tokaido, and Tsurumi line that you can use for local travel as easily as the metro line from the Shinjuku Station, which was about a 15 minute walk through the Shinjuku food and shopping neighborhood. Keep in mind that when using your Japan Rail Pass, you enter and exit stations through the staffed booths rather than the automated gates. The hotel was overall in a great area to access the restaurant and shopping areas of Shinjuku. It is walkable to the Shinjuku Gyoen Park about 20 minutes away and near major shopping destinations. They offer a buffet breakfast for 2100 yen and fine dining. The underground shops of Hiltopia had some dining opportunities, but there were many more in the surrounding neighborhood. We did have a nice Indian food meal at the Ashoka Shinjuku which was a nice change from the Japanese cuisine. Overall, we had a very comfortable stay at the Hilton and found it well located for our travel needs.","Pasadena, California",101,5.0

I looked forward to breakfast every morning so I could gorge on well-made Japanese food (although they have American options which are equally good, but of course less exciting). Hilton has recently updated their restaurants - they removed the stuffy French restaurant and added these great restaurants and bars on the 2nd floor that flow into one another. Dark lighting with sleek design create a sexy atmosphere - and the live piano and singer doesn't hurt a bit, either. The cocktail I had was way too sweet and the lobster bisque was disappointing, but the sautéed spinach and meat selection at the Metropolitan Grill was fresh and delicious. Expensive! Great staff, very flexible and aim to please. And all of them I ran across spoke perfect English. I had some issues with my reservation on hotels.com and they removed a penalty at the front desk within a few minutes. Seamless! A train station runs directly under this hotel for added convenience, so if you can manage to find exit C8 from the train station, you will go right up into the lobby of the Hilton. This is an impressive hotel, great for business, vacationing, weddings, anything. We plan to book next year as well. A short walk from Tokyo's Central Park. Go there if you have a chance!

Amazing views to Shinjuku, lots of extras in the room and plenty storage space (We stayed for 5 nights so needed the space!). This hotel is in a great location. There is a good, reliable shuttle service to Shinjuku Station but we just walked through the underground and used the metro to get everywhere (Toei Oedo line). This allowed us to explore Tokyo fully. Had breakfast every morning in the Marble Lounge which was great and set us up for the day. Service was excellent and food of a high quality. We also had dinner one night in the Grill restaurant. Excellent service again and the food was outstanding. Lovely wine selection and cocktails. Really enjoyed our first taste of wagyu beef! Overall a wonderful start to our honeymoon in Japan.

If you get the two day metro subway pass, you can only use the Nishishinjuku station. The rooms are nicely decorated and the beds comfortable. The windows are not double glazed so a mild chill can be felt if the shades are open. The aircon/heater in our room wasn't not that efficient so the room was fairly chilly in the morning and this was December. One great let down is that the rooms do not have free wifi, except only if you are a Gold HHonors member. Most hotel guests can be found using the free wifi in the small lobby area, making the place rather crowded. In this age of connectivity, for a large hotel like Hilton not to provide free wifi in the rooms is very disappointing.

The hotel is large but the service and hospitality is warm and personal. Check-in and check-out can be a little hectic especially for a non-Japanese speaker but that is only because they go to the trouble to match you with an English speaking agent who then takes their time to explain everything you need to know and answer any questions you have about your reservation or the hotel. They don't rush you and are attentive and hospitable--that takes more time and we truly appreciated it.I developed a full blown case of the flu on the flight over from the US and the agent worked with the manager to find us a second room and move my room so that the rooms were next to each other so my daughter would not be subjected to my constant cough. The concierge desk is fully staffed with several agents all of whom are incredibly helpful and patient. They answer every question no matter how small with care and diligence. We really liked them as well, they were upbeat, cheerful, helpful and warm.The hotel also has a pharmacy and a convenience store. There is a metro station connected to the hotel. It is a bit of a walk but you are underground and covered so on the rainy days it really was helpful.The club floor system of this hotel confused me at first and then I LOVED it once I understood how it works.

You are minutes from the Shinjuku station which is very convenient. We never walked it because it is a bit of a hike from the station. They do have a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes or so. If you need to get to the station quick,a taxi was only 730 yen which is under $7 american, so we did use that a few times when we had to get there fast. One BIG recommendation is to have a picture of the name of the hotel in Japanese because the cab drivers do not understand English, so I had the name in my phone and would just show it to them when needed.  It had many shops and restaurants which to be honest we never really went through because we were always on the run We did have the buffet breakfast which was really great, It was a little pricey though, with a discount with the room it was $100.00 for 4 people.. yikes. but it was great. There is a McDonalds and Starbucks about a block away(behind) the hotel. You are only about 2 blocks from the Metropolitan government building too. they have a free observation deck to be able to see the whole city and even Mt. Fuji on a clear day. Also close to other attractions in the area.Beds were some of the best I've stayed in. We have 2 adults and 2 teenage kids. most hotels you need to have two rooms because of the size of the rooms and the single beds. We got an executive king bed and they put in two cots for the kids. I was concerned when I hear the word cots, but they were like small twin beds and very comfortable. They also had all the amenities in the bathroom, including a blow dryer. They also provided pajamas, slippers and bathrobes. Room was very big and very nice. They also had an executive lounge which we didn't use because it didn't come with our room for some reason.One small issue with the bathroom, when you shower, the water goes on the ledge of the bathtub and runs around to a drain so beware, I got my clothes wet the first day. Water does seem to get all over when you shower. Again,, very comfortable beds, and heard absolutely no hallway noise or doors slamming. We are planning another trip because we absolutely loved Japan, and will definitely reserve rooms here again. Also look into the JR pass. It is good on any of the JR trains, some buses and ferries. It can only be bought in America. They also have a Tokyo east pass which is cheaper but doesn't include the bullet train. It allowed us just to show the pass and jump on the trains anywhere we needed to go, including a 4.5 hour trip to Hiroshima on the Bullet train. Japan was really beautiful and clean,, love the people and the culture. I recommend looking on the internet to see where to visit and eat. We did a lot of the local places instead of the touristy places. There are little eateries right behind the Shinjuku station that have tiny alleyways and little eateries inside.(Omoide Yokocho) I originally booked this hotel because it had a pool but we never got to use it, from what I understand there is a surcharge. Also, free internet in the lobby but there is a surcharge in the room. At the hotel they do rent wifi devices that aren't very expensive for the week, then just drop in an envelope at the post office at the airport when ready to leave. We didn't use this because we got there too late, but seemed a good deal instead of paying $$ for internet at the hotel.Concierge was my best friend. lol.. they were so helpful, and so willing to point the way, give maps etc. PS...

The bathroom was also quite small, despite the size of the room itself. Breakfast was great - anything you could think of was readily available, including cappuccinos and lattes. The concierge was very inconsistent. We would ask for restaurant recommendations, get suggestions from one person, and when we returned to confirm a restaurant another person would say they don't recommend that and give us a whole new list of restaurants. So confusing! This continued with other examples (coin laundry, museums, Shinkansen schedule, etc.), and this detracted from our experience because we lost time and were frustrated at times.

Not sure if it's because of the fact that I booked through a third party agent or it's just the norm of this hotel. All in all, it's still the luxurious Hilton hotel that we have always known. Will definitely stay here again the next time I am here. ","Sydney, Australia",6,4.0

It was a great stay. Had a room upgrade via Hilton Hhonors hence had access to the lounge. Internet was also bundled in. Otherwise I would be rather irritated to have to pay for internet in the room so might want to take note of this if access is important.The hotel is located between two metro lines. I used mainly the metros and the free shuttle (love the shuttle) It is not as punctual as transport usually is in Japan but it does not bother me. The travellators that lead to the metro station are not in operation. I am not sure if its this way all year round. So although the hotel is not located right in the hub of touristy things, it is easy to get to Shinjuku or any other part of central Tokyo.The room itself was great. Beds were comfortable. They were also generous with toiletries. Lastly I wish to lavish great praise on their concierge service. They helped with restaurant reservations/directions and could speak impeccable english. In fact you can email them for assistance from the time you confirm your reservation for all your needs and requests.Also the hotel drop off is one of the stops for the airport limo bus from Haneda and Narita which makes it very convenient. A very good stay. Will be heading back again next week for a shorter stay. Looking forward.","Singapore, Singapore",18,5.0

I would say it's over-priced for what you get, especially since everything has an extra charge, e.g. wi-fi and water, so only book if you get a good deal.

We were also able to borrow DVDs to watch in our room through our access to this lounge. We were so pleased that we had upgraded. The staff were so helpful and even booked a Karaoke for us and wrote down the details in Japanese for us to hand in when we arrived there. We preferred breakfast in here to the restaurant. The location was ideal for public transport with a metro station under the hotel. The hotel provided a bus every 20 minutes to Shinjuku station which was just over a 5 minute journey.

When hotel rates for both hotels are close, we prefer the Conrad. However, we booked the Hilton Shinjuku for the first time this year. It was a lovely experience to be back as we were made to feel vey welcomed by the staff, especially Mr. Yota Ogura, the front desk manager. He went out of his way to make our stay a memorable one. We had called ahead to request an extra bed for our daughter. He was most thoughtful and kind in offering us a different suite from the one we had booked so she could have some privacy as the doors to the living area could be closed. This was truly appreciated as she was ill with the flu upon arrival to Tokyo and could spend the next two days sleeping in,undisturbed by us.The staff provided superlative assistance with directions, restaurant reservations and a last minute forwarding of a parcel to our next destination in Japan. Without the help of the concierge, we could not have managed to address,pack and tape up a box and pay for the postage given the time constraint we had ( 20 mins).There is a direct airport limousine bus to the Hilton immediately outside the Narita arrival area. I would recommend this service outside of rush hour only as it once took us 3 hours to get to the hotel. For this trip, as we arrived at 5pm, we took the Narita Express train directly to Shinjuku( 1hr 15 mins ), walked about 5 mins to the West exit to Keio department store where we caught the Hilton transfer bus to the hotel ( about 1 hr 45 mins ). The train system is quite a complicated experience for first timers. The bus is a whole lot simpler.The only negative comment about the Hilton Shinjuku is that the executive lounge is always very full and would require a wait time to get a table.","Beverly Hills, California",26,4.0

Hotel staff apologized with a small gift. Considering the price of the room, in-room WIFI us not free. WIFI is complimentary at the lobby but connection was not the best. Go to a Starbucks across the street if you need to use the internet. Gym was small and amenities were basic. If you want to use it early in the morning, don't bother going (it can get crowded). If you need to use the bathroom at the locker room, you are required to take off your shoes wear slippers. The hotel should look at this again because of the inconvenience.If it's raining and forgot your umbrella, the concierge will be happy to lend you one (just leave your card key).","Washington DC, District of Columbia",102,5.0

The room was large and comfortable for the length of stay. We had a great view of Tokyo and could see Mt Fuji on a clear day! The executive lounge was awesome and, because we were travelling with kids, it was nice to have snacks available pretty much all day.The staff were amazing and helped us with everything from finding medication to finding a laundromat. All staff spoke English which is pretty amazing and something we didn't encounter at any of the other hotels we stayed at (except for Hilton Tokyo Bay). The poor concierge desk were kept busy just writing things down in Japanese for us so we could get directions if we needed. They also arranged for our luggage to be forwarded to Hilton Tokyo Bay on our departure so that we didn't have to lug it to Kyoto and back. The shuttle bus was great and made getting to and from the station really easy.The hotel has a small shopping centre underneath with a 24 hour convenience store and an international ATM. There are plenty of grocery stores, a pharmacy and food outlets within easy walking distance. Denny's is across the road, Starbucks a 3 minute walk and McDonald's a 5 minute walk (handy for fussy eaters).I would highly recommend this hotel for families, leisure and business travellers.

As my wife is a member of Hilton chain, the lady manager gave us a free upgrade to an executive room. The executive room is not particular large but is quite comfortable in size.

Both stations could be reached by underground passage so that you won’t get lost on the street. However, the two lines are operated by two separate companies. If you want to buy a 1- to 3- days subway tickets, you should buy Tokyo Subway Ticket. Do not buy the cheaper Tokyo Metro Open Ticket, as it is only valid for the Tokyo Metro Lines and not valid for Toei Lines. The underground passage does not bi-directional escalators, however.

If you are arriving late and miss the airport limousine bus service to Hilton Tokyo you can always take the bus going to Hyatt. The hotels are right across from each other. I would suggest taking this if you want to save a little bit of money. It cost approximately Canadian $13 per person. Street taxi will cost you about $300. Hotel taxi about $100. The breakfast in the marble lounge was great. Had smoked salmon every morning. There is a variety of ethnic food. Tea time was great a lot of different snacks.

Arrived after my red-eye flight from Hong Kong early in the morning and was checked-in promptly by very friendly Ms Kato at the front desk. Was promptly upgraded to an Executive room that has been refurbished and although the room is not ready for another 2-3 hours, we were welcomed to utilise the executive lounge until the room was ready. Breakfast on offer at the executive lounge and the hotel restaurant were of exceptionally great quality. Only downside was when we were trying to access the executive lounge on the Sunday evening for drinks and canapés - arrived at the lounge but was advised that the lounge is overcrowded with a waiting list of over 12 tables before we will be called! At this point we did not think it was worth the wait and decided not to proceed. While this was disappointing, it was fine for us as we were provided the benefit as part of the Hilton Gold status. Should I have paid for an executive room and not being able to access the lounge this would have been extremely annoying, and this seem to be what the hotel would need to work on.Rooms at oversized for Tokyo standards and is well appointed and furnished.

We did manage to find time to get a foot massage which I can't recommend enough after walking around Tokyo all day. A word of warning though, if you don't like your massages firm and I mean really FIRM then make sure you tell the therapist. Don't get me wrong my feet felt brilliant afterwards but at times it was quite uncomfortable whilst she worked out the knots! Still well worth it and again the therapists were all really lovely.In short, I couldn't recommend this hotel enough.It is also worth noting that the location was perfect as it had excellent links to Shinjuku station with a regular free bus running from the hotel.

My wife and I stayed at this property for 3 nights, 4 days at the end of September. We had booked an advanced reservation for 2 nights, 3 days initially, but we ended up extending our stay which required an additional reservation for the extra night. For both reservations, we chose to put in requests for eStandby upgrades, which some of the readers might be familiar with. In any case, when we arrived at the hotel for check-in, we were informed that we had been upgraded from our King Jr. Executive suite to the King Tower Suite. So far so good. So when we asked about how the Executive lounge and free Wi-Fi worked, we were told that this was not an Executive level package. I asked the gentleman to re-check the reservation as I was certain that we had booked an Executive level suite. He did so, but again re-stated that this was not an Executive suite. At this point, I said that we were going to decline the room upgrade in that case and go with our original reservation, which I knew to be Executive-level. He said that, unfortunately, there were no rooms available for our original reservation and that we would have to take the ""upgraded"" room. No mention was ever made about the fact that I had chosen numerous eStandby upgrades but was never given the choice of any. At this point, I was feeling fatigued from a long Shinkansen ride from Kyoto and I didn't have the strength to argue any further (plus it seemed like a very inappropriate thing to do in Japan), plus I wanted to double-check my reservation details privately to ensure that I hadn't made a mistake. They did offer me a slight discount on Wi-Fi and breakfast that I reluctantly took. Once we got to the suite, I found myself quite impressed with it despite being rather upset about check-in. So I immediately setup my laptop and starting looking into what had happened with my reservation. Strangely, when I looked up my original reservation, I could only see the confirmation number but it would not allow me to view the details of the reservation (I had done so numerous times in the past without problem which is why it was so strange); the details of the second reservation came up fine though. After reviewing what I could, I was no closer to an answer than when I started, so I found myself looking at the desk which had a generalized letter welcoming us to the Hilton and at the end of the letter it stated to contact them about any issues that might make our trip better. At this point, I realized that this was going to be a sour part of our trip unless I spoke out about it, plus I remembered reading replies from the hotel on this very message board where they stated that they wished people would've contacted them about issues when they still had a chance to make it right for them. So I wrote up a relatively long email explaining the issues I had encountered at check-in and just decided to leave it in their hands while we went out to run some errands.Once we returned, we noticed a letter under the door. As we took it into the room, we further noticed a fruit arrangement on the table as well. The letter was the welcome letter to the Executive level that we assumed each member receives at check-in. No other messages were left, so I figured that they had replied to my e-mail. Sure enough, when I booted up my laptop, I had a lengthy response from the Reception Manager. He deeply apologized for the issues we encountered at check-in and assured us that this was not representative of the service normally offered by the Hilton. He further stated that he had pulled our records for eStandby and found that of the 3 requested upgrades we selected, 2 of them were for Executive level, and the one that was not, was the one that was given to us. Apparently, this was incorrect as alternatives should have been made available to us, but weren't. In any case, the hotel waived the room upgrade charges for the remaining days, cleared the bill of breakfast/Wi-Fi charges as we were Executive now, and offered us discounts on hotel services such as laundry. We were in awe of such service as nothing like this has EVER been offered to us in the past at any hotel chain. 2 nights later, the hotel also formally recognized my wife's birthday with some goodies that were a total surprise.No one likes to have issues with checking into a hotel; however, I am sure glad that I spoke up about it because I truly believe that the Hilton Tokyo hotel more than made up for the issues we encountered. Even before we checked into the hotel, we were already experiencing their wonderful hospitality thanks to a member of their Concierge team by the name of Ayako Nakamura. Nakamura-san had arranged for some professional photos that we took in Kyoto to be shipped to the hotel and then later forwarded to our US address when it was discovered that the photo studio could not ship the finished hardcover book to the US directly. This kind of customer service was inspiring and served as a reminder just how different hotels in the US are compared to those in Japan, where people bend over backwards to help out complete strangers everyday. Finally, I must thank Mr. Fan and Mr. Ogura for helping us work through our issues and providing us with an experience that we are still frankly in awe of. We feel as though we made friends in the both of you and hope to see you during a future visit. For the readers who managed to make it this far, Hilton Tokyo is the real deal. It is a clean, modern hotel that has an amazing staff that is literally waiting to help make your stay better in any way that they can. If you can learn one thing from my experience, I would hope that it is to speak up about issues that the hotel can help you with. Don't just run to TripAdvisor or any other site to bash the hotel, but instead, I would encourage you to give them the opportunity to fix the problem as they did for us. We can't wait to stay at Hilton Tokyo again!","Omaha, Nebraska",15,5.0

This suite was amply spacious, beautifully renovated. Also an absolutely fantastic room, despite having no cold water pressure at all.

Stayed in an executive junior suite, apparently newly refurbished.Overall, it's hard to fault this hotel as far as big chains go - this is a place for airline crews (SQ, LH, etc stay here), large groups of tourists and as a good location for a low cost leisure stay in Tokyo – Shinjuku has many points of interest in itself. Rates are very low and there seem to be a lot of promos. To be fair, my overall rating of the property reflects this reality and not the comments below (which would score one or two points less).Without status however, this is not a welcoming property - it seems Hilton has taken loyalty to its limits, as, if anything, it now acts as a barrier of entry to non-HHonors guests - pretty stupid if you ask me. First time in ages I had to pay for Wifi (JPY1700/day) and denied checking out one hour later than standard as next guest ""had status and was entitled to check-in at exactly 2pm"" (would she?). Considering some guests don't mind paying for larger suites or better rooms, there is absolutely no reason to stay here without status since you will be treated worse than anyone with a Gold card - which are ubiquitous it seems thanks to countless tie-ins with credit cards or other promos... The room itself is wholly uninspiring and looks very dated already - seem to have been assembled through a knock-off catalogue of bad Italian design - the only Japanese detail (and original from way back) are the rice paper sliding shutters - bathroom is tiny and reminiscent of the one in the Novotel Wanchai I had to stay in during a typhoon in Hong Kong. Very cheap amenities too - made in China toiletries, cheap/thin paper products and incredibly poor towels... considering this is likely to be your first tactile experience of the room it immediately creates a poor impression - you know there are cost-savings at every turn. There are some bad design choices too - a single multi-plug electric outlet by the desk is located in a box and under the glass table - very hard to access especially if using a larger three-point plug... Breakfast which I was looking forward to, was awful, with overall, poor quality items. I was also admonished for picking a quieter table in the zoo of breakfast with a comment that it had to be vacated before 11am (at 9am... why would anyone spend 2 hours with such a disappointing spread is anyone's guess). So there you have it – decent and dare I say convenient for a low cost stay, this property has made it pointless to book there for non-status guests looking for a better room / experience... why keep being reminded of what you’re not receiving when it’s clear that so many of these so-called benefits are standard elsewhere… makes no sense.I’ve long got bored with chasing miles and points, after a few fun years with Randy and the original flyertalk crew, and as a former HH Diamond/ SPG Platinum/etc it strikes me that confusing loyalty management for true hospitality is probably a pretty bad long term mistake.","Singapore, Singapore",269,3.0

Neither was a problem for the concierge (unfortunately I do not remember his name) who gladly took the time to research and write everything down. The only negative experience was at the bar at night. Having ordered drinks and sitting at our table, I noticed I had to plug in my smart phone and proceeded to use a plug at the end of the bar where no one was sitting. The manager in charge rushed up to me enquiring 'Can I help you' - seeing I was just plugging in my phone, I took that to mean I needed to ask for his personal permission before deigning to use 'his' plug' It was a rather bizarre situation and I did complain to the Assistant Manager the next day who apologized. But we never went back there so Hilton lost a bit of business from us because of that (had I been Assistant Manager I would have offered 2 drinks on the house the next evening).

There is a shuttle from the bus to the station but if you are a walker it is better not to wait. We figured out a short cut going diagonally across the street to the lobby of the highrise (the one with the Willer Express buses in front of it), then down the escalator and left, out the door and straight to the station. Also nice for a blast of AC when walking in the summer heat and humidity. Overall a very good experience.","Cape Town Central, South Africa",204,4.0

I am a Hilton Diamond member, and have stayed and a number of very nice properties throughout the world. I can say that the service at the Hilton Tokyo is the best I have experienced.For example, prior to visiting Tokyo I was working in Vietnam and didn't have time to plan my activities in advance. I really wanted to see a Sumo Wrestling Match as well as a Japanese Baseball Game. I called the concierge to see if they could assist me. I worked with Ayako, who was incredibly helpful. She informed me that there while there were no Sumo matches in Tokyo the weekend I was in town, there were a couple of events that I could attend outside of Tokyo. She then provided all of the details for me (train tickets, cost of event, directions, etc). When I arrived at the hotel, not only did I have all of this information, but she even went so far as to include questions/directions in Japanese for me to hand to someone in either the train or taxi to make my journey easier. I thought this went above and beyond anything I had expected. Thanks to Ayoko and team, I was able to attend the Sumo match and saw everything I wanted to see in Tokyo.Aside from the fantastic concierge service, I would rate the overall hotel at 4 out of 5. It is very nice. It is located right near the subway lines, and all points of the city are easily accessible. Diamond Members will receive an upgraded room, access to the Executive Floor and free buffet breakfasts each day. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Tokyo.",,11,4.0

When we first walked in their you could tell straight away that it lacked personality and was for those who just want to get in and out and have more money than they need. I never expect much but I actually felt uncomfortable in this hotel. I think it was because we were dressed in casual clothing. I requested an early check in at the desk and was told we could go in 2 hours earlier if we paid for a room that was 80,000 Yen more expensive, fair enough we couldn't get an early check in but that was a bit step.With WiFi in the room, there was an option for free WiFi at slow speeds or faster speeds for a cost. The slow speed that was advertised is what I was used to in Australia, with our slow internet. The internet barely worked, kept dropping out and was frustrating. Also what was weird was that I then couldn't pay for the faster internet after I discovered how poor the connection was.The room was not that great (I had just come from the capsule hotel as well), it was nice but not for the prices that they advertise. The most helpful info I can give anyone that read this is that there is a shuttle bus to Narita Airport from the hotel, I paid about 36AUD I think it was about 3600 Yen. That was really convenient, although triple check and I MEAN TRIPLE check where and when the bus will arrive, because the staff may not be able to answer so well with the language barrier. I always appreciate the fact that they speak this second language for our convenience but please give the right answer (I don't want to sound mean but it was seriously a close call missing the bus which would have resulted in a missed flight, I'm so glad I stuck with my gut feeling and asked a third person)","Ourimbah, Australia",6,3.0

At check-in, we were offered early-check in at 11am and our 3 rooms on Level 34 provided us amazing view of Shinjuku and Tokyo as a whole. We also got discounted price for breakfast buffets because of our long stay at the hotel by the friendly receptionist.Location-wise, it's located at the safer and quieter side of Shinjuku but the hotel provides a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku Station which stop in front of Keio Department Store (bus stop number 21) and this is really convenient for guests. If you prefer, you can also walk from the hotel to the hipper and louder side of Shinjuku which is only like 10 mins walk away.Because it's summer and it's tremendously hot in Tokyo, the hotel even provided guests with free flavoured shaved ice at the hotel's lobby and hired a friendly guy to provide cute balloons to the kids. This is especially appealing to us because we had a 3 year-old with us who enjoyed this so much!The concierge has a complete file of attractions in Tokyo and even if they don't (which is quite rare because they knew basically everything), they'll try their hardest to assist you.Some really minor issues:1) The rooms were cleaned quite late in the evening. On some days, the rooms weren't cleaned even at 5pm and we called to enquire about it. It wouldn't be a problem if you come back later in the evening but if you stay indoors most times, this may be a bit of problem. Good point: when they clean your rooms, they really clean them throughout. I thought their works were good :)2) We were told that it was the school holidays when we went hence MAYBE that's why the hotel was so packed throughout our stay. At breakfast, there were long queues before we got seated so there was always that battle of patience every morning. Bonus point: wholesome Asian breakfast!!3) We had a baby with us and he was cranky all night and I got some rude guests to shout at us to ask the baby to ""shut up"". HOWEVER, we were pleased that when we called the guest relation office, they quickly came up and helped to sort it out somehow (I don't know how) and we never heard from that rude white person again.Overall, the staff were really attentive. They are well-staffed at the lobby area but maybe Hilton could do better in terms of house-keeping. 5 star stay. I would come back to stay here on my next visit!","London, United Kingdom",32,5.0

I have diamond status so they gave us free internet, which is fast (although we have to sign up every day, which is annoying), free breakfast, and access to the executive lounge. Breakfast was a large buffet with EXACTLY the same food every day. The omelet chefs were fantastic. The chocolate chip muffins were quite good, although often they were stored in the same cabinet as the banana bread, which made them taste like banana bread. Everything else was pretty mediocre. The sausage was hot dogs and the bacon was crap. The executive lounge suffers from the same malaise as the breakfast buffet - same mediocre stuff all the time. It is depressing to go in every night and see chicken nuggets with ketchup (sometimes called ""BBQ sauce""). It's fine if you want to serve the same chicken nuggets, fried veg, samosas every night, but just offer some Thai chili sauce to go with it and people will be happy. Better yet, take a page from the recipe book of the Hilton on the Park Melbourne (or any of the Hiltons in Victoria, New South Wales, or South Australia), which has consistently excellent offerings in the executive lounge. The room was fairly small, but we were traveling with a pet, and I believe they have certain rooms set aside for people with pets, so I wasn't expecting an upgrade. The fitness center was very nice - plenty of cardio equipment and just enough weights. In general the staff were friendly and helpful. The location was great, and in case you're here in the rainy season there is a tunnel that leads from the lobby to Tochomae metro station. This was very convenient. In general a mostly positive experience, I just wish they would have gotten the food right.","Melbourne, Australia",117,4.0

The bathroom was not too large either, but everything worked nicely. The bar in the lobby is a real life-saver at night, and the concierge has been quite helpful in providing a power adapter (do NOT think of traveling through Japan with a professional adapter with the central safety plug, almost no plug in Japan has the right socket for that!).The one thing that was a bit annoying was the WiFi: the sign-in only worked with Internet Explorer and as a matter of fact I find unacceptable that hotel WiFi is charged, it is such a commodity that it should be included in the room rate. Moreover, the staff at the reception didn't immediately figure out I was a Gold member and did not immediately offer a room upgrade.Overall though, I would definitely stay at the Hilton again, highly recommended!","Milan, Italy",122,4.0

Very nice breakfast spread in the main lobby dining room and very good service as in many places in Tokyo. Lounge food also very nice, not the full more comprehensive spreads of the Conrad near the tsukiji market (or Conrad HGK) but still very nice. A few key points for this hotel:- Access to the subway system (Shinjuku station) directly from the hotel or a walk from outside if you would like - about 15-20 min. fast walking to subway station (I did not time myself but that is my guess - whatever the case relatively short walk)- Nice breakfast- Compact, simple, clean and modern rooms, quiet a/c- Lounge staff and dining room staff all very helpfull and pleasant  (I had no specific issues or requests)- approx. 37 floors , kind of a semi-circle shaped building- No steam sauna, only dry sauna (the Conrad Tokyo has a stomping good steamroom)- Great location in Tokyo - about 20 minute walk from what i would consider a very happening area in Tokyo yet a quick walk back to the quiet business district where the hotel is located - the immediate blocks around the hotel are primarily office towers.Only stayed here and the Conrad in Tokyo, both great, Conrad complete different area.

The restaurants on the second floor were closed due to renovations, so the only restaurant we ate in was the Marble lounge. The food was nice but expensive. Luckily there are several decent restaurants in the area that we enjoyed for less than half the price that we paid at the hotel.

All of the staff, from the young lady who greeted us at the door, to the front desk clerks, buffet staff, bell staff, and concierge -- were unfailingly gracious and helpful. Most are well-versed in English, too. The Shinjuku location is convenient for excursions throughout the Tokyo area, and the hotel's shuttle bus will take you directly to the Shinjuku rail station for those trips which would be inconvenient if you're trying to start at the nearby West Shinjuku metro station. The breakfast buffet has a wide variety of dishes aimed to please both Japanese and Western customers. We tried some Japanese options to widen our culinary experience. The rooms are thoughtfully arranged, clean, and very comfortable. The HVAC unit is easy to operate and is whisper-quiet. I appreciated the reading lights by the bed so I can read in the early hours without waking my traveling companions. We also appreciate the refrigerators, so we can store cold drinks and leftovers (we just temporarily removed the hotel's bottles that were originally in the fridge).The concierge helped us arrange a trip to Mt. Fuji. We also learned that if you need an umbrella, you can borrow one for free from the concierge desk.I have only two suggestions to make this a perfect property:(1) Unlike most hotel lobbies, there is very little seating available in the lobby at the Hilton Tokyo. Nor is there any seating whatsoever in the vestibule or outside in front of the hotel. What seating is available in the lobby is not close to the doors, so it is difficult to see if your transportation or your tour guide has arrived. More seating, and more conveniently located, would be helpful.(2) Although there were electrical outlets at the desk in our room, there were none by the beds. Travelers want electrical outlets by the beds so we can use our laptops and tablets while their batteries are recharging. However, these are relatively minor quibbles, so I gave the Hilton a five-star rating.","Perry Hall, Maryland",33,5.0

The toilet of course has no shower, just the safety hazard bathtub which i dislike very much. There was also no complimentary water provided, so i had to buy my own. But on the 4th day of my stay, suddenly, complimentary bottled water appeared. so i felt cheated after thatOn the day of my arrival, i was also disappointed to find out the hotel room tv has barely any sports channels, and nothing is showing the french tennis open final. Another disappointmentThe gym and pool are smallish, but serviceable. So is the sauna. And like the room, everything just looks worn and old, and all style and design are deadThe breakfast restaurant and spread are ok, but rather odd it seems to be in the lobby coffee lounge. Some people trying to eat on a small coffee table just looks strange. Perhaps it's because they are renovating the entire 2nd floor restaurant complex above, which will re-open in novemberThe in-room dining menu has the tiniest list of options for japanese food, just 2 options - katsu-don and tempura udon.

Both were okI later found out the hotel has an underground link to a Metro station/line (different from the JR line), and there are also sundry shops, barber, medical clinic, and shops selling clothes and stuff.

Thought that was a very nice touch from the establishment until I decided to go and check out the lounge. Upon entry, we were categorically told that we was offered an ""upgrade"" to an executive floor room but not entitled to the benefits! Originally thought it may have been a communication issue at check in but corrected with some attitude from the executive Lounge receptionist that she checked with the person who checked me in and confirmed receptionist studied overseas and therefore English was not an issue. I was told by the Front Desk Supervisor & Assistant Front Office Manager that usually this is not the case but provided no explanation. To add further insult to injury, I was told if I really wanted access to the Executive Lounge, I would need to move from my King room to a Twin room! No big deal about accessing the lounge as being Gold makes it a privilege rather than a right but disappointed of not being told upfront at check in. Ultimately both Front Desk Manager & Assistant Front Officer manager insisted I use the Executive Lounge for the rest of my stay. At that stage I was no longer interested especially if Executive Lounge staff will have some attitude towards residents.I was hoping to meet with the GM on site but to no avail.

Room and service consistent with other Hilton business traveler properties in major international cities. On par with Hilton Paris La Defense, which is high praise indeed.The property sits more or less above the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station, so transit can be accessed without getting out in the weather, but it is a little bit of a hike. The main Shinjuku station is a fairly short walk the other direction, and the underground there is far more entertaining. If you are heading towards the Ginza, that short walk cuts out two stops.The room was business/executive-level, which is a step up from the standard, and seemed to be well worth the difference in cost. The room was moderately spacious, very clean, well-appointed and tastefully decorated.In keeping with the Japanese culture of cleanliness, the in-room shower and toilet facilities were far above the normal expected even for higher-end hotels.The shower and tub are separate but co-located, with water draining on (and into) the floor, which is a little disconcerting for Americans, but quickly overlooked because of the abundant supply of water at just about any temperature desired. Tall people (>6') will have no problems with the shower. The deep tub is shorter than the standard American version, so it's a wash (so to speak) for us tall ones.The toilets are almost a tourist attraction in and of themselves, and verge on needing an instruction manual. Who knew ""personal time"" could be so entertaining?The breakfast buffet was also typical of Hilton international sites, with a very good selection of locally-supplied Western and Japanese fare. The breakfast should be able to satisfy all but those with extreme dietary requirements/prejudices.The staff was always polite and helpful. Common areas were open, airy and, as expected, very clean. There was a high-end custom chocolate and baked goods kiosk distressingly near the main desk and elevators, good enough to cause many to impulsively abandon diets and risk diabetic shock, me included.Overall, a thoroughly excellent property in an equally excellent location.I would definitely stay again.","Athens, Texas",35,5.0

Be sure to arrive at 6pm when happy hour starts to get a table / seat. Staff are helpful in the Lounge. Following 'happy hour' I visited St George's Bar on the lobby level with my iPad to check my emails for the day. Think again - no wifi service in the bar. The beer was good and on my second evening I ordered a mushroom risotto in the bar which was very nice. Staff are helpful.Wifi elsewhere in the hotel and in the room works very well however.On my final evening I sent my shoes for shoe shine at about 10pm requesting they be delivered at 6.30am the following morning as I was booked on the 7.10am shuttle bus to the airport. At 6.20am I attempted to call to have my shoes delivered early as I was ready to go to breakfast - the operator was not answering the phone, neither was housekeeping. 6.30am came and went and still no shoes and no answer from the hotel operator, housekeeping or the help line. At 6.45am I gave up and went barefooted to the Executive Club to check out and have them locate my shoes and have my bags collected from my room. Returning to my room I waited until 7am and niether my shoes had been delivered or my luggage collected. Given the diabolical mess I took my own bags to the lobby - still without shoes and asked for the duty manager. He eventually tracked down my shoes and I got on the shuttle bus with minutes to spare. What an absolute mess and no breakfast either as I had to run around instead of enjoying breakfast before I left the hotel, despite being ready to go to breakfast at 6.20am. The Night Manager brought a coffee for me to the bus and apologized. I have also received an email of apology from housekeeping subsequently.Japanese efficiency has clearly left this hotel. Maybe be better to look at the Hyatt Regency if one is looking for a hotel in Shinjuku.","Singapore, Singapore",532,2.0

Breakfast is served off the lobby in a high ceilinged area that is very pleasant. We took the Breakfast/Dinner package and enjoyed both dinners, one in the Japanese restaurant and a buffet in the Brasserie. After two long excursions, it was a relief not to go out and search for dinner. The Japanese restaurant offers its lunch menu for dinner, apparently an abbreviated version of dinner. It was very good although we expected a dinner menu for dinner...Still a good value considering how expensive Tokyo is. The free hotel shuttle from Shinjuku Station is very handy since some tours pick up at the Hilton but drop off at Shinjuku Station. The hotel has an airport bus service (not all top Tokyo hotels do; some very fancy hotels we considered will tell you to take a taxi to another hotel to catch the airport bus!!!) which is less than $35 per person - a fabulous price.

I am not one to argue without all the facts, so I briefly expressed my dissatisfaction and moved on. The room was on the 34th floor. The toxic cloud of smoke was in the air as soon as we stepped out of the elevator. Once I'm the room the smell was all but gone which was a relief. Hotel has good facilities. I used the pool and gym on a few occasions as well as some of the restaurants. We had breakfast included in our stay and I must say that it was very good. Hotel has wifi in lobby but not the rooms.

This goes for both the communal areas - lobby, corridors, lifts etc. - and the private areas. Our room was excellently sized with fantastic amenities and a wonderful view over the city. All of the furniture and adornments had a mark of quality about them. The one disappointment with the room - which I cannot at all understand for a hotel of this quality and in this day in age - is the lack of complimentary wireless internet. We toured around Japan, staying at four different hotels, and despite this hotel being the best in many respects, it was the only one that didn't come with this. Its an easy thing for them to fix.Overall, the services side of the hotel was very good. We drank at the lobby bar on several occasions and all staff members were professional, polite and helpful. Similarly, when we used the reception desk or concierge, we received a high standard of care. One area that they did fall a little short on was housekeeping - one day our room was forgotten altogether (we rang them and they promptly sent somebody) and one day they missed refilling teas, coffees etc. Small mistakes and not something I particularly hold against them.We ate at the onsite Japanese restaurant and, to be honest, I considered it to be quite ordinary. I didn't think the décor and ambience matches other parts of the hotel and whilst the food was decent, I didn't walk away thinking it was amazing.I do think that this is an excellent hotel, and one which doesn't need to change much to really be top drawer. Other than the wifi, it does most of the basic things extremely well. But, when I think back to the best hotels I've stayed at (business and pleasure), there are often small touches that mark them out from those that are merely ""very good"". This might be a welcome note with a few chocolates, or an invite to a one of the onsite premises with a complimentary drink, or a bowl of fruit or some flowers on your last day. Some of those things may not suit the type of hotel this is, but those types of touches are the things that mark out the very best.","London, United Kingdom",115,4.0

Given its' excellent location (nearby parks and shopping) and close proximity to the Shinjuku station (Tokyo's largest and best train station) this is how I do Tokyo. As my wife hadn't visited Tokyo in decades, she asked to join my most recent trip to China and Japan. Given my preferences she chose the Shinjuku Hilton. While not cheap, the experience was faultless. Unable to arrange for all of the nights of our trip she scheduled our last night elsewhere. This only highlighted the differences in quality and service. The Hilton was resort-like by comparison with the other hotel. Yes, the Hilton was significantly more expensive, but is was significantly better in every respect. It is somewhat like buying a car. Go with the cheaper model and you will end up spending much more to option it up to your liking than you would have spent on the next higher model.The room was just about perfect. Large bed, large TV, large couch, espresso machine, great shower and tub, excellent view, great breakfast buffet, I can go on and on.

No reconstituted juices or mystery dishes masquerading as western food. No waiters afraid to come to your table in fear of an English conversation.

I booked a junior suite last year and paid in advance for a discounted rate. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised with a free upgrade to the Tower Suite, which has two twin beds and a separate living room. The boys slept on the living room sofa which was quite comfortable. The hotel room was recently remodeled and has a really nice modern, clean design with lots of drawers and storage space. The bathroom is relatively small but is nicely designed and the workmanship is excellent. The boys loved the room so much and kept saying it's one of the best parts of the trip. The buffet breakfast was also excellent with a wide selection of quality food. I emailed the consiege before the trip asking transportation options from the Narita airport to the hotel. They got back to me really quickly and provided detailed information which was really helpful. There really is nothing negative I can think of. My younger son's only complains were that the swimming pool was small and they don't let a 12 year old use the gym. :-). I'd surely recommend this hotel to my friends and will stay there if we ever visit Tokyo again. Oh one more important thing is the location of the hotel is great, right in the middle of Shinjiku, next to the Central Park and the city government building. There is nothing better than visiting Tokyo the first week of April to enjoy the cherry blossom and go up to the 45th floor of the city government building to see Tokyo and Mt. Fuji.","Hillsborough, United States",0,5.0

However another downside is the fact that smoking is allowed in the bar. Disgusting. The bedrooms are modern and very well maintained and the maid service is excellent. Always done promptly and not once did I have to phone up because something hadn't been cleaned or replaced. As usual the hair dryer wasn't up to much....a common bug bear of mine! The hotel staff are very welcoming, friendly, efficient and helpful. The reception staff speak good English, so there were no issues during check in or check out.

I took the train from Narita airport to the Shinjuku Station and called ahead and boarded the free Hilton shuttle for the 5 minute ride to the Hilton. The check in was uneventful. I opted to buy an upgrade by reserving on the web site in advance for the concierge benefits and it was well worth it, since I was able to actually have both breakfast and dinner in the concierge lounge.

I've stayed at 5-star hotels, so that may be why I decided to give it an ""average"" ranking. We stayed 6 days, 5 nights.The major issue was that we were not warned that there was major renovation going on. It made my stay really uncomfortable. While my husband was out on business, I would work in the morning either on work or school. All I heard for hours was a constant drilling, hammering or pounding. I went to the front desk after day 2 and asked about it. He said that it was going on from 12-5 (it was after 530 at this point) and he said it would stop. But there were mornings it started around 8! Very annoying, especially when you are paying for a suite. He offered to move us but we were already settled and the last thing I wanted to do was move....especially to a lower floor. It would have been nice to have been warned upon check-in, when we could've made the decision to be lower or upgrade to the higher Executive Suites floor rooms. We were on the 22nd floor.Breakfast was vast and very good. Expensive...but good. The wait staff was hit or miss. The host/hostesses were great but good luck getting things picked up! The first morning the staff was all over it, but the remaining days - not so much. I had to take my plates to the station. No water refills and my husband asked for a cafe mocha and it never showed up. They spray some sort of oils or scent in the building which can be quite overwhelming at times, but it did smell good. The music in the lobby/eating area is loud and very repetitive. Tough when you are nursing a hangover. :-)My last complaint was the blow dryer. My hand fanning off my hair would have done a better job. Ladies, if you need to have your hair dried quickly, bring your own. There was good...the staff was all very friendly and super sweet. Concierge led me in the right direction, however, I wish they would have talked to me more in detail about getting to one station to the other, as it is quite overwhelming to go to Shinjuku Train Station for the first time. Once you get the hang of it - it is quite easy to get around. Overall, they were wonderful though. The location is good. About a 10 minute walk (if you are walking slow) to Shinkjuku Station, and there are cool places to visit around there. There's a Starbucks close - if that matters to you. If walking isn't your thing, there's a shuttle that will take you there. And the metro below will as well. Rooms are very clean and spacious. Thanks for a wonderful stay. We will be back to visit Tokyo again. Not too sure if we would consider staying here though.","Phoenix, Arizona",2,3.0

Once in the evening opting for chicken wings and a club sandwich, which were okay. Not great, but acceptable. I also had bed in breakfast which was really nice. However, i was charged for a full breakfast which i thought was harsh even though i had breakfast included, because it wasn't from the buffet. Even though i could have eaten unlimited amounts more from the buffet. Paying twice, as it's delivered to my room? I would have understood a service charge... Ah well.

The ambiance, the service, the modern architecture and decor, and the food. This hotel literally screams high quality experience.From the time you pull up to the entrance of the hotel, you are cordially greeted by doorman(women) who welcome you to the hotel with a sense of class and sophistication missing from Hilton hotels in the United States. Walking through the entrance of into the lobby provides a similar experience as the color scheme and architecture give the space a very modern feel. With their straight lines, bronze color, and hints of glass and tile, you immediately feel like you are in the lap of luxury.Heading to the front desk is an incredibly warming experience as the front desk personnel seem eager to help you. There's nothing better than being greeted by a warm smile and sense of professionalism after a long day worth of travel or business. The people who work the front desk at the Tokyo Hilton have obviously mastered the art of customer service. And no worries about the language barrier here. Every one of the agents at the front desk and the concierge speak perfect English.This may be a good time to mention why I said ""I love just about everything"" in my opening statement. It's the fact that everyone speaks perfect English. It might sound silly, but when I travel abroad, I like to feel that I've immersed myself in a different culture. I love the adventure of trying to understand local colloquialisms and even the nuances of the language. While at the Tokyo Hilton, you feel like you're at any luxury hotel in a major metropolitan city (like NYC). The only real difference is that a majority of the people are Japanese.I can see that Hilton took great pains in creating an atmosphere of luxury and grandeur here, but I wish they had also added some tasteful touches from the local Japanese culture. Something to leave visitors with a feeling that they'd escaped their normal world and had entered a new, mysterious place where comfort, extravagance, and experience await. That's all.I've stayed here twice. Once in a Junior Suite and the other in a King Executive suite. You will have NO issues with any of those room selections. Both are duly appointed with flat-screen television, incredible vistas of downtown Tokyo, and a bed that provides comfort like no other. I know that the comfort of a bed is subjective, but Hilton got it just right for me. Once I laid down, I was out.I'm also a Gold member with HHonors, so I have access to the Executive Lounge. This is a great to grab a drink with co-workers, discuss business details with clients, and enjoy some very delectable treats from both Japanese and western cultures. Definitely worth a try if you have access. The breakfast buffet is incredible and offers a wide variety of food from both Japanese and western cultures. Be careful though...it's a bit on a pricey side.The restaurants in the Shinjuku Hilton are also incredible. My favorite is the BRASSERIE CHECKERS which offers a buffet option of food from all over the world. If you're there when they're serving the stuffed squid or the Lobster Tails, you HAVE to try them. They're absolutely delicious.The hotel is also conveniently located 10 minutes from the Shinjuku train station and also provides a limousine bus service to Narita airport.All in all, I love this hotel. I try to stay here when I can while in Tokyo for business. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.",,7,5.0

This approach works well if one is staying put in Tokyo and does not need access to train service (if you will be using trains a lot it is better to find a hotel next to the main Tokyo train terminal). The Hilton Tokyo is located in the hotel district part of Shinjuku, one of Tokyo's major and certainly liveliest shopping districts. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the train station or one can take the hotel's shuttle bus which runs three times per hour for most of the day. There are also a couple of subway stations within 5 minutes walk. The west side of Shinjuku is spic and span and dominated by skyscrapers (but no restaurants, etc, close by). I booked a standard room as offered by the ___wire special unnamed deal for a 4.5 star hotel. Cheap by New York or DC standards but on the high side for Tokyo. When I arrived I found out that this price did not include breakfast which would be an additional $27 or so and not free wireless in the room. Also, standard rooms are not available for smokers if this is a priority. I was told I could access the ""executive"" rooms by paying a surcharge of about $80/night which would provide a room on a higher floor (and a better view), and access to the executive lounge on the 37th floor, where a breakfast buffet could be had, as well as unlimited snacks, coffee, and other drinks throughout the entire day, as well as free internet. Since I knew I would be spending a lot of time at the hotel, I took this offer. The room was on the 34th floor and did have a very nice view. The room wasn't spacious nor was it cramped; just enough space to walk by the bed, with a decent glass top desk that could be located in front of the window if one likes to work facing the view. The wireless internet was very fast and there was no problem using my computer, ipad and iphone simultaneously. The bathroom was adequate for a business room but cramped for a couple on a romantic outing. There was a large flatscreen with CNN, BBC and a couple FOX entertainment stations in English. The breakfast bar in the executive lounge was adequate, although minimalist by 4-5 star hotel standards. The bacon was razor thin and the scrambled eggs were runny but the automatic coffee machines were great.The executive lounge was open from 6:30AM to 10PM and one could get coffee, drinks, and snacks ad libitum as part of the executive lounge package. Given the location of the hotel away from the main commercial area, this lounge area is very useful.The service was excellent and the staff were universally competent and very helpful. Bottom line: The total price came to about $300+ per night for a decent but not special room with breakfast and internet included. This is OK but not a bargain given the range of alternatives in Tokyo.","Columbia, Missouri",36,5.0

We found out later Hilton Honor members can check in at the exec floor lounge on the 37th floor. I wish we would have known that earlier or it would have been good to have a sign in the lobby saying this. We got our first room and it was very small. The fan in the room/air conditioning did not work. The room cooled, but there was no air circulation. After calling the front desk, they sent a repairman, but still did not work. We then asked if we could change rooms and they accommodated by giving us a bigger room on the 11th floor. The room was very nice and clean, but unfortunately not much of a view. I asked on my reservation for highest floor possible and really wanted that. Not sure why they did not do that, perhaps they were full. Also not sure why they did not upgrade us to the bigger room when we first checked in as they usually do for diamond members. All of this occurred though when were very tired and probably cranky from traveling all day.After that the stay was nothing short of fantastic. Japan is such a great and friendly country and this hotel does not disappoint. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. The room was very clean, although bathroom was a little small and odd in that if you turn on the light in the bathroom, people in the rest of the room can the bright light which will wake you up at night - it is hard to explain, but there is a window from the main room into the shower!Wifi worked great, the executive floor lounge was the best we have ever experienced - strict dress code applies - no shorts, flip flops, hats, tattoos - and they mean it which is fantastic! The manager had to talk to some people who were dressed inappropriately. Views were amazing with Mt. Fuji clearly seen.The location is also perfect - we learned after exploring a day that the hotel is on top of a subway station for 2 lines and is super convenient - just one stop to Shinjuku, but there is a bus service as well for free. The walk is only 15 minutes as well to that station and 5 minutes to the heart of Shinjuku. Fantastic location!!!

We had 7 rooms for 5 nights. Everything was fresh, the staff are all really helpful and the services they offer here are all pretty perfect. Checking in was incredibly easy, everything was prepared for us to head to our rooms pretty much immediately, which was hugely appreciated.. My room on the 22nd floor was great, spacious, clean and fresh - the bed was totally amazing and so was the view. The only slight issue was how dated the bathroom was, although it still had everything you need including a bath big enough to consider drowning in (and I'm 6ft1"") The vegetarian room service was fantastic, really reasonably priced - although I missed it the first night as it's actually at the back of the menu, behind the deserts and drinks menu.. Breakfast is amazing, and once again really reasonable considering the feast which is on offer, carefully adaptable to European, American and Eastern diets. While exploring Tokyo, I actually felt guilty about not spending as much time in the hotel as I should, and I felt pretty depressed when I eventually had to check out!For the brave there's direct access to the underground metro. For the weak, there's a taxi rank right outside the hotel entrance, so getting around is really easy. The gym and swimming pool were really great - limited, but one of the best I've experienced in a hotel. I used the laundry service twice, once using the economy service, which I still received back about 3 hours later, then used the express service (50% more) the following day where housekeeping admittedly screwed up, I was thrilled however when at around midnight they accepted they were wrong and would deliver it back to me at 11am the next morning, only charging me for the economy service, which was a fight I was preparing to have to deal with.

As a very nice gesture, we received a bottle of wine, a cocktail glas full of strawberries and chocolate. Overall the staff at the hotel was very friendly. The highlight of our stay was definitely the breakfast, although during the peak time the breakfast area was to crowded and some of the food and drinks were not available due to the overconsumption by to many guests. For all those who don't have wifi included in the room rate/due to status, one can easily access the free wifi at the lobby area which also has some nice seating options on the second floor.Overall the hotel provides very good value for money, although the price differences among the travel agencies were tremendous.

(I've stayed for both.) From a business perspective, the Hilton has all the infrastructure and convenience needed by a business traveler. Tourists will enjoy the hotel as well. The concierge was wonderful and helpful. As expected in Japan, the hotel runs efficiently while being infused with graciousness and civility. (I'm a big Japan fan. I think both have to do with the national character as much as the particular hotel.) One issues to be aware of.... The Hilton is not close to any specific tourist spots. It's not a problem for me as I'm a veteran of the Tokyo Metro system. Frankly, the major sites are somewhat spreadout in Tokyo. Consequently, no hotel is ideal from a tourists perspective. If you aren't comfortable with subways, Tokyo will be a challenge for you. Just be aware. Finally, from a value standpoint, I think the Hilton is superlative. I work for a very large/recognizable corporation. We have phenomenal rates around the world. The rate I paid is astounding for a hotel in central Tokyo. I'm not sure what the ""rack rate"" is so I can't make an objective comment about value.",Shanghai,5,5.0

Therefore, I had to call IDD and check what's going wrong, but it's so difficult to communicate with them. The lady who received my call did not speak English very well. I spent over 20 minutes on the phone but I had to give up. I communicated with them by email afterwards. Finally they refunded the difference to my credit card. As they charged/refunded me in Japanese Yen but I paid/received in HKD, I still had to pay the exchange difference charged by the credit card. I arrived around 6:30 and checked in, they gave me a twin bed room but I booked a king size bed. The receptionist said no king size bed was available at that moment. I told them that I got the confirmation from Hiliton and I insisted to have a king size bed. I wasted half an hour at the counter becuase of their mistake.","Yuen Long, Hong Kong",0,4.0

The executive lounge at the hotel is on the 37th floor with fantastic views, including a beauty of Mount Fuji if weather and pollution factors permit. And of course, you get all the professionalism and outward courtesy that is present everywhere in Japan.So why is Shah not more generous with his stars? Well, what is also expected, especially in Japan, is loyalty to those who give you a great deal of business. Such is the case for those who are Diamond members, and therefore do have an expectation of something a bit more than the ordinary, such as an upgraded room. Every Hilton does this so it was more than surprising that the Hilton Tokyo failed in this regard (for two rooms that Shah had booked with them). It is also disappointing when the front desk clerks claim that executive rooms are not available. Do they not realize that this lie can be caught with just one look at their reservations page on the Internet?As fans of Shah know, he is so perceptive as to see through people rather easily; his canine instincts are still very sharp indeed. It is very unfortunate but true that many Japanese still treat foreigners as second-class citizens. And until they realize that all the outward smiles and endless bowing simply can't mask their inward feelings, this situation will unfortunately continue.Shah Rukh says: If you are a loyal Hilton patron, then do demand (politely) that they treat you with the respect and courtesy that many other Hilton properties automatically do. Smiles and bows are fine, but a room on the 35th floor with a Mount Fuji view is even better, and expected if you are Diamond.Shah Rukh's tip: Take the ""Friendly Limousine bus"" from Narita or Haneda airport directly to the hotel for $30 and $12, respectively.

This was my first visit to a hotel of this standard and I have to admit that I wasn't disappointed.We stayed in the King Executive room (with my girlfriend) for most of our stay, but the last 3 nights we upgraded to the Junior Executive Suite. Both of the rooms were very comfy and modern with their decoration. It was noticeable that the rooms had just been renovated because everything was in top shape.We are very strict about the cleanliness of the hotelrooms we stay at and I can say that these rooms were the cleanest we have ever seen. I can't say anything bad about the housekeeping. One time we made our bed and left a book on top of it before we left the room. When we came back, the bed had been made by their standards and the book was on the same exact spot we left it. I mean EXACTLY. They had put it a little ""crooked"" like we had. That is attention to detail.I really liked the bathroom. The shower was one of the best I have used in hotels and it was nice that it was separate from the tub.The bed.... don't even get me started. My neck starts to ache even when sleeping in my own bed and I never feel that hotel beds are perfect, but this time it was! I always woke up refreshed without any aching. The bed is firm, but still soft enough to make it comfortable. The pillows are huge and weigh a lot, but they were really good. For the whole 2 weeks, I slept better than I have in a long time.Executive-level rooms have complimentary wifi (which worked well) and the customers have access to the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor. I recommend eating your breakfast here because it is so much relaxing and the view is spectacular. The customer service here is fantastic.It's hard to say if you should take the Junior Suite or not, because in a way the Lounge gives you a big livingroom eitherway. Both are very good and the Junior Suite was amazing. It just depends on your budget really. Junior Suite isn't necessary, but I have to admit that it is still better ;).Special thanks goes to Mr. Goto who is the Executive Lounge Manager. He really made us feel welcome and he was a great guy. The service in this hotel is the best I have ever experienced.I know that these kinds of reviews never feel honest, but I can't help but compliment the hotel, because I can't wait to get back there.The only ""cons"" are as follows:- Sometimes we could hear sounds from the next room. It might have been because there was a connecting door from the King Executive room to the next one. This wasn't a problem because normally the soundproofing was good.- I informed the hotel a couple of times that I have a birthday on the day we were travelling and I would be celebrating on this trip. In a hotel like this, I should have gotten some recognition of that. Even a card or something, but nobody mentioned my birthday. This might sound like a small thing, but it is a pretty big deal when paying this much on a hotel.- I had agreed to pay extra for a room upgrade from eStandby (Hilton Honors exclusive), but for some reason they didn't accept the confirmation I had on this even though they had available rooms.All in all I really recommend using this hotel on a trip to Tokyo, because everything is within reach and the transportation options are the best in the city. Shinjuku itself is a very good choice for a hotel. We used the Limousine Bus from the airport to get to the hotel and back to the airport and it worked very well.","Helsinki, Finland",2,5.0

We stayed at two other five star hotels in Shinjuku in the past. Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku is the most outstanding and memorable one. We stayed for six nights in last December. We booked two Executive rooms (1 King and 1 twin plus extra bed) through CX holidays. As there wasn't much information given on the travel agent's website, we expected to receive standard service with a high price tag. Fantastically, this stay has exceeded much of our expectation.Before our departure from Australia, I had to ensure that there would be three beds for my teenage children in their room as this was not clearly confirmed by the agent. So, I had to contact the hotel reservation department myself and we had a number of exchanges of email because they couldn't find our reservation due to some systematic issues with the travel agent. I was so impressed by the efficiency of the reservation staff in locating our record and answering my enquiries. A job well done.We received a warm welcome by the Reception staff and the check-in was smooth. We were given rooms on the 38th floor. The rooms were spacious, modern and clean (I think they have undergone some refurbishment a couple of years ago). How nice to be in a hotel bedroom as comfortable as the one in your own house! Perhaps, it is the executive floor, it is pleasantly quiet on this level. The view from our room was impressive. I personally appreciate the sliding paper and wooden screens at the windows which add a fine Japanese touch to the room. We made enquiries about a tour to Mt. Fuji/Hakone. The Concierge staff was so efficient and helpful in assisting us to book a tour on our arrival as well as the airport shuttle bus to Haneda Airport. We would like to thank all the staff (Ms. Nakamura and others) in recommending us some nice restaurants and making the bookings for us accordingly. It was often very busy at this desk but they were always patiently rendered their assistance.Staying on the Executive floor, we could freely use the Executive lounge at its opening hours. We enjoyed the exclusive use of it. Especially after a long day out, it was nice to have a relaxing place, not confining in one's own room, for a drink before heading out again. The staff was friendly and happy to have a chat with the patrons. Our special thanks to Sho Goto-san, Emi Suzuki-san and all the staff who work on this floor for their exemplary services. You have made our stay very memorable.The buffet breakfast and pre-dinner canape were very nicely prepared. There is not a wide variety of food as in some other Asian countries which can be overwhelming and excessive but enough. We do enjoy the simple elements and concepts of Japanese food.The location of the hotel is not that close to the Shinjuku train station; but, there is a shuttle bus service running back and forth between the hotel and the station at a 20 minute interval. There is a also a subway connecting the hotel and the Marunouchi line. One won't get wet in the rain (we had three days of rain during our stay) to catch a train and it is very safe to walk at night time. The i-land building next door has a few eateries and a building nearby has a few fine dining restaurants. If we visit Tokyo again, we will certainly consider to stay at Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku again.","Melbourne, Australia",34,5.0

The room was what I would expect from a Hilton seeing how it was clean and arranged quite well so that any guest would feel comfortable. Though my view from the 37th floor was a nice added bonus. The executive lounge was a nice place to grab a tasty snack and drink in the morning and the evening. They really take good care of Hilton Honors gold members. Although the hotel wasn't a close walk to Shinjuku Station, the complimentary shuttle service accounted for that fact. If you don't want to wait for the shuttle there are also two subway lines within walking distance below the hotel which was also quite convenient. Overall this is a great, quality hotel to stay at while in Tokyo and it is exactly what you would expect from a Hilton property.","Viera, Florida",5,5.0

Staff were courteous and helpful. Our rooms were not particularly luxurious but fine. I wondered whether you get nicer rooms if you are not using Loyalty Points.Breakfast buffet was very nice but needs a little reorganising. There were huge queues. Residents should be encouraged to go to different stations and there would be more numerous but shorter queues. What was happening was that the polite residents were joining a ONE LONG queue of people many of whom just wanted, say, the Japanese breakfast but not the Western one. So all the residents who wanted the western food would wait behind the clients selecting their miso soup and grilled fish. A bit barmy really and easily solved by delineating the cuisines somehow. It got to the stage where we would just cut right in for our sausages and scrambled egg. It looked really rude but life is too short to wait in a line behind 20 people, many of whom don’t even want what you want – it’s just that what they want comes first! This is not a hugely picturesque area (finding the hotel by following signs for Metropolitan Govt Offices gives you a clue!) Lots of good eateries close by (including the underground passes) if you know to look. Our first stop was the nearby Spaghetti Goemon – I love pasta done Japanese style! There are several different conbinis (convenience stores) nearby and they sell different brands of beer so if you have a favourite tipple have a quick look. My husband found a favourite black beer in a conbini which was pretty useless for everything else!One travel tip – if you are arriving at Narita Airport on a Friday or Saturday evening and do not have much luggage consider taking the Narita Express to Shinjuku. Our ride in on the “Friendly Airport Limousine Bus” took over 2 hours because of the weekend traffic. On the way out however, we left at 7am and the ride was fine. And of course the bus is much handier if you have more luggage as it is door to door. Japanese people travel very light as they often use a courier service (eg Takkubin).","Singapore, Singapore",230,4.0

There was a wonderful manager there by the name of Leon who honestly made the trip even more special!

The suite was very large, with a great view over Shinjuku office buildings. Our king size bed was so comfortable, it was just so good, I keep wanting to be back in it! The large room with great beds was a wonderful way to rest after all our shopping. The breakfast was fantastic with Western and Japanese options. The kids loved the pancakes & donuts and my husband loved the omelette station. Breakfast was included in the advance payment web option, so great value.

This was, however, not so much of an issue as we stayed in the lobby while waiting, and the entire place smelled terrific (some sort of green tea fragrance). Their staff was also very helpful. My brother bought plenty of stuff from Amazon, and we were always notified by phone to pick them up just when we get back to our room.

Yes staff were courteous and helpful but that's the minimum requirement for a 4-5 star hotel. The room we stayed in has obviously not been renovated. The wall paper on the ceiling was peeling left right and centre and the bathroom clearly demonstrated it was desperately in need for a massive update (I assume this is happening already as mentioned in other reviews but unfortunately we got stuck with an old one). The room was extremely underwhelming and we were glad we only stayed for two nights. Apart from the lobby, I'm not sure if anything else has been renovated recently, the sauna/spa area was basic and the executive lounge tired. The offering at the lounge was also far inferior to other Hilton properties.Breakfast was crowded but at least the variety was decent. In terms of location, it's not inconvenient but certainly not very convenient either. The hotel is connected by underground walkways to Nishi-Shinjuku station, approx. 5 mins walk or there's a free hotel shuttle that takes you to Shinjuku Station, outside Odakyu Department store.Overall, the service (software) is 5 star quality but the dated hardware (room/facilities) made it really difficult to enjoy. For the price it charges, there are more modern alternatives and for us personally, the chances of returning is slim and recommendation to friends/family is unlikely.","Sydney, Australia",71,2.0

However, my expectations were different - being a frequent international American traveler - and this was my first overnight trip to Asia.I got to the hotel fairly late -past midnight as my flight landed late and had to fork out $120USD for a cab (no trains running that late). When I checked in, I was a bit disappointed to find out I'd be in a room with 2 twin beds - they didn't have anything else. This kinda blew my tone for the rest of the trip as I have never stayed in a hotel room with a double bed or smaller. Call me spoiled. And the fact we were spending over $350 USD a night I was just expecting a bigger bed.The lobby area was nicely decorated and surprisingly busy for being 1 am. A quick elevator ride and short walk to my room made me realize I'm in a cruise-ship style room. It was definitely smaller than I'm used to at Hilton properties. Then again, this IS Japan. It was nicely decorated and the sliders blocking the windows/light did their job quite well. Fortunately the hotel had a few US channels and some with english subtitles. I had to spend a few bucks to login to the internet as the city-wide WIFI through the cell providers have instructions ONLY in Japanese & Google was not translating it very well :)The bathroom was alright, but the toilet controls were definitely neat. I've never sat on a toilet seat that can play music, warm itself up, and also spray your butt. I've always had a separate bidet, so kudos to the Japanese for making it all one toilet.Shower took a bit to get warm, but it was sufficient and nice.The twin bed though bugged me. I was hoping the rooms were like cruise-ship rooms where you could push the beds together -- but no go. I ended up using all the pillows in the room and at least got a decent sleep in... just missed being able to sprawl out on a queen/king bed.Hotel staff during my stay were good. I was happy that the concierge desk sells the visitors pass for the train - $5 USD/day and the stations are very close to the hotel. The Denny's nearby is NOT your traditional Denny's -- there is a McDonalds around the corner of the hotel that has a fairly ""Americanized"" menu, and I believe a 7-11'esque type store also sold comfort foods to satisfy any culture.The hotel is in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo - which is great if you are doing business here as this is where most companies have offices, but if you are playing a tourist like me, its WWWAAAYYY out of the way. I had to take a 20 minute subway ride to Tokyo Station just to get anywhere. I also took a tour from HATO Tours and they did a great job with their American speaker. These tours typically will leave Tokyo Station and I'd recommend the Tokyo Skytree & Asukusa Tour (about $65 USD) and also make it to the Ueno Park Zoo. I also found the city to be VERY tourist friendly - maps everywhere, and also in English. And if you don't know the language -- most restaurants have picture guides of their menus.Now, I may backtrack a bit - if you are flying in and out of Narita, the NEX departs from just a few blocks away... so its not totally out of the way.Stay was overall pleasant. I was just expecting something different because of the high price paid for the room. I also appreciate being able to use the health club well after checkout to shower and rest up before my 930PM flight out (although i have NEVER showered sitting down... it was an experience!). Everyone was very accommodating and their english was very good.","Juneau, Alaska",57,3.0

The exec lounge is outstanding both for breakfast and evening drinks/snacks. Great selection, good service, and good views on clear days. It can be busy, so get there earlier for breakfast.

I was surprised at the fluent English they spoke. It was very nice. The rooms were very trendy and I really liked the theme they used. The only thing The Executive Lounge was also nice with an amazing view. However, there is often a lot of people. The food in the executive lounge was also very cool and had cool Japanese styled foods. The staff were very friendly all over the hotel. I really couldn't believe how nice they were. The location is also fairly decent. The walk to the JR Station is not bad and there is a bus to go there anyway. There is also a subway that is right below the hotel. The i-Land is right below as well and has many very good restaurants. Hiltopia below the hotel is also a very interesting place to walk around. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff was very attentive and helpful. I highly recommend this place for anyone staying for a while and wanting a great place to sleep.","Houston, Texas",56,5.0

If you are looking for a hotel with view of mount Fuji then I would recommend this hotel. We had King Tower Suite with magnificent views of Fujisan.LocationWe found the hotel bit off from the main tourist track. However its only about 10-15min walk to Shinjuku station (there is also a free minibus) so when you want to be in the tourist track it wont be long.RoomsApart from the view we found the rooms bit weak. Decor was old and minimalistic and it did not feel like a warm place. Even the suite was so old. The bathroom definetely did not live up to the standard of a suite in our view. The room in was spacious however with plenty of space to entertain friends and for the kids to play. Standard room also seemd pretty spacious.The ViewGreat views of mount Fuji. Its winter season with clear weather and we definetely enjoyed the views. Sun setting on Fuji is great.ServiceSimilarly to other people writing here we did not feel the warm service we had anticipated in Japan and experienced in most other places we have visited. The service was very robotic and cold. When we called the reception to arrange extra beds as we had requested at time of booking we were told that there would be extra charge. After going to reception it was cleared but this should not happen for top class hotel. I do not want to be forced to go down to get what I had paid for.RestaurantsWe only tried the breakfast, which was one of the best I have had in a hotel before. Fantastic but very expensive if you do not have inclusive package.SpaThere is a oldish swimming pool, which has got dedicated space for kids. Free bathrobes are provided. As its old fashioned Japanese place you need to bring your swimming hat or they will give you one. The hotel also includes a Japanese bath area,which whilst not special is very typical and you can truly relax after a busy day of sightseeing. Nice area to cool off.",UK,40,3.0

The staff would bend over backwards for their guests. I requested a Mt. Fuji view and probably got the best view we could get. They also let us check in early, ~11am. We showed up a bit earlier than expected and they accommodated us in any way we wanted. The rooms are normal sized rooms for a Hilton. We did not stay on an executive floor however the room looked exactly like an executive style room at some other Hiltons we stayed at. The bed was comfortable, soft (not like the typical hard Japanese style) and 4 huge pillows. The room was spotless and bathroom clean. The TV had some English channels along with some entertaining local Japanese channels.We had access to the executive floor lounge which was top notch. Excellent food and alcohol choices. The service was great. The breakfast buffet was the best one i have seen in a long time. The selection was both Japanese and Western style. You will not leave hungry.The hotel is exactly 15 minutes walk from JR Shinjuku Southern Terrace Entrance. We timed it. If you are arriving at that station and plan on walking i would recommend printing a map for reference. We used Google maps on our phone and it made it easier. There is a shuttle that will pick you up at the station but it might be hard to find it first time.

Reception staff was polite but took a while to sort the rooms. When finally done, I went to a room which was occupied and it was an embarassing moment as the guest was half dressed. Had to go downstairs with my luggages and left sitting at reception for a few minutes before getting the rooms few floors down. I guess the way the hotel apologize for that mistake was sending a small tray of fruits without a note.Executive lounge was mediocre. Told the staff that the coffee machine is out of milk as the caffe macchiato is just a shot of expresso. She just pointed to me that there is milk in the fridge. Then they hurried to inform all the guests that the lounge is closing at 10pm.On the last day, at checkout, I have specifically reminded the staff on the change of our pickup time. She seemed to understand but I guess not. When we got back to the hotel later, we approached the concierge 30mins prior to the rescheduled pickup time ie 730pm to only discovered no call was made to the pickup earlier. The hotel was running fullhouse as its near xmas + new year so there were many guests at the lobby. I'm sitting in the lobby waiting for the pickup with my no brand shopping bags. After.an hour, a female caucasian staff stood in front speaking to a local staff that it was unacceptable to have my shopping bags being put there and immediately have the staff removing my bags. No issue on wanting to maintain their standard 5 star image but its the manner and approach thats totally uncalled for. As a 5 star hotel, that staff was down right rude to treat a hotel guest that way and I am very disappointed that my hols ended with a bad experience at the hotel. Its as if I've committed a crime.

The staff member who was directing guests to available check in agents was very attentive, and offered to take my luggage, jacket, and my carry-all while I waited to check in. The check-in staff were nothing short of fantastic. Ridiculously polite, the staff member took time to review my hotel rate, explain where hotel facilities were, and let me know about the Shinjuku Station shuttle schedule. The agent asked if I would like help to my room, which I declined, however when I turned around after finishing up the same staff member who took my luggage items and coat was waiting for me, with all my items in hand, and helped me towards the elevators.My room was on the tenth floor, and when I arrived I was just as impressed as when I first walked into the hotel. The room looked like it had been recently renovated and refreshed as everything was crisp and clean. It was very well lit, smelled fresh, and had some great furnishings including a nice large closet for my cloths and two reasonable sized drawers. I was pleasantly surprised to find some slippers and a Japanese style robe in one of the drawers, very comfortable to be in after walking around Tokyo all day!The bathroom was just as clean and crisp and amazing as the rest of the room and was well stocked with towels and amenities. I was a bit thrown off by the lack of a shower curtain, there was just a bit of glass close to the shower head, but after a bit of figuring it out was able to not spray water all over the place! The mirror was also slightly heated so when you had a hot shower part of it stayed clear and did not fog up. The toilet had once of the fancy bidet attachments on that also heated up however I did not use it.One thing that I was amazed about was how quiet everything was. I had the air conditioner working and was concerned that it might be broken but it cooled and heated just fine. I did not hear anything from either of the adjacent rooms (not even a TV) when I was in my room, and never heard anything from the hall.I did not get a chance to use the restaurants or spa at the hotel, but when I did walk by the breakfast buffet it did look amazing. (I opted to go eat like a local and go find the tiny restaurants for a quick bite to eat here and there and I highly recommend it if you want to try more traditional Japanese cuisine)The one thing about this hotel that topped it all off for me was the staff(and i touched on it at the beginning of this review). As a Canadian who has worked in the customer service industry for 15+ years I always considered myself as someone who provided very good customer service. The staff at the hotel have given me a new bar to reach - I was completely blown away by each and every staff member who I talked to. EVERYONE greeted or acknowledged me in some fashion, even if it was just a quick hello. If I had a question to ask, I always felt as if they took ownership to find me an answer even if they had to ask for help. When I left one of the mornings the concierge asked me if I needed directions anywhere and when I informed him I was just going shopping it turned into a 5 minute info session about the best shops to go see - both high end and hidden gems. Everyone was fantastic.Overall I give this hotel a 5/5 and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Tokyo. It is not a cheap hotel to stay at but if it is within your budget it is a no brainer!Note: When I checked out I was talking to a fellow guest who said that he was on the same side of the hotel but quite a bit higher up (30th floor I think), and the view was even more amazing than his previous stay on the lower floors so try and request a room higher up!","Vancouver, Canada",15,5.0

The breakfast in the Executive lounge is fantastic, there's typical japanese food and for those that need something more familiar there's your typical American breakfast as well. Plus free drinks and finger food all evenings. And the view is fantastic, it's located over the 30th floor (not sure the exact floor, but it was high). The rooms are standard for what you'd expect of a $300+ a night hotel, luxurious, and kudos to the cleanliness, comfort of the bed and the great shower. Very attentive staff who really made my stay effortless. In terms of location, one can't ask for better: It's less than a block to the Tokyo subway from where you can reach virtually anywhere in Tokyo and connect to the whole of Japan if you'd like (there are extremely fast trains you can get to go to other places on a day trip and come back on time for the evening drinks with your friends - in the VIP lounge, of course). If you can choose a time of the year to go, the Cherry Blossoms are awesome in Japan in the Spring, truly amazing and it's worth to visit Ueno park. Nearby the hotel there's lots of shops and native restaurants in the Shinjuku district nearby the rail lines. A particular delicacy is the Yakitori, you'll find lots of variety in different restaurants in the area.

There is no consistency in the rules at any of these hotels and during our recent stay from 8 - 13 October we both stayed on the Executive Floor with use of the Executive Lounge a the Hilton Hotel, Tokyo. On our fourth night at the hotel, upon leaving the Executive Lounge, we were stopped and told by one of the staff that our footwear was not appropriate for this Lounge. We were both wearing the brand of Fit Flops, the weather in Japan being unseasonably warm and I had only this type of footwear with me on my trip. I also wore this brand of footwear during a trip in May 2013 and we had previously stayed at the Hilton in Osaka on the Executive Floor, used the Executive Lounge and no comments had been made about our footwear. In fact, no comments re our footwear have been made in any of the other Hilton Hotels we have stayed in. We were extremely offended by this and I emailed Helen Jacobe, Director of Operations, at the Hilton Tokyo to share this with her. Also I was extremely disappointed and offended with the attitude of the Duty Manager on duty that evening. We met with the Director of Operations and I acknowledged to her that I have no problem with rules, but this type of rule needs to be communicated with the customer before they start out on their trip so they can meet the dresscode, not when they are at the hotel. And of course, there is no excuse for a member of management to be patronising and condescending to paying guests. We also wondered what type of atmosphere and image the Hilton are trying to portray for their Executive Lounge, as certainly in Tokyo, there were children as young as 2/3, dropping food on the floor, running around - not really conducive to an executive environment. In addition, there were many other guests wearing, in my opinion, inappropriate dress for an Executive Lounge and certainly wearing beach flip flops and sandals, which according to the dresscode are not allowed. We felt that we had been dicriminated against, and were extremely surprised that the Hilton brand would treat their customers in this way. My colleague and I are both of the opinion that it is very doubtful we will stay at the Hilton again, certainly the Tokyo Hilton, unless we can receive some strong assurances that Hilton Hotels will be training their staff in equality and diversity, and that the principles of their rules and dresscode are enforced equally to offenders. I look forward to receiving your response to this complaint, which unfortunately is the second I have written in a year to complain about a Hilton Hotel. I have also sent this complaint to your Hilton Worldwide website some 2 months ago and received no response.","Bournemouth, United Kingdom",2,3.0

Upon return from Kyoto, we again stayed at the Hilton, this time in a regular room and it was just a regular shower that was in the tub but the pressure was still excellent. The buffet was great, we had it twice - wide variety - great eggs made to order at the omelet station. We never normally get room service as we like to dine out but Jet-lag was rough and we had dinner twice in the room - surprisingly excellent - it comes up in heated cabinets and was well prepared, even Italian pasta - and we are foodies by nature and very discriminating.

Some folks say the service is as great as other hotels, but I found them extremely friendly and helpful in a Japanese way (not lots of plastic smiles in the western way, they were genuinely sincere). I have stayed at other Hilton hotels around the world, but this one was as good as others. A good portion of the guests were non-Japanese here. Being a Japanese myself, I felt like this was a bubble.

My work hotel was in Roppongi so we wanted to check out a different part of town for a couple days and decided on the Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku. The hotel itself was very nice. Room was a good size, quite spartan in the furnishings with a low fairly uncomfortable couch. The bed was comfortable and the room was spotless, which are really the only two requirements for us. One thing that I did love about the room was the A/C. Most hotel rooms have an A/C or heater with a blower that does just that, it blows air in a noisy fashion. This usually is a nuisance in the middle of the night as a noisy fan comes on and off. This one was silent. It's a weird thing that sometimes annoys me and this one was so quiet and added to the peacefulness of the room. Even though our room was right next to the elevator we never heard any noise from the hallway which was also nice. The only downside to this hotel is that it's a bit out of the way. We tend to walk and use subways when we're visiting a new city and this hotel, while not super far from the subway stations, was about a 10 minute walk in each way so we always had to factor that into it.

The hotel provides a regular shuttle service between Shinjuku station and the hotel. To walk to the station, it'll take 15 minutes walk, which we really enjoyed.

The Hilton is a great choice for exploring Shinjuku, but it's also a convenient place to stay if you plan to tour all over Tokyo. What I mean is that it's a 10-15 minute walk from Shinjuku Station, a very convenient transportation hub for getting around Tokyo, but also just less than 10 minutes should you wish to use the subway. The walk is great on a nice day, but in rainy or cold weather, you can take the subway to Shinjuku Station without even going outside. You go through the lobby, past the main restaurant, and downstairs to walk to the subway. And near Shinjuku Station, don't miss the wonderful Takashimaya department store, principally the amazing basement level food area.The Tokyo subway is very easy to use - machines have a button for English language and trains have signs and announcements in English. At any train station, you should also be able to pick up an English language subway map. I highly recommend using the subway when touring Tokyo - easy to use and even using the subway you'll still likely be walking several miles a day.But back to the Hilton, I found the hotel very functional. It's a very large hotel, one that I would typically avoid in the US because I find the waits for the elevator to be long and the crowds too big. But I never experienced any of this at this Hilton. More importantly, while I typically don't use concierge services, I absolutely did at the Hilton because of the language barrier making dinner reservations (I don't speak Japanese). Now you might think with such a large hotel that you would have long waits to speak to a concierge, but that was never the case. And we even communicated with the concierge by email well before our arrival in Tokyo to make some hard-to-get dinner reservations. The concierge was truly outstanding and willing to go great lengths to secure a dinner reservation and to make sure you knew how to get there, what to wear, and how much time to allow.Our guest room was very comfortable. I appreciate a firm mattress and nice bedding and they certainly offered that. Air conditioning worked just fine. There's a safe in the room too. Also, you don't need converters or adapters. Wi-fi worked very well (note: free for me since I'm Hilton Gold). The bathroom was just fine too and the shower had great water pressure.There really wasn't anything I disliked about the Hilton, though I thought the breakfast buffet was not quite as good as a couple of others I experienced on this trip (in Osaka and Kyoto). The Japanese offerings were not my favorites or particularly impressive (not a natto fan, that's for sure). And the western offerings were fine but very ordinary - eggs, omelets, french toast, bacon, sausage, breads, fruits, etc. There are a few pastries which I though were pretty lousy actually. I would have preferred to just get a bowl of fruit and then go out to eat but my travel companion seems to love buffet breakfasts. That's okay - I still enjoyed multiple bowls of ramen (at Tokyo's Ramen Street). I'll also note that occasionally I had to wait a few minutes for a table here - not a big deal, but surprisingly the only place where the largeness of the hotel perhaps came into play.A few other notes: check-in and check-out were very fast and the staff members we encountered throughout our stay were extremely friendly.Getting to the hotel from Narita: Don't take a taxi - it will cost a fortune. There's the Friendly Limousine Bus you can arrange at the airport. It's plenty comfortable and they store your luggage, but it took us just over 2 hours on a Friday at around 6pm (got to the Hilton shortly after 8). In retrospect, I wish we had taken the subway, although I was so tired from the flight. But that would have saved us at least 30 minutes, maybe more.Overall, I'd absolutely recommend this Hilton.

A friend and I traveled together so the space helped a lot with our month long travel items.2. Concierge service was excellent. I must give a shout out to Yuhsuke Nakamura for all the work he did to help us including tickets and directions to the Tokyo Symphony a couple days before the concert. His help was above excellent standards, even though the desk was very busy with lots of requests, he remained friendly and helpful. 3. The swimming pool/exercise area is stellar. Also, the ""onsen"" facilities in the locker room was an added bonus. Everything was very clean and well stocked with whatever you needed.4. Breakfast: The open buffet style included everything you may want to eat from Western to all Asian styles. It was well displayed and stocked with fresh food including eggs made for you and several types of smoothies.5. Business center has good desktop computers to use for free. See below.Not So Good: 1. I am a Hilton Honors member, but could not find the room I needed on the hilton website. I went to a 3rd party to reserve my room since Hilton reservations said I could still get my points. Now I am being denied by the honors program. Beware if you want points to not believe the reservation people with Hilton. The were not nice in my denial.2. Breakfast: It was a wonderful meal, but the downside was having to wait in line to get a table. After 3 days, they finally opened another dining room and that helped. However, then if I ordered a latte from the coffee bar, it took so long, my food was long eaten by the time it arrived. I like to drink coffee with my meal.3. This is a very busy hotel. Lots of people coming and going all day. 4. No internet in the room unless you paid $16 a day. The lobby connection was spotty and slow with so many people. I discovered the business center and they do have desktop computers for free. Be sure to use one that has an English sign on the bottom edge of the monitor. The Japanese ones do not work for English.

While traveling to Tokyo for work, it was hard to feel like anything more than a number at this hotel given it's massive size and the throngs of people passing through daily. Getting ThereThe most convenient way is to take a shuttle bus directly to the hotel from the airport (with the hotel name written in Japanese). However, since I arrived late at night they could only take me to Shinjuku station, which is a fairly confusing and lengthy walk with luggage in the humid summers. Taxis are way too expensive, so if you do get dropped off near the train station, make sure you have clear instructions in Japanese and English or can get the shuttle bus from the train station. The surrounding location has a Starbucks relatively close as well as other shops and restaurants, but you will have to look for them within other buildings without super clear signage for those not fluent in Japanese. Luckily, this location was very close to my company's Tokyo office, so taking a taxi proved to be the easiest. Common SpacesThe lobby has recently been redone according to the hotel. Upon arrival, I was told that my room type wasn't available in non-smoking, so I was put in a room with two twin beds. However, once my key did not appear to work the first time, the staff did personally escort me to my room to make sure it worked the 2nd time. The areas throughout the hotel all appear clean, but the lobby during the day feels a bit like a zoo with lots of different people including business men, tourists groups and other travelers. The concierge desk right by the door was fairly helpful with finding nearby places to eat and even making reservations. The taxi stand outside also works very efficiently though it's critical to have your destination in Japanese. The breakfast buffet is around $25 USD if it's not included in your room. The Japanese breakfast items and European style pastries are all top notch. The rice dishes and dumplings were worth a 2nd visit daily. The more Western hot breakfast items can be hit or miss depending on the day. The restaurants one floor up from the lobby are very expensive but overall very good. This is where I felt the service exceeded my expectations. Everywhere else felt liek the service was courteous, but due to the size of the hotel, it is virtually impossible to feel any sort of personalized touch here. RoomOther than my key not working the first time, which was a minor inconvenience, the room was well appointed. Daily housekeeping service did a good job. Noise levels were fine though in the mornings yelling children would often awaken me. There wasn't much of a view from the room other than of some tennis courts and other nondescript buidlings. The tea and kettle in the room worked well and the bathroom was updated an modern. It took a little guesswork to figure out how to use the remote for the TV since it was all in Japanese. The elevators were usually speedy but almost always packed with people no matter what hour of the day. OverallI felt this hotel met my expectations but rarely exceeded them. Given the higher cost and distance from Shinjuku station, I would recommend staying in another part of town if you want to feel like you have a chance to soak in the local culture and be closer to other major tourist attractions, even if you're only trying to see them during down time from your work duties.","San Francisco, California",16,3.0

Rooms are large for Japan and the beds were long enough (I'm 6 foot). Clean, modern and the staff are professional and eager to assist. All that we encountered spoke English perfectly. The Concierge managed to effortlessly arrange a Michelin Star restaurant booking for two at very short notice. Sign up for a package that includes the breakfast buffet - it is extensive and delicious and if you're sightseeing, load up and you won't need lunch. Highly recommended.

I also tried Musahino Japanese Restarant and had there Sukiyaki which was delicious but at 13,500 Yen (almost A$150 per person) it is too expensive.","Sydney, Australia",129,2.0

Great location. Check-in was slow, and as it turned out later our booked and confirmed king size bed room wasn't available, so the check-in person gave us queen size bed room (which actually looked like full size) without even letting us know. We dropped our luggage and went sightseeing. When we came back we realized that this is no way king size bed, so we went to the lounge to check if there have been a mistake, and we were told king size not available for this night, but they can put us to the junior suite for two other days with king size bed, and the room was huge comparing to the regular size rooms. The bed though, wasn't king size, but more of queen size. Our suite was by the elevator, so we had trouble falling asleep because it was pretty noisy with guests talking by the elevator after 11pm. The breakfast was good, so as happy hour in the evening. The housekeeping was very good, and concierge was helpful. Airport Limousine was on time and convenient. We also used shuttle to Shinjuku station several times, which was also on time.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates",33,4.0

We took the Airport Limousine bus from Narita directly to the hotel. This cost about $30 per adult and $15 per child. The bus was extremely convenient with the ticketing desk directly next to the baggage claim and the pick up point literally right outside the door. We considered the Skyliner train but that would have involved two transfers on a rail system we were not yet familiar with. So we opted for door to door bus service. It took about two hours but the buses were comfortable coaches with air conditioning so it was not really a big deal.The hotel is a very busy Hilton. There was a line at check-in (we arrived about 1PM) but the service at the front desk was friendly and efficient and we were in our rooms in about 15-20 minutes. The rooms were very nice. Spacious, very clean. They have the cool high tech toilets also. Very nice. Don't be afraid to try it. Your rear end deserves a vacation, too.The hotel is well situated being within an easy walk to the massive Shinjuku train station. They also have a shuttle to the station. From there, you can easily get anywhere once you figure out the somewhat complicated train system. We went everywhere by train. It was cheap and efficient. But there are many lines from different companies, so if you are confused, ask the concierge. They are a great help. You'll figure it out after a ride or two. From Shinjuku its a very short 15 minute ride to the great shopping and dining area of Shibuya. If you want to go to the more pricey Ginza district its about 30 minutes or so with a train transfer. We stayed in a room that had Executive Level access. I highly recommend this if you can especially if you are traveling with a family. It is great to have a place to gather and relax after a long day of sightseeing. Particularly in the summer. When we were there, the outside temperature was in the neighborhood of 105°F. Sweltering. The executive lounge staff was excellent and the lounge provides breakfast each day along with appetizers and drinks in the evening. There are also complementary DVDs that you can take back to your room. This was great for the kids evening wind down.The only thing I didn't care for was the dress code for the Executive Lounge. I have stayed in Hiltons all over the world and I have never experience one with a dress code. Shorts were not allowed. This was made very clear to me (in a friendly way but nevertheless very explicitly) when I first visited the lounge (I was wearing shorts). In addition to the ""No Shorts"" rule, there are additional rules that are provided in writing. The really strange one is ""No Visible Tattoos"". I have since learned that until the post-World War II period, tattoos were illegal in Japan and are still considered somewhat taboo. I don't have tattoos so the rule didn't affect me but it just seemed strange at the time. The good news is that the dress code rule seems to be routinely ignored by visitors to the lounge and I never observed anyone being asked to leave because they were wearing shorts. I never saw anyone in the lounge with visible tattoos. We tried to be the good visitors and always change into long pants before visiting the lounge, but it was really a pain.The restaurants in the hotel were quite good although expensive. There are also many off-premises dining options very near the hotel including some very nice Ramen shops for a relatively inexpensive but tasty meal. Please don't equate Japanese Ramen with the add boiling water into a styrofoam cup version you often find in the US. It's an entirely different experience. The hotel also has a pharmacy right in the lobby which was great when my grandson suddenly got sick to his stomach. The clerk at the pharmacy did not speak very good English (an exception for the hotel) but had a convenient chart of the human body with symptoms. All I had to do was point and she provided me with some kind of interesting pills that I had never seen before. They did the trick, though, and my grandson felt great the next day.So all in all a very nice hotel. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again.",Chicago,26,5.0

Every person we had contact with from the check in, concierge and restaurant staff were eager to please and very helpful. It is close to Starbucks and a small supermarket where you can get snacks, fresh fruit etc.which is helpful for a family. The hotel was able to accommodate adjoining rooms which was wonderful. We are exceptionally fussy with cleanliness and upkeep of hotel rooms and we could not find one thing to complain about.

Weird set up with a rolling blind outside the bathroom which covers the shower! The view was good, pointing towards Shinjuku station, but not spectacular being of some city streets. BREAKFAST Very good selection of Western and Japanese cuisine. Eggs cooked to order a highlight - really top quality. You can get better breakfasts for the money they charge, but definitely not one that you'd turn down if included in the room price. THE FACILITIESRedone to a very high standard internally, the outside areas (and less importantly the facade) feel very dated.

Also, all members of staff we encountered wished my wife a happy birthday – which after 15 hours of travel was delightful.The room was newly refurbished and each day it was spotless. In general we were very pleased with the room – see other posts for room reviews…We took advantage of our jet-lag and had breakfast each day at 0630. This helped to avoid queues for breakfast, which tended to form around 0730. There was a good selection of food (from healthy to not-so-healthy), which was always well presented and topped-up, although on some days could have been warmer. Breakfast-time was ideal for internet-related tasks as internet-access is free around the lobby. Staying at the hotel gives easy access to the Nishi Shinjuku underground station on the Marunouchi Line, although just as easy is getting the every-20-minutes shuttle bus to Shinjuku station (Keio store, #21), from 0800 onwards. On my wife’s birthday, we organised a private room in the Musashino Japanese Restaurant in the hotel. We sat at a low table and were served in a traditional manner by a young lady dressed as a geisha.

Great location, staff is always helpful, and room are nice (although I was told by the exec lounge staff I should try the new refurbished rooms next time). If you have access to the exec lounge, it is still one of the best, evening cocktails are absolutely great, but over crowded with too many people having access. Breakfast at the lounge still one of the best, and downstairs which I haven't had in a while, was really good as I remembered it.Now, the penny pinching. I forgot they have ice machines at the end of hall so I called for ice, and was charged a service fee. They also charged to store luggage as well. For a 5 star hotel, which I considered it to be, I would expect this to be part of the service.Regardless, still would stay here as I love the location and the Hilton points do go a long way.

We (2 teenagers, my husband and I) stayed in an Executive Suite for 4 nights in July. The suite was really spacious, with 2 sleeping areas, great amenities and a sitting room /desk area. The staff were incredibly helpful with any queries. What really made it great were the perks of the Executive floor rooms - you get free breakfast either in the executive lounge or in the lobby (where they have so much choice - smoothie station, eggs cooked to order, hot food, huge continental choice, fresh fruit galore, Japanese options...), you can help yourself to drinks throughout the day in the executive lounge and in the evening you get free alcoholic drinks between 6-8pm with canapes too. There was a really friendly and sociable atmosphere there between the guests and staff.It meant that in those first few jetlagged evenings, we werent confined to our room.There is a free and very regular shuttle to Shinjuku train station (approx 15 min. walk), swimming pool and gym are small but great. We even left our spare luggage for a week for free. The airport shuttle bus goes straight to the hotel which was also great after a long flight.

I can also do a pretty good comparison of the A-Class establishments in Tokyo since I have stayed in the Best of the Best Japan has to offer, so what I am about to write about Hilton Tokyo, Shinjuku, is as accurate as it can be.This was my first stay at the Hilton Tokyo and I stayed there from 09/04 - 09/08 , I arrived late on a flight from Chicago, I arrived to the hotel at around 23:00, upon check-in I was offered a discounted upgrade of my room, I was already in the executive status, but I took it anyways. Aside from the upgrade offer, everything was explained to me in detail, and I am talking about in detail, I got all the information about Breakfast and the Executive Lounge. In addition to that my return travel arrangements were made at the same time, so before I even checked in completely they had me setup for my departure. This is PRICELESS. Let me just say that any worries about the transportation back to the airport where already taken care of and I could not be happier. (Actually, I could I just did not know it yet... read further).The rooms are quite big by any standards with the bedroom and office/living room separated. They are newly renovated from top to bottom, and the second you open the door and walk in, you can smell the freshness and cleanliness of your suite, both rooms are independent controlled for Heat and AC, which was great because I like it super cold at night, and work in a warmer room. I was very tired so I took a shower in a perfectly designed and organized bathroom and went to sleep. The next morning, I knew I had a busy schedule and I had to travel some distances from Tokyo, specifically I had to go to Yokohama which is not a walking distance. I started with the Breakfast at the Marble Lounge ... you will be AMAZED!!! what type of Breakfast is served, you name it they have it, including eggs to order any style, but I chose to go a little more far east and try some of the things that I had no clue how to pronounce, absolutely delicious and unlimited.The next I went back to my room it was then, that I noticed how everything was 100% perfect, I took pictures of all room and sent to my wife to judge. 10 out of 10. I had to go to Yokohama so I got dressed and went down to the lobby where I had my first contact with the Concierge. 100% on top of things, they got me where I need to be ON TIME !!! This is something quite important in Japan. I returned about 8 hours later in a taxi, again greeted by the Staff outside the Hotel on the inside, back up to my room to refresh and then back down to the Marble Lounge where I informed them of my meeting later in the evening with my business clients from Kyoto (also pretty far from Tokyo). The staff at the lounge again was super helpful and allowed me to choose a table in the corner away from the main area or the lobby. The table was held for me when I arrived back with my guests it all went super smooth, having some drinks and light meal. Them being Japanese were also quite impressed with the Hilton . The next day, another trip to another location again quite far so here I go to the Concierge. 10 out of 10 services they put me in a taxi at my request and I get to my meetings and handled my business. I came back to the hotel later that day, went to the Executive Lounge to sit in quiet and go over some business proposals. Staff at the Executive Lounge is top notch!!! Being so satisfied with the services provided I decided that on all of my future trips to Japan, Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku is the only choice, let me just tell you from the experience of a world traveler, skip the others and stay at the Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku, you will not be disappointed. The list of the accolades is 10 pages long, if I was to write everything I would bore you to death, from the lowest level to the highest Executive in the Hilton Chain of Command they are 10 out of 10. I think I have said enough and I will leave it at that. I see there is some nasty reviews here, I just think some of these people have expected the freebies and because they did not get them they are just disgruntled. Now for those of you traveling to Japan for the first time: business or pleasure here is one advise…learn some basic Japanese, it will take you further than you think, as people in Japan are very traditional and I have found the Japanese to be extremely organized, polite and respectful, everybody is super nice, everybody bows and the list goes on. They are 100% devoted and concentrated on the current task, from the moment they wake up they are so involved and dedicated and they are giving 110% to everything that they are doing. A culture is so difficult to understand to foreigners that I did not even try, in a country where people never say no and hardly mean what they say, the art of interpretation is the key to success in Japan.Mariusz Swita","Chicago, Illinois",18,5.0

He even didn't tellme that I needed to make a reservation for the bus until I was skeptical and asked again. I felt like i talked to someone who just didn't want to help.

The room they put me in was newly renovated. so very clean and modern with a view of the rooftop tennis court. oddly enough, one of the bathroom walls was made out of glass and you could see into the bathroom. That was a bit too sexy for me. But they there is a sliding wall thingy that you can pull over the glass wall. The bed was very comfortable, the sheets were cleaned and spotless every time I returned from a day of sight seeing. the only issue I have with this hotel is that when taking the elevator down to the lobby it stopped at every floor, every time. It was kind of crazy!!The in room massage service was a welcomed option after a loon day at Tokyo Disney Sea.The buffet breakfast is fantastic. Something for everyone. I really liked the freshly made fruit juices and smoothies. Oddly enough one of the best meals I had in the hotel was a hamburger topped with egg and a ton of other ingredients. It was easly the best burger i have ever had. It was made medium rare and was made from grounded sirlion steak. just melted in your mouth. The location of the hotel is fantastic. Just a short 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station, Kabuki Cho and all of the lights and energy of tokyo. What really impressed me with this hotel was the fact that they let me leave my bags for 1 week while I toured Okinawa, even though I was not returning to the hotel upon my return to tokyo.

I thought of it as a bad joke. The second time, because I realized some other shortcomings like the sound isolation. This time my room was ""renovated"" (i.e a little layer of white paint in the bathroom) but the building is so old that whatever they do to renovate, the sound issue will never be solved. You can hear footsteps from above, toilet flushing from besides, voice vibrations from below...and sometimes even the super annoying ambiance music from the corridor (elevator style music is for elevator use only!).

The location of the Tokyo Hilton is great for a tourist. It is convenient to get to by using the airport limousine shuttle bus that drops off right at the hotel. You have the Tokyo Metropolitan Towers almost next door. The Shinjuku gardens, about a 20-minute walk, are one of the best in Japan. It is easy to get around Tokyo using the subway connected to the hotel or by walking or taking the shuttle to Shinjuku Station.The concierge/luggage carriers (the line seems blurred at the hotel) were excellent and very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English. The receptionists were professional and quick as well.But now the bad. The hotel is WAY too crowded without the infrastructure to handle the crowds. Most of the lobby area is taken by the restaurant, so there are not many places to sit. If you are waiting for a tour in the morning, most likely you will have to stand. I know space is at a premium in Tokyo, but five star lobbies should have couches, chairs, end tables, etc. Also, while I was there, guests had to wait forever for elevators, and then when you finally got on, they were jammed packed like the Tokyo subway in rush hour, very uncomfortable. It seemed that at least two out of the eight elevators in the lobby were out of order. If the hotel knows that it does not have the infrastructure to run at full capacity, it should cap its room capacity at 75% until it can handle the crowds instead of selling out the whole hotel. Payiing $300+ a night, then having to wait forever for elevators is not right. Also, breakfast is ridiculously expensive at 3400 yen per person.I stayed in a junior suite. The bed was very comfortable, but some of the decor needs updating. For example, there is not a single picture on the wall, and the leather couch was scratched up and uncomfortable. Others things in the room were nicer, such as the Japanese style shutters on the large windows, the nice clock, the long desk, etc. The bathroom is very small and disappointing, with the basic format you expect from an average motel, with the sink on the left, the toilet in the middle, and the bathtub on the right, though the amenities were nice. The walls of the bathroom were were plastic and wallpapered, not at all luxurious.As a tourist in Japan, I liked staying in Shinjuku, but I might choose another hotel, one that doesn't cater so much to huge convention parties and one with better infrastructure. The staff, though, at the Tokyo Hilton is top-notch.","Fairfax Station, Virginia",72,3.0

The good - the staff was friendly and the lobby is nice and typical of the Hilton standard. There are also a lot of choices for meals with several different restaurants on site. The breakfast buffet in the main lobby restaurant has a great selection. There is also a bus service to/from the airport which is very convenient.The okay - the location is decent considering you can walk to the train station and metro stations quite easily. The hotel is in the middle of a business district so if you are in Tokyo for holiday then the location is not ideal.The bad - first the rooms. I had upgraded to a King Jr. Suite as this was my last stop on a six month travel journey and I wanted to splurge. However, the room was completely outdated (note they are doing renovations although I did not see any renovations and do not know the status). The biggest problem with the room was not the outdated style and small bathroom but rather the noise from the guest above me. I heard the guest literally all night long. Granted a guest should be able to do whatever they want in their room and stay up all night but I should not have to hear them. After talking to the front desk staff the next morning, they did move me to a new room. Believe it or not, the room was actually more outdated and in worse shape. And the worst part was that I again, heard the guest above me for the remainder of my stay as well as people next to me (I could actually hear/feel someone snoring in the room next to me). This was very disappointing considering the money I spent on the room.The other problem I had was with my reservation. I booked an advanced pay room and two days before arrival got an email that my credit card wasn't working and I needed to respond. I did giving them my new expiration date on the card (my Honors profile has my Hilton credit card number which had expired). After several emails back and forth they told me that the card still wasn't working and they were reverting me to the normal price which was over $100 more a night. I wrote back again explaining one more time and never heard a response. When I arrived I explained the situation and the front desk person went to ask the reservations manager. Without the long boring details, I spent a very long time at the desk going back and forth with them telling me my credit card wouldn't work so I was going to have to pay the full price (mind you I had been using the credit card across the world at various other Hilton properties for six months and paying the balance every two weeks). I finally asked the front desk person to see if she could run the credit card. She did and it worked which finally proved that the error was on the side of the reservations staff. So that was finally resolved after a lot of time and discussions.Although I will continue to stay at Hilton properties in other countries, I will not return to the Hilton Tokyo. There are too many other choices that I am sure would make for a better stay.","Denver, Colorado",44,2.0

A supermarket was conveniently located just 2 blocks away - great for drinks & even sushi (fresher than the sushi that we've had at suburban restaurants in the USA).As for the hotel, the staff was wonderful - they spoke excellent English, were very welcoming and friendly. The concierge desk was OUTSTANDING. Except for 1 tour, we had opted to plan out our sightseeing on our own. The concierge gave us all the info we needed to have a terrific time in Asakusa & Shibuya/Harajuku, Meiji shrine.Our suite was huge - much larger than suites we've had in NYC where each square foot costs a premium. And the view was spectacular! My only complaint & why I gave only 4 instead of 5 for the rating was the size of the bathroom - very tiny/cramped & nothing special.

I have managed to stay away from Hilton for many years but just checked out from a very nice week at the Hilton Tokyo hotel due to a colleague insisting that we stay ""at this property"" while in town. It was nice. Not over the moon great but nice. First what I liked: The hotel smells good. I did not think that I would ever write those words in a sentence but my goodness it is true at this property. I think that they are pumping out some sort of ""happy smell stuff"" out on the curb and in the lobby. Anyways, it was the last of my 5 senses that I expected to be engaged at a hotel property and it was a pleasant surprise. The room itself was really nice. 2917. Pizza pie shaped room with one 1.5 meter by 1.5 meter window at the narrow end that featured both black out shutters and japanese paper doors. Modern , almost minimalist, design feel to the space. Tan carpet. Bed was firm, pillows were soft (* too soft) and the TV was large. Felt ""opulent"". They offered me lounge access , on the 37th floor, and it was splendid. Nice breakfast with a marvellous coffee machine that ground the beans for your coffee and then made the beverage post haste. We also had cocktails on the 37th floor lounge one night from 6 pm and watched the sun set out the window. Very nice. Overall the lounge is worth the executive room fee that they are charging for this service. What I didn't like: There was a sound , like an alarm clock in another room ( but it wasn't) that was present in the room 24/7. It woke me up, but I had settled into the room by this time so I didn't call and request to change rooms. Earplugs from the plane were called to duty. I told the guy at check out about it, so hopefully they fix it. The bathroom. It was circa 1985 and was in dire need of a re-fresh. Cream coloured tile and a glass door that guaranteed a flood of the bathroom after each use. The elevators: each use of the elevators was a planned event, and included comedy as a bonus. The hotel is apparently updating the elevators at this property to meet new local building codes and they are only running a few of the 6 elevators that they have at once. Every time I tried to use the elevators I either A) was greeted with an elevator that was already full of guests or B) it took a month and a day for an elevator to come. This construction / improvement is apparently scheduled to end in August of 2013. Plan ahead. Overall: I would, and probably will, be back to this hotel ( September 2013?)

To put it in perspective, the Imperial was about $80/night cheaper on my stay, but being a business trip, I needed the location.The food, unfortunately, while respectable, is certainly not deserving of its stratospheric pricing. I have eaten in multiple Michelin starred restaurants in Tokyo and Kyoto and they seemed like bargains compared to Musashino and Dynasty in the hotel.The service is also respectable, but by Japanese standards, nothing special.","Vancouver, Canada",72,4.0

First time in the King Executive. Check in is usually busy on the ground floor; however, with an executive room booking the hotel will register you on the 37th floor (executive lounge). Check in was efficient. Staff were friendly. Was given a room on the 36th floor; hence, it was quite convenient as I was able to access the executive lounge using the designated stairs (located by the lifts).The room:Contemporary, neat and today. King size bed was comfortable. Great glass top desk with much improved internet connection (the Hilton was undergoing some internet connection upgrades when I stayed in, I believe, 2011 - much better now). Bathroom is not spacious; however, is clean and has great amenities. Enjoyed using the Gatsby shaving gel... quite soothing. The housekeeping staff are generous and will replenish your amenities daily (that's if you use them). Above all else, as I was on the 36th floor, I had a wonderful view of Shinjuku. Quite impressive at night.Executive Lounge:As I was busy at work or attending client dinners, I rarely visited the executive lounge BUT the few times I had breakfast, I enjoyed thoroughly. Great selection of carbohydrates (i.e. pastries, toast), dairy, Japanese food, Western food, etc. Suggest sitting by the window - wonderful view of Tokyo... that's if it's not raining.Restaurant:Rarely eat at the hotel restaurants in Tokyo (born and raised so I know all the good and cheap places) BUT I do enjoy their Chinese (Dynasty Restaurant... I believe). Not cheap but good food. As for the other restaurants... sorry, can't comment as I have never tried. Other benefits:Free bus service to Shinjuku Station. Runs every 20 minutes and drops you off at the station. Runs on time and can save you some money. Location:Very convenient. Family Mart and 7-Eleven (convenience stores) close by. Several restaurants within walking distance. Tokyo Metro station entrance located on the ground floor.What disappointed me:As the Hilton Tokyo was undergoing lift refurbishment work during my stay... the wait was quite long. Minor issue but was quite annoying when I was in the rush. Overall, no complaints. Would be staying again in October/November 2013.","London, United Kingdom",24,5.0

It was a solid experience in every regard. During my stay, the Hilton Tokyo rose to the occasion and showed me its absolute best of customer relations when dealing with an unfortunate misunderstanding that had occurred. The person who made the mistake first called me to take responsibility and to apologize. Overnight, the head of room service (which is the division that made the error) had a letter written to me and put under my door taking full responsibility and apologizing. It appear that half of the hotel staff and much of senior management, led by Helene Jacoby, spent the next day and a half on the lookout for me (I left for work before 7 a.m. and did not return until 9 p.m.) in order to apologize. When Helene finally hunted me down the following morning, she explained to me the scope of the ""manhunt"" they had been doing for me, and then she personally took full responsibility and apologized and offered to do whatever I wanted to ""make it right"". Silly me, I should have asked for a free night or an upgrade to the Presidential Suite. Instead, I settled for her apology and five dollars to reimburse the actual cost of the food for my special kosher diet that room service had destroyed and that I had no way to replace. But I still came out of this experience a happy guest, because the Hilton Tokyo showed that they really cared about my issues and my concerns and were not going to rest until they addressed them.

Our room was a suite with a king bed in a separate room. We had a very good view on a high floor; the room was incredibly spacious to accommodate one rollaway bed and our other child slept on the sofa (very wide and comfortable). A few highlights for us: 1. Proximity to a local market, Maruetsu is a supermarket opened 24/7 and has everything needed for late night sushi to the diversity of drinks; 2. Concierge, Mr. Shimano, was incredibly helpful and articulate to navigate us thru the complexity of Japan metro and get us to our destinations; 3. Walk or shuttle to Shinjuku train station (we did both); 4. Bus shuttle, VERY affordable, to take us directly to Haneda airport (or Narita). I loved the suite setup; bathroom could be bigger, but a minor issue; more plus plus and very comfortable bedding.

We had 2 executive rooms booked and arrived early in the morning. We were told I could have the suite straight away if I did an immediate upgrade of one of the rooms. When I declined, I was further offered a better rate if I did. When I declined again, he gave up and kindly offered my room by 11am instead of the expected 2pm. We had just been travelling the last 24hrs from Melbourne and were slightly exhausted so that was appreciated. I was also beginning to feel rather unwell, more of that later, so they held our luggage and we did a bit of walking to the Shinjuku station and orientation to our whereabouts.That evening my husband was more than a little annoyed when told he was not suitably dressed for the executive lounge because he had on a pair of white leather sneakers. He was attired in long sleeved shirt, long pants and just happened to have on a pair of very clean sneakers (leather) as we were on holiday and were planning to do a lot of walking. Others in the lounge were in flip flops, grubby sport shoes from the gym and even in shorts but did not seem to be told they were improperly dressed.The real test came however the next day when I fell seriously ill and needed to go to the doctor and then to hospital. They were very helpful in calling around for a suitable clinic and to arrange for a female staff member from concierge, Ms Hoshino, to accompany and translate for us the entire day. The next day I was still unwell and they again helped us to call around for an English speaking doctor who was available on a Saturday. Fortunately we found one who managed to assist us in Shinagawa. The Japanese health care system was foreign to us and we actually found it very difficult to get adequate medical assistance. Hilton did not seem to have an in house doctor who could see me and triage me accordingly. Even my travel insurers did not seem to have a list of recommended English speaking doctors. There did not seem to be any A&E I could go to either and the issue of language would then probably have been a major issue if there were.In all it was a little bit of a disaster as I was in a lot of unnecessary pain due to the inability of the first 2 doctors who saw me to adequately manage my problem. It was only the 3rd doctor I saw on Saturday who finally acted more aggressively and managed to give me adequate pain relief. I speak as a medically trained person myself.On other matters, the food in the executive lounge for breakfast and afternoon tea and evening canapes were good. The staff were always helpful in serving drinks and taking final orders before close of the bar. Due to my illness I did not have the opportunity to use the gym nor pool but it did look very inviting.The free shuttle to and from Shinjuku station was very timely and efficient. Goto San, the manager of the executive lounge, even gave us some information on Kyoto for our onward journey after our 5 day stay.We used the luggage forwarding service through the hotel to our next hotel in Kyoto and everything went smoothly with our luggage already waiting for us when we arrived in Kyoto the next day.","Melbourne, Australia",82,4.0

I fully appreciate that this is a high quality property, but, in this case, the service that I received was below standard. First of all, the in-room WiFi did not work on ANY of my devices, and after I contacted the hotel I was directed to call the support centre myself. The call took about 40 minutes, and the general idea was that the problem was most likely to be inside the hotel, and they needed to reset the system a few times. Luckily for me the problem was resolved, and with best intentions in mind I informed the reception about the problem, and tried to provide them the support ticket number, so the hotel could resolve the problem for future guests. However, to my surprise, no one at the reception was interested, and they tried to explain that the IT system operates separately from the hotel.The next morning, I awoke especially early to make up for the time I had lost the night before, and to my surprise, the WiFi did not work for me once again. I contacted the receptionist, and, to my second surprise of the morning, I was directed to the tech support line yet again. In the end, the fact that I had lost a lot of my own time fixing their internet did not phase or concern anyone at the hotel. In the end I demanded a new room, as, at this stage, I understood, from my conversations with the support line, that the problem was connected to the room itself. My third surprise for the morning was that in the new room, everything was working fine.I find it hard to believe that the staff didn’t know about that the WiFi wasn’t working in some rooms, and do not appreciate the fact that absolutely no action was taken until I demanded a new room.Later in the morning, after I arrived in my new room I found a welcome message on my table from the General Manager Jamie [---], unfortunately the message was not addressed to me but some other guest. I again contacted reception, and the lovely girl at the reception was confused and promised to look into the mix up, and to my next surprise, nothing happened over the rest of my three day stay.This is my own experience, and is probably the product is a series of unfortunate events, however, a few more observations I had over my stay are similarly unpleasant. For instance, the staff at the executive lounge would routinely forget orders, the staff in the 1st floor bar would make some rather obvious mistakes in orders, and the most annoying problem was the elevator, which would take up to 15 minutes to just reach your floor. I have seen that in previous reviews, the management staff explained that the elevator will be in full service in a few weeks, but that makes no difference to me, as it affects my visit and the visit of many other guests, who have no intention to return in a few weeks. So, all in all, I understand that this is a high quality property, but it is let down by repeatedly low quality services, which does not correspond to the prices they are charging.","Tauranga, New Zealand",74,3.0

The breakfast buffet was wonderful and if one arrived early enough it was also peaceful. It does get very busy from 8am onwards, this however did not seem to impact the quality of the food or the service in any way. The location is in the business area of Shinjuku making it very quiet. On a number of occasions we walked to the subway station without encountering another person - quite unexpected. The hotel is serviced by two subway lines and a free shuttle is available to Shinjuku Station. We did not take advantage of all their facilities as we preferred to explore Tokyo from morning till night but all the standard major hotel chain facilities are available. The service, as one expects from Tokyo, is excellent. In particular, the concierge service was outstanding. We challenged the concierge service with many unreasonable requests, such as a reservation at Sukiyabashi Jiro, where tables are booked out at least a month in advance. Much to our surprise and delight, the concierge delivered. Our many other requests, while not quite as unreasonable as an immediate reservation at Jiro's, were nonetheless challenging and the staff delivered on every count.

For example additional hidden costs may be ""shower fee"", ""bath fee"", ""person tax per night"" and other miscellaneous taxes depending on where you stay. However at Hilton, as we booked directly from Hilton's website, every type of fee which could be one's nightmare was included in the price - which gave me the peace of mind.Check-in was fine, not immediate however, even though there were 3-4 staff at the counter (and all were active and with guests) - a sign that the hotel has a high occupancy rate. As HH Gold, we were offered an upgrade to the exec floor - but a smoking room. We declined the upgrade, nevertheless, were offered free buffet breakfast at the restaurant. We were given a room on a very high floor which was very nice - overlooking the park and also to an office building some 500m away - and on that clear afternoon I could see as far as some 6-10 nautical miles. The view was definitely amazing for a city hotel if you get one of the rooms on the top-most floors. Room and toilet was very clean, bed extremely comfy and representative of other Hiltons. As HH Gold, there was no additional charge to use the hot bath or gym, or swimming pool. Note to fellow travellers: at other hotels we had to pay an additional charge to use these facilities even though these facilities were all within the same hotel. I must say this is where the value of HH comes in. Buffet breakfast was top-notch - definitely one of the highlights of our trip. From Japanese cuisine to crusty French croissants, from freshly blended fruit juice to made-to-order omelette -it is a breakfast heaven! Staff at the Hilton Tokyo spoke fluent English which was a big plus - unlike some other hotels we stayed at. However the staff at concierge gave us mixed feelings - where 1-2 staff were not sufficiently helpful (but merely pointed to information brochures) while the others were patient in explaining routes/tours, etc. Location was very good, but not perfect. Very good because it was located in the business district of the city; not perfect because it was some 7-10 minutes (off-peak) by shuttle bus to Shinjuku train station. That said, Hilton provided complimentary shuttle to-and-fro the bus pick-up point near Shinjuku train station. If you choose to walk, Hilton is probably a 30-minute stroll to Odakyu and Keio - the boutique shopping complexes (thereabouts) above Shinjuku train station.All in all, Hilton Tokyo was an excellent base for travel around Tokyo, Shinjuku and even a few stations out of Shinjuku. If you are planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea, stay at Hilton Tokyo Bay instead of Hilton Tokyo and save the 1+ hour (one-way) public transport (plus complimentary shuttle) travel time.

One short block away (I don't know the name of the street, but in the direction of Denny's and the park) is a very nice mini-mart - a big step up from a 7-11 - where you can purchase snacks, wine, sushi and breakfast food the night before to store in the room's mini-fridge.

Cannot think of improvement except for the several elevators which run from G/F to 38/F – perhaps the hotel is too busy, quite often I had to wait for 5 min+ to get in the elevator on 35/F, and another 5 min+ ride to get to G/F as it usually stopped 10 times+ before arriving G/F. Luckily we didn’t pick the Deluxe room on 14/F – I’m sure those on the lower floors will be much more frustrated by the elevators. But I am aware that 1-2 elevators were out of order, maybe the problem will be solved soon.Highly recommended, will definitely come again.","Hong Kong, null, Hong Kong",12,5.0

Whenever we're in Tokyo, we normally stay at the Hyatt in Shinjuku. This time we decided to stay at the Hilton and there were so many obvious differences in the quality of service, it was unbelievable. Right off the bat, we started on a bad note. 24 hours prior to arriving at the hotel, my husband called the hotel in Japan, not the 1-800 number, to verify our reservation. The Hilton rep could not find our reservation and after some time, they finally fixed it. (Foreshadowing???) They eventually confirmed our two, king sized, non-smoking rooms. After 8 hours plane travel from Hawaii and a 1.5 hr bus ride from Narita, we arrived at the hotel to be told that all they had available for us were smoking rooms. My daughter and I each have asthma. This would not do. Strike ONE. For more than 30 minutes, my husband tried to work with the front desk person to find a suitable room. The best they could scrounge up for us was two non-smoking rooms with twin beds. Meanwhile my oldest daughter was not feeling well and ended up falling asleep on one of the lobby benches as we waited. Finally, I stood up, walked over to the Front Desk and demanded the Front Desk remedy this problem. They screwed up our reservation twice now and why should we have to accept twin sized beds? I told her to fix the problem immediately even if she had to upgrade us to a suite. But to wait 30 minutes for a room was not acceptable. Finally, after I loudly confronted her, she found two rooms on the 20th floor where one room was ready and that we could have the second room in 45 minutes after they cleaned it. We agreed to this. They told us that they would send someone up with the key when the room was ready. It took a total of 50 minutes to finally get upstairs to a room. My question is why did it take 45 minutes to come up with a suitable solution and only after I had to raise my voice and demand for it? Since my daughter was feeling ill and sleeping on the lobby bench my patience had run thin. After 1.5 hours of waiting and waiting in the one ready room, we finally called downstairs for status on the second room. Well guess what? The room was ready and no one came up to bring us the key as promised. Strike TWO. Several hours later, we went to dinner and went back upstairs to our room. The key did not work. Sigh........... we had to go downstairs again to get the card re-keyed. Strike THREE!!! At this point, we were upset. When we went to get the card re-keyed, we asked to speak to a manager. We waited 10 minutes and finally the Shift Leader came to speak to us. He was polite and apologetic and told us that he would relay our concerns to the Manager. At no time did upper management ever acknowledge our complaint. It should be noted that during our stay the elevators were being renovated. So of the 6 elevators in the tower, only two worked. Getting upstairs or downstairs was a grind as many times the elevator was packed and you could not even get on. The room itself was clean. There was a nice bed with a crisp, white, comfortable duvet. They get points for this. The size was adequate, I did not feel cramped. Housekeeping did a great job. The workout room was great. There seemed to be an adequate number of machines. There was water, clean towels, and even ear phones available. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle service that runs from the hotel to the Shinjuku Train station comes by every 20 minutes. This was useful. We ate our breakfast daily at the lobby restaurant. The breakfast buffet was quite varied and delicious. Service was always excellent. If only the front desk staff was not so clueless, our stay would have been perfect.","Honolulu, HI",61,3.0

First, let me clarify - as far as U.S. travelers are concerned, the lobby is quite adequate and I would not have given it a second thought. The room did have a straight back rocket ship chair which could have been a prop in a 70's Bond movie and also had sliding panel windows but the room was spectacularly clean and comfortable. Also, the windows were marvelously large giving a truly great view of the streets and people especially for early risers. The pool is a bit smaller than the one at the Hilton Narita Airport - which probably has the best hotel pool that I have seen in 4 continents - but is quite adequate. That's about all regarding the concerns that I had heard about.Now the good stuff - - Firstly, great staff. Very courteous, always trying to help and very willing to make suggestions (Ask for tea bags and creamer at 3:00 Am and you get it promptly with a smile and a bow).- Probably either the best or second best breakfast buffet that I have ever seen (keep in mind the 4 continents remark above). Great Continental preparations, perfect omelettes 4 days in a row, great scrambled eggs, fresh fruit including ice cold litchis, great local yog(h)urt, fresh fruit juices and smoothies, emphatically the best hot chocolate I've ever had, decent breads, etc- Rooms were quite comfortable with a nice firm mattress. quite spacious even for p90x workouts; smallish bathroom but not inconvenient.- The GM, Jamie Mead, manages the hotel well and is well liked by this staff. He is receptive to constructive input and will address any valid issues. - Really nice amenities - much better quality than that offered by their American properties.- Nice gym with a quiet section for those who are looking for some seclusion.There is a free shuttle to the station and a paid shuttle (you can charge it to your room) to the airport. There is an underground shopping area with stores which are reasonable in terms of prices and restaurants. However, many of them are cash only i.e. no credit cards so exchange the money at a post office or bank when possible. Nice restaurants including Denny's which can be reached by walking a few minutes. Internet can be pricey but free if you are Gold or higher.

A few of the staff members are simply outstanding and I would like to hire them myself, while others are simply awful. Some of the rooms have been upgraded in the sleeping areas, and not the bathrooms! Imagine gold fixtures, etc. The executive lounge is nice and accommodating. The wifi is spotty at best in the rooms. The food in the restaurants is mediocre and expensive. There is much better food in the area. The elevators are HORRIFIC! They take forever and if your are on one of the top floors, it can be very frustrating. I leave my room at least 10 minutes before I have to be in the lobby! It's that bad.

The front desk at check in was mess too many guests waiting and even though some guests taking extra time the management did not provide more personnel to the front desk and they do not have the dedicated position for the Hilton Honors silver and above. It was first unpleasant experience at any Hilton properties. They assigned us the renovated room but the shower partition was only covers a half length of bath tub and took some skill not the bathroom floor wet. Some refurbishment idea makes Me wonder. And 3 out of 6 elevators to the rooms and pool, spa was unavailable for the construction and so I asked at the check out and the bell desk, they could not give me even a ball park of schedule.The bar at the ground floor was good as usual, not the fixed menu like other hotels in Japan. And I must confess their complementary Wasabi nuts for the cocktail is better than one the Business and First class of Airlines.I did not see anybody brushing teeth at the washing area at the spa.The several commuter trains are inter connected since last April, so more and more shops, restaurants and department stores in the Shinjuku area are competing - not just price, also the quality and variety. Since land dispute between Japan and China, some 30 to 40% less Tour Groups from China buys everything ""Made in Japan"", any large retail and airport, right now less you need to fight this crowd.","Las Vegas, Nevada",57,4.0

The shuttle bus to the train station works well, goes every 20mins. the only suggestion for this hotel would be to provide information on the shuttle bus timetable flyer (which we received at check in) that the bus departs from near the west exit of the station. we had a huge amount of trouble finding the bus stop, and asked about 10 locals where the 'Keio department store' that was listed on the flyer was, none of them knew or could understand our english . we walked in circles for 30mins before finally locating it. for our stay (4 nights) there was just 1 lift working, it was extremely frustrating and often meant waits of 10+ mins in the morning peak.

Shinjuku is the busy buzzing centre of Tokyo and when you find your way around you will know what I mean. I have stayed in the Hilton on several occasions over the past couple of years and this place is up there with the best of Japan's top branded hotels. I like the space I was always given, a large room that was a great plus amongst Japanese hotels that are usually very small in comparison to western standards. Clean and immaculate with good daily service. The Gym was modern and adequate with a good sized pool next door. I had a tattoo on my upper right arm that I simply covered with tube grip bandage and this was not a problem. Many hotels in Japan will simply ban you immediately from using facilities with tattoos. So I was thankful to the leisure staff team for there compromise and letting me swim. Food was great, breakfast was very good, although I ate out most of the times I stayed here. There was free wi fi in the lobby or business lounges but charged if needed in the room. This seems to be a Global Hilton policy not just here in Tokyo. I personally believe like many other hotels I frequent around the globe, Hilton group should make the Wi Fi complimentary in the rooms. Traveling business men and women will empathise with this. The British themed St George's bar is on the ground floor near lobby. Its quite a chilled out place that has jazz style live entertainment on many evenings, with food and an array of beverages.There is a Metro station entrance across the road, ensure you have a map or one of the many great telephone apps if you don't know Tokyo. The Concierge desk are extremely helpful, polite and knowledgable, so ask for there advice. Most of the staff had very good English and were still very understanding and encouraging when I practiced my Japanese (Nihongo). Taxis in Japan are immediately available but are very expensive in Japan, the concierge staff will assist you in ensuring the drivers no exactly where they are going. Airport Limousine bus service is excellent as is all public transport in the area.I, personally, have nothing but good to say about this place. The staff were always helpful, polite and proficient in all that I asked of them. This is clearly a very busy place (by japanese standards) and one should be forgiven sometimes if the concierge are not immediately there at the click of the fingers due to them already at full throttle dealing with the large amounts of customer demands. Credit to the staff from an experienced observer who can tell when working people are quite clearly giving their all during very demanding busy periods of the year. So much so that I believe some of the other negative reviewer comments are unwarranted in their comments whereby as such their comments would be equally the same in any other hotel under the same circumstances.In summary a great friendly efficient hotel that is reasonably priced in comparison to the hotel competitors. There were many staff here I have met over the years and would if I could single them all out for their great service; so apologies for not doing that. However, Two that I have met on every occasion and are like friends to me are Kaori Hayashi San and Azusa Seshimo San, two ladies who have shown exemplary professional service during all my stays and always managing to make me feel uplifted even during my bad business days, a challenge in itself, well done.",United Kingdom,75,5.0

We had some concerns about the service and the breakfast because of previous reviews. However, being Hilton Honors members we chose the Hilton over other nice properties in the area. We must say we were extremely pleased with our choice. The service was exceptional from every department. After a VERY long trip from Orlando, Florida (17 hours in the air) we arrived tired and cranky. The front desk was courteous and quick. The breakfasts were extraordinary... American (eggs, bacon, waffles, pancakes, fruit bar, bakery bar etc.) Japanese (miso, rice, fish, seaweed, kelp etc.) Juice/Smoothie bar (delicious healthy concoctions of fruit, vegetables and the sorts) and of course a variety of both teas and coffees got the morning off to a good start. The servers were considerably better then expected and really highlighted ""Japanese Hospitality"".However, the best thing about this particular hotel has got to be the concierge staff. Since we both travel extensively to foreign countries we rely heavily on the knowledge and support of the people behind the concierge desk and in this department the Hilton Tokyo excelled. For example, we were told by a different hotel's concierge staff that there was no ""Dressage"" in Tokyo. The Park Hyatt staff was at least aware of the riding stable but was convinced that there was NO public access. After returning to our hotel we asked Aoki-san to look into the matter. After a quick search on the net and a phone call she produced completely different information. We are pleased to share that she alone was absolutely accurate. A foreigner can get a riding lesson in Dressage at the Tokyo Riding Club, and do it in English! This is just one example of how accurate information can change the course of a trip and we owe many thanks to Aoki-san for doing a great job every single morning. Whether business or pleasure we recommend this property for its helpful and knowledgeable staff.","Orlando, Florida",2,5.0

The only physical area we thought they might improve was the condition of some of the fixtures in the bathroom where years of high occupancy have started to show.

We often packed sandwiches and fruits and yoghurts for the rest of the day too..(Please note, there are no highchairs at this hotel so if you have a baby, then pack a travel one).There is a metro station beneath the hotel which proved really useful when travelling around Tokyo (we didn't use a taxi, but loved hopping on a train and exploring the fabulous city).We stumbled across a really interesting flea market one Sunday morning, it is next to the hotel, so check it out (opposite the green tower where Starbucks is located). We also made great use of the free shuttle tfrom the hotel o the Shinjuku which was really convenient. Also, grab a map and make sure you know the basics of where you want to go as some places simply don't speak English.The hotel staff was impeccably polite and courteous throughout.An excellent hotel and stay and we will certainly go back.","Singapore, Singapore",9,5.0

We also appreciated that the hotel provided a roll-out bed for the third person, we were 3 adults sharing without being asked - the room was a little cramped it was true after the addition of the third bed but this was more than compensated by the fact that the beds were all very comfortable.Reception was efficient albeit a little slow but I think that this was due to so many people checking into the hotel at the same time. This was also a problem with the lifts, which was made worse by the fact that 2 were out of action due to maintenance.We had to go to Tokyo SkyTree urgently and concierge was able to assist very effectively - plus everyone that we came into contact with spoke fair to excellent English, not always the case in Japan.The rooms were immaculate, again with the correct number of towels and toiletries provided and replenished every day, again not always the case in Japan, especially for triple share. Housekeeping I think did a great job.Location was excellent, in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo - very close to Tochomae subway, albeit a little far from main stations like Shinjuku, although a periodic shuttle was provided from the hotel to Shinjuku free.The only small issue that stops this hotel from being perfect was that when I asked for our flights to be re-confirmed for me the lady at the bell desk was perfectly willing to oblige - by calling the airline concerned from 9am and then handing the phone over to me to re-confirm myself. I'd ask the question of her at around 7am on a weekday.She advised me that it seemed that the airline re-confirmation office was only open from 9-5pm (for Korean airlines) and thus it was only possible to do any sort of re-confirmations during that time. Unfortunately due to day tours it was not possible for me to be at the hotel during those hours, thus I was prepared to perform the re-confirmations myself. I was a little surprised that I'd be expected to re-confirm myself in essence since this was a service advertised by the hotel. The assistance from the bell desk seems to be just ringing the airline concerned - which to be frank I could have done myself.I ended up ringing the airline myself on another date (around 10pm from my mobile) and was advised by the surprised airline that their re-confirmation line are opened 24/7. Perhaps the lady who assisted me was not trained about this - at all times she was most willing to help to the best of her ability. Perhaps training in this area can be improved, unless I was expecting too much as far as this service was concerned.It is definitely worth it to reserve an Executive room if you can since Executive Lounge access is included plus their excellent breakfast. The Lounge itself was small and thus it may be necessary to go early to ensure access to the Lounge because it does get very busy sometimes.Internet was also free for Executive rooms, not the case for Standard rooms.I did not eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel, there were plenty of nearby eateries that seemed to be cheaper.In summary I'd definitely stay at the Hilton Shinjuku again - service was excellent and staff also spoke very good to excellent English.","Sydney, Aust",95,4.0

On a Sunday afternoon the trip was slightly less than the advertised two hours. We considered the express train, which would have saved some time, but would have required getting from Shinjuku station to the hotel somehow, and with a lot of luggage, the train is not a great option. The return trip to the airport on a Tuesday afternoon took about an hour and a half.From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the service was generally excellent, as one would hope for from a Hilton hotel, and as one would generally expect at high-end Tokyo hotels. Check-in was quick and pleasant, and the front desk clerk was happy to allow for a late check-out on our day of departure. The concierge was helpful and efficient in booking our return to the airport. The one exception to the service being excellent was in the lobby restaurant during breakfast (3600 yen per person for the buffet… yikes), where the servers seemed overwhelmed, and it took quite some time to get our bill, even after giving our room number twice to the same person (once before we sat down and once when we finally were able to flag someone down).The room was very good, not excellent. My guess is that we were in a room that had not yet been refurbished, but I’m not sure. Everything was clean and in good working order. Decent drawer space, although not great. In-room safe was a good size and easy to use. The bed was very comfortable. Quite large flat screen TV at the foot of the bed, where it belongs (but where not every hotel puts it). The desk provided a good working area.Bathroom was fine, although not particularly large. Shower in tub had adjustable shower head (nothing special) and a hand sprayer. Toilet had standard Japanese attachment on the seat. Everything was fine, just not excellent.In-room wi-fi was fast and reliable, although we had some issues with having to log in (and pay the daily rate) more often than we should have. However, a quick discussion at the front desk before checking out resulted in the appropriate adjustment. Wi-fi is free in the lobby; I see that other reviewers reported slow speeds but at busy times; when we tried it (at an off-peak time) it was fine.Hotel’s location was fine for us, but might be very good instead of excellent for some travellers. It’s about a 15-minute walk to Shinjuku metro station and shopping area, and we enjoyed the walk, but some may not like having to do that in order to get to a busy area (there’s very little right around the hotel), and you may not want to depend upon the hotel’s periodic shuttle to and from the station. Alternatively, it’s only about a 5-6 minute walk to Nishi-shinjuku station, which is on just one line, so it’s closer but may then require a transfer depending upon where you’re going. Both stations are accessible underground from the hotel, which is very convenient especially in bad weather.Check-out was quick and smooth.No real complaints, and I happily give the hotel a “very good” rating.","Toronto, Canada",47,4.0

The executive lounge is spacious enough that it never felt too crowded (a pervasive Hilton issue these days, it seems), the food selection was excellent and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Moreover, the hotel is clean, the beds are comfortable, the rooms are modern and nice and the common areas are kept up nicely.Regarding the location, I love nishi-Shinjuku; directly north of the hotel is the Nishi-Shinjuku metro stop on the Marunouchi Line; just south of the hotel is the Tochomae stop on the Oedo Line. Both of these lines - as well as a hotel shuttle and your two feet - will take you to the Shinjuku Station nearby, which then opens up a whole new world of travel options (busiest train station in the world.) Additionally, a host of great food options await in close proximity to the hotel, including the Hiltopia shopping and dining experience directly beneath the hotel.

Wifi in the room is great (and despite being USD18 for 24hrs - which I personally do not find to be expensive at all) however the wifi (free) in the lobby is slower than the backroads of Tibet (maybe because there were so many people there at the time.We have never stayed in a Hilton hotel before today and you can rest assured it will be our hotel of choice in the future.

Unlike most parts of Tokyo, front staff at hotels speak English so that calmed my fears. We had requested a king-sized bed but due to the hotel being at full capacity because of all the rugby competitions & various other events, we were given a queen but the front desk sent chocolates & wine up to our room (SWEET!).Room was recently remodeled & shower door only covered half of the tub, which was just a teeny bit odd & made the water from the showerhead spill out onto the floor every single time we showered. I didn't understand the concept but was told that it was a modern touch to the bathtub...flat screen TV with mostly Japanese channels with a handful of English-speaking channels...bed was comparable to ones at other nice hotels except the pillows were a bit too firm for me (as I'm used to memory foam ones). The shoji paper sliding door partition was a nice touch that replaced traditional draperies. I got a kick out of the toilet, with its water-spritzing features, which are everywhere in Japan but seldom seen in the U.S. There are complimentary toothbrushes & toothpaste that is part of the freebies in the bathroom. I wished that more U.S. hotels would have these items as standard ones along with the shampoo & conditioner.Very convenient location with free shuttle service that runs every 20 mins (super convenient & VERY punctual) early in the morning to around 9pm at night from the hotel to the large Shinjuku train station. There is also a train station right outside the hotel as well. We walked everywhere & used the rail & subway systems...just let someone at the info booth know where you're going & they can tell you how much to pay & which # train to hop on (simple to navigate; do not be scared). Also, if you did not pay enough or too much, they have a readjustment station so that you can either pay more or get a refund.Only downside to the hotel was that they were renovating/remodeling when we stayed there so only 2 of the 6 elevators operated at one time which required waiting of up to 10 minutes (the trick is to just go up & then come down...do NOT just press the down button & hope you'll get on...by the time it comes down to you, it will be filled with all the people on top levels trying to come down as well). One time there were too many people waiting so I just took the stairs down (going down is always easier than going up). Also, there was construction noise from the other rooms during the afternoon hours.","Orange County, California",43,5.0

You can also go to Shinjuku station and get a free Hilton shuttle every 10 mins. There is not much touristy stuff right near you, but a short train or 15 minute walk and the options are endless. The hotel is in a business district, but accessibility made this a non issue.We were warmly welcomed by the check in staff and they went above and beyond. It's always nice to get more than just ""passport and credit card"" fromcheck in staff. I commend them on their exceptional customer service.The rooms are contemporary, large and comfortable. We arrived back in the middle of our room servicing one day and the staff member was so gracious and sped through her work (which she didnt need to as we weren't fussed). She was delightful and extremely courteous. Again, I commend the hotel on training the room staff for exceptional customer service.I would have given this hotel a perfect rating except for a few small issues which normally I would deal with, except that this is a large international hotel that should not have these issues. When we first arrived we needed a good coffee and saw the lobby had a barista so we headed there. The waiter who was European approached us and we asked for 2 Machiato's. His response was a curt 'it's to on the menu'. As I saw a barista I suggested that they could probably do it for us and he again said, not, it's not on the menu. That irritated me so much I just got up and walked out. I've thought about this and I know under normal circumstances that would be petty and irrelevant and have just dealt with this, but this is a Hilton and a Europen waiter should have plugged his brain in and sailor led it out. Maybe he had a bad day, maybe I did, but hat was bad form and I've written this so the Managment knows how one little thing can become an irritant.Anyway, to put it in perspective, the hotel is fabulous, all other staff memebers were exception (we ate one dinner in one of the restaurants as well as breakfasts) so I would definatley recommend this hotel","Melbourne, Australia",164,4.0

On arrival after a long flight, we were efficiently checked in on the 37th floor and given a superb room with fantastic views. Breakfast had every type of offering you could think of, and the hotel had recognised it was an anniversary trip with gifts in the room. A nice touch! Unfortunately, while exploring Tokyo on our first morning, my wife had a bad fall and injured her leg. On returning to the hotel, staff recognised that we were in trouble and litterally rushed to assist. They helped us contact our travel insurance company and proceeded to search for an English speaking doctor, which was near impossible on a Sunday afternoon. However, the hotel is perfectly situated near to a hospital and one of the concierge staff volunteered to come with us to act as an interpreter. This became essential, as few of the nursing staff or doctors spoke english, and all the forms were only in Japanese! She stayed with us way past her shift, till my wife had been seen to and we returned to the hotel. That is service! Over the next day or so she and other staff assisted in cancelling tours before our medical flight home. A great hotel is more than its rooms, its decor and location, the helpfulness, courtesy and patience of staff, when your in need, makes this hotel in my mind better than 5 stars.

In additional to the typical breakfast juice selections, the hotel breakfast has a fresh squeezed juice and smoothie shot bar, which is unique compared to the many other hotels that I've visited around the world. I've found firmer beds to be the norm in Japan, which is the case at this hotel as well. I believe that it is a local preference.

Very good hotel as Hiltons go internationally, with nicely appointed rooms and all of the amenities and services you expect from a Hilton. Food and drinks in the hotel restaurant can be pricey (USD$10 for a latte), so be sure to consider any specials they offer you when you check in to reduce the costs of breakfast or other meals. Wifi is free in the lobby but not in the rooms. The closest subway station is the Nishi-Shinjuku station with the Marunouchi running through it - you can pretty much get anywhere from there by transferring to other lines, but keep in mind that the trains that run through this station are not JR lines, so if you buy a Japan Rail Pass, these trains aren't covered. The nearest station with a JR line is Shinjuku, but that is a pretty good walk (20-25 minutes) if you are looking to avoid the 160 yen fare to get from Nishi-Shinjuku to Shinjuku.

The lobby seemed to always be busy, but had a very sleek feel to it. Customer service was great, always conducted with a smile.Now why did I give only a 3/5? Well, for starters, it really annoys me when no drip coffee is offered in the room. I know it's Japan, but it should be standard for the price of the room. Also, like 99% of the other guests have already stated, it's stupid to have to pay 1600 yen per night for wireless, what a scam! Also, there are no English newspapers offered, let alone left every morning under the door like others we've seen. A small annoyance was the check in lady... Many real high end hotels will address you by your professional name....so normally they would address my wife by doctor. She did not, and called her Ms even though we are married lol.Last, my wife and I were shocked that even though there were onsens available (I've done several throughout Japan) and a lap pool specifically for laps, there was nothing available for us to share a hot tub.

The check-in went smoothly, which was welcome.That, however, was the highlight of my trip. (I actually kept a list!)Yes, the rooms are large - quite large - for Tokyo or any other major city, but the hotel is stuck in the '70s. From the wallpaper to the carpeting to the lobby. This hotel screams living in the past.The bathrooms, on the other hand, are teeny tiny, with virtually no place to put your things. The blow dryer they provide is so weak it would have taken me 3 days to dry my hair with it.When I went out at 7am in the morning to get a cab to work, there wasn't a single person around to help me. There were a lot of people waiting for the Airport Limosine Bus, but nobody at the front door. I didn't know where the cabs were, so I asked for help. The hotel is far away from the business center of Tokyo, which makes it a bad choice for business. I found this out the hard way, as it is more than a 3,000 yen trip to the Tokyo Station area. There is a reason it is cheaper than hotels closer to the business district & to the shopping in Ginza!So, I stopped by the concierge desk on my 2nd of 3 nights to find out whether they paid for cabs into town, as other major hotels do to win corporate business, and had to deal with someone who barely spoke English. I just gave up and left, and then she chased me in the lobby to hand me a letter. It was from the sales rep for our company, but my question is why then? Why wasn't the letter delivered to my room? What would have happened if I hadn't stopped by?Now, let's review housekeeping: They didn't bother to throw out the candy wrappers that were left on the desk. Clearly these weren't meant to be saved for anything. They didn't bother to throw out the plastic lids they put on the glasses in the bathroom, even though the glasses had other things in them (my toothbrush in one and my make-up brushes in the other). They didn't bother to throw out the plastic lid they put on the glass on the mini-bar, which I used for some wine. I dropped a french fry at night, and I couldn't find it. Needless to say, I found it the next night - after housekeeping had supposedly cleaned my room (vacuum much?).I wanted to order wine from the room service menu, and after a 20-odd minute discussion, I found that they had none of the red wines on the menu. None!The room service bills don't separate out the embedded service charge or the tax -- which I've never, ever seen before. It is just 1 price, so the bills shows a considerably higher than what is on the menu because it includes everything without a breakdown.I set my work wake-up calls when I checked in, so they came.The night before I left I called down for a 3am wake-up call with a follow-up at 3:15am. 3 am came & went, and the phone didn't ring. I got 1 call at 3:10am and another at 3:30am. Good thing I had a back-up.Checkers, which offers both food & wine buffets (not sure whether the Friday & Saturday 'seafood buffet' is worth it at 61,000 yen) says it is open until 10pm, with the last seated at 9:30pm. I waited at least 30 minutes for my food (I ordered from the a la carte menu rather than opt for the buffet, but that was still unacceptable). Then I watched as they took down the food and wine buffets starting at 9:45pm, so if you are late, you are SOL. (Tip: Water from the mini-bar is 310JPY, but only 200JPY at the Chequers pastry shop.)The list:Shower pressure: Surprisingly good for the 22nd floor.Front desk: Check in & check out were good. If you call, you're in trouble.Bed: Average.Sheets/Bedding: Average.Towels: Larger than average, but only average for softness & absorbency.Phone service/attendants: There is a real problem with them understanding you if you speak English. Room size: Above average.Room service: Aside from the fact that none of the bottles of wine were there, it is OK. It is limited as to time. Not many appetizers or sides.

Both get mixed reviews. The bottom-line for the Hilton is that the rooms are large (by Japanese standards), the location is good, but the property needs maintenance and I got tired of being nickle and dimed on everything.Location: Right next to the Nishi-Shinjuku station or about a kilometer or so from the main Shinjuku station. Also right next to the Shinjuku Park (1km loop around) and the government buildings. Plenty of restaurants nearby.Rooms: I was upgraded to the junior suite, which was nice. However, I noticed the wallpaper was peeling at the seems, the vinyl furniture was well worn (showing through in many places), and overall just needing an eye for detail from the maintenance crew. Compared to the local chain, this hotel was, however, more modern. Compared to other Hiltons around the world, this one ranks near the bottom for the quality of the property.Price: Unfortunately, this is where things fall apart. The basic room rate gets you a room. If you want breakfast (which they push upon registration), you'll have to fork over $20+ a day. Also, if you booked here based on the great reviews for the executive lounge, be aware that you must be Gold or Platinum to gain free access. Otherwise, be prepared to pay handsomely (I was quoted $80+ a day!). Now if you want internet, guess what? You're right, yet another outrageous fee. You can, however, go down to the lobby and get 2-3 hours of free wifi down there.Bottom line: I would only recommend staying here if you get the breakfast, lounge, and wifi bundled with a good rate. Otherwise, look at the other hotels within walking distance that are better values.",,213,2.0

The rooms are spacious (especially compared to other Japanese hotels) with great views of the city. There is an underground tunnel connecting the Nishi Shinjuku station to the hotel; however, it's a several-block walk underground through a near-empty section of the subway. The underground connection is certainly nice, but don't expect the convenience of dashing straight onto the train or walking immediately into a busy section of the station. The Hilton has a free shuttle bus to the Shinjuku station but if you just miss the bus on the half hour, it can feel like a wait when you're anxious to get out exploring the city or waiting to get back to your room after a long day. We had an early morning departure flight and had timed out exactly how long we needed to get to the subway and to Tokyo station to catch the NEX so we were frustrated to find out that the underground connection to the subway was closed in the morning (there were no signs posted about the times and no one could really tell us what time everything opened). There's not much immediately around the hotel - the Hyatt is across the street, as is a Denny's (?!?), but after a fifteen-minute walk around the hotel we gave up looking for an interesting neighborhood and hopped the shuttle to Shinjuku. One of my pet peeves is paying for wifi - (we knew this when we booked so I can't complain too much!) but the reason I mention it is that we really relied on the internet a LOT on our Tokyo trip for subway routes, restaurants, etc., and so the daily room wifi charge added up. Overall, the Hilton met our expectations - great room with excellent service. We were aware of the ""cons"" I've mentioned above when we booked and after staying at a few hotels in Japan with very small rooms, we wanted the view and comfort that we knew Hilton could offer. However, our travel style is most suited to hotels that are steps from the subway and/or in a neighborhood that is fun to explore. We tend not to spend too much time in our actual room and eat only maybe 1-2 meals at the hotel during our trip. We have no complaints about the Tokyo Hilton (the service really was excellent), but we will probably not stay here again on our next trip to Tokyo. Our bottom line is that we're willing to stay in a smaller room and experience some language barriers during check-in if we're in a more convenient location to explore the city.","Grayson, Georgia",47,4.0

Narita Airport shuttle had a direct stop at the hotel.The hotel is solid in most areas, e.g. room, facilities, restaurant service, etc. as many others have reviewed. So I won't repeat here. From my experience, there were 2 areas that can be improved upon:- Check in: While there was a marked check in line/area designated for HHonors next to the general check in line, it was not in operation at the time of my check in, even though there was a long line of 5-6 parties and no staff inquired if anyone was a HHonors member.- I had a reservation at the hotel for the airport shuttle in early morning. While the shuttle bus was by the entrance on time and the shuttle bus driver already got all passengers onto the bus, it took 10-15 mins before the hotel staff came out to exchange paperwork with the driver and confirm the passengers boarded from the hotel. The shuttle thus had a late departure. I would like to reiterate that the aforementioned feedback should be deemed as a tune up point, not a turn away point. The hotel is great all around.

I felt in general the staff was polite (something you expect out of Japan anyways in the first place) but not hard-working and not willing to go out of their ways to serve guests (something rather SURPRISING for me) Here are the reasons:1) HousekeepingActually housekeeping was not bad, and every day the room was cleaned impeccably. However, one day the bulb in our toilet was broken, so we called hotel to fix it, and they said they'd come fix it while we went out. When we came back from dinner, we saw a card saying that ""the problem was fixed,"" but the bulb apparently was still not working. We called again and had someone come up again, this time we were able to tell them that the problem was in fact not resolved as stated on the card. The housekeeping then said they thought we mentioned the TOILET was broken....find it a little bit hard to believe that they misheard.2) BreakfastServers too busy trying to clean up vacant tables than to serve dining guests, even when nobody was waiting. Also, when asked for cappuccino, regular coffee instead came. When we told them we wanted cappuccino, they answered back saying that my father had asked for coffee instead, even though my father was with us the whole time and did not say a single word. Making up excuses for themselves I smell?3) ConciergeWe had asked for the specific type of envelope from the concierge and wanted more of the same kind after an hour or so. The concierge then reluctantly said they ran out, but when she went in a check she quickly came out with a stack of them. We then asked if they have glue to help seal the envelopes, she again said there is no glue, which is very hard to believe considering it's supposedly the Hilton. She finally found a single glue stick all the way in the other end of the lobby atrium to grab us a glue stick.4) OthersThe hotel also comes with a complimentary shuttle service to the Shinjuku Railway Station, but it's very crowded usually with locals and commuters from nearby offices, and once we were actually unable to board the bus and had to take a taxi instead. The same thing happens on the other way back; we see a lot of commuters using the bus to reach the hotel, enter the hotel, then walk back out to the streets to their real destination.Anyways, overall for the same price and class, there are bette choices out there nearby like the Keio Plaza and Hyatt Regency. I have stated at the Hyatt Regency recently and I generally find it less crowded, more exclusive, and staff there more hard working and understanding.","Hong Kong, China",9,2.0

All of the staff were very polite, helpful, and accommodating! Our room was very comfortable and extremely clean. The bathroom was very nice, with lots of counter space and good water pressure in the shower. We were lucky enough to be on an upper floor so we had a great view of the city. The breakfast cost extra but was delicious with lots of different options, we ended up eating too much every morning because we wanted to try all of the good food. One morning when we got to breakfast there was a line but it went quickly and all of the other mornings we arrived to breakfast earlier and there was no line. They offer free WiFi in the lobby and there are several places to sit there. You have to pay extra to get it in your room. There was one morning we were having trouble with the internet and called the front desk, almost immediately someone came up and fixed it for us. The location is excellent! You are within walking distance to lots of restaurants in the area and there is an underground tunnel that takes you directly to two train stations. There is so much to do and see in Tokyo that we didn't get a chance to use the pool or exercise room so I can't say what they were like. At the airport we were able to buy tickets for a hotel shuttle bus that took us to the hotel. Though it was possibly a little more expensive than taking a train or bus it was nice to go directly to the hotel. Through the hotel we also booked the same shuttle bus for our return ride to the airport. Also, we took several sightseeing tours with JTB Sunrise tours and they do hotel pickups at the Hilton Tokyo; that made this a very convenient hotel to stay at. We loved this hotel! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Tokyo and we will definitely be staying here again when we come back to Tokyo!",NY,78,5.0

You can get a subway train to very close though. It's on the quiet side of Shinjuku away from all the fun and shops. But the hotel was excellent, the staff really could not be more helpful and the Excecutive Lounge spoil you to pieces. Great view, great selection of drinks during the free drink time. Breakfast was outstanding - nice Sweedish musli, great fruits and lots of hot stuff. Best breakfast I've had in Japan. And they serve Champers with the breakfast - the real McCoy too - think it was Moet. You can take a local free bus to the hotel from the station if you have luggage. But I'd say by the time you found the bus stop and waited on a bus you would be far better with a taxi. It's not far so I would guess less than a 1000yen (£7) Brilliant place to stay though and Shinjuku station takes you everywhere in Tokyo (Yamanote line and subway). ","Glasgow, United Kingdom",6,5.0

Lounge access is one of the most important benefits to me as a Hilton Diamond member, and one which I actually go out of my way to spend more money with Hilton each year to secure. So being unable to actually enjoy this benefit really disappointed me. I understand fully that lounges are not unlimited capacity, but based on my experience as well as other Trip Advisor reviews and feedback from other guests overheard on our stay, it seems like the Hilton Tokyo is in need of a larger lounge, or a smaller number of rooms that bring Executive Lounge access.

On a couple of occasions, the executive lounge was full during the pre-dinner time frame between 17:00 and 19:00, so we were turned away and had to wait to be called later when a table freed up.

It took close to 2 hours which is a bit painful but even getting the fast train, the subway and then the hotel shuttle would have taken almost as long so there's no way round it.... except to fly into Haneda airport which is closer.When we checked in, we were informed that they had a special deal on: breakfast and internet for ¥6,000 per day as opposed to the ¥8,200 it would normally cost. We hadn't really planned to take up the offer because we object as a matter of principle to paying for internet anywhere in this day and age but it was over the New Year period so we accepted.We were looking forward to checking into our room as we arrived very late but what a let down. It was so dated and basic that we might as well have been in a Holiday Inn (see photos) - and it only had a Queen bed despite the fact we'd ordered a King. I phoned down and was told that they were full and that they could move us the following night. It was only when I continued to complain and object that they managed to ""find"" a room for us. We were moved to a higher floor, to a renovated room which was worlds apart from the original room we'd been given. I can't say it's a top of the range high tech renovation but it's certainly a massive improvement - see photos. That said, it was virtually impossible to get out of the shower and as an aside, I think it's completely objectionable to charge the same rate for rooms that haven't been renovated.Anyway, the next morning, we went down for breakfast only to find that there was a queue of over 30 people and that we had to wait to be seated. It was frankly like a zoo and without doubt the least enjoyable breakfast I've had in a long time. There were way too many people milling around so people were bumping into each other, there were long queues at all the food stations and many of the buffet items had run out. I have to admit it was less frenetic the 2 subsequent mornings but it really was a miserable experience that first morning.When we got our bill for easy check out, it was also wrong - they'd charged us for the special internet & breakfast deal as well as internet on top. A small error that was easily rectified but added to the list of other issues we'd already had, it just didn't sit well with us.However, that said, to be completely fair, the hotel wasn't actually bad. It was a pretty standard chain hotel and the plus points were:* It was in a good location (for us) as it was max a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku. * There is a free shuttle for those that don't want to walk from Shinkjuku.* There's an underground walkway that links it to 2 metro stations and various other spots.* The staff were amazing.* There is at least free wifi in the lobby area.* There were some good restaurants very close by in the I-Land building next door. * There was a grocery store less than 5 minutes walk away.* There was a Starbucks and Denny's across the street although we didn't try either.",London,124,3.0

The hotel has a shuttle bus that runs every 20 minutes. You need to exit the station from the WEST entrance. It is a bit confusing if you don't know the station. The shuttle bus picks up in front of the Keio department store , which is at the west exit of the station. Take bus #21. The Friendly Airport Express bus picks up about every hour. We took it to Narita airport when we left. It was 3000 yen per person. We thought it was easier than the train and it dropped us off at the front door of the Airport. We had a light dinner at the lobby restaurant the night we arrived. It was very expensive. Two medium pizzas, 5 beers and a coke was. 16,000 yen. It was not worth the money, but we were tired.

I asked if we are getting a room on the executive floor with lounge access but was told that they are all full that day and the only room available on that level is just a regular room. Instead, Mr. Tsai suggested that we take the junior suite which is much more spacious but without lounge access. He said if we will be out around town anyway there is really no need to use the lounge. He gave us several drink coupons (and ask for more if needed) to the bar in the lobby and also access to the free breakfast buffet the next morning. He was right! We were out all day and didn't even have a chance to use the drink coupons. The junior suite was indeed very spacious and comfortable with an excellent view.

This time I traveled with my infant child and they were very accommodating in that respect. They provided a crib for our entire stay which is a great help to us.The positives: The Executive Lounge is one of the best. I love that it is open all day and is very helpful when I am working and my wife is at the hotel that she can go get a snack and relax. I feel the staff tried very hard to accommodate us and work around us having a baby with us. I am a Hilton Diamond member and I stay at this Hilton because of the lounge. They staff also went to great lengths to try and accommodate some foods/snacks for my wife who couldn't eat dairy.It has a great location relative to Shinjuku. The executive floor rooms are fantastic and we definitely did not have any complaints with the room. Our first night we were not able to be in an executive floor room and the staff, after asking, found a way to move us onto the executive floor after the first night.The negatives:My child has a milk allergy right now.. which means while my wife is nursing my wife can't have milk..or milk products. We understand this can be difficult in Japan to avoid but it is possible. We did explain that she can't have milk, butter, whey, anything dairy. We even have a sign written in Japanese that says this so there shouldn't be any confusion. The staff did try very hard I felt to accommodate this. However at least 2 times she was served food that did in fact have dairy in it. Primarily margarine (which after asking..and confirming with the staff who talked to the kitchen. does have dairy in it) Also she was served a sandwich(two different times) where the bread contained dairy. As I said they did try hard but it just seems like it is such a common allergy problem that understanding that margarine that contains butter/whey..is pretty much milk. No real harm was done other than a child with a tummy ache for a few days..which isn't fun mind you. I don't know if the fault is with the serving staff not asking the right questions or cooks not understanding what dairy free means. It could of been a real problem for someone that has a more serious food allergy. But maybe people that do are more careful and ask more questions? I think we tend to think if we say no dairy that they understand and food items the staff claims are ok to consume are indeed ok.The nice to of haves?? We found that the hotel did have a few activities such as Christmas hula dancers/singers in the lobby on a couple of evenings. I guess the negative part is we only knew of this as we walked out of the hotel for dinner. Something may of told us about these things in our rooms but we didn't see it. It would of been appreciated if when we checked in, knowing we would be there a week, to have something like that made known to us. We will still go back to this Hilton as long as the lounge is there anyway. With any luck my child would of outgrown the allergy thing and my wife can eat all those yummy things she wanted to eat but couldn't while she was there.","Fukuoka, Japan",26,4.0

We were supposed to stay at other hotel for 7 nights, but after 3 nights, we moved back to the Hilton. It was convenient to everything, but more importantly, it was more comfortable for us because of its Western style. (We try to stay at Hilton hotels when we travel outside the U.S. and this hotel did not disappoint.) Considering our long stay in Tokyo - 10 days - this hotel was the perfect fit for us. The hotel is beautiful, clean, and offers all the amenities of a Hilton in a large city. The staff were very friendly and always asked if they could assist us. We used the Executive Lounge (2 rooms - the largest Exec Lounge we have ever seen), which fortunately, served Western-style food in addition to Japanese food, although their scrambled eggs were more like a curdled soup than scrambled eggs and the bacon is served almost raw. Fortunately, they also offer a large selection of fruits and cereal as alternatives. The evening fare in the Executive Lounge was hit and miss for American palates.

Although typically expensive for a Hilton in a large business-focused city, I was happy to find a three night stay package price that knocked about 20% off the cost. The location was in a major business and government area, but it is convenient to get anywhere from nearby metro stops and Shinjuku station, one of the busiest and best connected train stations in the world. The hotel runs a quick shuttle bus to the station every 20 minutes, although the walk to the station is easy. There are some nice local spots to visit, most notably a fine and uncrowded city garden park (Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden). You get to the garden by crossing to the east side of the station area via the underground mall (use Google maps to see the huge mall area and the exits to the street from it). We also went to Takaosan, a mountain area attraction west of Tokyo and a quick trip on the Keio line train (be sure you take a limited express not a local!). If you are interested in sampling local food, be sure to check out the basement food vendors in the major department stores like Isetan (east side of station) and Odakyu (west side). For airport connections, a convenient bus service (Airport Limousine) comes to the hotel. Finally, I note that there are plenty of comments on TripAdvisor regarding the rather spartan rooms (we had a King Deluxe), and it is undeniable that you can get larger and more luxurious ""standard"" rooms in other Hiltons. It easy to find bad hotels in Tokyo, however, and I stayed in another business hotel there that was not much cheaper but was amazingly bad compared to this hotel.

We always try to stay at Hiltons on our vacations because we enjoy the perks – i.e. the Executive Lounge and the free upgrades. We used to live in Asia, and one thing that was great about Hilton hotels in Asia, is that they are so luxurious. This was certainly NOT the case here. There are some positives. The location was great. 2 subway lines connected to the hotel (although a bit of a walk). It’s even walkabout from Shinjuku Station (although maybe not with luggage). The shuttle to Shinjuku station was very much appreciated. And the food and drink in the Executive Lounge for cocktail hour was great. Most of the people who work there are great – they genuinely wanted to help us (with directions, dinner recommendation and reservations, etc). I read other reviews where people said that the staff were unfriendly and unhelpful – that could not have been further from the truth for us (with the exception of the lying – explained below).However, there is so much more wrong with the hotel than right. As I said, my husband is Diamond – which is Hilton’s top bracket in their loyalty program. When we checked in for our first stay, we were upgraded to a “Deluxe” floor – not the executive floor. We knew that that the hotel was very busy, and upgrades are only offered if available, so we didn’t think too much of the smaller than usual upgrade. However, when we got to our room, we couldn’t believe how basic it was. We were wondering, “if this is a deluxe room, what is a standard room like?” To put it in perspective, a couple of weeks ago, we spent a night in the Hampton Inn in South Oklahoma City. I would put this on the same level of luxury (all the way at the bottom). I see in the manager’s response to reviews that he refers to the hotel as a five star property. I have no idea where he gets that from, but our “Deluxe” room was the equivalent of a three star room in the US. When I think 5 star – I think luxury. Now the size of the room was actually fine – I wouldn’t complain about that at all. However, the bathroom was tiny! I didn’t have room to leave any toiletries in there (my husband had room for just his). The furniture is cheap looking, cheap feeling, and there are no decorations. There is not one thing about that room that says “luxury”After 2 nights, we left for one night, and then came back for another 2 night stay. This time, they told us that there were no King beds, and they had to put us in a Queen bed on a “Deluxe” floor. We asked to be upgraded to the executive floors (since the hotel was not full this time) and were told that they only do a 1 level upgrade. I find that so disappointing. One of the best customers that Hilton has, and they won’t even give an upgrade to the executive floor – when there is space available. Every other Hilton that we have stayed in has upgraded us as far as possible. But this so-called “5 star” Hilton doesn’t even make an attempt. So we headed to our room. It was shocking – absolutely worse than the Hampton Inn we stayed at a few weeks after this. I cannot believe that Hilton would even allow rooms like this in the Hilton brand hotels. The walls and furniture were cracked and the TV had to have been over 10 years old. I can only assume that this was a standard room and they lied about it being Deluxe. We called the front desk to complain, and they moved us to a King room that was more to the standard of our first stay. I really don’t appreciate the fact that the person who checked us in flat out lied to us about the availability of the King Bed. I also can’t believe that they thought it was OK to put us in a room like that. I feel so bad for the people without status who pay hundreds of dollars a night for a room like that – with no chance of being upgraded. We used points and still overpaid for our rooms. I’m so grateful we didn’t actually pay to stay here.Another problem was the executive lounge. Breakfast was just not very good. Yes, I am complaining about a free breakfast, so maybe I should just stop – but we had stayed at 2 other Hiltons on our trip (Osaka and Seoul). On both those hotels, we were permitted to eat in the main restaurant (for free), which tends to have a much better selection. That wasn’t an option here. So while breakfast wasn’t terrible – it just wasn’t very good. The other problem was something that another reviewer had identified earlier, and management’s response was along the lines of “that doesn’t ever happen and won’t happen again”. Well that was wrong! We went to the lounge one evening and were told that there were no tables, and that we could return to our room and they would call us when one was available. This bothered me because another guest had made management aware of this on TripAdvisor, they knew that the hotel was full, and they did nothing to proactively address this problem. They even sat single people at tables pushed together (where they could comfortably fit more than 4 people). I was very disappointed in the poor management around this.Overall, this hotel is very disappointing. As a diamond HH member, the benefits are nowhere near what you get at other Hiltons. This is not a luxurious hotel by any means - although according to the responses on tripadvisor, management thinks that it is (which is very worrying). I would not recommend this hotel.","Dallas, Texas",16,2.0

The receptionist was very calm, offering me a suite on the 36th floor for one night, then arranging to move my things to another room for the second night.Staying in a suite was a real delight, witih more space than many Tokyo apartments, and access to the exclusive business lounge. Even the ""normal"" rooms are great though, with plenty of space to stretch out and all the features you would expect for the Hilton.I also found out that staying in this Hilton is very convenient for taking buses to and from either of the two airports, and for the multitude of half- and full-day tours that the city has to offer. The concierge and ground floor staff are also very helpful, and can help you to get onto any of the available buses or trips.So why don't you try the Hilton next time?

A 5 minute walk from the hotel you could find a similar restaurant or bar where the bill would be less than half the price. The hotel is located nearby to the Nishi-shinjuku and Tochomae stations on the Marunouchi and Oedo lines connected via underground walkways so getting around Tokyo from here is very easy. Alternatively a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station departs outside the hotel - although to be honest it's only a short 10 minute walk anyway. Standard rooms are good sized for Tokyo and are clean with large comfy bed and recently refurbished bathroom. Breakfast was very nice with both Japanese and Western style buffet options (and the service was very good).Overall I really enjoyed the stay here - and perhaps the only 2 things that 'might' put me off staying again would be the high cost of the hotel restaurants and bars (£10+ for a bottle of beer!) and the fact that it is a very 'westernised' hotel so you won't get the 'true' Japanese experience.

Yes the hotel is located in Shinjuku but it is on the western skyscraper side and therefore out of the way of most of the things Shinjuku has to offer. We took the hotel shuttle bus from the train station so can't comment on how long a walk it might well be from there.Check-in was routine and we were advised that we could have a room on a high floor which had good views. We had requested a double room but all that was left on arrival was a twin room. For 1 night we weren't too bothered so accepted anyway. The room though was very dated and while still clean and functional, was really in need of a renovation. I say this in comparison to the two other hotels we used in Japan - one a budget/boutique hotel also in Tokyo and the other a 4-5 star place in Kyoto. However, we paid a premium price for a luxury 1 night stay and the room was a disappointment in that regard.One other problem when compared to other hotel experiences in Japan was that there was no free wi-fi or internet connection included in the room rate. Unlike the 2 other hotels we stayed in where these were included in the price, the Hilton charged over 1600 Yen per day per device! Now I don't have that much of a problem paying a bit extra for wi-fi, but considering the price of the room, in a hotel aimed at the luxury market, this extra charge was quite excessive. The other hotels we experienced on the trip also provided complimentary water bottles each day, which was very convenient and one of those little things you expect for the extra price of the room, but the Hilton charged. Now these things might seem pretty petty to some, but considering the Hilton is supposed to be a luxury hotel, the premium price we therefore paid for the room, and it's dated fittings, well I don't think it is good enough.To summarise, even though we only had 1 night at the Hilton Tokyo, I would not recommend others stay there until the rooms are renovated, and management reconsiders the excessive internet charges and the few other minor things needed to make choosing a luxury hotel over other less expensive though perfectly nice hotels worthwhile.",Brisbane,25,2.0

The maid even properly arranged our yen coins left on the counter, lol.As others have written, the only problem is the location to Shinjuku station. We either walked it which is doable, 10-15 min, but in Tokyo you do so much walking already that this can be a hassle. We never took the free shuttle, but a Taxi ride is roughly $10. There's a Denny's right across the street which is convenient for foreigners who don't want Japanese food or McDonald's all the time. I'd recommend this hotel because with a Hilton you know what you are getting, but there are many alternatives which may suit your likings more in Shinjuku, and other districts of Tokyo, in terms of better location and pricing.

Instead they offered us a Junior Suite on 33rd floor (34-37th floors are executive). To be fair we were very happy with the suite which was smart and newly decorated, though the bathroom and TVs were a little dated.I'd recommend Executive floor access if you have a little extra budget - this includes: -breakfast buffet (choice of cooked English, Japanese, and continental (toast, large range of pastries, fruit, cereals)- free wifi in your room- free access to pool/ gym facilities- all day you can help yourself to coffees / teas/ water/ juice, and there are also other slots like afternoon tea and cocktails at various other times. Even though we knew the Exec floors were overbooked, we never struggled to get a table even at breakfast. Location: a 5-10min walk from Shinjuku station (Hilton offer a shuttle bus but this probably takes longer than walking!), also less than 5mins from Tochomae metro station.

This is a proper ‘Hilton’, as they used to be; five stars, prime location, lots of uniformed flunkies, attentive service, extortionate f&b prices, etc.. The décor & furnishings are either timeless & classic or old-fashioned, according to your point of view. The occasional slight blemish to the furniture & fittings could charitably be said to add to the patina of the hotel’s heritage but no such charity can be afforded for the dangerous missing bolt of high-tech office chair in our room which rendered the back liable to collapse at any time. My main complaint, however, is that only one comfortable chair is provided in a room that is sold for occupancy by two people; exactly where is the second person supposed to sit comfortably? I expect better of a self-proclaimed ‘luxury hotel’. At only thirty-eight floors this is one of the smaller buildings of Shinjuku’s sky-scraper district. The hotel is well located for visitors to Tokyo. Two underground stations on different lines (different networks, even) are close by and Shinjuku station, which is only half-a-mile away, is served by a shuttle bus every twenty minutes. This is useful if travelling via the station with luggage, but the station is such an incoherent sprawling mess (being actually half-a-dozen entirely separate stations, all operated by different companies, all on different levels and cobbled together in a remarkably inefficient manner) that visitors with luggage and/or visitors unfamiliar with the place are well advised to avoid it. Painless door-to-door transfers between the hotel and both Tokyo’s airports are provided by the oddly-named ‘Airport Limousine’ coaches.The ‘Executive Lounge’ provides good facilities until it becomes overcrowded, especially in the evenings. This is perhaps unsurprising as the one lounge has to service no fewer than five floors of ‘Executive’ rooms. Diamond Hhonors members should note that this property ignores Hilton’s much-vaunted suite upgrade policy by restricting upgrades to rooms even when suites are available.","Oxford, England",648,5.0

They have us two brochures - and seemed to only have the two...both by the same company (Gray Lines Tour Company.) I don't know if they get a portion of the proceeds or if they aren't interested in offering information on other options. The people WERE always POLITE. But not friendly or really helpful. They gave polite smiles and seemingly the bare minimum in assistance. As we have been served SO WONDERFULLY in both London and Paris in the past year, this was a great disappointment.

So, to thank you all the reviewers and tripadvisor.com, I am helping to review my recent, super fantastic stay at Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku! :)My family and I stayed at the Hilton Shinjuku Tokyo for 5 days, 4 nights during the first week of September 2012. The service was awesome from the start! Even though our plane arrived extremely early in the morning at Narita Airport, so we got to Hilton some time before 9 am--front desk staff was very welcoming and offered a super early check-in. Well, we paid some additions for a room upgrade, but the room was available immediately! We were also upgraded from originally 32nd to 37th floor, from a total of 38 floors. That was cool because the executive lounge was right on the 37th floor! We also received a complimentary box of Hilton chocolates less than an hour after we got into our room! That was so nice! Thank YOU!!!!!The executive lounge is awesome! The lounge offers refreshments and snacks all day. You can expect to have a full breakfast and dinner at the lounge, no extra charge for guests staying in the executive room. Staff at the lounge were very friendly and helpful. Love the chocolate drink... a lot! I think I had over 10 glasses in 5 days!! Thanks! ^-^ My birthday happened to fall on that week. In the evening of my birthday, I was surprised to see a thoughtful birthday greeting with a complimentary chocolate truffle cake in my room when I got back from shopping! It was from one of the Hilton staff. He just made my birthday even more special! I hope he got my thank you gift though. I asked someone to give it to him. :) The room was quiet, barely heard any noise through the door or the wall. Everything was clean and tidy. Housekeeping staff were friendly and dedicated to their work. Oh, but you need to inform the hotel though if you want your bed sheets changed. It is the environmental friendly approach by the hotel to save water, but if you inform them, they will do it right away! The beautiful origami birds placed after bed turndown service were very nice touch!Although the hotel is not located exactly in the middle of Shinjuku busy streets, they offer shuttle bus service leaving the hotel three times every hour to Shinjuku Station, where you can take JR trains, Keio trains, etc. Very convenient. Unbelievably punctual! The bus capacity is over 40 passengers a trip. There were always available seats, all the time. Make sure you make all your necessary requests before checking in, and you will pretty much get everything! Really! Oh, our trip got postponed by a day, so I contacted Hilton Tokyo through their Japanese website, with google auto-translate, for a slight change of stay dates. It took them only couple days to change it and emailed me back, while all my requests remained the same. So, I did not have to redo all my bookings. That was fantastic!Leaving the hotel was also very convenient. You can buy airport limousine bus ticket from front desk or executive lounge staff. The ticket costs Yen 3,000 per person, exactly the same price as buying from their office at Narita Airport. The airport limousine bus picks you up from the front gate of the Hilton and drop you off at your airport terminal. Hilton bellboys helped us with our luggages. They ensured the proper baggage loading and everything. Oh, a complimentary bottle of water was offered by Hilton to every limousine bus passenger before hopping onto the bus. How thoughtful!Thanks a lot ++++++ to Hilton and Hilton staff for making this trip one of the nicest vacations ever! It is definitely in the top 3 for me! I won't have any second thought about where to stay if I'll ever get to go back to Tokyo again! It's definitely Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku! <3 <3","Bangkok, Thailand",9,5.0

I have stayed all over Japan. The rooms were nice enough, the service was good. The staff was friendly and attentive. That covers the basics.However, the ridiculous internet fees drove me to distraction. Internet access costs $20 a day for starters. Ok, that is common all over the world- irritating, but common. Let's not forget that we all pay $30 A MONTH at home for the internet. $20 a day is $600 a month. So, we are getting nicked when we pay 20x a home based fee to use a hotel's internet. Think about it.All that would still be standard at the Hilton Tokyo if that was the extent of their internet fees and I wouldn't say anything. But, alas, that's not all, if you want to use a second device you can pay the $20 AGAIN. That would be $40 a day for internet folks if you have more than one device (who doesn’t?). How about that? I travel with my laptop which is essential for business and my Ipad to read the paper, catch up on the world at home, etc.Hilton folks- I am 6,000 miles from home and the Ipad is a nice way to read the paper and connect while being away. But, NO I am not going to pay $100 for five days use of the Ipad and another $100 for the laptop. So, while I stayed at your hotel, I just had to skip the leisurely paper reading part of my morning. Thanks. And, no, there is no free internet connection in the lobby, there is a charge for that too- $10 for 30 minutes if you are so inclined. Here’s a thought; I paid your $20 a day for internet access, so in my book, at that already hyper inflated price, I should be able to use the service I paid for regardless of what I want to connect with.As I see it the Hilton Tokyo internet policy is simply about gouging people. And, I don’t like it. Yes, I can afford $100 extra to read the paper. But, no I am not going to pay it. So, that issue clouded my entire experience at the Hilton Tokyo where I will not be returning.Hilton management, you can skip the standard response to my post, “glad you liked everything else, etc, etc.” Instead, if you want to actually do something about my complaint, talk to the powers that be in your organization and take a stand against your ridiculous internet fees.","Tampa, Florida",46,3.0

I think I had a standard room and it came with nice amenities including toothbrush, razor, comb and the others you would expect. The lights are very logical and easy to use so you always have lights in the right place. There were two complimentary bottles of water, refreshed each day. The sun is so bright in Tokyo and the shades are very nice letting in natural light but blocking the heat and then having a layer to block all the light at night. The Breakfast buffet was divine. Western and Japanese cuisine in the buffet. And if you get the buffet, espresso drinks are included. The service is great. Otherwise, the restaurants in the hotel proper are VERY expensive.

Haven't stayed at a Hilton before. Impetus for the trip was to see my first UFC, and wanted things to be as hassle free as possible so happy to spend that bit extra to stay somewhere that seemed like a pretty safe bet, according to most of the reviews here.From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby I knew I was going to enjoy my stay - there were a handful of UFC fighters hanging around the bar (turns out the whole UFC organisation was staying there the same time as were). Made for a fantastic atmosphere in the hotel the whole time we were there.Getting There---------------------------- Easy. We caught the Narita Express straight into Shinjuku, then got a taxi to the hotel (not yet having our bearings, knowing where the shuttle bus stop was or how easy it is to just get to Nishi Shinjuku station under the hotel),Location----------------------------------- Fantastic!- Nishi-Shinjuku station is underneath the hotel (+ short walk), we tended to use this far more often than using the hotel shuttle bus to get into Shinjuku (which is also an excellent service). A 160Y ticket will get you into Shinjuku we could use our JR pass to get most places from there.- Heaps of places to eat all around the hotel. There's a good volume of Western style restaurants right near the hotel (Dennys, Royal Host) for those in need of something more semi-familiar.- There's a 7-11 a short walk away so very handy if you just want to grab some food to have a quick breakfast in the hotel room before heading out for the day. Also has ATM, though it didn't like my card!The Room--------------------------- Stayed in a standard room - great, no complaints at all, good size, nice view.- On our last 1 night stay we got upgraded for free. Upgraded room is really just the same room, slightly better furniture, and on a higher floor.The Staff---------------------------- Very friendly, very helpful (aka Japanese). All spoke English.The Food- We didn't eat at the hotel. Checked out the menu's, a little pricey (the Japanese and French restaurants in particular). Plenty of other places to eat.Shopping----------------------------- We didn't shop at any places around the hotel. There's a bunch of shops underneath the hotel but we'd only pass by them in the early morning and late at night so were always closed.Other Amenities----------------------------- Sorry not much help here, didn't use the spa/gym etc.- Wifi to the rooms is pretty pricey, we just used the desktops in the lobby a couple of times (also v pricey). Free wifi at Denny's next door though limited to socmed.I'd like to think for my next visit to Japan that now being much more comfortable with Tokyo I'd be able to find somewhere cheaper, but I'll probably be back to the Hilton, it really is an excellent spot.Also, have to say - great smelling lobby.","Perth, Western Australia",9,5.0

Rooms have Hot water kettle, bath robe, slippers which are good for a business & leisure traveller.For an Indian traveler whether be business or leisure, Indian Food is a must atleast once a day. So this hotel is ideal as it is situated next to I-Land Commerical complex. On the lower level there is an authentic Indian Restaurant - Maharaja Shinjuku. This hotel serves set meal for lunch at a very decent price. Food is awesome.Hotel too has a variety of F&B outlet which serves multi cusine. Breakfast spread is good with a combination of International & Japanese items. Best thing of this hotel is they have a limited menu breakfast for travellers who check out early morning.Front office staff are very polite & very good. I had checked in late at night, but the staff was very pleasant & completed the formalities very quickly. Early morning the checkouts are in big numbers as it is more of a business hotel, so advise is to settle the bill previous night itself.Hotel offers ample parking & also has shuttle bus stop for airport coaches to Narita / Haneda.Shopping is not that great in this area, but there is a big electronic shop next to the Shinjuku subway station.Overall, good bet for an Indian Traveller.","Mumbai, India",1,4.0

I also do not speak any Japanese. I checked in to the Hilton after staying two nights in Asakusa. First, the location is central and is proximal to a subway station on the metro line (two blocks). There is a supermarket about two blocks away. The modern looking Tokyo Metro Government building is two blocks away and is notable for being designed by renowned architect Kenzo Tange; also, you can go up to two observatory areas (no charge) in the building and get a wonderful view of Tokyo (there are free english speaking guides there). There is also a complimentary shuttle bus that runs three times a hour from the hotel to Shinjuku station which is a main subway station. There are also many department stores and food options in this subway/train area. I did not try the breakfast buffet but it looked good.What sets this property apart from the others is the service. I have used the concierge service in many hotels on vacations. I was able to communcate with the concierge desk while still in the US once I established contact by phone (email didn't work for intial contact, not sure why). They were super helpful in helping me purchase sumo tickets in Nagoya. I was not able to purchase the tickets from the US despite using google translate and did not want to use the two internet based services which I found online because I had to pay in advance to private individuals-I felt more comfortable having a hotel do this and the commission was nominal especially compared to the internet based companies.I rarely use superlatives, but I had truly outstanding service from the concierge desk run by Ms. Natsuko Fujiwara. I was trying to climb Mt. Fuji (and did it!) with two kids and could not have done it without their help. Two staff members, Tomoko Aoiki and Maya Kohhara in particular went above and beyond to help me. As i was trying to climb the first day of the official climbing season, there was still lots of snow on the trail and it was not certain whether people would be allowed to climb. Needless to say, this was a big worry for me as it was the most anticipated part of my trip which had required weeks of preparation back home. They helped me closely monitor the weather conditions, book the bus reservations to Mt Fuji, and asked about making hut reservations, and so much more and for not just the climb but also for my entire stay. The coordination between the staff was excellent. It's hard for me to describe this adequately in words, but I felt really well taken care of and was sad when I had to leave for Kyoto. I was highly appreciative of the care and consideration I received and impressed with the concerige desk's competence and thoroughness. My experience at the Hilton has made my trip special and memorable and set a new bar when it comes to service.","San Francisco, California",42,5.0

Else can also walk to Shinjuku train station, a mere 15 mins short walk.The room was pleasant and clean, with housekeeping doing a good job cleaning the room daily. The room amenities were adequate that we don't have to bother the hotel for anything. The hotel team members potrayed excellent service, with dedicated professionalism, as expected of their culture. The hotel lobby was interesting, sat people-watching for 30 mins at the lobby and you can feel the buzz and excitement of the hotel (busy but well-handled). The complimentary hotel shuttle bus to Shijuku was very appreciated indeed, always on time and never late.

Our favorites were the executive lounge and lobby staff for their friendliness and help in anything we needed or just good directions in navigating the city with the trains and metro. At first the underground is intimidating but once you get a feel for it you can go anywhere. Wandering and getting lost in the underground was part of the fun with this city. Just be careful during the rush hours, the movement of people is amazing to watch. The Hilton's Executive Lounge was the best we had ever experienced.

A very pleasant surprise! After a speedy check-in, the check-in staff escorted me to the elevators and wished me a pleasant stay. Another pleasant surprise!After entering room 3010, my first impression was that it was spotlessly clean although the furnishings were looking a bid dated. Even the dark brown day bed had permanent scratch marks on them. The bathroom was an OK size, the complimentary toiletries were from Crabtree and Evelyn, so not too shabby. Nonetheless, not long after entering my room, my luggage came in double quick time.As I stayed in a junior suite, I was given the option to purchase the buffet breakfast at 2,500 yen instead of the regular price of 3,600 yen. Even though there was a huge selection at the buffet breakfast, the quality was only average. Hence, I only ate there once during my four night stay. Also by staying in the junior suite, I was given complimentary access to the 24 hour gym and the swimming pool that closed at 8 pm every night. Why can’t they make the pool open 24 hours, like the gym or at least close later?In terms of service and warmth, this hotel is top notch. In the hotel lobby, concierge will stand in strategic locations to attend to guests’ queries and provide assistance. This hotel also has a complimentary return bus shuttles service to Shinjuku train station leaving every 20 minutes so it was really useful. However, I noticed most of the people who took this shuttle service don’t even stay or work at the Hilton. I don’t know why the Hilton allows this, they should make this shuttle service for hotel guests only or start charging these freeloaders. As I had to check my email, I went down to the business centre to use the desktop computer and internet. Very expensive! 800 yen for 30 minutes! On top of that the desktops they had were really old. The RAM was less than 1GB and the MS office was still the 2003 version. Because of the exorbitant charges, I only used the business centre internet only once for 30 mins during my entire stay.Apart from the expensive internet charges, my right hand was almost taken off by one of the elevator doors! I was in the lobby wanting to go upstairs and was rushing for an elevator that was closing so I stuck my hand between the closing doors. This should have caused the elevators doors to open but it didn’t! I had to wrestle my right hand from the elevator jaws of death! All in all, I had a pleasant stay at the Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku, and would probably stay there again when I am in Tokyo again. What would make it go from ‘probably’ to ‘definitely’? Cheaper internet.","Singapore, Singapore",16,4.0

The staff are phenomenal from the check-in team, the tiny lady who delivered my bags to the room (half the size of me), to the housekeeping team who left origami cranes on turn-down.

Had a room 20 floors up so the view was nice. There are many skyscrappers on this side of the train station. The room was tiny compared to Singapore and Australian rooms. The bathroom was tiny. Clean room with all the amenities were supplied. The complimentary bottles of water were only supplied for the first day. Had a twin bed configuration and they were singles. Gym access was included, there is not very much equipment in a small area but it is enough for a good workout. Pool is indoor. When walking to Shinjuku Station the quickest route I took was above ground, turning left as you exited the hotel and that took about 7 minutes. You could also go underground all the way to Shinjuku station with that taking 15-20 minutes. There is a 7/11 and family mart close by in the basement of the Hyatt Regency.

Shinjuku is a super gateway to lots of the best of Tokyo, well connected by subway and teeming with the massive malls that Tokyo is awesome for. The hotel is classic Hilton, so no surprises, but large rooms which can be hard to find in a world of pods and love hotels. Also happy to be able to get a KS bed in a country where doubles are standard. For long legged peeps, this is surprisingly hard to find, and was weirdly one of the dealbreakers in staying here. Not cheap compared to other business hotels, but certainly makes returning home easy, glam and a little luxe.

This literally drops you off at the door and the very friendly staff are on hand to help you with your luggage etc.I am a diamond member, so the check in service was carried out in the executive lounge. The staff were friendly and very welcoming. The executive lounge is quite small compared with other hilton properties which was quite strange given the number of executive rooms / guests with access. However, more on this later!The hotel restaurants were good - but expensive. The sushi restaurant was excellent quality but nearly 200 pounds for my wife and I. Yes the fish is the very best quality, however, still pricey. The room service was nearly 50 pounds for the sushi menu alone. Appreciate that hotel food is generally over priced, but even still, thought that this was a little steep.The room was good. We had an executive suite which had a nice sort of living room feel to it and a main master bedroom. The bathroom was tiny though compared to the room...but that is being picky. Overall, good. I would recommend this type of room if you can. The room was on the 38th floor - good views too of Tokyo.Now, back to the executive lounge - the food and drinks on offer are fine - if you can actually get in the lounge. On the Saturday evening (we were there from Friday to Monday) the lounge was so busy that a booking system was introduced. There were no tables available from 7pm. Guests were turned away as the lounge was full. When I asked to have a look, I was slightly bemused by the fact that one guest had been sat a 4 seat table and other guests were not able to use the table. Simply, not good enough. Guests were sat in the lift lobby waiting for a table which I found rather strange. To be fair, we only experiences this on the Saturday night. It is not the first time though that this has happened if you read some of the other reviews...Overall, excluding the poor executive lounge experience on the saturday night, I would recommend this hotel as the title of my review states, it does what it says on the tin!You cannot go far wrong at this hotel.

Not sure what the actual room cost would have been because we did use airline miles to pay for the room. The hotel staff were outstanding, the service was above expectations. The front desk staff were very helpful, even though we were paying with miles we even got upgraded for free to the next level of room on the upper floors (not the executive floors). The rooms were very nice and ours even included a great breakfast buffet with the room. The pool was the only area we were not thrilled about. It was narrow, shallow, and nothing to write home about. But that being said this mostly a business hotel if I had to guess and it was set up for those who want to swim laps, not relax in the pool. So for those people I'm sure it's fine. The food in the buffet was very good but if you have to pay for it, the prices looked very expensive. When we arrived the first day we almost went to the lunch here and I believe the conversion to US $ was about $60 PP for lunch, so we skipped it. Otherwise the hotel was great, I can't say enough about hot police and helpful the staff were. The bellman and bell women were so attentive and helpful as well. There is a free shuttle that leaves every twenty minutes to the train station, you can walk to the train station but it's about a 10-15 minute walk. I don't remember there being a lot to do or see around the immediately hotel area, although there is an underground dining and shopping area attached to the hotel.

I recently spent almost a week in Tokyo Japan and had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton Tokyo hotel in Shinjuku. I'm usually one to wander around the city on my own but given the potential(guaranteed?) language barrier I was a bit hesitant about doing that; especially with Tokyo's huge railroad and subway infrastructure. All those concerned were completely laid to rest when I ran into Tariq Lacy. Unassuming as he was, he made a genuine effort to approach us as we were waiting for the shuttle and immediately began to build a genuine rapport with us that didn't even seem like something he begrudgingly did because it was his job. He took an honest interest in our reasons for choosing the Hilton and took the time out of his job to circle the places of interest that would pique our curiosity as well as prioritizing each location so that we could make efficient use of our time. The man was fantastically brilliant in his suggestions and it is great to put a face to such a large company like Hilton. His attitude, professionalism, ability to read people, and charming honesty is a great way to humanize what can be an overwhelming experience with a busy establishment. I truly believe that Tariq Lacy was the reason that my friend and I had more fun than we anticipated and I don't know what I would've done without his patience and understanding at my ignorance with travelling in a city that doesn't retain english as its primary language. Because of Tariq, I was able to navigate the railways, subways, Harajuku, Akihabara, Shibuya, Asakusa, and Shinjuku. I believe that he made the difference in our entire trip and he makes for a marketable and extremely valuable asset to the Hilton Tokyo staff and Hilton Hotel company.

Of course, food in the hotel was very expensive. For those who want to avoid the 3,675 yen ($46) breakfast, we recommend that you walk to the left around and behind the hotel, past the hospital, to a restaurant called Jonathans (a little over two blocks away -- you'll see it to the left once you pass the hospital). We had a wide choice of breakfast items including full American and Japanese breakfasts for under $10. The very friendly staff speaks little English but the picture menus are easy to understand and the food is very good.","South Pasadena, California",76,5.0

I stayed at the Shinjuku Hilton in the summer of 2011, and now in May of 2012. I had good experiences both times. I stay in a standard room, which is either a queen bed or two twin beds. The rooms are a pretty basic hotel room layout, with the closet and bathroom first thing as you walk into the room. The bed area is the bigger open space, with a built in desk area and a flat screen TV. There are Japanese style screens for window shades, with a thin screen for light but privacy, and a pattern screen for complete darkness. I like the 70's-80's style leather swivel chair. Standard rooms typically do not include breakfast (2500-3500 yen per day) or Internet (1680 Yen per day). The rooms at the Hilton Shinjuku all have great views of the neighboring highrises and the surrounding areas. Its cool just to sit in your room and look out at the city lights at night.

To be honest it will take a bit of time to explore the city that is so large and couldn't be totally covered within just a few days. We chose Hilton Tokyo simply because it was quite close to Shinjuku station and the massive Shinjuku garden for the cherry blossoms season. We weren't disappointed.Cab ride from Shinjuku station, one of the stations that connect to the Narita Express line, is only about 700-800 yen. The walk from the station would only be about 10 minutes but the hotel has a shuttle bus service between the hotel and Shinjuku station leaving every 20 minutes. Now that's a plus that I wasn't informed before booking and wow.. this ended up being the ""killer"" feature that we decided not to move to hotels in other parts of Tokyo (to explore more).Unfortunately there was nothing special about the normal room in particular. It was a little bit dated but it was spotlessly clean! One of the nights we moved up to the Executive Floors just to see what it was like and yes, it looked a lot more modern and up-to-date. Bathroom on the executive floor was still a little bit small.As far as the facilities are concerned, everything was above average. The staff crew handled everything quite professionally. The concierge made bookings to restaurants a couple of times for us. Breakfast in the lobby does get very crowded at times that they have to direct you to some of their restaurants on other floors-so better get there really early or really late. The gym was very well equipped and it's open 24/7, something normal hotels don't do which is great! It's also extremely well equipped. And if you're interested there's also a tennis court.Overall, our stay at the Hilton Shinjuku was good. Wished the standard rooms are more up-to-date.

Beds were comfy, shower was great, tons of little bathroom goodies and effective temperature control. Even felt safe during one of the many tremors so common in Japan. Obviously, location was superb, with Shinjuku station mere blocks away and a shuttle bus to/fro if you just don't feel like walking it. And airport transportation is great, whether Narita or Haneda with bus service, train service, Narita Express etc. Other highlights include: great buffet breakfast, nice hotel smell in lobby, friendly staff with good English, sufficient gym for travelers. Some refinements needed: hotel floor was musty, carpet a little worn out, tv was small, hotel bar and restaurants pricey, but it's Tokyo so what do you expect? Finally, let me say that the concierge was great, most notably Tariq. This guy was super cool, fluent English AND Japanese. (he's from U.S.) and soooo helpful. Especially if you want to immerse yourself in Japanese culture from an American point of view. His recommendations were spot on as were his directions throughout Tokyo and beyond.

Upon arrival I was immediately greeted with courteous hotel staff equipped with an umbrella as it was raining that night. The front desk was very courteous as well and provided me with maps of the local area as it was my first time in Shinjuku.The room size and view was pretty decent. I wouldn't consider this a 5-star hotel as the price and rooms aren't up to par with other hotels. But nevertheless it's more than enough for the value and location. We went to Sizzler Sunday morning which is down the street and it was excellent. Theres also a Park Hyatt Hotel down the street which has a bar called ""New York Bar"" which was in the scene of Lost in Translation and you'll definitely want to visit there. But be advised you may have to reserve a spot ahead of time and the menu is expensive. What you'll get in return is live music, amazing view, and an amazing experience. On another note you might hear the sound of an ambulance from time to time as the hotel is right next to a hospital. So for the price it can't be beat but it's not quite the top notch hotels in Tokyo I am accustomed to which is why I can't give it a 5-star rating.

I was pleased with my stay as the hotel continues to improve and offers a very pleasant room, well equipped gym and a staff that is both supportive and well-versed in English. Its location is very safe and close to a number of convenience stores and restaurants within walking distance. My Diamond membership had expired a week prior to my stay (darn!) so I did not experience the lounge, but my memories were that it was actually a very good lounge.I actually paid for the room (rather than points, which I would have preferred). The bizarre Hilton redemption scheme does not make it easy to get the type of room you would like and I had experienced a lot of difficulty with their systems (not fault of hotel). I bought a junior suite which offered a seating area and a bigger room. Of note, it was one of the only rooms I saw at a hotel in metro Tokyo that would allow 4 adults in a room at any price, and the overall price was quite reasonable.In retrospect, had I realized that my diamond membership was expiring, I would have either bought the executive level suite or given points for the upgrade. The access to the lounge for breakfast, as well as free wireless, would have been worth the extra costs, particularly if you have more than one guest per room, or more than one wireless device. Internet access otherwise was $20 per device and breakfast was ranging between 2600 and 4000 yen, which drove us elsewhere.Hiltopia (their underground shopping arcade) was a bit of a disappointment, but if you go across the street to the Shinjuku I-Land area there is multiple levels of restaurants that are good values, but have varying levels of English support. All cuisines are represented. Starbucks, McD, Dennys all within walking distance as are most brands of convenience stores. High end dinners available at Mon Cher Ton Ton / Seryna on top of the Sumitomo building across the street with some of the best views of the city (just bring money, lots of money).Bedding was comfortable, bathroom clean but a bit small.There are two reasons why this is not a five star rating. The first is that it is not on par with the five star hotels I have stayed in in Tokyo (The two Four Seasons for example) and the service response level to special requests was a little slower than I would have liked (e.g returned to the room at 2:30 pm after leaving at 4:30 am for Tsukiji and the room was not made up). So, my recommendation would be to be very direct with your requests and call to confirm things if needed.All in All an enjoyable stay, and a good value.","Madison, Wisconsin",61,4.0

Everything was perfectly arranged as requested when we arrived, fantastic! We found the rooms of decent size and comfortably furnished; ours were adjourning regular guest rooms on the 19th floor, the deluxe rooms are of the same size but located on higher floors. There is wireless and wired internet access from the rooms at extra cost. We found time to enjoy a swim in the hotel's rather tiny indoor pool which was located on the same level as its rather more impressive gym. There is a free shuttle service that leaves three times an hour for the nearby Shinjuku JR station which was a great convenience as this allows one to get to the many brand name stores around there (Isetan, Uniqlo etc). The metro is also easily accessible through an underground passage connected to the hotel. Staff at the Hilton were always attentive and helpful, even though the concierge managed to mess up our airport limo bus reservations (which ultimately cost the hotel an otherwise ""excellent"" rating for this review) for our departure by reserving seats for only half our party.

We stayed in early November and when I entered the hotel, it was breathtaking. Their decorations rivaled some of the best I have seen in New York during the holidays. Transportation from the airport was very easy and we used the airport bus and were dropped off at the front entrance. The train was a short walk away, though very crowded at times. If you are claustrophobic, I would enjoy the breakfast at the hotel and then venture out after rush hour.Front desk personnel spoke English well and were very helpful, especially when I had to venture out to find bubble wrap!The website offers two choices for the King room. Opt for the King Executive because it really is not much bigger than a standard sized room.The bed was comfortable, closet and bathroom on the small side which is why I gave a 4 star rating, but then again this is Japan.","Orange, California",143,4.0

It's a bit off from the main train/subway station - yes there's shuttle running from Shinjuku station and back but it runs only til 10pm - so if you are out for dinner or late evening drink/shopping you are out of luck. Alternative is a good 10-15 minute walk - not terrible but just bear that in mind.Room size's great from a Japanese hotel standard point of view - good 300 sq feet for their standard room. Nicely equipped with free water and Crabtree & Everlyn toiletries. Don't expect spectacular view from the hotel in the skyscrapper district but view from higher floors can be quite nice on a clear day. Service's okay - as one reviewer mentioned, language's never a problem. Called belldesk and housekeeping for several occasions and things were delivered straight away. Before I came, I emailed the hotel to ask for help with some restaurant reservations, but never got a reply. They only told me it's done when I checked in - by that time I already got my booking sorted out by someone else (yes the concierge by a certain Platinum charge card is awesome) Got free breakfast in the lobby coffee shop as part of the HHonors perks - very nice buffet style breakfast but it does get quite crowded at around 8 before everyone got off to work. I would say this is a perfect hotel for business ppl (esp if your office's close by) or couples on sightseeing/shopping trip (for its room's bigger than average), if the price is right. After all Shinjuku's a good base point for travelling around Tokyo. Would think twice if I were travelling as a family - I wouldn't fancy dragging kids to walk such distance from station to hotel at night.","Hong Kong, China",20,4.0

Although the hotel is about a 15-minute walk from the Shinjuku Station, it provides a complimentary shuttle to and from the Shinjuku Station that runs every 20 minutes. The hotel shuttle stops at the side of the Keio Department Store (on the upper-most street level) on bus stop number 21, which is at the West exit of the Shinjuku Station.Getting from the Narita Airport to the hotel is very convenient since the Airport Limousine Bus stops directly at the hotel (we only knew this after arriving at the hotel).We stayed in the normal deluxe room, which is large for Japanese standard hotel rooms. The room was very clean. The hotel placed us on the 8th floor in room 824. Luckily, we didn't have to walk far since this room is very near the elevator. The only comment is that the medium-size TV was placed a bit far from the bed. We had to glare from the bed to watch the TV.The staffs were very helpful. Additional praise would go to the bell lady (or concierge) who would help transport your luggages without worrying about how heavy they are. The hotel has many restaurants including a buffet. There is a Denny's restaurant 2 blocks from the hotel.Area-wise, there are vast shopping centres around the Shinjuku Station such as Keio Department Store and Odakyu Department Store.

The staff were nice. It can get crowded in the lobby.Rooms: I stayed on the executive floor, which gives access to the executive lounge. This lounge is nice as it provides breakfast/dinner; drinks, etc. The breakfast was good. Limited selection, but you should be able to find what you need. Dinner is really a broad selection of small finger foods. Dinner time gets very crowded as people come for the ""free"" food and drinks. Wireless is ""free"" too. The room was above average in size. The bed was average. Someone mentioned the lack of a robe, but I think they hid them in the drawers...you have to open each one to see if they are there. Bathroom was good...had your 'technologically' advanced toilet too. Outside noise was not an issue.Location: I did not have time to walk around; but this area appears to be close to business and government buildings. There is direct access to the train (via underground passages). Taxis appeared easily accessible. For those who do not want to spend a fortune on the hotel's breakfast, there is a Denny's directly next door (not sure of the cost though).Verdict: Above average hotel that I would stay at again.","New York City, New York",45,4.0

We couldn't have chosen a better place to stay, and we will return to the Hilton if we are ever fortunate enough to visit Tokyo again. I've read the reviews below, and absolutely concur about the excellent service, wonderful views, pretty rice paper screens, quiet location, and most of all, the friendly and professional staff who were there to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Since so many positive attributes of the hotel have been mentioned in other reviews, I'd like to add a couple that haven't been mentioned recently. First, the concierge staff was extremely helpful, and provided excellent information for us. They gave us advice on buying a PASMO card, made several phone calls for us when we inquired about specific places we wanted to visit, and suggested some wonderful restaurants, varying from cheap and authentic to fine dining. Their help was invaluable to us and really enhanced the quality of our trip, which had been planned somewhat hastily. Another great feature of the Hilton is the lobby escalator that goes down to a passage linking the hotel with the subway. Very convenient. And lastly, the location, while quiet and a few minutes walk from Shinjuku station, is convenient to some great breakfast options. Royal Host is a diner that is almost next door (to the left exiting the hotel) and offers a cheap American breakfast. Also, there's a 7-11 in the basement of the building across the street, and like all 7-11s in Japan, it has an ATM and free wi-fi.

You always get hello from every staff member, they will always offer to help you with transport, checkin is very polite, maids do a great job cleaning the rooms. There was even a maid supervisor who came around to the rooms to check if I was happy with the way it was cleaned. Never had that in any other Hilton. Good breakfast, good bed, good shower, enough space in the room to spread your stuff out (all important to me as a frequent traveller).Whoever the staff drill seargent is, he needs a pat on the back, he's really good at his job. Or maybe its the team who hire good staff.Either way the service delivery is precise and excellent.If I had to nitpick it would be a couple of things they can't change easily. Some of the common areas have a slightly darker set of colours which makes it feel a bit late 90s in design, and the location is a 10min walk to Shinjuku station which is a bit irritating in winter if you walk it.Also stayed at the Cerulean Tower up the road in Shibuya, which while good, doesn't stack up to this.Impressed.","London, United Kingdom",8,5.0

You will find all the comforts one is accustomed to in a Western style hotel - a very good English speaking staff as well as high quality and spacious accommodations. The basic room design is clean and simple and attests to the theory of less is more. I especially liked the sliding rice-paper window shades which allowed soft light into the room while providing privacy from potential voyeurs from neighboring tall buildings. Not to worry, there are blackout screens to help those overcome their severe jetlag. There is an electric kettle for self service coffee and tea; but, for those who are not crazy about instant coffee just keep in mind there is a Starbuck’s just behind the hotel which opens at 7 AM daily and figure about $5 for a grande.This high-rise hotel is serviced by the best elevators I have found in any hotel - fast, smooth, almost silent and even more important, a sufficient number of them!The hotel offers an adequate exercise facility, indoor pool, “his and hers” locker rooms each with a sauna, Japanese soaking tub and relaxation area. Remember to remove your shoes before entering these areas! Be careful when entering any area with a bamboo floor or one with mats, you will probably need to remove your shoes or fear insulting your host.The hotel offers dining alternatives for virtually any international taste – Western, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc. But a word of caution: hotel dining is very expensive and figure on close to $30 for buffet breakfast in the lobby lounge area. The good news is the buffet offering is quite extensive and if you are on an expense account, this is probably no issue.There is probably no city on the face of this planet that has more restaurants than Tokyo. You might want to consider purchasing a dining guide to assist you in your culinary planning. If you want a real culinary adventure, visit the food halls in the basement of virtually every Tokyo department store. And on the top floors of these same stores you will find a wide array of high quality small restaurants. While not inexpensive, these restaurant generally offer a pretty good price-value relationship with their culinary offerings.You will be amazed at what is available in the Japanese department stores and should you purchase an item, you will quickly learn anything you buy in Japan is respectfully wrapped and then a clerk will come from behind their counter, present you with the package and bow. Macy’s should take note…But if you are looking for a relative dining bargain close to the Hilton Tokyo, consider Denny’s (open 24 hours) located adjacent to the Starbuck’s right behind the hotel. An inclusive breakfast of an egg, slice of bacon, link of sausage, little cup of coffee and a small green salad will cost about $7, a veritable bargain compared to dining prices within any Tokyo hotel.If you start to go through hamburger withdrawal, you can find a McDonald’s is some locations; but, there is a Sizzler just a block from the front of the Tokyo Hilton. While I do not normally place Sizzler on my dining map – a charbroiled burger with fries and beverage for $10 tasted awfully good after five days in Tokyo.""Arigato"" Tokyo Hilton, it was a very nice visit and I look forward to returning.",New Hampshire USA,19,4.0

That being said, the JR train lines are perfect, use the Yamanote Line and you can't go wrong, it does a large ring about Tokyo CBH and all the stations are dead in the middle of each district either for shopping, or Temples/Shrines, or Sumo. Definitely consider getting a Japan Rail Pass (only available before you get to Japan). No tickets to worry about, all JR included, except the two fastest Bullet trains, and great value with unlimited use. Also if you can, you must get to the Sumo tournament if one is on when you are in Japan. Tickets are available online, get seats in A section on first floor: perfect.","Cairns, Australia",8,5.0

The pool staff were very helpful and let us borrow swimming caps.4. The breakfast was wide ranging and filling.They welcomed us by name, and mentioned they could help with early check-in and check-out because of the Gold status - whether that's special or not, it made us feel special that I'd taken the effort to rack up the nights to get gold.Location wise - it's a short walk to 2 tube stations, but a 10 long minute walk (mostly undercover) to Shinjuku. we arrived by train from the airport, and it was a bit of a trek with luggage to the hotel. On return, we took the hotel bus straight from the lobby which was much less hassle. For kids, there's a park and playpark across the street, a Denny's nearby, and Shinjuku has the department stores and noodle places. We found the local metro station the quickest way to travel to the tourist sights.In contrast we went to the Hilton in Seoul a few weeks later, and they almost made it a point not to have a room ready for when we arrived, all the little things were charged - e.g. a swimming cap in the pool, a razor and toothpaste if you had forgotten them etc. When asking about the hotel bus in Tokyo they asked when my flight was and looked at timing.

We had the convenience of taking an airport bus direct to the hotel, for the same price as catching the Narita express, which would've taken us to Shinjuku station, approximately a 10-15 minute walk away.The bed and facilities were comfortable, and staff were extremely polite. My only complaint was the location. Of the business hotels in Shinjuku, it is located furthest from the rail station and department stores (most of which are at Shinjuku station and on the other side). In hot humid weather, it was quite a walk to get to the station. On our return from Kyoto, we stayed at another business hotel for a slightly cheaper price, which we found to be comparable to the Hilton in terms of standard and quality.

A typical Hilton setup, which might suit travellers who like to look to a hotel chain which is well known and reputatable . However, I do feel it has not live up to its name . Here are some pro and cons of the hotel1) Transport : Narita Limo bus bring you up directly to the hotel lobby , there is a tunnel next to the hotel that you can walk to Nishi Shinjuku or Tochomae subway station. Of course, you can walk to the world busiest train station : Shinjuku station in about 10 to 15 mins. As its winter, we have opted to take hotel complementary bus ride to the station and the service end at about 940pm . pretty cool !2) Check in /checkout : its a breeze. typical hilton service . I did try to speak Japanese, but they still response to me in English. 3) Room : Im quite disappointed with the room as not as big as i thought.I suspected it's not even a Queen size bed for 2 person to sleep. the furniture is dated and the room lighting is dim. The only plus point is the small ""bay window"" which u can sit there and view the night scene of Shinjuku4) Envioroment : As this is not the mall or shopping side of Shinjuku , so it s all office building , suprisingly, the nearby 7-11 or family mart is near nishi shinjuku subway station, so need to walk about 10 mins in order to get to your convience store .

I had spent many days researching hotels in advance of my trip and trying to decide where to stay. I read and re-read all of the reviews on TripAdvisor and I chose Hilton because of its reputation, its location, and the price. While I kept second guessing myself up to my departure date, once I arrived I was comepletely satisifed.It is a large western style Hotel located a brisk 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station. You can take the train directly from Narita airport to Shinjuku and then walk (luggage permitting) to the hotel. Shinjuku station is a sprawling sea of humanity and after a long international flight you would be wise to print walking directions in advance! Tokyo is somewhat like New York City in terms of expense (and size - though Tokyo is larger!). The rates for the Hilton were commensurate with New York City hotels and, for Tokyo, very reasonable. They were certainly much lower than many other hotels.I did not choose to prepay breakfast but I ended up eating at the buffet every morning. Yes, there are other places to eat in the immediate area (including a Denny's and a myriad of eateries at Shinjuju station) but for quality, quantity, and convenience, the hotel buffet could not be beat. As a further note, there is a subway entrance directly outside the hotel lobby door which made for a much warmer walk to the nearest metro station which was still a solid 10 minute walk away.There is not too much in the immediate area of the hotel other than large office buildings. But the Shinjuku shopping area is only 10-15 minute walk. In short, if you are going to be in Tokyo, you should consider the Hilton.","Houston, Texas",15,5.0

The hotel itself is a typical Hilton so you can rest assured that you get good service and all facilities such as restaurants, business centre, gym etc.Upon check in we were upgraded to an Executive Floor room owing to my status with the hotel chain. The room was very nice and clean with crabtree and evelyn products and had direct proximity to the Executive Lounge.The lounge itself is no doubt something you have read about many times in these reviews - it is a spectacular benefit in expensive Tokyo. You can have your breakfast, afternoon tea [small scones and tiny pastries] and dinner which has a variety of buffet type food. We ate here very often and it was very nice.So when you book consider the Executive floor option - it is worth it if you have more than one person in your room. We also had breakfast in the Marble Lounge which was even better since they have a chef who can make omlettes or fried eggs for you.The location of the hotel was very good in Shinjuku so you will have good proximity to restaurants and shops if you fancy a wander, there is also a free shuttle to Shinjuku station which is very convenient although we prefered to walk there.Quick tip on the booking, when I searched for the price for 4 nights and for 7 nights the total worked out to be exactly the same. So, if you are planning on staying at 2 different hotels double check and get a quote for the whole duration too. One other point, there is a hospital just round the corner from the hotel, so on occasion you can clearly hear the ambulances racing to and from the hospital even from the 37th Floor. I would suggest going for a high floor and specifically asking them in advance to put you in a room which is as far away from the hospital as possible.","London, United Kingdom",61,5.0

Traveling with 2 young children and their grandparents was no easy feat but the staff made us feel right at home the entire time. I used my HHonors points for one room and paid a very attractive ""advance purchase"" price for the other. Upon arrival both rooms got upgraded to the executive level which was without fuss. The room upgrade is an HHonors benefit (Gold status or above) but is also subject to availability. You may want to check in early for the best chance or pay a daily surcharge to guarantee an upgrade. The extra amenities and services you get from an executive level room and the lounge are definitely worth it. Our kids loved the (almost) around-the-clock access to free drinks and snacks and the executive lounge team provided impeccable services with warm, mesmerizing Japanese hospitality. Our 4-year-old was greeted with daily jokes (in both English and Japanese), kiddie utensils (Anpanman) and Hilton bear toys, and was treated with utmost patience and accommodation. The view from the 37th floor lounge allows a good glimpse of Mt. Fuji on a clear day. Our rooms on the 36th floor were clean and well-appointed, as well as surprisingly roomy by Tokyo standards. We had a baby crib, a double stroller and 3 large suitcases in the room with ample space to spare. Speaking of the baby crib, it was the traditional, bulky and wooden type provided by the hotel. The housekeeper must have spent over 25 minutes setting it up with a nice mattress and fitting it with proper bed sheet, pillows and a sham. What a treat! Our 1-year-old is used to sleeping in folding cribs half the size with non-existent padding. In terms of kid friendliness, I would never have thought this hotel would get high marks, judging from the presence of mostly business and leisure travelers in the lobby and lounges. We had breakfast one day at the Marble lounge and dinner at the teppanyaki restaurant. The food and service was top-notch but we got a bit of a sticker shock considering the strong yen. The free shuttle bus service to Shinjuku JR station (every 20 mins) was nice but we actually enjoyed taking walks which took only about 10 - 15 mins. There is a 7-11 convenient store across the street in the basement of the Hyatt Regency and tons of restaurants are in the vicinity, some hidden on the top floors or the basements of office buildings nearby. The hotel is also connected to the Shinjuku station via an underground walkway lined with stores and eateries. There is a park (Central Park?) a block or two away with a playground and a Japanese shrine on the premise. Near the Mini Cooper dealership (exit the lobby, turn right and walk a block) there is a Starbucks, a neat little food mart and a pharmacy. The location is really not as inconvenient as the map suggests, even though you will not find yourself in the middle of Kabukicho or Shibuya stepping out of the lobby. By the way, Tokyo is such an exciting and dynamic city with a unique character. Even with 2 kids we managed to do some explorations around the different districts experiencing the culture, food, sight and sound. We weren't a bit reminded of the tragedy that struck this country in March and paid little attention to the unsettling potential of radiation contamination. We had a choice to skip stopping over in Tokyo but I was glad we didn't.

My requested yukata and foam pillow were ready in my room as per my pre-arrival request. Room smelled of stale cigarettes even though it's non-smoking room. I didn't bother to request for a change of room as it's quite late in the night and it's cold and I was too lazy. Next morning breakfast at the lounge was ok, don't go expecting a full spread of breakfast,rather basic continental stuff, the lounge was busy but again service was good. They even allowed me to stay in the lounge after I checked out just to kill time before my train schedule was up. The lounge affords a birdeye's view of the cityscapes, rows of trees burting with colors of different shades of orange and yellow at this time of the year made for interesting view.Next stay was exactly a week later after my trip to Hiroshima. This hotel was again very busy, people were arriving by the busloads for whatever occasion the hotel was having. They didn't have a club room but had a regular room and offered free breakfast and internet for which my status entitled me to. Took that offer up as I didn't really want to waste time waiting for a club room to avail. This time room was fine without that stale smoke smell. Basically no difference between a deluxe room and a club room. Yukata and buckwheat pillow waiting for me in the room. Breakfast was sufficiently good at the lobby level, better than the club lounge. Ok this is Tokyo, don't go expecting value for money especially when it's a Hilton. It's pricey as it is. 40,000 yen for a basic room is a lot to pay for. Good thing I got a corporate rate. It's located at the office block area of Shinjuku. (chome 3), so it's quite a distance from chome 2 where all the famed Shinjuku area is. Hence the area around the hotel is pretty sterile.

I suppose it is not too bad as I don't smell any kind of stale smoke in the room. However, my check-in is not smooth because the keycard cannot unlock the door.

He used his other keycard to unlock the door and said that he will send a new keycard to my room later. I should have asked him to put the new keycard under my door or I collect it the next day from the front desk. As I wanted to sleep immediately due to jetlag after a long 7 hours flight.

I booked from the Hilton site when they had a discount promotion and it was by far the best value quality hotel in Tokyo. I liked the location. It was walkable from Shinjuku station or there is a shuttle bus that takes you to the hotel from the station. The bus stop takes some finding so note where it lets you off. It looks like there are no restaurants close by but they are located inside or at the bottom of the office buildings. Avoid the restaurants under the hotel in the ""Hiltropia"" underground area. They are very traditional and overpriced. If you cross the road and go down inside the building, there is a 7 Eleven store that sells great sandwiches, a huge variety of drinks, snacks and anything else you might need for your day trips. It also has an ATM machine. If not clear of the location, ask the staff. The afternoon bus tour sold at the hotel was a disappointment. You are better off catching a cab to the park near the Ginza area, catching the river boat cruise yourself from the park, getting off at the Yasakusa Shrine, then catching a train back to Shinjuku Station.

It is very convenient if you are trying to catch a train or subway line. There is also the red subway line that is about 3-4 minute walk from the hotel.About the only downside of the hotel is the lack of non-smoking rooms. I was on a smoking floor, which was not my first choice. Unfortunately, there were no other options.

The nearby lounge bar makes great liqueur coffees called “Latte The Mozart” (1270¥) which was coffee crème liqueur, espresso and whipped cream - delicious!We were upgraded to the Executive Level on one visit. One porter organised our luggage while another person escorted us up to our room - top service! The rooms were a decent size with lovely views. Very neat and clean, usual bathroom amenities and the beds were comfy - as one would expect of Hilton.Compared to Australia, they have unusual toilets in Japan. In our room, not only were they electric and heated but had all sorts of gadgets (like an inbuilt bidet) and when sitting on their toilet, the water starts to run into the bowl - have no idea why that happens, but a visit to their loo was quite ""entertaining"" ;)The Executive Lounge is large and the buffet breakfast was quite good. If you don't want to eat breakfast at the Hilton, there is a Denny's closeby (about a 5 min walk).Hilton were very obliging and held our bags in storage overnight (while we travelled to Hiroshima for a couple of days) without charging any ""holding"" fees. Would certainly recommend the hotel and we would stay here again if we returned to Tokyo.","Hervey Bay, Australia",258,4.0

The rooms are older style, but tasteful and a good size, not large but just fine. The Exec floor rooms have been modernised with better bathroom fixtures and fittings, but overall all rooms are very clean neat and want for nothing. We were a party of three, and two had Exec rooms. The beds and pillows were new and very comfortable, had a good rest and that was the main thing. All staff I encountered spoke English very well. The best view and food is from the Executive Lounge and the staff were very helpful.In I-LAND tower next door on B1 there are lots of different restaurants, we enjoyed the Indian one called Maharaja, it was very authentic and fairly priced for a Tokyo restaurant. There are lots of other choices too if you have a look. We used the Limousine Airport Bus to get to Narita, previously we have used private transfers but thought we would give this a try.

It was painless and in moments I was in my very nice room with a great view of Shinjuku.Every day, the club lounge staff provided a nice breakfast and evening snack service. Eating outside the hotel was easy, as there were many restaurants near or at the Shinjuku station.Due to the tragedy in March, electrical conservation occurred everywhere. Half the elevators in most buildings were off (Not the Hilton I think as I never waited for one), all of the underground escalators or moving sidewalks, and the thermostats in the train stations were set to 'Oven' strength. It was clear that most people observed the 'Be Cool' program in effect and shed their ties and jackets.By Friday of that week, a sinus infection I had picked up the previous week in another country was raging, and I decided to seek out a doctor that evening. The staff of the Hilton Lounge was unbelievable. They were genuinely concerned that I was sick. Suwabe-san was on the phone talking to the hospital next door to the Hilton, which told him they were full for the night and do not come there. Then he called another hospital in Shinjuku and received word they were not as busy. He accompanied me to that hospital in a taxi and translated to the staff. At all times he was professional and concerned about my health.We arrived back after midnight from the Emergency room, after which Suwabe-san wished me health and walked home from there.I was astounded at how dedicated and caring the Hilton was to send a staff member to translate at that time of night. The staff member, Suwabe-san, and all other staff of the Hilton displayed a service ethic I rarely see around the world.The next day, the staff of the Lounge were asking how I was feeling, even those who had not worked the previous evening!In every fashion, this property has embraced an outstanding service ethic that on top of the fine property and it's upkeep, make it a prime destination for Japan travelers.",Southeast Florida,132,5.0

Room is spacious (thank you for the upgrade!). The decoration is sort of Japanese-style, The room, including the bed, is comfortable, although I am not a big fan of the glass round table, which is not very convenient for eating/drinking. Typically the room I get has a nice view of the Shinjuku skyscraper. I like the view.They have a gym and a (tiny) pool. Internet is not free, even in the public area; you have to pay 1700 yen (about 23 dollars) per day to get connected (I hate it!). It is a walking distance to the Shinjuku station, which is one of the biggest hubs in Tokyo. Probably 15 minutes. They have a shuttle bus to the station every 20 minutes, if you don't want to walk. It's a pity that the hotle is not directly connected to the huge Shinjuku station (you have to walk outside for like 5 minutes), but it is connected to two subway stations.Overall, with the competitive price, I think it's one of the best deals if you want to stay in Shinjuku, which is a convenient place to stay if you move around in (especially western part of) Tokyo.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",110,4.0

Staff is amazing. Extremely helpful and goes way out of their way to help. Can't praise that enough! Gym facilities are pretty good, again by Japan standards, and pool is nice.

Go for the buffet on second floor restaurant - has dessert and wine selections as part of the buffet ( nominal cost) .Shinjuku area is great, especially at night and weekends. Check out the lights and action behind Shinjuku station- like mini-Times Square in New York. Many street performers, but fun just to watch the beehive of activity of thousands of people, the billboard light and tv displays, and great energy! Lastly, station is great hub to get essentially anywhere in Tokyo. The area is safe and clean, train system is extremely prompt, vast network, relatively easy to use ( get a suica or pasmo card instead of fumbling with change at each station - cards are easy to get at station. Load with a few hundred or a thousand yen or...) and the cars on train are unbelievably clean. People are quiet and reserved and talking loud or on cell phones can be viewed as being rude, but they are generally tolerant of Westerners behaving in this way...).

The room is spacious enough and has a rather futuristic look - the desk is a sheet of glass. However, there new room designer has either never stayed in a hotel for more than one night or decided that Hilton guests have nothing that needs to be unpacked and put away:- there is no dresser in the room- the desk does not have drawers- the bedside tables do not have drawers- there are no drawers or shelves in the closet.This assumption may be tolerable for Japanese domestic business travel (one or two nights max) but it is certainly annoying and inappropriate for core Hilton HHonors travelers like me who go, stay for a few weeks and work out of the room.By the way, the Imperial Hotel and the Hotel New Otani do NOT have this problem and if you are traveling for business, your corporate rate for these properties might not be that different from the Hilton corporate rate.Another quirky problem with the Tokyo Hilton is that the computer program that prints your bill does not understand that they have a block of addresses and the like on the bottom of there letter head. As such, the last several lines of each page of the hotel bill are obscured. Depending on just which sort of angels of death your accounting department employs, this problem can be quite annoying when you get home.A third problem for extended business stays - the ""speaker phone"" is not a true speakerphone, but rather more of an ""on-hook-dialing"" phone. That means you have to hold the handset for those lovely hours-long middle of the night conference calls.The hotel does have a few good points:My favorite is the door girls. That is, most hotels around the world have doormen. The Tokyo Hilton has a corps of extremely outgoing, energetic and cheerful young women who wear the uniforms that a doorman would normally wear. They are incredibly cute. Having one of them open your taxi door for you with a bright warm smile makes your whole day (at least it does if you are a middle aged guy like me)Another useful point is that the hotel lobby connects directly into the network of subterranean passages that connect several of the subway stations in, around and including Shinjuku station to the Tokyo City Hall. If you are comfortable moving around Tokyo by subway (the best subway system in the world by far!) this feature can be extremely handy in inclement weather.The overall service system of this hotel suffers from poor coordination. The hotel makes a lot of mistakes. However, this problem is somewhat compensated for by their young, energetic, friendly and outgoing staff. One one Saturday morning in the coffee shop, a young woman who looked about 28 and seemed to be the shift supervisor came over and simply chatted with me and the similar aged guy sitting at the table next to me. She was very relaxed and natural and spoke excellent English. I and the other guy both walked away in good spirits with a positive outlook for the rest of the day...","Austin, Texas",100,3.0

My friend knew that and booked the Hilton Tokyo for me and fully paid for it but Hilton Tokyo's staff has just about the worst attitude out there...The brief story is that due to a change in plan, I was arriving one day earlier in Tokyo.Originally my friend kindly booked the Hilton Tokyo for me for two nights already. Ithought I will inquire Hilton directly to extend my stay at a good rate especially sincethere was a ""stay 3 nights"" promotion going on. I wanted to pay for the 3rd night on my own and don't want her to pay for the extra night.Hilton replied with a rate and just when I was about to book it (because I thought Hilton guarantees the best rate booking from their site), I have another friendshowed me another online website that is actually offering the same room at less than 50% of the price! Therefore, I explained myself, declined the Hilton official ""offer"".However, I DO NOT understand after I explained myself in a very nice email:1) Their staff (Misaki Ito) rudely replied and encouraged me to book my stay from another channel?2) Then, when I emailed them again to confirm with them that I have booked another hotel for my 3rd night stay, their staff (Hirose) responded that if I wanted to claim ""Best Rate guaranteed."", I should have had a reservation number. Also, she said since I stayed at another hotel for the third night, if I was not planning to stay at Hilton Tokyo I should contact Hilton at my soonest to cancel. (NO!!! I was not claiming anything but really can't book through the hotel directly since their quoted rate was MORE than 200% of the other online rate. Because of the first girl's attitude, I did not feel comfortable booking the 3rd night at Hilton. Even though honestly I did not feel comfortable staying at Hilton Tokyo even for the 2 nights that my friend booked for me, her staff didn't need to suggest I need to cancel my booking!!)Overall, the attitude of the reservation staff was horrible. Then, when I arrived on the day my friend booked for me. I asked for a one-bed bedroom because my spouse and I married. The check-in staff there rudely replied that mam', they follow the reservation strictly and since for some unknown reasons, my friend did not state that we need a one-bed bedroom but just 2 people, they have arranged a 2-bed bedroom for me, and I was told very rudely how I just cannot change rooms upon check-in like that. On top of that, the hotel shuttle bus was really way too small, and has almost no room for luggages, my spouse and I from North America has large pieces of luggage and cannot fit our luggage in the luggage area on the bus (so small!!) and we had to take the luggage onto the bus ourselves through the small door without help (unlike the other hotels that we stayed at in Japan; the staff were always rushing to assist us with our luggage). The shuttle bus runs every half hour, but because it is so small, it can be full and you may not get on and you may end up waiting an hour for the bus.I asked the hotel staff for directions to attractions and their English was really poor.Therefore, I stayed away from having further contacts with staff at Hilton or to use their amenities and just wanted to finish my two-night stay there and leave immediately...",Canada,21,1.0

If you've been looking for a hotel in Tokyo you probably realized how expensive it can be. The Hilton Tokyo is no exception. It was around $425 a night (from US dollars to yen) which included a buffet breakfast. Since they charge per person that's probably why the cost was high. The Hilton Hotel provided the best room we ever stayed in. Nice size living room with large TV. Large bathroom. And most importantly an extra bed. Not a cot but a real bed!

There is a fee (about $20 per person) for the pool and a separate fee for the fitness center. However, between 9pm and 6am the fitness center is free as there is no staff working during those hours.

The bus ride from Narita to the hotel can take up to 2.5 hours in the Tokyo traffic.You can walk to the Shinjuku station for a great selection of restaurants and shopping. The restaurants in the hotel are severely overpriced - breakfast runs a steep JPY 2500 (which was supposed to be a ""discounted"" company rate). There are quite a few additional restaurants and a few pricey shopping places in the basement of the Hilton called ""Hiltopia"". There is an Indian restaurant called Ashoka that I really liked and that offered set lunch menus at less than JPY 1500. The rooms at the Hilton are quite spacious by Japanese standards and have been refurbished since my previous stays here in 2005 and 2006. However, I would term them as just ""average 5-star"", i.e. there is no ""wow"" factor. The bathrooms are tiny and have drab lighting, walls, and tiles. The rooms are minimalistic, but functional. They also offered free wi-fi access this time (which I noticed has become more common in the 5-star hotels across Asia). Overall, this is a good hotel, but I would rate it as an average 5-star.

Once again the service was excellent, the rooms were lovely and clean and the staff can't do enough for you. On check-in, there had been a miscommunication between the travel agency and the hotel, and we found 2 rooms booked, but for only one person in each (instead of 2). Despite being fully booked when we made the reservation, there was no hesitation in solving the problem, and we were given the two adjoining twin rooms we had originally requested.The breakfast served downstairs was a lovely selection of Western and Japanese, although on our budget, we couldn't do this on a daily basis. The beauty of staying in Shinjuku is there is no shortage of places to obtain food. Most nights we would stop off at Keio and purchase some of the lovely food they sell on B1, which is always beautifully packaged up to take back to the hotel. It is mostly Japanese food, but there are a few counters that give you an alternative (i.e. Italian). With the Aussie $ down against the Yen, it wasn't as cheap for us as last time (it was level then) but still a great alternative.With Shinjuku Station so close - 15 minute walk, or catch the courtesy Hilton bus which leaves every 20 minutes and drops you off at the Station - we were able to get around Tokyo easily. We purchased a Suica card on our last visit, so just topped it up with a few thousand Yen and we were off. We mostly used the JR Yamanote line, which does a look around the most visited places in Tokyo. We were also easily able to get out to Disneyland and DisneySea by taking the JR Chuo Line Rapid to Tokyo, then a 10 minute walk through the Tokyo Station to catch the JR Keio line out to Maihama Station, right outside Disneyland. We were also able to use our Suica card for these trips too.We love Tokyo so much, this won't be our last trip, and we will definitely stay at the Hilton again.","Sydney, Australia",0,5.0

My kids thought this was great.The buffet breakfast on the ground floor was very good, with a wide variety of Asian and western food. The location worked well for us. It was close to both my work meetings and to leisure activities for the family. The very busy Shinjuku train station was a short walk away.

We had been fortunate to book our rooms during the Hilton's recent advanced purchase, half price weekend sale, so were able to enjoy a junior suite for around the cost of a regular room. On our return stay we were able to purchase an upgrade for minimal cost, giving us access to their executive lounge and free internet access.Service is impeccable. All staff are friendly and nothing is too much effort. All staff speak faultless english making the stay very easy. Our room was huge, with a modern japanese style and well appointed but compact western bathroom. The room was so quiet, we heard nothing from the corridor or near by lifts. Bed comfy, aircon quiet and the right temp, great range of toiletries etc. The breakfast buffet was an extensive range of western and japanese food and staff coped very well with the volume of guests (our second visit was during their spring long weekend, a very busy time).Like almost every building we saw in Japan, the hotel is spotlessly clean and perfectly maintained. The housemaids do a turn down service and clean the bins and offer you fresh towels if you want. The hotel is an easy 15 min walk to Shinjuku station and many department stores and the restaurants and nightlife of East Shinjuku. The hotel runs a free mini bus to and from the station each twenty minutes. We had english language newspapers delivered every day without having to ask.The concierges (there were always at least 2, so no waiting) were always very helpful and as is the japanese way, expected no tip. Likewise the number of people to check you in and out meant this was also very efficient, there must have been 6 staff at reception when we checked out.We enjoyed a beautiful meal in their French restaurant, clearly a special occasion venue, but by japanese restaurant standards it was not an unreasonable cost for the high quality food and service.

My signifcant other and I wanted to avoid the usual shoebox hotels in Tokyo, so somehow we ended up the Tokyo Hilton. Probably like many of you, there were preconceptions with Tokyo and Hilton. Gleaning from Lost In Translation, Tokyo can be such a metropolis in a parallel universe. And for Hilton, having a night visioned viewing of Paris Hilton would give the Hilton name a different zing. So with that, our stay in the Tokyo Hilton started with a revonated room but with a typical beige plasticky Japanese hotel bathroom. The view was of buildings and streets, just like any typical view in a city, but at night, it just lit up and somehow it just felt right. The room was spacious so we didn't have to reconfigure the furniture to fit our suitcases, although I gathered the front desk gave me a slightly larger room judging from the fire escape map. I wasn't a fan of the glass table/desk though, as the supporting legs can be a toe jam hazard. The sheets were soft, there wasn't any dust on ledges anywhere, and they actually had decent bathroom amnenties that didn't smell like latex gloves. Housekeeping did have to bring me another water kettle though as the one in our room was lined with water plaque. And for this inconvenience, they gave us some fruit - actually 1 plum, 1 apple and 1 banana I may add - to be fair though, they do sell ""premium"" single bananas in the supermarkets for like 280 yen, so it's not like the Housekeeping manager decided to give me half his lunch.You can always be rest assured with 5 star service in the Tokyo Hilton. The rooms are immaculately made up, the Concierge is experienced and knowledgable and the front desk never roll their eyes- so your needs be will tended too. There's a shuttle bus to Shinjiku every 20 minutes, and if you're up for it, walking just takes 15 minutes. I didn't eat in the hotel at all as you will be overwhelmed with food choices in Shinjiku alone. And if you do your homework before you arrive Tokyo, you would have lined up all the great dining spots from the fish market to various fine dining spots.My original decision to stay at the Hilton was to strike a balance between price and room size.

The Hilton Tokyo, (there are also other Hiltons, including one at Narita airport), is in the luxury class for sure and deserves top ratings, both as compared with other hotels in the area and globally.This sounds like an overly enthusiastic exaggeration, but it is true.With some 45 years of world travel and thousands of hotel nights behind me, I can say it with conviction.Every aspect of the service and facilities is top drawer. Apparently, the hotel was totally renovated a year or so ago and for all purposes, it is a sparkling new property with every convenience. We had a 30th floor up-graded, (they said), room with a stunning view towards the Shinjuku station area about a half mile east. At night, the view beyond and towards the center of the sprawling city was spectacular.Arrival welcome was perfect. Desk personnel should be used to train all US hotel staff in courtesy, efficiency and knowledge.Cute and efficient are only way to describe door/entry personnel who welcomed our airport bus and immediately handled luggage carefully and quickly. It was in the room almost as soon as we were.All room elements were perfect with great, comfortable beds, plenty of storage space, LCD TV, computer access, (hi speed internet service, if you want it, is about $20/day), excellent lighting, mini fridge, all day water boiler for tea/coffee, safe, big closet with real wooden hangers and much, much more….things I don’t see in top of the line hotels elsewhere. The most interesting novelty in the bathroom was a combination bidet and squirt toilet seat. It might take you awhile to figure it out, but it is different. Certainly a new high in personal hygene.Things to know:Hotel area, Shinjuku, is great as a base for business or tourism. Quite and safe with restaurants outside hotel costing considerably less than hotel food places. Long ride from Narita airport, and with traffic, prepare yourself for as much as 2 hours or more to get from airport to hotel.Prices in Tokyo, with current dollar value, are steep, but match those of most other World Class cities. Bar prices in the hotel are about the same as in New York, Paris, Frankfurt or San Francisco. There is NO TIPPING or add on taxes, so it is not as bad as it first looks, but be prepared for $20 drinks and bottle prices that are prohibitive for some of us poor USA tourists.Meals can also be costly and if you can deal with the local places, you can eat for a lot less. In general, most restaurants that are not at street level and have a western name will be cheaper. This is not always the case, because there are some top places with American names, but there is a Denny’s, (not the same menu as US Denny’s, but adequate food 24 hours a day), almost next door and another English-based restaurant, Royal Host, down the street where breakfast or lunch can run at less than $10-15 each. Most meals I ordered anywhere were fine, but portions are smaller than one might expect and they reflect one reason that there are very few visible fat Japanese. If you want to lose weight, this is the place to come because fats and carbs are not as common on most menus, with the exception of noodles which are, of course, a staple. But dining in house at the hotel will set you back about the same as it would in other major hotels in any big city elsewhere. Nearby, within walking distance, are two Hyatt properties with top rated restaurants and the price of a dinner there will be in the $200-300 per person range or more. Michelin stars notwithstanding, food quality seems to vary and often you may be paying for the flash and glamour as much as for the food and beverage.This is the quietest hotel I have ever been in as far back as I can recall. I heard no outside or inside noise over the five day stay. Even the elevators are silent! Only exception is that there is a major hospital next door and occasionally ambulances arrive with accompanying sirens. You can dine or have tea in the lobby patio restaurant at any time, but the St. George bar, which permits smoking, closes at one a.m.Free hotel buses go to and from the Shinjuku station, the nearest rail and subway hub, every 30 minutes. Airport limo/shuttles will cost in the $30 range one way and should be booked well in advance.If you want nightlife, remember that subways are closed (literally), from midnight to 5 a.m. and during that time, taxi is your only option, other than walking. Taxis are expensive.English is spoken here, but less so elsewhere in Tokyo. If you need help, there are plenty of uniformed personnel everywhere throughout the city and they all seem willing to help with just about any problem you may have.Although I don’t usually book Hilton properties because a few years back they tossed out several thousand of my Hilton Honors points when I was not using their hotels enough to suit them, I will still recommend this hotel as a fine place to hang your hat in Tokyo.One other comment: if you are not accustomed to big city homless camping and living in the parks and on teh streets, Tokyo will perhaps shock you. Even on the Imperial Palace grounds, there are hundreds of dug in homeless with their temporary tent shelters camped out.Unlike street people in other cities, they keep to themselves and do not bother anyone. As far as we saw, the police ignore them. We saw no beggars anywhere.","Fort Pierce, Florida",451,5.0

It really was fantastic! Especially at night!Lots of the reviews here complain about the size of the room. I have to say mine was OK. Not huge but OK (like any other Hilton in North America). I guess the size of the room may depend on the type of room you book (the room I had looked VERY different from the pictures posted in some of the reviews).Other than the rooms, the hotel is very clean and with good service. The staff downstairs may seem cold but I believe this to be due to the language barrier only - they were always willing to help! The hotel has a couple of VERY expensive restaurants. I don't think its worth eating at any of them. If you have to eat at the hotel order room service, it’s a bit cheaper and the food is great!

At the check in, they told me that the exec floor is fully booked. In both cases, I opened my laptop, went to the internet hilton site and showed them that I can still book an executive room. After doing so, they gave me (after calling around forever) a room with exec lounge access. Not good, Hilton !

This property was part of a package vacation we purchased. The package itself (out of LAX) was very inexpensive and included air on Singapore airlines, bus transfers from Narita to the Hilton and a half day tour. When we arrived at the Hilton we had no perspective on whether the hotel was centrally located. The lobby is large and beautiful. We were given a room on the 14th floor- nice, reasonable size for European standards, but not totally special. We met folks on the 23rd floor (not executive). They had free internet in their room,- ours was $20 per day. I still can't figure out why (and we are Hilton Honors members!) As others have said, the beds are somewhat hard. However, they are not so hard as to prevent you from crashing after walking around Tokyo all day. The location is close to the metro, with an underground walkway to one station and a free shuttle bus that takes you to the Shinjuku station. I am not sure that I would necessarily stay in the Shinjuku area on a return visit, as the Hilton is in a business district. However, with metro access you could easily get anywhere. One down side of this hotel is the unbelievably high price of it's breakfast lounge. Breakfasts are $38 here. Most people I met walked one block to the Dennys or the Royal Host coffee shop and had breakfast for under $10. Also,between 4 and 6 PM the hotel had a dessert bar in the lounge with a chocolate fountain. However, that too was $38- which was too high of a price for a snack for this poor American... Finally, the concierge service is available 24/7. They aren't extraordinary but they were helpful to provide maps and very basic recommendations. In all, I would recommend this hotel if you can get it for a good price or as part of a package.","Wexford, Pennsylvania",144,4.0

Inspired by Lost in Translation - but not able to afford the Park Hyatt – I opted for the Hilton, which is just along the road. I booked an Executive Room which included access to the Executive Lounge (free breakfast, drinks and snacks), gym/pool access, and free internet. I found this to be very good value for money at just over 140GBP a night – more than I would normally spend on a hotel in Europe, say – but a very competitive rate for a quality four star hotel in Tokyo with all these services included. We took the Airport Limousine Bus from Narita to the hotel – really simple to use - out of arrivals and the Airport Limousine Bus counter is facing you. At around 20GBP one way it’s a very convenient and affordable door to door service. If you want to take a taxi be prepared for a massive dent in your wallet - you’re looking at an astronomical fare of 150GBP plus!The room was ready when we arrived at midday and they let us check in straight away. I found the reception staff to be friendly and courteous. In fact, all the staff we came across here were very polite - bowing, smiling and helpful. Our room was on the 37th floor with views over the tower blocks of Shinjuku. (The roads are incredibly clean – the markings look like they are repainted daily!) The room décor was light and bright, contemporary yet simple - it could be a hotel room anywhere in the world - but I liked the paper screens on the window, a nice Japanese touch. The room was spacious enough, with sufficient cupboard space for a 5 night stay, and all the usual amenities you’d expect: safe, iron, mini-bar, bottles of water and tea/coffee facilities. There was a large flat screen TV – just a few basic English language channels - but some there are some interesting things on Japanese TV that’s for sure! The bathroom isn’t huge, but it’s bright with an anti fog mirror. There was good shower pressure, plenty hot water and a funky Japanese toilet – complete with built in fountain (it’s an ‘interesting’ experience!) There’s an extensive range of toiletries (more than you really need!) which are replenished daily. The Executive Lounge is also on the 37th floor, with panoramic views of the city. It’s not massive but it’s spacious enough - there is lots of seating and it never felt busy – calm and relaxing. Breakfast is served here daily with a good selection of western and Japanese items. Later in the day, afternoon tea is served, and there are cocktails in the evening. We were always out during the day, so unfortunately missed these on all but one night!The hotel has a number of restaurants and a great little patisserie although the pumpkin cheesecake is an acquired taste! There are loads of other eateries in the vicinity – lots of local restaurants plus the likes of Burger King, Denny’s and Starbucks.Tokyo is huge. The metro may look like a bowl of coloured spaghetti at first glance, but it’s actually really simple and very efficient. You can get to the Metro system from the hotel basement – although it’s a good 5 minute walk through an underground passageway) A rechargeable PASAMO card is a very wise investment and can be bought from the ticket machines at the station. It might take a while to get anywhere, but this metropolis is well worth exploring!","Edinburgh, United Kingdom",43,5.0

I had a great HIlton agent, she found a rate code that's lower than the airline crew rate, the nightly rate was quoted around USD $130.00 before tax. I'm not sure how the agent did it but it was confirmed.I'd say the hotel service is excellent but will rate it as 4 because I only checked-in and out, and not a problem asking for a late check-out (2:00pm), I'm also a Hilton Honors member.The lobby is nicely decorated, there's also a pharmacy on the same floor which I didn't realize until it was closed, my fault for not paying attention. The room was okay, size was decent for a two night stay but I thought the furniture was a bit dated, hence maybe the low rates? The bathroom was fun, err..what I meant was the toilet had one of those washer/bidet, I've forgotten how nice it is to have one to use. I'll spare the details.In the room, slippers, robes, complimentary tea, electric hot water thermos, LCD TV, and sad to say no free internet, it'll cost around USD $17.00 for a 24 hour period.Not much more I can say about the room, it's great if you get a good deal but if you had to pay closer to USD $180.00 per night, I'd say look somewhere else.Quick tip: When arriving into Narita Airport, after customs and you've just stepped out into the passenger arrival area and need internet access, walk towards the ANA check-in/ticket counter, they have free internet access, let your laptop find the signal and connect! It's great if you need last minute checking of whatever.This time we took the JR train (non-express) from Narita Airport into Tokyo, transferred at the Tokyo Station to Shinjuku Station, roughly around USD $15.00 per person. The bus for Tokyo hotels was about USD $34.00 per person and maybe 30 minutes faster or just as long pending traffic.The Shinjuku Station is perhaps the busiest in the Tokyo area, be ready for the crowds!There is a complimentary Hilton Shuttle Bus between Shinjuku Station and the Hotel. The schedule is 00, 20, 40 of the hour. Bus stop number 21, right outside the department store. This is a nice department store, the lower level is all about food!The hotel is located in an area not exactly close to the main strip, you'll need to walk a few blocks, once you're oriented in your bearings you might opt walking to Shinjuku Station versus taking the complimentary Hilton Shuttle Bus unless you have your luggage with you. By walking you'll get to pass by many little stores, shops and if you need a comfort zone ""Starbucks""Don't be alarmed with the noise, not from traffic but from the bugs...Cicadas! You would never believe the noise coming out of these little monsters! The bulk of the noise is concentrated in the park nearby. For such a short trip, we did locals things; fish market (get there early), Imperial Palace, Akasuka, Temples, a little shopping. Like I said earlier this was a last minute jet set trip as we have reservations at the Westin Princeville in Kauai in a couple of days (read my write-up if you get a chance).It's cheaper to get a day pass for getting around on the local train, around USD $10.00 per adult. On our way back to the airport we continued to use the day pass to the Tokyo Station then bought the JR (non-Express) ticket to the airport which was about USD $12.00 per person. Make sure you ask for ""non-express"" it's much cheaper and about 30 minutes slower, I think the agents automatically default to ""express"" and the ticket was much, much more!Oh, one more thing...observe their custom especially when taking the train.",San Francisco,16,3.0

He even scuttled over to tell me that I could have it now seconds later!! Plus the bar staff in the St George Bar were nice but pretty clueless about what beer they served.

We came from Hyatt Kyoto via the JR train to Shinjuku station. When we hopped off the train, no taxi would take us to the hotel – probably because they didn’t want to lose their place in line for a short taxi ride to the hotel. The Shinjuku station help desk kindly told us that there are shuttle buses to and from the hotel outside the station near Keio. Therefore, if you’re coming from Narita airport, take the limousine bus to the Hilton, and if you’re taking the JR train, take the shuttle bus from Shinjuku station.Upon arrival, staff are ready to greet you and will kindly take your bags while you check in.

The hotel is 5 minutes walk from two metro stations and just under 10 minutes walk from the larger Shinjuku station. These stations make it easy to explore Tokyo and there are plenty of shops and restaurants within an easy walk of the hotel if not actual ""sights"".We tried to check in at 3.30pm and were asked if we were checking out! It seems that check out / check in times are late in the day here as our rooms were not ready. After a 30 minute wait in the executive lounge we got our rooms. The rooms were a good size by European standards but not executive sized by some standards. Wired broadband is fast and no charge.Tried out the gym which is complimentary if you have an executive room but if not, outrageously, at additional cost. The gym is small for the size of the hotel but was fairly quiet, perhaps its Hilton Tokyo's policy to price out guests who might want to use the gym. There was also a small indoor swimming pool and a Japanese bath/sauna.The executive lounge offers a good selection of drinks and canapes between 6pm and 8pm which we enjoyed. The lounge got busy so get there early to find a table. Didn't have dinner in the hotel but tried late night drinks in the ground floor bar. After signing the bill I notice that we had been charged Y1,300 per person cover charge! We queried this given the very mediocre piano/cello players in the corner who hardly justified any cover charge and were told it was a mistake by the barman, as we were in executive rooms there was no cover charge. The whole episode gave a poor impression.Breakfast in the executive lounge was good. Again the lounge was very busy so don't arrive late to get a table without waiting.After our ""late"" check in we were offered a ""late"", 2pm, check out.Would stay again in an executive room at the right price but would not stay in a non-executive room unless the hotel recognises that it is completely unjustified to charge guests extra for use of the gym/pool and hotel bar. In my opinion this is absolutely unacceptable and very underhand by the hotel - they should be more open and honest about the extra charges they impose!",United Arab Emirates,160,4.0

Of the several (granted, generally nice) hotels in Japan I've stayed in over the past few weeks, this was one of the least enjoyable, owing to the following:1) the downstairs reception/lobby area was at all times very crowded and noisy, especially with the contending buffet area alongside, and bags at all times lined up on carriers in various sections either awaiting check-in, airport transfer, etc. This common area seems not adequately designed, spacially or acoustically, for the heavy traffic, or at least comfortably so.2) despite arriving at 4pm (well after check-in time), we were made to wait 20 minutes for our room. And there was no place to sit while waiting (see #1).3) rooms were very average, with bathrooms in particular lacking much of any attractiveness that I would expect in a hotel of this stature (this being rated in comparison to various other Tokyo hotels I've stayed in).With this said, the hotel is in a very desirable location in Shinjuku, with much within walking distance, including the Shinjuku station (though you may prefer to take the free shuttle), Park Hyatt for drinks. Buffet breakfast was included in our room rate and, aside from weaving through the masses to fill the plate, the food and service was overall very good.","Orange County, CA",8,3.0

The concierge and hotel staff were uniformly helpful and friendly. The hotel's meeting facilities were better than a lot of other places I've stayed. The hotel is a short distance from Shinjuku station, and there are regular, free shuttles run by the Hilton and other nearby hotels between them and the station.

I stayed at the hotel from 30 May until 12 June for a large trade show. Typically 80% of the trade show participants stay across the street at the Hyatt, with 10% at the Hilton, and the other bargain-conscious 10% spread amongst the discount joints throughout Shinjuku such as the New City Hotel across Shinjuku-Chuo Park from the Hyatt. This hotel has no shortcomings as far as I can tell. I have read the reviews about the executive club being crowded and poorly managed, but I found just the opposite. It was only crowded once on a Saturday where we had to wait for seating,and the staff and management are outstanding. Incredibly attentive service for a club. Exceptional bartenders with a full range of premium liquors and excellent food make this club the finest that I have ever experienced at a Hilton. The Regency Club at the Hyatt across the street has a very limited liquor selection and doesn't have a bartender, and their food selection is far less than the Hilton's. The fitness facilities and pool are far better than the Hyatt's with the fitness center being at least three times bigger than the Hyatt's. The very best thing about the fitness center are the huge ""onsen-style"" gigantic hot baths (like giant jacuzzis) with accompanying cold baths and sauna. There is no better way to wind-down from a hard day's work or tough workout than an extended soak in this wonderful bath with a few cool dips or sauna sessions interspersed! Food at the restaurants that we tried was outstanding if somewhat pricey--but hey, it is Tokyo and everything in a first-class hotel is expensive. Housekeeping staff were always quick and efficient and quickly adapted to my odd trade show schedule. Another great advantage of the Hilton over the Hyatt is the powerful aircon units: For 15 years I always stayed at the Hyatt for my trade show and could never get the room cool enough, but at the Hilton, I can make the room as cool as I want, winter or summer. The concierge desk was superb and took hours helping me with a customs problem on my trade show shipment. This is a truly wonderful hotel and outstanding in every way.

So expectations were higher than what I received. Three star review is probably little bit too strict, but on the other hand there quite much better hotels in my four star review list so cannot go higher… As a concrete example Hilton Osaka was clearly better in many aspects. Location:Location is surrounded by high office buildings, main restaurants/bars/shops are in the other part of Shinjuku (~15min walk). There are some restaurants in the basement of the building next door though (multiple Japanese, Burger King, Italian place, Indian place and a very decent Kirin bar). There’s a complimentary shuttle bus to Shinjuku station but its completely reasonable distance to take a walk. Room:Had a junior suite in 17th floor. Room was clearly bigger than a regular one, based on floor plan it was almost double the size. So certainly enough for me as a single traveler. Room was very clean and had been renovated some time ago. Bathroom on the other hand did show some signs from 80s. TV was a smallish LCD screen and there was the normal equipment such as safe box. I didn’t notice any particular Japanese theme in the hotel, except in the room windows there curtains were replaced by traditional looking wood/rice paper blinds. Which was small but nice touch. Service: Service was not quite up to the normal very high Asian luxury hotel standards. For example according to the normal Hilton rules a HHonors Diamond member is always allowed to use Executive Lounge, regardless of whether staying in Executive Floor or not. That was not the case in this hotel, I was asked to choose between lounge access and buffet breakfast. This might sound like very minor thing, but those minor things are really the ones making difference in this level between 4/5 star hotels. Oh and didn’t receive any upgrade either (didn’t expect one though). Lounge was rather large and had quite good offering, including cocktails (between 6pm and 8pm). Instead of champagne they were serving sparkling wine, rather unusual I have to say in this kind of executive class lounge. Etc: Breakfast downstairs didn’t officially start until 06:30, but we had to leave every morning at 06:30 in order to catch the train to the other side of huge Tokyo city for business meetings. So we came in already at 06:00 and ate whatever was available then, normally everything but hot food was already in place. There were quite many other people doing the same, so perhaps an official start at 06:00 would be in order based on demand?  Tried the lobby restaurant once, Hilton Burger was very average and quite expensive. Beer was very expensive. Breakfast was, on the other hand, quite good with very extensive selection. So no complaints there. Didn’t try pool or gym so cannot comment them. Value for money was not the best here since hotel is quite expensive!

Aside from having a spectacular view of the Shinjuku skyline (and it's glorious at night), the hotel is right on the subway line (Nishi-Shinjuku) and just down the street from Shinjuku Station which is a major starting point for just about everything in Tokyo. The staff and concierge service are wonderful. They were friendly, spoke English well and were helpful with all our questions. The rooms are comfortable, very clean and well thought out. Nothing overly fancy, but enough room for two people to be content with natural colors and bright lighting. The bedding is glorious if you like down though I found the bed to be a bit hard. The television doesn't have many English channels (HBO, CNN and BBC), but that seems to be standard for Japan. We hooked up our laptop with an AV cable and watched movies. Our floor had free wireless which wasn't slow or buggy so we were easily kept entertained when we were in the room.The workout facilities are extremely nice. If you like tennis, there are two lovely courts outside. Inside, you'll find a pool and other standard gym equipment. I especially liked the locker room which had a sauna and a hot tub - great after a long day of sightseeing. Both times I've stayed here, I've opted for the Executive level which is perfect if you like a good breakfast and enjoy food throughout the day. The Executive Lounge is probably the best amenity in the entire hotel and well worth the extra price considering how expensive eating in Tokyo can be. The food is delicious, the service excellent and you won't find a nicer cocktail hour (champagne anyone??). The place is usually packed so get there early and grab a window seat to enjoy the views. Drawbacks? No coffee maker in the room! A small complaint but we got up early one morning and found the only place to get coffee was in the main lobby at 900 yen a cup.

The breakfast downstairs was very good, large, and had great variety of foods (Japanese breakfast as well as Western breakfast). I definitely recommend eating breakfast downstairs in the Marble Lounge.We ate dinner one night in the Japanese restaurant and, although the food was good, it was at least 10,000-15,000 yen more expensive than a comparable meal would have been in a good local restaurant. That is to be expected in a hotel, however, in hindsight, I would have eaten somewhere else.The downstairs concierge was very good and made reservations at the office building across the street for dinner one of the nights we were there and the dinner was great, moderately priced, and the view was amazing. Even if you are staying on the executive floor, use the down stairs concierge and not the executive floor staff.

(Take the West Exit from the station to go to the shuttle bus stop.)The hotel's location in the heart of the Shinjuku business district is probably what explains its high rates, because when it comes down to a careful evaluation of the hotel, it is a typical Hilton property with standard rooms. I booked my room on the Hilton web site, but later found a cheaper rate through Orbitz. I tried to take advantage of the Hilton web site ""low price guarantee"" but they have so many requirements to qualify for the guarantee that they were able to wiggle out of honoring it.I booked my room through Hilton's website because I am a member of the Hilton Honors program. But despite being a diamond level member, I was placed in a standard room on both of my stays in January. Other than getting Hilton Honors credit for your stay, I can find no other benefit to booking through Hilton, so if you want to stay at this property at a more economical rate, I would advise shopping around at other sites.The rooms are quiet, comfortable and well designed. The hotel underwent a major renovation recently, so the rooms have a ""new"" feel to them, although the decor is bland and uninteresting. The beds are very comfortable and the down comforters are a perfect weight; not too heavy, not too hot. The housekeeping is flawless. The rooms have flat screen televisions, but no dvd player or ipod docking capabilities. In-room internet service is provided at a rate of Y1680/24 hours.The bathrooms are small, plain, and the amenities are just the standard ones found in most all Japanese hotels. I was a little disappointed that there was only one bar of soap to be shared between the wash basin and the bath. The towels are also standard issue.The hotel's restaurants are excellent, but expensive. I use an informal ""Hilton Burger"" index to compare restaurant rates from Hilton Hotel to Hilton Hotel. At Y2000, it's an expensive hamburger.The hotel's overall service level is excellent. It's consistently enthusiastic and efficient.

There you will find a supermarket and a gourmet deli area with some terrific prepared foods. It is also a great place to practice your newly learned Japanese phrases on some of the locals. Japan has no tipping and this is very welcome when ordering food, or taking a taxi.The free shuttle bus to Shinjuku's main train station from the Hilton is also a nice touch, should you be travelling outside of Tokyo, or anywhere on the JR (train) Line. A great day trip is a 55 minute train ride to Kamakura. This is a mini-Kyoto, with temples, shopping and a giant Buddah. Also try the Yanaka area, just outside of the Nippori Station for more temples, a Buddah, and a large cemetary with the graves of some Japan's famous Shoguns and celebrities.Both the train and subway are extremely user-friendly with English instructions.Attached to the Hilton is ""Hiltopia,"" their shopping mall with restaurants and shops galore.Returning to the airport is a 90-minute breeze on the Limo-Bus.

Also, many of them would not allow a triple or 2 adults & 1 child, I suppose maybe due to the small sizes of the rooms.As time was running out, I had to bite the bullet and book at the Hilton, and with a credit card deal, got a junior suite (non-executive floor) with breakfast. However, the price per night was almost US$400.At check-in, we were given breakfast vouchers only for the 2 adults. When questioned, the staff said that this was the standard rate, even though the booking was for 2 adults and a child and I also had an additional foldable bed for the child. They did give me the child's breakfast vouchers in the end, but only after I made some noise about it. You won't expect my child to go out and eat on his own, and the child's rate at the hotel breakfast was about US$40 !!!The room itself was excellent and spacious, it faced the back and had a partial view of the Shinjuku Garden. The garden is just across the junction from the hotel, making it convienient for a morning stroll. Room amenities were also complete, and there was enough space for my child to run around.The hotel breakfast was great and very comprehensive, covering both Japanese and Western tastes. The service staff were very attentive, and my child made friends with the omelette chef. Our first morning there coincided with a Japanese public holiday, and the breakfast area was very crowded with a long queue to wait. But the staff were still very polite and actually opened up the bar area to allow more people to be seated faster.The conceierge also deserves a special mention. We did have a few stores/museums/places that we wanted to get to, and each time exact directions were given to us, with the train/subway access as well as the local map of the place, if it was not in a large building.

We ended up getting a spot everyday for both breakfast and evening cocktails but it certainly packed to the limits. The staff at the exec lounge tried their best but sometimes found it hard to cope - this is a problem at many Hilton properties, in my opinion. I found the overcrowding problem actually worse at the Conrad in HKG. The food in the Tokyo Hilton's lounge is OK, but not as good as other properties - the best I can recall was Hitlon Bangkok and Conrad Singapore. Service at Tokyo Hilton was good, especially concierge and housekeeping. However, we found the food & bev. prices at their restaurants to be not only very high but TERRIBLE value for money. At their Teppan Grill, for new year's eve, we were charged $1250 for 3 people. We knew this going in but expected a gourmet experience (supposedly a Japanese 5-course dinner).

Once you get there, the entire city of Tokyo is easily accessible to you. It's less than 15 minutes to walk to Shinjuku station where you can pick up the JR or take the subway to any of the wonders Tokyo has to offer. The hotel had a lot to offer for a ""city"" hotel. Rooms were good sized, which was nice to see after hearing horror stories about Tokyo hotels. The gym was large and clean and the staff was always ready with complimentary bottled water or towels. There were tennis courts, but they were fully booked during my stay. Umbrellas were available to guests, free of charge and taxis were plentiful. One of the nice things about the area the hotel is in, is that there is little street traffic. It's a very easy five minute walk to several 7-11 type stores (and two McDonalds if you just couldn't make it another day without a big mac). Insider tip: you can walk almost the entire distance between the Shinjuku station and the hotel underground by follwing the signs to the Tokyo government building, which was great for chilly days.The breakfast buffet, though expensive, was a good way to start the day. It had something for everyone from American standards like pancakes, to crepes, to simple Japanese dishes. On a less enthusiastic note, the hotel bar was deserted and too pricey for what it offered. There was a Belgian place called Frigo a few blocks south west that got most of our business.I'll close with an example of how good the service was.

Unfortunately, my experience with the Hilton Tokyo in Shunjuku was not as positive. The hotel website proclaims quite proudly that it now has newly renovated rooms and an executive floor. Well, thats as far as it goes really. While the rooms look nice and new (for now), the housekeeping is somewhat not what you would expect of a top notch Hilton property and certainly I have seen much better standards at the Grand Hyatt (though its more expensive) and the Conrad Tokyo (excellent, simply excellent). However, the WORST aspect is really the Executive Lounge, which is way way too small to cater to some 7 whole floors of executive rooms! Poor planning must have been the root cause of this anomaly. I am sure there must be some tried and tested formula for how large the executive lounge should be per 10 rooms and so on, but clearly, this was NOT the case here. The lounge was so congested and crowded and stuffy during the peak periods (breakfast and evening cocktails), it was quite a sad sight. The staff at the executive lounge kept struggling with the demands of the guests, and the food etc was slow to be replenished. I saw hotel guests being turned away during breakfast and evening cocktails! I was quietly observing the mayhem (the concierge staff tried to be as polite as they could but really, the situation is unforgivable) including one American gentleman saying loudly that he has stayed in many Hiltons in his lifetime and he found this to be a disgrace to the name of the hotel chain. My verdict is: DO NOT pay the extra and stay at the executive floors unless you do not really intend to use the lounge. However, with the money you will pay, I think it far more value-add and sensible to stay at some of the other better 4 to 5 star hotels in Tokyo (of which there are many).",Singapore,99,1.0

I only tried couple of restaurants in the hotel and found them decently priced comparing with same in other nearby hotels. Shinju-ku is a nice area to stay for westerners and I would highly recommend that Hilton should be a top choice for your next stay at Tokyo.",IL,14,5.0

Room itself offers stylish lounge sofa, little desk, large king bed with a wonderful mattress, absolutely clean, quiet and of course well equipped with goodies like wireless internet, huge flat screen, bathrobes, pajamas... Incomprehensible in this great and spacious room with 44 square meters there was only a very small bathroom, however fitted with a little window to the room and equipped with all needs, too. House keeping including additional night service was just perfect. Hotel: Of course the most unimportant feature of hotels, the exterior view is uncomely compared with other Shinjuku buildings. Inside there is a small lobby-area with only a very few chairs. Same problem in the Executive Lounge: Both facilities are clearly to small dimensioned for this huge hotel. Nevertheless the Lounge offers great drinks at the evening, but a really poor breakfast for Executive Level in a five Star rated Hotel. Also not convincing was the pool with its ambiance from the eighties. Don’t misunderstand me: Except for pool and Executive-breakfast the Tokyo Hilton with its always very friendly and obliging staff was one of the best hotels I’ve visited so far. Location: in walking distance to Shinjuku station (west side), the Hilton is located in one of Tokyo’s most busiest areas. They offer a free shuttle to the station, but you’ll walk easily there in the same time. From Shinjuku station you can take direct trains to Narita-Airport (Narita-Express), the cheaper Airport-limousine-bus for 3000 Yen stops in front of the hotel. Subway-access is perfect: Nishi-shinjuku station (M 07) has direct access to the hotel, this line (‘red’ Marunouchi-line) goes directly and fast to Ginza and Tokyo main station. Much more efficient than hotel-shuttle and transfer in the huge Shinjuku main station. Direct neighborhood of the hotel offers some shops and restaurants, so in the I-Land tower. Next supermarket is located in the basement of the Hyatt regency vis-à-vis the Hilton. However, real life starts on east side behind Shinjuku station first.","Mannheim, Germany",143,5.0

Very good to start, since I am HHonors Gold member they offered me additional amenities. So far so good.The rooms are on the smallish side since the hotel has been build in the eighties and at that time rooms were rather build on the small side. In particular the closet space is limited, in particular if you are there for a longer stay. Combine this that my wife joined me for about a week, our closet space then was really limited. Bathroom is also very small, but adequate with a shower which had a very good pressure. Oh if you member of HHonors and if you book a single room, they let a second person stay for free in your room.Housekeeping service always was prompt and good. The Executive Lounge is ok, the food offering was adequate and the drinks during the cocktail hours plenty, but they offer the whole day free soft drinks, coffee etc. One of the big pluses of the Executive room is that they also offer free wireless internet in your room and not only the executive lounge - extremely convenient.Nevertheless one negative of the lounge is, that since the Hilton has 6 Executive Floors, the lounge in particular for the cocktail hour is not only too full, but plainly overcrowded sometimes.Restaurants at the hotel are of good quality, but pricey. Their teppanayaki restaurant (Teppan Grill) is highly recommended, the food and service is wonderful - but you will pay a lot. Lets say a good dinner (teppanayki menu + wine) will run 500 USD for two persons.The hotel also offers a free shuttle to Shinjuku Station every 20 minutes from 7am - 10 PM, which is extremely convenient.Overall a very good business hotel with some minor weaknesses, would not hesitate to stay again there.","Johannesburg, South Africa",101,4.0

I was also told they actually only offer in suites ~~ the bathrobe in fact are not quality at all, they are rough after years of combating with the washing machine.The arrival ~ bell staff was short. The bell staff dropped my bags in the check in area unattended then left. The reception check in staff was cold though polite. I asked if there s a possiblity of an upgrade for HiltonHonor VIP. I was told they only upgrade regular customers ~~ my understanding was regulars apply only to Tokyo Hilton, Hilton Honor members are not regular ) Restaurant ~ I visted their 2star Michelin French restaurant ~Twenty One. It was rather disappointed. The service definitely is under par comparing to other one-star Michelin. Many non-Michelin restaurants can produce same quality of dishes.I was rather disapointed on my first return to the Hilton after a 8-year lapse. A concierge staff changed my impression. I realized i was over-charged by a restaurant in Shinjuku on my last night. Hilton helped me to reserve the table. I didnt' realize it until the next day wondering why the dinner bill was so pricey. I asked for translation of the bill, Ms. Morita, a polite concierge staff speaks perfect English, explained to me the bill was for a table of 9 guests, while she knew I only booked a table for 4. She took down all the dishes I had order. After my meeting, she sorted everything out for me, the restaurant even sent back the new receipt and the over-charged amount.

However, we skipped eating restaurants on the second floor as they were a bit pricey.If Tokyo is the only city you're visiting I'd probably recommend a different hotel as Shinjuku is a business district and pretty quiet at night unless you hang out at the station (the shuttle service ends around 9:30PM). If Tokyo is one of many cities on your agenda, I thought this was a great choice. Only downside is the JR to Kyoto/Osaka leaves from Tokyo station, so you have to change stations if you venture west.

I have been coming to Tokyo regularly on business during this time and I thought it might be useful to write a review based aimed at this type of traveller rather than a tourist.I have always stayed on an executive floor and made use of the lounge facilities. As a diamond member of the Hilton Honors program, I was surprised at first to find that room upgrades do not tend to feature in the Hilton asian region. However, the room gifts are very generous and you can expect to find a bottle of wine (very expensive here), some chocolates and fresh fruit upon arrival.The service is, of course, excellent. It starts as you arrive at the main doors where the Doorman (or more likely woman) greets you. If you are staying on the executive floor, you are taken straight to the dedicated check-in on 34. The staff there have remained constant over the past eight years and are excellent at their jobs. A swift check-in will take you to your room. The doubles are small by western standards and if you can afford it, a junior executive suite does give more reasonable space, especially if you are going to be resident for a few days.Following a major upgrade last year, the rooms are very well decorated in a ""fusion"" style with both good work and relaxation areas as well as the comfortable bed. All executive rooms have flatscreen tv's and DVD players.The views from this level are magnificent and if you are at the ""back"" of the hotel you can often see Fuji in the distance - but look early in the morning because the mountain tends to cloud up later in the day.Wireless broadband is available at no cost if you are a diamond member and there is a business centre on the lobby floor just past the Abiste concession.Room service is comprehensive and served perfectly but be prepared to pay very high prices. A three course set meal with a glass of wine will cost about £80 and most westerners will still be hungry and possibly thirsty afterwards.There are eight restaurants in the hotel ranging from classical Japanese and Chinese through to Michelin French and a brazzerie.A note for first time Brits...the Chinese food is nothing like our Chinese food so be prepared to be adventurous!Apart from the Brazzerie, Chequers, the cost is in line with Tokyo restaurants. If you are entertaining, be prepared for £100 to £130 per head.For relaxing in the evening, executive floor members have access to the lounge where drinks are served free.from about 6pm for an hour. Given the incredibly high price of wine, this is a very good perk although you have already paid for it in your higher room tarrif. St Georges bar in the lobby has free access for executive club members and normally has some form of entertainment from either Austrailian or British groups. Those of you who have seen Lost in Translation with Scarlett Johannsen and Bill Murray will know the type. Breakfast is served in the executive lounge and is again very good.As an executive floor member, one also has free access to the health club and swimming pool. A couple of cultural tips here...in the pool it is normal to wear a (supplied) cap. If you decide to take a bath, then read up on the procedure first. Google ""Japanese Bath Procedeure"" for some examples.ln the basement, one can find a newsagent selling western books and little knick-knack souvenirs. Also a few restaraunts cheaper than the main hotel including a very good Indian. There is a womens hairstylist and an excellent Gentlemen's barber in the finest tradition with many other services such as back massage, wet shave and manicure. After a twelve hour flight from the UK and the journey from Narita, this is always my first port of call to start getting over the inevitable west/east jet lag. If gently prompted, the proprietor will happily show you photos of him and the current and former Prime Ministers of Japan, both of whom are customers.Overall, The Hilton Shinjuki is expensive but gives value for money.

It's clean, it's safe, it's convenient. There's a free shuttle bus that runs to the train station in Shinjuku and it's located close to the subway station (Marunoichi Line). The friendly staff is courteous and the facility inside the hotel is great. There's a pool, tennis court, workout room, shops and restaurant on the lower floors of the hotel and on the second floor, and a business room with internet access. The only other places in Shinjuku I would consider other than this hotel is the Keio Plaza Hotel and the Hyatt, which I have stayed in and both are excellent hotels. However, I suppose I'm nitpicking but there are a couple things I do not like about this hotel:1. The beds were uncomfortable for my liking. It's quite stiff and small. 2. We had the standard room. My wife and I stayed in the room with our son and after they added the extra bed in our room, it was quite cramped in our room.3. The television in our room had approximately 15 channels of which most were in Japanese. The only English channels were CNN, BBC, Discovery Channel and Cartoon Network. The Pay Per View Channels were playing really old movies and expensive. I would have preffered having at least one business channel like Fox Business News or CNBC and Fox News over CNN or BBC.4. Every service imaginable cost money at this hotel. Internet access in the business room was $4 per 15 minutes. Gym, pool, and tennis court all were expensive. Be prepared to be nickel and dimed to death.5. They gave us a discount for breakfast. The standard price was 3500 yen per person but it's 3100 yen with the discount. In my previous stay at this hotel, I've had this breakfast and it was marginal. This price is outrageous considering that you can have a full blown breakfast next door at the Royal Host restaurant for about 1000 yen with a stack of pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, and coffee. Everything in the hotel is outrageously expensive. During our 5 day stay there, we never ate or used any of their facilities because their charges were outrageous..6. Since this is our 3rd stay at this hotel, we noticed that the interior of the hotel is starting to look dated. I remember when I first stayed at this hotel, it was alot nicer. Since we hardly stayed in the hotel during the day, it didn't really matter much but I'm starting to notice the difference between this hotel and the Hyatt Shinjuku more and more.All my criticisms are minor so overall, I recommend this hotel. In addition for all travelors staying at this hotel, I recommend the following:1. There's a 7-11 near the hotel so buy your munchies there since they have a great selection.2. There's tons of great restaurant around the hotel so eat out. If you miss McDonalds, it's a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Most of the restaurants around the hotel is open until about 10PM. McDonald is open 24/7.3. Take the subway if you can't read Japanese since most of station names are written in English and it's much faster and cheaper than taxi. I recommend you download the subway map from http://www.tokyometro.jp/global/en/index.html.4. If you need internet access, go to the internet cafes in Shinjuku since it's alot cheaper and the coffee and food there are awesome.5. Tipping is not required if you eat at restaurant around the hotel so you save 15% on all foods if you eat outside the hotel. Also, if you do eat at the restaurant in the hotel, they'll usually add the tip to your bill automatically so read your bill carefully.We picked this hotel because we had a great deal thru our travel agency which included 5 days stay at the Hilton Shinjuku, roundtrip limousine bus service from Narita airport to the hotel, and a round trip ticket on Singapore Airlines from LA to Tokyo for approximately $1300US per person. In my opinion, I don't think there'a a better deal out there. We totally enjoyed our trip to Tokyo and it was worth every penny!.","Simi Valley, California",17,4.0

Anything else?Positives - the brilliant Japanese bath house down by the gym; the nothing is too much attitude from the staff (even looking after a valuable painting for me when I was called off to Singapore); the quality of the dining and the service.Negatives - if you are in an older room it can be a bit seventies; Shinjuku is an ok location but nothing great (business on one side where the hotel is; sordid on the other) - but for the real Tokyo try the Grand Hyatt in Roppongi Hills; or the Cerrullean Towers in Shibuya.

Rate was decent for a Hilton and used Tripadvisor to advise me when a cheaper rate showed up so that I could rebook the stay.Typical Hilton; everything as expected. Extremely polite service (to be expected), very clean hotel; excellent beds and pillows which is typical of most Hiltons I have stayed in. Probably could use some updating since the hotel, in some parts, looked tired. The price included the buffet breakfast which is excellent - a variety of hot and cold/continental foods, Japanese breakfast items, fresh fruits, espresso bar, juices, etc. Truly a delight.The hotel was about a 10 minute walk to the Shinjuku subway station (busiest in Tokyo) or one could take a Hilton shuttle bus to the station (free) - trips are very very frequent so you never have to wait long and run till about 10pm every day. The hotel also has direct access to the Toei line which we used to get to Tsukiji Market at 5am. Do not miss the market visit. If you like sushi/sashimi, then you now will love it. Overall then, the location was good; outside of the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku station and amongst office towers, yet close enough to walk to the main station. Also linked via underground route which can get confusing. Pretty much all the shopping you need to do is around the Shinjuku station although easy enough to take a subway ride to Ginza, Akihabara, Harajuku, Roppongi, etc to see the local sights. Just don't get on the subway at rush hour - they are packed.Did not use the facilities (gym etc). In-room internet is extra but the free internet service was adequate.

And I really liked the room - terrific view and I had braced myself for the tiny rooms I had heard about in Tokyo but I was impressed, room was a very decent size and very well appointed. It had a Japanese flair, particularly the window dressing, and was immaculate. My understanding was that the hotel was full the weekend I was there (Nov 16-18 2007) but you'd never know it...and here's where the hotel exceeded expectations - the service. During check-in there was an issue with my VIP card, which was brand new and not a big deal because the upgrade to Executive Level would have been a smoking room with two beds and I wanted a non-smoking King so I didn't care about the upgrade really. But the woman at the desk made sure everything was worked out with my card so that I could at least get coupons for a free breakfast. She actually spent time on the phone (her doing) making sure that my old Hilton member account was incorporated into the VIP to ensure that the VIP was the active account to allow me to get full benefits. And the beauty was that there were no lines behind me because they kept so much staff behind the front desk - I never saw anyone waiting during my stay. Concierge was superb - here again, plenty of staff behind the desk - no waits despite the hotel bustle - and they were so willing to help and very knowledgeable. The doormen and women also made you feel so welcome, very friendly. I felt at home coming back after being out all day.The breakfast buffet had a nice variety and was pretty good (and free for me thanks to the front desk help). I ordered room service twice and found the entrees to be quite good. I will say that in general I think Tokyo is very welcoming, I had no rude experiences there - and the Hilton isn't cheap...but for me this hotel was worth the money - a charming (even for it's large size), reliable, well appointed hotel (the lobby Christmas tree was very well done) in a good location - very nice rooms and excellent, excellent service.

Anyways, I wanted to book at the Conrad where I had a great stay on a prior trip, but they had already fulfilled their allotment for HHonors bookings. We came in by train from the airport and had trouble finding where the shuttle picked up. Luckily, we had rented a cell phone from the airport and were able to call them. It ended up being by the Keio Department store. It is confusing because it shares its bus stop with the city bus and there is only a little sign with the Hilton logo that marks it. Our room was not ready at 1PM (check in time is not till 3 or 4) however we were able to get some lunch across the street at Denny’s while we waited. The room was ready by 2 and I got a free upgrade to the executive floor for being a gold member. The room was very clean and fresh. The views were also good. While the room was free, the roll away for the third person cost us a whopping 7000 yen a night (approx. $65). I know this included the occupancy charge for the third person, but still. The internet was also free on the executive floors. The executive lounge was very nice (I would say even better than Conrad’s). It was very large and always had a full stock of soda’s water, and beer that guests could just help themselves to. The evening reception was nice and had a full comp bar and snacks. The free breakfast had both western and Japanese dishes. The only problem we had during our stay was that when we booked a helicopter tour at the concierge desk they gave us the instructions to tell leave one hour ahead of time to get their early (and tell then that we were leaving so they could confirm it). After the one hour mark we were only just over half way their. When we called to cancel they said it was 100% cancellation fee. This ruined the entire afternoon because this was supposed to be the highlight of our trip. To compensate the hotel ended up being able to get them to waive the cancellation fee. The indoor pool was a little bit of a disappointment. Considering how much they charge ($25/person/day) it was quite bleak. Being gold I got free admission. They made you wear these dumb swimming caps and the place on a whole looks dilapidated and of need of remodel. They had separate male and female saunas and baths and this of course meant it was ‘traditional Japanese’. I had to say I was a little bit hesitant at first to strip all the way down and ’take a bath’ with other people, but when I finally did it I could finally see why they do it. It is very relaxing and worth a try (at least once). On a side note I would highly recommend going to karaoke. Basically, you rent a small private room for a couple of hours, buy a couple of drinks, get some bar food, and you sing your heart out with your friends and family. They have just about every English song ever made and the controls for the song selection are in English too. I am no singer, but we ended doing this almost every night. It only cost like $25 for a few hours. Just ask the concierge for the details. All in all I would only recommend this place only if you were not able to get into Conrad (200% better). If you do stay here, secure a room on the executive floor. It’s well worth it.","Arroyo Grande, CA",82,4.0

Breakfast is geared to the all you can eat buffett (Western or Japanese style). We only wanted a la carte and paid through the nose for cold toast, regular fried eggs, and blah french toast.

The Japanese are an amazing people and have 'customer service' down to a fine art! Their culture is fascinating and well worth experiencing.They are also very modest, so if you ask if they speak English they will always indicate 'a little', but most of them speak and understand more than a little :)The room we had was a good size, the service was excellent and we are now looking into having one of those Japanese toilets installed in our own home :)The hotel staff are excellent and nothing is too much bother. I had a problem with my foot and the hotel reception arranged an appointment for me with an orthapaedic doctor close to the hotel. They also sent a fluent English-speaking staff member along with me to translate. The doctor was very good and took his time to make sure he understood exactly what my problem was - and the result being I was able to keep walking around, and without pain - and let's face it, if you cannot walk in Tokyo you're in trouble!Yes, the hotel restaurants are very expensive, but department stores like Keio and Odayku at Shinjuku Station have 2 floors of Japanese food available for purchase at a reasonable price (and a mind boggling variety at that). Mind you, it is worth experiencing room service at least once.The shuttle bus between the hotel and Shinjuku Station is brilliant and made lugging all that shopping back to the hotel so much easier :) What's that?? People don't only go to Tokyo to shop??? <evil grin> Yes, I know - so many things to do and places to see - you will never manage in one trip - so pick a few good ones, and know there will always be more when you go back the next time.

The service (bell man, front desk, maid service) was on par with most 4 star international chains, meaning pleasent, friendly, but not over the top like a 5 star hotels. Our room was decent sized with a queen, desk, sitting chairs, LCD TV, small table and a single shower/tub combo. The rooms vary in size, depending on the price. In room internet is available, but at a charge. We didn't spend much time at the hotel or using it's ammenities as most of our day trips took us out of the area (via shinkansen/bullet train). One convenient perk isthe shuttle that runs to/from the Shinjuku station. This'll save you a 660 Yen cab fair, each way. There's also a metro stop underneath the hotel, but it's quite a walk within the tunnels before one reaches the action stop. The hotel shuttle was much more accessible.The hotel is situated on the west side of the train station where most of the business hotels and government building are located. However, the east side of the station is an entirely different beast;department stores, cafes, boutiques, electronic stores, little markets, 100 Yen stores, etc. DefinItely spend some time exploring the east side. With regards to another reviewer's comment on attitudetowards females: I really didn't notice any difference. However, I did notice that some of the staff was a bit friendly to the western guests (vs Asians). Another observation was that western guests tended to tip the bellman in spite of the non tipping practice in Asia. Ymmv.",Southern California,7,4.0

So in an expensive city like Tokyo if you don’t pay a lot of money you won’t get top notch luxury most times. I think that pretty clear. There’s typically two ways to improve your chances of getting a better room in hotels, pay more or join loyalty programs. In my case my experience at the Hilton was pleasant. I stayed there for close to a month. I was fortunate because I could pay a reasonable price but since I am a Diamond member I was upgrades to a junior suite. So the lesson here is usually a hotel will treat you better if you are loyal otherwise pay a lot of money to gain access to the amenities. That’s just the fact of life in big cities across the world especially since now the hotel industry is booming again due to business travelers traveling more again. It’s just supply and demand, so prices are high.The other nice things I liked about this hotel is it is centrally located and in walking distance of the Shinjuku Station. And for me this was important because that was my mode of transportation to get to work and it is the fastest way to get around because there’s a lot of traffic. There’s a good variety of restaurants to choose from but I always suggest to people to venture out into town. This is also a way to get better prices on food. The views of the city and Mt. Fuji is a plus if you are on a higher floor.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",88,4.0

I just returned from 5 nights at the Tokyo Hilton. I'm a widowed mother traveling with my 2 teenaged sons, and felt no anti-feminine discrimination whatsoever. Yes, the beds were singles, but I knew this going in and that is what is offered to both male and female travelers on the website. Smaller rooms are common in Japan. I travel internationally multiple times a year, and found the Hilton to be a wonderful hotel. Yes, it's getting older, but it's been beautifully kept up. The single beds struck me as over-sized for singles, and I found the firm mattress and soft duvet to be delightfully comfortable. In any event, the beds were quite adequate for my 5'7"" frame as well as my 6'+ son and his younger brother. The addition of a 3rd single, did take away some of the room space we would have had, but it was no problem. I loved that the windows are covered with shoji screens instead of curtains. It gave the room a lovely, Japanese feel. The bathroom is not overly large, but is well-appointed and quite adequate. (The high-tech toilet-bidet, so popular in Japan, adds an amusing bit of cultural diversity, too. :)) Toothbrushes and other amenities are replaced each day. Two types of green tea, instead of coffee, and a water boiler are provided in the room. Robes and slippers were provided as well. Our hotel room was almost eerily quiet. I almost wished the whisper-fan would make more white noise! We were in a regular, non-executive, room on the 12th floor. I did think the charge for pool and gym was ridiculously high, but room service, to my surprise, was cheaper than in most US hotels. A la carte muffins were under $5 for an assortment of 3; waffles, french toast or pancakes a la carte were under $7. All prices already included service and tax--unheard of in the US! There's no tipping in Japan, so the price quoted was the price paid at checkout. (The exchange rate was around 117 yen to the dollar when we were there, 3/18-24/2007.) Also, an in-room massage was available (to women only, if I understood the card correctly) for about $50; quite a deal. Service was speedy and friendly. A requested adapter and transformer showed up immediately. When we had trouble with our television, two persons arrived within minutes to set it right. The front desk offered quick translation and travel advice with a smile. The hotel is in an ideal location for travel with subway stops on two lines within a block, and an easy walk to huge Shinjuku station, if you want to skip the one-stop ride. There is a free hotel shuttle as well, but we used the subway as it was so easy and convenient. The lobby is elegantly beautiful and there's a shopping arcade downstairs with underground connection to the subway as well. When my younger son decided to help me out by charging my iPod on the floor behind his bed, then leaving it, housekeeping answered my call from the airport to assure me they'd found it. An email when I returned informed me the iPod and charger had been mailed and that there would be no charge, despite my offer to pay. All in all, I loved the Hilton and would happily stay there again.","Dallas, Texas",161,5.0

This is a nice hotel if you get a room on the Executive Floor. If you're not a Gold Member, and you're here for business longer than two nights, then you'll start to miss the typical business amenities.I stayed here for a week, and had a single bed. I complained because quite frankly, I couldn't sleep in it without feeling like I was going to fall out of bed. I'd never been offered a single bed for business travel in my entire career, so I never expected to see one on my first trip to Tokyo.I also think that in general, if you are female, and in my case, I am also Asian, I am occasionally subjected to second-class service. I think this is a common complaint by most female executive travelers. But that's a whole other traveling issue. Long story short, I am spoiled by American hotels and big comfy beds. Since I travel mostly for work, the bed is the most important part of the room. I don't fault this hotel entirely, but the truth is, I was judged as someone who could tolerate inferior accommodations as compared to my six-foot non-Asian colleague who would have been given the double bed without hesitation.If you don't fit my profile, you'll probably do fine at this hotel. If you are a Hilton Honors Gold member then you will score high with all the proper business amenities. I am terribly disappointed because I have no safe in my room to lock up my electronic gadgets and computer when I'm out at customer meetings. I am disappointed about my bed of course. I am disappointed that there is no complimentary coffee in the room (there is coffee you can buy through mini bar for about $6 US, my company doesn't reimburse mini-bar charges either.) I am also disappointed that access to the gym will cost me $20 US dollars per use. My company doesn't reimburse for gym fees, so I'd have to shell out $140 of my own money (weeks stay) in order to keep myself in shape for these long haul flights into Asia. The food is outrageously expensive. I couldn't get a bowl of fruit for less than $10 us dollars, and it was canned fruit! There isn't anything to like about this hotel, and it rates very low compared to US Hilton Hotels for business travel. I have to give it a low score just so other business travelers will be cautious in case they can't get an upgrade to the Executive Floor. The non-Executive floors have very tiny bathrooms, meant for small-framed people. Frankly, this hotel should just charge more money and give me what I need rather than nickeling and diming us to death.What's good about the hotel?

The lounge was closed and a makeshift one was provided in one of the rooms on the same floor. Drinks/snacks were limited though.I notice that the Hilton Group has managed to minimise the influence of local culture on its service style. In this hotel, everyone was businesslike - polite, efficient but somewhat distant. It was not a problem for me as I was on a business trip during this stay. Efficiency ranks high under such circumstances.I flew into Tokyo from the US on this trip and was running out of clean suits to wear. I decided to use the 4-hour dry cleaning service made available to those on the Executive Floor at no extra charge. The pair of pants came back to me just 15 mins before I had to leave for my business appt. I was in a hurry and didn't manage to check on the condition of my pants prior to leaving the hotel.You could imagine how embarrassed I was when a Japanese lady on my client's team pointed out that the side pocket of my black pants had white bits stuck on it and the pocket also appeared torn. I thanked her profusely for it must have taken her a lot of courage to point this out to a relative stranger; by Japanese standards, this was bold but only for my good.I returned to the hotel and the housekeeping people came in the evening for the pants, saying that they would do everything to fix it.The next day was a saturday and I was out for the most part,when I returned at night, I ddn't see the pants in my room. I went down to talk to the manager at the front desk. He called the housekeeping manager down to see me. He came with the pants but both men didn't apologize; the front desk manager said to me with a straight face - it is fixed now.When I came back to Singapore and wore the pants again, it was torn at the same place. I travel too much and can't afford the time to take this up with the Hilton mgt, may be I should?Apart from this incident, the hotel is actually fine, it is in a convenient location.

The frequent free shuttles to Shinjuku station were a nice bonus. But having no Valet Parking and charging for parking seemed a little cheap.We ate at Twenty one (French). The food / wine was on par with similar meals in Tokyo. But the service was very spotty for a $600 meal for two.We also got free breakfast at Checkers. The food was actually very good, with better service than at Twenty One.It would have been better to spend an extra $100 a night to stay at the Park Hyatt or Grand Hyatt.","Yokosuka, Japan",101,3.0

The Shinjuku Hilton was a nice choice. If you're lazy you can take their shuttle to Shinjuki station but the walk is less than a mile and usually quite nice unless it's one of those super hot tokyo days.My corporate rate was $225 or something like that for an exec level room. I'd not waste my money on anything other than exec level.. not if you want to eat or use the gym. The gym had real weights which is nice and there's a decent park caddy cornered to the hilton (across from the Dennys) that you can run around without encountering too much traffic.The pool, like most things in Japan, is a freak show. They try to get you to wear swimming caps. Which is a little weird since they don't even cover all of your head.The exec breakfast is good but does get old somewhere around week 2. So pace yourself, be brave, and order some freaky [--] in the little shops on the way to the metro.There's not much to do in Shinjuku at night except for kabukicho, which is a red light district but does have some nice bars. Nogerian guys will try to get you to come into their ""clubs.""The only downside is that at night you need to be in Roppongi (Geranimo!) or Shibuya and that's like a $25 cab ride either way. Riding the subway is fine for work but not so good for partying.. if you're going to hit the clubs a lot stay at the ANA.. Even if you just get a weekend room at the ANA and leave most of your stuff at the hilton.Take money to Tokyo. I had several >$200 bar tabs, and this is not abnormal as drinks run 1,000-1,500 yen (approx $9-14).","Denver, CO",17,4.0

The first night, they put us in a junior suite because they ran out of executive rooms. The room was big and comfortable but we did not get breakfast, evening drinks nor hors d'oeuvres because we did not stay on the excutive floors. That was alright because we spent our morning at the most amazing fish market in the whole world. The subsequent days, they put us in an executive room. The room was big for Japanese standard but no details were over-looked. The furnitures were a bit dated though. They stock the room with 2 sets of fine british toileteries. We got 2 pajamas and 2 very comfy terry robes which were laid out on our bed everynight when they came and turned the bed down. The slippers were also brought out and put on cloth mats wishing us good night. It wouldn't be Japan without an origami crane on our bed with forecast for the day after. Breakfast buffet was very good at the Hilton Tokyo. They served both Japanese and American breakfast with top quality foods. I enjoyed the Japanese breakfast more because I don't get to eat like that in the States. Happy hours was fantastic at the Hilton Tokyo also. They served champagne, cocktails, and very tasty mini sandwiches or hamburgers, cheeses, cookies, and chocolates. We often didn't have to go eat dinner afterward. The staffs were extremely courteous and helpful. The most polite staffs outside of the Peninsula in Bangkok. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station. The courtesy bus runs frequently between the hotel and the train station. The Nishi Shinjuku subway station is right behind the hotel if you want to get on the red line. The gym, japanese bath, and the pool are free if you stay on the executive floors. So when you check in, insist on staying on the executive floor if you have Gold or more VIP status. You won't be disappointed.","San Diego, CA",44,5.0

However, we had been spoiled by our experience at the Hilton Tokyo Bay earlier in the week, and we didn't feel that this hotel lived up to the same standards, although this hotel was swankier. This was mostly due to the fact that this Hilton treated us differently than the HTB.We were originally supposed to be upgraded to a room that was on a business floor, but after we returning at the designated time, it was still occupied, and we were given a junior suite on the 23rd floor. However, we were not given access to the executive lounge or given passes for the pool and gym. We also didn't receive free breakfast passes, but were instead given a discount. We didn't bother using it since it still would have been expensive. It was annoying that Hilton didn't have standardized treatment for HHonors members.The room itself was nice and clean. It was updated, but not as much as the room at the HTB. We had a view of the business area facing the front of the hotel towards Shinjuku. The amenities were almost the same as at the HTB (nice), but I once again wished that the room had an iron and ironing board, as well as a safe, as standard amenities. We requested the iron and ironing board on a daily basis.The Shinjuku station was an approx. 15-minute walk away, and the shuttle bus made frequent stops, although we wished that it ran past 9:30pm. The TMG building with the free observation area on the 45th floor was two blocks down. However, there weren't a lot of restaurants opened past 8pm because it was located in a business district, so it was difficult trying to get something to eat after returning to the hotel. Denny's, which, to our surprise, didn't serve American food; Starbucks; McDonald's, and Royal Host are some places to grab a bite.We continued to experience a high level of service, as we did when we arrived earlier in the week at the Hilton Tokyo Bay. The staff was very accommodating. There was a FedEx/Kinko's in the lobby, which had three computers to use for internet access, so that was convenient. The Hiltopia area on the basement floor had various restaurants and high-end shops. We enjoyed our lunch at the tempura restaurant.Overall, this was a nice place to stay, and I would recommend it. It was just disappointing coming from our earlier experience where we had had more perks, but I doubt this would affect most people.","Baltimore, MD",87,4.0

Had this been disclosed on the website when I made the reservation, I might've tried to find less expensive accommodations though the hotel was close to my business needs. But at over $250 a night x 7 nights (granted, it IS Tokyo) I expect using the fitness center ought to be embedded in the price. Most business people have the luxury of expense accounts but on my tight start-up budget, I blame Hilton Hotels for making this absurd policy.

I am a Diamond member and got to use the executive lounge on the 37th floor, which provided a free breakfast and free drinks in the evening. I shutter to think what I would have paid for these items had they not been comp. The entire staff of the hotel is wonderful and aim to please. You will not wait for anything and they do not expect a tip. If you have never been to Japan, you are in for a real treat as far as attitude and service. NOTHING like what you find in the states. My only complaints were the temperature of the room (they gave me a free fan which cooled it down fast) and the size, but hey, this is Japan and space is at a premium. I had a twin room with two beds. I'm a large guy and fit in the bath tub with no problems, but wasn't able to wear the free bath robe or japanese style sleeping robe that is put on your bed each evening. Make sure to utilize the free shuttle to Shinjuku, but it is less than 10min and an easy walk if you don't. Also, the JTB Sunrise tours can be booked through the hotel and they come pick you up in the lobby at 755am. I highly recommend the Fuji/Hakonne day trip with Sunrise (lunch included and return on the bullet train) which goes for about $150 or the Nikko trip for $130. Tokyo is a great place to visit and can be done quite reasonably money wise if you don't break the bank on 5 star meals. Make sure you wake up early your first night (you'll be up at 3am with jet lag anyways) and get down to the Fish market. The subway opens at about 430 or 5, so be on the first train. Overall, high marks for the Hilton Tokyo for service and no complaints on any ammenity. Another tip..use the airport limosine bus to/from Narita for 3000 yen ($30US). Drops you right at the front door with no hassels of any kind. You buy your ticket at Narita just as you come out of customs and the hotel can book your return. About a 2 hour ride with traffic, but again, don't have to muck about with your luggage or think at all after a long flight.","Orlando, Florida",234,5.0

Can check email at token charge. Can even print photos from your Digital cameraCONS- No complimentary crib/bed for small children and the hotel charge a big fee for an extra bed, which is also hard to fit into a cramped normal room. The staff recognized that and suggested me to upgrade to a Japanese style room, the cost is bit more than the extra bed but the room is much larger. Everyone sleeps on futons, which is great experience for kids and very comfortable.- The entire hotel is actually quite old. Built in 1960's, it impresses you as one from that era. There are not much hi tech facilities in the rooms. However, everything is imaculately clean and is very well maintained (so this is not actually a major con)- The distance from Shinjuku station on foot is considerable. If you miss the shuttle bus, it is a fair way to walk.- The air con system is not working well, quite dated design.- Not much recreational facilities and the health club is quite small and dated.- The restaurants are VERY EXPENSIVE!
