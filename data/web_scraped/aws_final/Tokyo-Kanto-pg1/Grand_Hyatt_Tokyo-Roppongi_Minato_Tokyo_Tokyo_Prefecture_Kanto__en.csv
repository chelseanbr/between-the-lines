This hotel did an outstanding job with service. I can't recommend the concierge services enough: from knowing the neighborhoods in Tokyo, making reservations in a timely manner, speaking conversational English, and giving out clear and concise directions. The hotel is located right in the middle of Roppongi which is an expat neighborhood in the heart of Tokyo. The hotel connects to the mall and is within short walking distance to the Tokyo metro subway gray line and some great local restaurants. The location was definitely convenient to getting around to different areas in Tokyo. The common areas of the hotel are very well maintained and eye catching. I especially liked the gym/spa/pool area. While the pool isn't as flashy as some of the other hotels in Tokyo, it is still quite nice. The spa was also free to use and had amazing massage chairs in the rest area. I was slightly disappointed in the room but I can't blame the hotel for this. The hotel was completely full for the enthronement ceremony and the Rugby World Cup so they placed me on a low floor. There was no view whatsoever, but surprisingly the room was still pretty quiet even with the close proximity to the street. The room itself felt a little too 90s decor and probably could use a refresh. However, it was very clean, spacious, and well laid out. The breakfast at the hotel seemed a little hit or miss to me. I had decided to try the breakfast after reading the glowing reviews and I felt somewhat let down. I think for the price point the buffet breakfast should have had more variety offerings. The quality was top notch, but it just seemed like the spread was sparse for the price (I believe it was around $55 USD per head). I would probably eat outside of the hotel unless you are Diamond. One tip if you are coming from Narita or Haneda: the limo bus drops you off directly at the hotel. I thought this was super convenient instead of taking the NEX and then transferring to a taxi or subway. I would definitely consider staying at this property again.","San Francisco, California",136,5.0

The rooms were clean and room service was always prompt and very thorough. Even though we didn’t use it, the hotel also provided a mobile phone in each room which was a nice touch.

There are plenty of electrical sockets, including some at desk level that accept most plugs, including UK three pin plugs. There is a large swimming pool and good gym on the fifth floor, and if you pay for a club room then you can access the club lounge on the tenth floor, which serves breakfast and evening snacks and cocktails, and soft drinks all day long. Even the club lounge champagne is Louis Roederer, a top quality non vintage champagne, rather than some generic fizz. The concierge team is the best in the city, with no less than fourteen concierges at your disposal. Staff are uniformly excellent, and even the lifts (elevators if you prefer) are slick.

Lady who check us in had nice attitude and manner, just the type of bed and room messed up which may not be her fault, she tried hard hitting on the system and walking in and out to the back office trying to help and too nervous to answer some of my questions, efficiency is the slowest for checking in and I even had to filled in my address and details which they have the record actually.I feedback to Reo the duty manager and he is so nice and solved out all problems straight away, thanks him for that and he is super friendly and polite, appreciated his concerns too.Just back to hotel at 9:30pm and tried to reserve a taxi to airport 4 days later, only one lady staff at front desk and she was on the phone. A boy staff asked us to wait politely at the concierge so we did, the lady finished her phone call and looked at us but ignored us (I’ve told the manager to check the CCTV for proof) so I asked her for help, she replied Concierge is closed and we have to walk outside to a counter for enquiry, IMPOLITELY !!I then asked why have the hotel guest to walk outside instead of sending a colleague in ? Come on ? Services ?! Grand Hyatt ? Or just a 3 star hotel standard ?!Then she said she can ask a staff to come in but not very polite also, then j asked for the duty manager to official complain her(don’t want to disclose her name here).My complain is the Front Office Manager did not train their staff well so 2 incidents happened and one worse than worse, despite I’m a Globalist Member since no greeting not welcome as a Globalist and zero World of Hyatt Globalist benefits except access to Club lounge and no amenities received at all but even I’m just a hotel guest I shouldn’t be treated this way.The unprofessional & rudeness of the staff is unacceptable, not as a 5 star hotel, not to a member of World of Hyatt no matter I’m a Globalist or not, not to a hotel guest who request services politely.Club floor staff were the best, you can see all the smiles and they are so friendly and super helpful, breakfast not variety enough and no egg station which most of the club lounges have in Tokyo but food and beverage cocktail is better than others.

For those of you who ponder what to do over the lack of free wifi in Tokyo (and those that hate paying $10/day for international data access), this phone was super helpful for navigating around the city, finding restaurants and sights, and for keeping in touch with other members of our family. It erases all information at the end of your stay (or whenever you schedule for the phone to be erased and reset back to standard settings). You can download WhatsApp and communicate with others using this new free phone. This saved us at least $50 in our few days in Tokyo, since we were able to use these instead of buying SIM cards and replacing them in our phone.

You can access the large and swish shopping mall in Roppongi Hills direct from the hotel without leaving the complex, which is convenient if you either want to get some cash (ATMs are by the Starbucks) or simply want to buy something essential, such as pastries from the Atelier Robuchon.The hotel is modern with particularly well designed rooms with plenty of drawers and amenities, and with power sockets at desk level. The beds are extremely comfortable, with high quality linen, and the shower in the room was excellent. This room gave access to the tenth floor lounge, which offers breakfast and drinks all day, as well as early evening snacks and cocktails, including Louis Roederer champagne. On a very clear day you can see Mount Fuji in the far, far distance. There is a large swimming pool and well equipped gym on the fifth floor.The staff here are terrific, with excellent English spoken. There are no less than nine top notch concierge staff who can be relied on to sort out all your restaurant reservations and provide handy customised maps to help you navigate Tokyo’s complex street numbering system to find your destination. General manager Christine does not hide in her office but can be seen mingling with the guests and checking up on the smooth service operation. Usually on a long hotel stay you will find some little issues, but not here. The place runs like a Swiss watch.","Chiswick, United Kingdom",257,5.0

I booked a standard room Amex FHR for this hotel but wasn't upgraded. Check-in was pleasant and fine.Food at this hotel was great. The breakfast each morning was a standout. The freshly carved ham was amazing and a great way to start each morning - amongst the other items they had available. Room service was also great. Had two late night meals brought to me and each would have tbolbeen great had they been served at a nice restaurant. The steak sandwich was fantastic, with garlic bread and tender steak sliced correctly against the grain. The bolognese was also top notch - sauce had depth of flavor most restaurant struggle with. Hotel was also perfectly centrally located in Tokyo. Tokyo being such a sprawling city finding somewhere placed a priority for me. I didn't want to have to travel an hour when I had somewhere to go. This hotel solved that. Getting to Shinjuku and Tsukiji (opposite directions) was equally quick and un-problematic. The doormen were also quite helpful with taxis and directions. I don't use conceriege services too much, but in this case they were quite helpful. They helped me with an advance sushi booking at Masuda (which was fantastic), and also helped me plan a special eel restaurant. The room itself was a bit small but had several positives. For one, the bed was HUGE. Largest bed I've ever slept in - it was probably over seven feet wide, i.e. it was wider than long (though you could make argument it made room smaller). The bathroom was gorgeous and decently sized. I was disappointed with the view from my room that looked directly into an office building. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.","Shanghai, China",8,5.0

There are a ton of restaurants within walking distance and you are smack dab in the middle of the bar district. It was perfect. With all that being said the hotel itself is just what you would expect with a 4+ hotel. Even if my toddler boys had came along, I knew this hotel would be suitable for them too. The spa was top notch, and my biggest evaluation is always the breakfast buffet. It was beautifully setup and there was a wide variety of food everyday. The open kitchen made it feel very homey with the interior design making you feel like your at an upscale place. (it was on point ) The room wasn't big like other Hyatts in Tokyo, but the modern up to date decor made up for it. It was just my husband and I, so we didn't mind at all. We were just there to getaway. I would recommend this to anyone, business travelers, families, or romantic getaways. Oh BTW... There was the most beautiful Jazz bar connected to this hotel - I forget the name, ask the concierge. It was breath taking when you walk in, I mean I had only seen places like this in the movies.

It is an 8 to 10 minute walk to the subway, again through an endless mall-office urbanscape that is reminiscent of the part of downtown LA that was redeveloped in the 80's. I had mixed feelings about staying in this somewhat sanitized area but there were still loads of interesting restaurants, stores, etc. if you ventured outside the immediate mall/office complex into greater Roppongi. The hotel itself is very large and self-importantly upscale, with a vast multi-level lobby inhabited by lots of suits and locals going to formal events. Even the pastry shop felt like an elegant and perhaps famous boutique. The hotel overall fit right in with the fancy mall/office surrounding it. For me, the highlight was one of the nicest pool-gym- spa combos I have experienced in a hotel. The pool is large and darkly lit and modern, and the locker room has excellent hot tubs, sauna and massage chairs. The gym is a full scale gym, with a variety of good elliptical and similar machines, all with excellent video screenss, and a good weight selection. It was so good, we made sure to go each day. I think this feature alone may have made this a 5-star hotel. Our room was comfortable and quite large by Tokyo standards, having stayed in a number of different lodgings in the city. By American standards it was probably average for a four or five-star hotel. Very comfortable bed. Everything was electric, modern and refined, with e.g. little motors raising and lowering two types of blinds, or four different sets of lights for the bedroom, all controlled by little panels of buttons. The desk also had a built in stereo with a little bose subwoofer, which was kind of cool but also felt like 1992. My wife's favorite part was the motion-sensing toilet that would raise and lower its lid automatically; the toilet itself discretely hidden behind a door. The bath products were decent but not great with a green tea and cucumber scent. Breakfast was in a pretty setting, with outside seating on a terrace, and the eggs benedict was solid, but of course stupidly expensive. A tip: we found a better egg place in the mall around the corner. Overall I would stay here again if I decided to stay in Roppongi.","San Francisco, California",24,5.0

Located in Roppongi Hills it's really a great location close to the train station, F&B and shopping. Comfortable big rooms, not as luxurious as Andaz but impressive still. Rooms are clean though I do find housekeeping way slower than Andaz. They lose hands down in terms of the view. We stayed for 4 nights and were disappointed to be given a room on the 5th floor with a view of an apartment building across the road. Andaz in comparison has one of the best views of Tokyo. Would we return? Maybe. They win in terms of location. But if you're a first timer to Tokyo I'd highly recommend Andaz. ","Singapore, Singapore",12,5.0

As a result, we get lounge access and other perks that you may not, depending on your situation. That being said:- This is a superior hotel. It deserves the Grand moniker. The rooms are generous for Japan, modern, tastefully furnished, and mostly sound proof. The lounge is large, with good food and drink options. You can easily eat a light dinner, especially if you're jet-lagged and not planning on eating a lot at 6:00pm Japan time / 2:00-5:00am US time.- The staff is generally very competent. We needed help with dinner reservations and transit to Mt Fuji, which were addressed very helpfully.- As noted by others, the gym is not quite at the same standard, but we never saw it full. The pool is really a shallow lap pool, but very nicely done.- The location is top notch. The rooms in the front of the building face a major cardiac center, so you'll hear the occasional siren. The rooms on the other side face the Roppongi Hills tower and some have views of the Tokyo tower.Lastly, if you're using Hyatt points, this property is appropriately priced.","Muir Beach, California",139,5.0
