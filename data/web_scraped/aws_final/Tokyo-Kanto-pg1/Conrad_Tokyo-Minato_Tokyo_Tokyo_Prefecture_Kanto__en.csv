However, I would like to share with others on our wonderful experience of staying in Conrad Tokyo. The hotel staff were so attentive to your needs. The rooms were spick-and-span. Club lounge access had various food and beverage choices. The concierge team were especially outstanding in meeting our high expectations, last-minute arrangements on vehicles and itineraries reservations/bookings without a single sigh.","Singapore, Singapore",6,5.0

Our first stay was 2 nights before New Years, so we knew that the hotel would likely be too full to offer such an upgrade. We were correct, but even though we were given a Standard King, which was what we had booked, the soft furnishings and decor of ALL the rooms at this fine property are top-notch, and we were happy to have the time to luxuriate in this wonderful room, with quite a pleasant city view, on our first night in town. (See my other review of the December stay, on this site).I reviewed the hotel after our first stay, because it was so wonderful, I didn't want to wait. Not only is the property stunning, but the location is wonderful too, on a couple main train lines, and near some pleasant, upscale shopping, and the Hamarikyu Garden.Apparently, the staff read my review at that time, and in order to try not to disappoint, offered us an upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite overlooking the Hamarikyu Garden and Tokyo Bay, on this second stay in January! They always say the true measure of a hotel is its people, and the staff at this hotel indeed made our stay wonderful! They knew we were coming back, and we were greeted with open arms. There is nothing like coming back to a hotel, and being treated like long lost family!Yohei, the Assistant Front Office Manager, came and welcomed us when we checked in, in the executive lounge, and told us the story of how they had seen our previous review, and despite the hotel being very full on this night, wanted to make it a point to see we were looked after, and had reserved a 1 bedroom suite for us. This night was ""coming of age day"" in Japan, when people turning 20 are celebrated, and hotel capacity is usually very full on this night.During the following 24 hours, no less than 6 staff on his team treated us as royalty, and were attentive and kind beyond the call of duty. The whole team is clearly quite proud of their hotel, and were happy to be able to accommodate loyal customers, something we very much appreciated!The one bedroom suite had sweeping views, a walk-through closet, between the living area and bedroom area, a monstrous bathroom with heated floors and separate shower and bath, with the bath having a TV in it, the shower having an overhead rose and a hand shower. I particularly loved the 10x10 Koehler sinks in the bathroom, with HansGrohe Faucets, and am searching for them now for my own home!I personally loved the desk/table in the living area, which was large and great for anyone having to do some work while staying at the hotel. And the sofa was generously deep and very comfortable after a long walk around Tokyo, as was the lounger by the window in the bedroom.The lobby is commanding, and has the most wonderful bar and lounge area, twenty-eight, which on both of our stays, was brimming with happy celebrations, music and laughter, which made for a very cozy atmosphere. You can get extravagant drinks and cute afternoon tea here, with a view and great ambiance.The highlight of the stay (besides the people, who really made the stay fantastic) was the breakfast. As Diamond Members, we were entitled to either the club lounge, or Cerise, the all-day restaurant. Of course, we chose Cerise where, in addition to the buffet options, we were allowed a choice off the made-to-order menu, which was extravagant. We had the omelet lobster fricasse on one occasion, and the croffle on the other (which had truffles... and was YUM).I have been to many of the more upscale hotels in Tokyo during my 9 trips to Tokyo over the past 15 years or so (Marriott Shinagawa, Westin, the other Hiltons), and out of them all, this buffet stood out above all the others for its high-quality, exapnsive buffet choices, as well as its extremely pleasant outlooks and ambiance... and once again, for the people. From chef to server, we were greeted with a smile and attentive service. Even the restaurant manager worked hands on with his staff, and cleared plates and engaged in pleasant chit-chat with us. This is something you don't see at many hotels these days.The Club Lounge offerings too, were pleasant. There were some fantastic wine collections, and the tea time offerings were very yummy cakes, puddings, and chocolates, as well as finger sandwiches.If there were any one thing that let down the hotel, it was that the evening club cocktails were full by the time we arrived, at the starting time, on the dot. We were asked to go back to our room and they would call us when a table opened up. We were told it would likely be around 15 or 20 minutes, but it was about 45 minutes.We were still able to partake of all the cocktail lounge had to offer at our late seating time, though staff were struggling to replace food items and clear tables.I don't blame this on the Conrad, I blame it on the patrons. We also stayed at the Hilton NishiShinjuku and the Hilton Odaiba during this stay, and experienced similar issues.It seems that people who book club rooms take extreme advantage of Hilton's generosity. We saw families of more than 4 people with several children under the age of 10 running around causing havoc. These families would sit around for hours eating free ""dinner"" and annoying other guests... and this was at all the properties. I would suggest tightening up rules around number of guests and duration of stay, at the very least, for Hilton Clubs in general, as a solution to this issue.However, once again, I can't say this was an issue with Conrad Tokyo specifically, it was a general issue with all the Hiltons we stayed at. I have seen it happen in US and China before, but not at previous stays at Hiltons in Japan, so it was sad to see.Aside from that one blip, we were so impressed with the pride all of the staff at Conrad Tokyo, and so grateful for the experience and generosity of providing us a 1 bedroom suite on this occasion.They say that great staff is supported by great managers. Clearly from the GM all the way down through management takes great pride in their work, and so do all of the people they support.We are looking forward to coming back for another pleasant stay when the world opens up again! The next time we hope to stay long enough to try out some of the other restaurants such as China Blue and Kazahana. I think we'll probably also try the Conrad Osaka on the next trip too!In all the stays I've had at upscale hotels in my lifetime, this may not have been THE most upscale (though it was right up there), but it did have some of the best quality offerings, and was my personal favorite of them all!Thanks once again, for a very upscale stay, but also for treating us as family!","Vallejo, California",122,5.0

There was the usual buffet, but also an a la carte menu with gourmet selections. I chose the lobster omelette and Dutch Baby pancake.All members of staff we met, from front of house to waitstaff and housekeeping were friendly and professional.

As we had a late evening flight the next day, we opted for a late checkout, which obviously meant an additional full day rate. The property is awesome, beautifully located near the busy Shimbashi Station and Oedo Line Shiodome Station, and overlooks the Tokyo Bay area & the Hamarikyu Gardens. Our rooms (3403 & 3407) on the 34st floor were very comfortable, quiet, intriguingly architected (rolling shades between bedroom and bathroom) and nice furnished, offered a stunning view on the bay which clearly represent the pièce de résistance of this location. We enjoyed a traditional teatime at the bar on the 28th floor lobby, which at evening features live music and a cozy fireplace.

Everything from asking how our day went, to making recommendations of fun things to see and do in the area. Tammer was especially helpful, and we certainly enjoyed that he made drink suggestions and brought them over himself. The pool and fitness area were impeccable, with the pool being on the 29th floor overlooking the city. The breakfast was amazing with all of the choices. Japanese and western with views of Tokyo.

I am a gold member and booked with American Express travel so I had hoped for an upgrade. Did not receive which was fine but was confused when I was told by one staff member the hotel was booked then told by another that because of coronavirus the hotel was not full.I will say the stay was polite and professional but had challenges with problem resolution.

They were both amazing, but Tokyo just takes it to the next level. This was by far the best customer service I have ever experienced. Everyone was super helpful without being pushy or snobbish. The property itself is the height of luxury. Elegant and sophisticated, but still welcoming. It's just what we needed after a 14 hour flight. As soon as we arrived, the staff were there to take our bags directly to our suite. During check-in we received hot towels and a welcoming soft drink. As soon as we entered our suite there was a plate of Japanese pastries waiting for us. We had a bay view, which was amazing! Waking up to sunrise over Tokyo Bay was a magical experience. We decided to use the pool/spa area the first night we arrived to help recover from the post flight fatigue. It was great to be able to relax in the steam room after all that dry air on the plane! All the facilities were immaculate with high-end toiletries and cosmetics. We had breakfast included as part of our stay. The buffet features a wide variety of Western and Asian options. You can also order off of a menu in addition to the buffet. Needles to say, we didn't need much to eat the rest of the day. I highly recommend the dim sum options. Delicious! We also treated ourselves to cocktails in Level 28 one night. Our drinks arrived with a complimentary bowl of baked cheese sticks and chocolate covered macadamia nuts, which was a lovely touch. The hotels is a short walk to shopping in Ginza and several difference transportation options. The staff at the Conrad were incredibly helpful is getting us taxis whenever we needed them. I can't say enough good things about my experience at The Conrad Tokyo.

However, we did have breakfast at the beautiful breakfast restaurant on the lobby level. The quality was top notch, and probably the best breakfast buffet we have had in Tokyo thus far, including the very good Hilton Shinjuku and Westin Ebisu offerings!I’m happy to say we are lucky enough to not only have started, but to be ending our journey at this lovely hotel on Jan 12th, so we will both get to partake of the wonderful breakfast and this time to experience the club lounge, which we are looking forward to.Fingers crossed at this less busy time, we get to experience an upgraded room also, but regardless, the stay will be worthwhile.

My room was outstandingly appointed--as nice a room as I have stayed anywhere in the world.The amenities were all good but not consistently outstanding. The food and drink options were of reasonable quality but were perhaps too Western and hardly exceptional--perhaps could be described as Hilton-level quality and not something unique or exceptional. In particular, the bar ambience was lobby-esque and the drinks were decidedly ordinary, in contrast to the Mandarin Oriental bar which is sleek and refined, and serves innovative world-class drinks. The fitness center was OK but too small to accommodate the morning rush of business travelers. The sauna/steam room was like a mini-onsen and was the best I've seen in a hotel.","San Francisco, California",15,4.0

Which has resulted in my spending just under 4,000 hotel nights thus far, mostly in very nice hotels. In the process of spending so many nights in hotels, it's natural for a person to become a bit jaded, and to not be particularly excited about yet another night in a hotel. And while I always deeply appreciate the hard work hotel employees do to make my hotel night, and every other guest's night a pleasant and memorable event, it can be just another night. At least, that is how I thought until I recently stayed at the Conrad Tokyo. This hotel *blew* *me* *away.* It started with one of the warmest welcomes I have ever received at a hotel, thanks to the absolutely extraordinary hospitality of Guest Relations Manager Yuka and her exceptionally talented colleague, Sarah. New Guest Relations recruit Francesca, who is outstanding and learning from the best of the best, also contributed to the wonderful welcome. They were all friendly, conversational and fun, and more like old friends than Guest Relations specialists. They created a deeply positive mood and atmosphere that lasted during my entire stay. While some veteran travelers can become demanding and even grumpy, I am the exact opposite. I just go with the flow, and am grateful for whatever I get. I never ask for anything special. To me, travel is much easier when you adopt this ""attitude of gratitude."" For some reason, Front Desk Manager Mr. Takagi decided, on his own and without my making any special request of any kind, that he wanted me to have a wonderful room. Maybe he just picked up on the ""attitude,"" and liked it. He worked his front desk computer hard, leveraging all his knowledge and expertise. Next thing, I walked into one of the most beautiful hotel rooms I have ever occupied in my life. It was my luxurious home for the next five nights, and what a pleasure it was. With amazing views of the harbor, a bed that was out of this world, and a bathroom that even billionaires only dream about. Thank you, Mr. Takagi. The entire Executive Lounge team, under the expert direction of Naomi, simply could not have been nicer. Each Executive Lounge professional was hard working, caring, helpful, friendly and pleasant. Once again, they were more like friends welcoming me at their home. I won't name anyone in particular because the entire team was terrific, and I would feel bad if I forgot someone due to jet lag. Thank you all. Mr. Takii, Breakfast Manager at Cerise, oversees the best breakfast buffet I have ever enjoyed anywhere in the world. He, too, has a wonderful team. Special mention goes to Anri and Yui, who provided the warm, gracious and hospitable service for which the Japanese people are so renowned and revered. Special mention, too, to Vincent, the super-smart Front Door welcome and bell person who went so far out of his way to greet me upon arrival, and to then wish me a safe journey upon departure. With excellent language skills and a big heart, he epitomized everything that is so wonderful about the people at this hotel. Finally, special recognition to Angelo, the Assistant Food and Beverage Manager, who is like a magical presence at the extremely popular and absolutely beautiful lounge in the sky, adjacent to the sky high lobby and reception area. I have never before encountered a Food & Beverage professional more in tune with and wanting the very best experience for his guests. It was a pleasure to speak with him. Unfortunately, I am forgetting to mention several other truly outstanding team members. The simple fact is that every single person I encountered at this hotel was superb. As you can tell from this review, to me, the team members at a hotel are everything. Even a standard hotel can be superb if the team members are superb. But this hotel is different. It is absolutely gorgeous in every respect, with every luxury and amenity a person could want. But in addition to this, the team members are off-the-charts superb, in every department. When you take excellence, and square it, and then square it again, you are able to take a surreal trip to the ""Blown Away."" I simply cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",West Virginia,16,5.0

The service at Conrad Tokyo by far provides the most luxurious and yet the warmest among them all. ItThe minute I stepped in the first floor ,I could sense an aroma with light flowery tones. It was warming and welcoming. I was directed the elevator and then to the lobby. The minute the staff knows about my diamond status, we were escorted by Aisha ,an energetic young lady to the elevator and were soon greeted by Sarah. I didn't expect my diamond status was such a big deal. We were sure be taken care well.Sarah was the one taking care of our need during the whole stay.

This is our third stay in about 3 years. The hotel is located in a highly built-up business area in the Shiodome/Shimbashi neighborhood. Access to the hotel, especially for those who take the public transport system, is very convenient. The hotel is just next to Shiodome on Ooedo Line and Yurikamome Line. It is also a very short walk from the Shimbashi stations. The hotel is also served by the Airport Limousine Bus to/from both Tokyo area airports, though there is a lack of an afternoon/evening bus from Haneda to the hotel. We especially like the property because it is somewhat away from the craziness of Shinjuku/Shibuya/Ginza/Marunouchi tourists. For those who are brand new to Tokyo, the location may be a bit intimidating because it is not really possible to see the street from the ground floor entrance...it is part of a semi-undergound pedestrian system. The property backs against the Hamarikyu Garden and the Tokyo Bay beyond it, with a spectacular view from the hotel. Check-in was smooth and efficient as usual. Our room was clean, modern, comfortable, and well equipped. Breakfast, both in the executive lounge and the downstairs restaurant, was outstanding as usual.

The beds were quite comfortable and the bathroom was huge - with a separate bath and shower.The Executive Lounge was nice - albeit cut in half by the corridor which was a bit odd - and you had to be quick, and with sharp elbows to get your food - it was very busy and people were quick to take the offerings - not very refined to be honest. It didn’t feel like a Conrad experience in all honesty.Breakfast was where it all went wrong for us - we went to the hotel restaurant - Cerise - and it was shocking. Waiting for tables (despite the restaurant being empty, waiting 20 mins for coffee and reordering in order to get it, waiting 25 mins for an omelette to arrive) - all just poor staff organisation. I watched 2 people get up and walk out while we were waiting for food. However, after I complained, the hotel sent a manager to come and chat to us and some apology snacks to the room - I think they handled it very well once we had complained - it just should never have got to that in the first place!Other than that the stay was fine - although I will hesitate to stay here again - I have a booking in Jan and will have a think if I want to keep it or move elsewhere.","London, United Kingdom",130,4.0

In this trip to Tokyo, I've stayed at places that are £30 a night, mid-range hotels and this, the most expensive of my stay which quite frankly, did not match up to its luxury status. Here are some things that irked me, because when I'm paying through the nose, I don't expect anything to irk me. - the hotel bar has seats by the window. On the twice I entered the bar, every seat was empty, but they told me I couldn't sit there because they were reserved. They remained empty for the entire time I was there.- at breakfast, every morning, I had to ask for my coffee three times.- the food was not good at breakfast, the room overcrowded, the area by the window nice, the other area, where I was mostly put, dark and depressing. The eggs were rank. The scrambled tofu was not scrambled tofu.- at breakfast I was embarrassed in front of a queue of people by being told I had to go and change my slippers/indoor shoes as they weren't allowed. I was sent away from breakfast- a huge deal was made about me not having a credit card. I wasn't allowed to use my debit card for a hold on the room which prevented me from charging anything to the room. Room service, for example (£20 for a bowl of soup) had to be brought up, card taken down and charged, then brought back. It made me feel like they thought I was going to steal something.- the TV in my room didn't work. - the shower in my room was full of limescale. - I wasn't allowed late checkout.- on my last day, I asked if I could sit in the bar if I wasn't drinking as I had time to kill, at reception they said yes. I was then asked repeatedly by waiter staff what I wanted to drink. This is the most attentive anyone has been all trip!

Yes, the hotel is luxurious but there's better Conrad's out there in terms of the hotel itself. The staff though, the staff is what earns Conrad Tokyo the excellent rating. I am hard-pressed to think of a more outstanding guest relations member I've EVER encountered than Peter at the TwentyEight bar.  He was incredibly gracious, generous and professional. He went above and beyond multiple times to ensure I enjoyed my stay. Thank you Peter. Miyako at reception made sure my check-in was as enjoyable as possible and Tamar in the executive lounge was extraordinarily helpful without me even having to ask for anything. He just naturally knew how to help. He ensured my husband who was joining me later in the trip would have a seamless arrival to our next destination. There was no need for him to voluntarily do this but yet he did. Amazing customer service!The staff was so exceptional I even convinced my husband and his friends to stay at the Conrad on our last nite in Tokyo (it didn't take much convincing given my raving about it). We already had accommodations at an AirBnB for that nite but when you can receive such care at The Conrad, you make the move. Especially when your team just won their quarterfinal game of the Rugby World Cup. You must celebrate and again Peter stepped in to make sure we all enjoyed our last nite in Tokyo.As for practicalities, getting around the city is easy as there are a couple of stations within a 10-min underground walk or less. Taxi to the Haneda monorail is a 5-min cab ride away. I got upgraded to a higher floor as there were no lower floor/bigger room upgrades available. When my husband and his friends arrived, we were generously allowed to check in early to get ready for the Springbok game. Thank you Conrad for making our Quarterfinal weekend so memorable (and my stay during the week)!",NYC,105,5.0

Needless-to-say, the hotel was fully booked with others in the same situation including those attending the the Rugby World Cup games and Grand Prix car race.Since the typhoon caused practically a lock-down situation for guests as well as staff, the Conrad employees were required to remain on the premises throughout the ordeal to tend to guests. Plus there was a 5.7 earthquake during the middle of the storm! Although they must have been exhausted, the staff performed their duties in a calm and gracious manner.Spa - We splurged on a hot stone massage and although very expensive, we were very pleased for our massages. The facility is spotless and our therapists were top-notch....perfect answer to the stress of cancelled flights.Room - Our room was large and the view over Tokyo Bay and Hama-rikyu Gardens is spectacular.

First of all the staff were fantastic from the moment we arrived to moment we left, thank you!. I was in Tokyo 2 weeks earlier and had stayed in the heart of Shinjuku which has its benefits for going out and experiencing Tokyo. Some people may say this hotel is a little away from the places you want to go, and is in the modern part of the city; but for me it was a nice change and lovely oasis, beautifully designed interiors with a nod to contemporary japan despite being an international brand. We were also being a little jaded from travelling and being my 4th trip to Tokyo the hotel was an incredible place to relax with vibrant restaurants and bars with excellent food, and funnily enough wasn’t filled with foreign tourists like some other well known hotel bars in the city, A lot of Japanese people dined and drank in the restaurants and bars which I really liked, similar to the Aman Tokyo. So this still felt like you were having an authentic experience without the need to rush out. Also it has a metro stop right underneath and actually got us using the underground to pop to my favourite places on my last day in the city; which was great. All in all really enjoyed my time there, fantastic staff particularly on the front desk and lobby :) and will be my Tokyo hotel of choice from now on! :)","New York City, New York",4,5.0

Our expectations were low because the Conrad is affiliated with a brand of hotels that we don't typically think of as being in this category (Hilton). If there was such a thing as a star hotel, the Conrad would be in it. The facilities are top notch, the room was nicely appointed with a spectacular view of the Tokyo bay. The breakfast in the morning was particularly noteworthy with both Japanese and Western options. Best of all, though were the people. On the first night of our trip, we were be-friended by the Bar Captain, Peter, who not only made sure that we were taken care of with great seats and service at the bar (we aren't big bar people, but we went there at the end of each evening just to see him!), but also took an interest in where we were going and what we were doing in Tokyo, He was a great ambassador for the hotel and for the City of Tokyo and made us feel very special and welcomed in both his hotel and the city. On our first evening, we had dinner in the hotel (mostly because we had just arrived and were quite jet lagged and just needed food). Much to our surprise, the hotel restaurant served top notch food that compared favorably to the other great restaurants that we visited during our trip. When the travel agent originally suggested the Conrad, we questioned the choice. Ultimately, we decided to trust her and we were so glad that we did. The Conrad is a gem...and unlike other 5 star hotels, it really felt like a hotel that could have been no where else other than Japan. In a country that takes enormous pride in service, the Conrad hotel stands at the very top. We could not recommend any hotel more!","Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania",1,5.0

However, Hilton was offering a status match (I matched to Diamond) and I had some Hilton points so I thought I would stay at the Conrad Tokyo which has apparently always been ranked near the top hotels in Tokyo. I was very much looking forward to this stay. I stayed here for 3 nights as part of a 9 day Japan trip (coinciding with my birthday) with my family (with two small kids) which took us first to Tokyo and then to Kyoto. I was also recently in Tokyo in October 2018 where I stayed at the Ritz Carlton and had a fantastic experience.After this stay, I left quite disappointed and I think there are a number of flaws that were exposed and need to be highlighted. First, I want to touch on the location of the hotel itself. It is indeed convenient to Shiodome station which is right next door, but getting to Shimbashi station is another story. It is a complex web of elevators/walkways/buildings which make it difficult to find the right direction. The front line staff at ground lobby do a commendable job in providing directions to Shimbashi (amongst other places) but I found they sometimes struggled to provide clear directions to something that should be straightforward (like, how do I get to Shimbashi station from here?). In general I found it difficult to find my way around the neighbourhood because something as easy as crossing the street required going up a series of elevated walkways. At the Ritz, they always gave out maps or drew maps for the guests - why not do the same at this property? Secondly, I was also concerned about the training of the staff with regard to how they deal with small children. I felt like children were treated as a nuisance compared to the rest of the clientele. Yes I have a 3 and a 5 year old , and while they're generally well behaved, they also just stepped off an 11 hour plane ride into the humid summer weather, and they're going to have their moments. There is a pretty flower display in front of the Cerise restaurant and when the lineup for breakfast is 10 deep, they're going to want to explore . Instead of sternly telling the children to ""not touch"" in front of me (who is already trying to stop them from touching), it would be helpful to engage them and draw their attention to something else. There were a few friendly staff who we encountered (I think it was a Filipino lady who I cannot remember the name of unfortunately, who worked in the restaurant who was especially kind) but in general this was few and far between. This was one of the most disappointing aspects of my stay. After I left Conrad, we went to Ritz Kyoto where it was immediately clear that the staff valued children and went out of their way to make them feel welcome (special kids programs daily, free ice cream, etc) and were so wonderful with children. The difference between what we had at the Conrad was night and day. Thirdly, and somewhat related to my point above, I thought that the general demeanor of the staff was rather cold. I was rarely greeted by name when I came back (the staff at the Ritz ALWAYS greeted the guests by name) and it wasn't really a welcoming environment to come back to. Finally, I want to share an experience which I thought highlighted a major flaw of this hotel. My wife inadvertently forgot some gym shorts at the hotel but we didn't realize this until our 2nd last day in Japan (by which time we were in Kyoto). I emailed the hotel and they confirmed that we had indeed forgotten the item and offered to send it to us. By this time we would have been traveling overseas and the cost to send the item would have outweighed just buying a new pair of shorts. It is obviously our fault that we forgot an item and it's not the value of the item that is important. However, I thought it was blatantly irresponsible that if a guest were to forget something, the hotel would not proactive. Instead it took FIVE DAYS and I had to initiate the conversation for them to inform me that I did leave something. Does anyone actually think that this is acceptable at such a high end hotel? For an example of how it's done right, when I was at the JW Mariott in Seoul in October 2018 and also inadvertently forgot something. Within a FEW HOURS of checking out I had received an email to let me know that I forgot something and asking how they could get it to me! And other (relatively) minor things - having Diamond status did not come with any room upgrades (I suppose HIlton has too many elites) though they were kind enough to offer a complementary cake for my birthday. The Conrad also has a decent breakfast spread and as a Diamond I could order off the menu as well. So in conclusion, it's probably the top Hilton in Tokyo but certainly not among the top hotels overall. You will see that I have compared my experience here to the one I had last year at the Ritz Tokyo which was superior in almost every way. I assure you I am not getting paid by Mariott to write this, I am only speaking from my personal experience. For Conrad, a hotel that aspires to be one of the top in Tokyo, it's certainly got a way to go and improve on","Vancouver, BC",27,2.0

From minute one, we knew it was going to be a great experience. Every member of the staff with whom we interacted was professional, warm, and incredibly kind to our two young children (aged almost 3 and almost 1). Reminiscent in many ways of the Ritz Carlton Hong Kong, the hotel’s lobby is on the 28th floor, as are the three restaurants and a very nice lobby lounge. On the 37th floor is the Executive Lounge which, due to Hilton Honors Diamond status, is where we found ourselves shortly after arriving at the hotel. Jiew welcomed us to the lounge, showed us to a table overlooking the famous Hamarikyu Gardens, and brought us some light refreshments while she prepared our check-in paperwork. Despite the fact that our free night certificate equated to a “standard room reward”, we were upgraded to a King Suite Bay View, which was absolutely perfect. The room was amazing, and we were able to keep the kids in separate spaces so they didn’t wake/keep each other up - this made a huge difference and I truly appreciate the Conrad staff going out of their way to ensure we were comfortable. Besides Jiew, other staff members who made a lasting impression included Sarah, who was so sweet with our daughter on multiple occasions, and the Assistant Front Office Manager Yohei Asano, who spent so much time during our breakfast at Collage ensuring we (and especially our son) had a fantastic meal and wanted for nothing. Finally, a big thank you to all the staff at the Executive Lounge - truly an amazing group of professionals. During our stay, we had the opportunity to dine at all three of the main restaurants (though Collage only for breakfast, so did not sample the haute French cuisine for which they are known). All the food was thoughtfully prepared and delicious - exactly what you would expect from a hotel of this caliber. It is clear the Conrad Tokyo puts a great deal of time into ensuring their guests feel welcome and cared for, and I can say without question that every aspect of our stay was exceptional. We will absolutely be staying at this world-class hotel the next time we come into Tokyo.","Anacortes, Washington",6,5.0

The moment I made reservations online, Aya from reservations sent a welcome email. Then Yuka & Sarah from Guest Relations contacted us regarding our stay and to see if there is anything that we will need upon arrival and for the entire the duration of our trip. When we arrived, we were greeted warmly by the front lobby staff who led us upstairs to the reception area. We were then greeted by every person in reception and Yuka warmly welcomed us and then led us to our room. We were truly impressed by the beauty of the hotel and our suite and view was amazing. When we arrived in our room, our 11 yr old daughter squealed with joy as she saw welcome treats and lovely note from Sarah. Sarah made sure our daughter's stay at the Conrad was just as wonderful as our experience. Lastly, but not least, we would like to mention Angelo for helping us figure out what we like to do, for concierge for making it happen and four housekeeping/turn down service for the excellent service. I can go on and on so we're planning a trip back to Tokyo and staying again at the Conrad. ",,0,5.0

On one of the days of our stay I had to book different type of room from what we needed (we needed two beds as it was me and my 20 yo daughter), and the hotel reached out to me through the e-mail and assured they would give us a room with two beds for all our stay and we would be able to stay in the same room all the days, without the need of switching rooms.When we came to the hotel the great experience continued. I am Hilton Diamond, and in US you never get too much of a value for a status, at least I never did. But when you are abroad - that's when you are happy you have the status. We were upgraded right away to a bay view room with two (!) beds on the 34 floor as I always ask for higher floor. The view was so great - like whatever I thought Tokyo would look like in my imagination - that was what the view was: the bay, the park, the skyscrapers and neon on the distance. When I first came into the room I was just sitting at the sofa next to the window for a little while taking in the view.The room had everything one can possibly need: a lot of toiletries, tea pot, electric kettle, fancy coffee machine, tea and coffee and the small fridge (which was actually a part of the mini bar, but we were able to put our stuff on top of the hotel's stuff when we needed). The design of the room also was very cool. The foyer had wooden floor, the shower had two shower heads - rain shower and the portable one. When we came into the room for the first time - there was rubber Conrad duck on the bathtub and cute Conrad bear on the bed - my 20 yo still is a child, she was so happy :)))Being Diamond we got a choice of breakfast - downstairs or in the lounge. We mostly ate downstairs as we like bigger selection to have something different every day. But on the check-out day we went for breakfast to the lounge - and it was pretty amazing compared to lounges in the US: there was even a chief there making omelets and eggs to order. Breakfast downstairs was pretty impressive too: great variety of European and Asian options, everything was absolutely fresh and tasty.The lounge was such a great option too. You could get soft drinks and juices there any time. But during certain hours in the evening they would serve alcohol and hot items - small but very tasty, and for us two it was often enough that we would not even need to go to dinner.But even better - is the stuff. Everybody we encountered in the hotel was highly professional, genuinely warm and friendly. The quality of service was outstanding to the degree that it was not just Japanese hospitality (which is impressive to begin with) - but it was just very attentive and delicate service. The personal in the lounge were our favourites - I wish I would remember the names but I am really bad with names. Also the maitre at the breakfast downstairs (again I don't remember the name but I remember that it was an Italian gentleman) - was just such a pleasure to communicate with. Even the gentlemen who was handling the limousine bus departure and tickets on the ground floor - was efficient, fast and very professional.Thank you VERY MUCH, employees of Conrad Tokyo - you are amazing!We will definitely be back!

In Tokyo we stayed at the Conrad in a two bedroom executive suite facing Tokyo bay. I had arranged transportation from Haneda airport to the hotel through the concierge and that played out painlessly after 12 hours in the air. Upon arrival we were met by several staff and one of the guest managers who is actually the Chinese guest relations manager and goes by the name ""Simon"" for us Americans. Simon showed us to our room, explained all the amenities the hotel had to offer including the location and hours of the executive lounge, and helped us get settled in. After we unpacked, we were ready to go start exploring and Simon again helped us with maps of the area, ideas, and a map of the subway system which I highly recommend using as it is cheap, clean, quiet, and very organized. I can say I really hate when a hotel puts those ""green"" thermostats in rooms that limit your temperature range, and shut off if no motion is detected for a time. This hotel does not use those and you can set the AC to freeze your brains out if you wish which we did. Our room also had a small kitchen area and a washer/dryer which we used several times to keep up a supply of clean clothes. The room was very nice and had outstanding views of a ground level garden/teahouse area as well as Tokyo bay. We heard no noise from the hallways or from other rooms. The only thing you could hear on occasion was the trains running on the nearby tracks but it wasn't loud and didn't bother us at all. The executive lounge had a good breakfast, mid day snacks, and evening cocktails with things you could actually use for dinner if you wished. The lounge also had a nice view of Tokyo Bay in one of the two lounge rooms. The staff there in the lounge were very attentive and also helped with ideas for things to see and do. We came back several evenings from day trips so worn out that we ordered room service for dinner on two occasions. The menu had American, Japanese, and Chinese offerings. We found the room service food quality, timeliness, and overall experience to be excellent in all respects. The location of the hotel is really in a great spot with close proximity to the subway and rail system as well as being near the multiple streets of ""street food"" shops that the locals hit after work. We walked down every alley we could find in that area and I can say that at no time did we ever feel unsafe day or night. We interacted mainly with Simon and another manager named Paweena. Both of them were excellent representations of the hotel and it's goal to make you feel at home. We left there after 5 nights to go to South Korea and do a DMZ/JSA tour to see the North Korean border area. We then came back to Tokyo for our last night before flying back to the US and were made to feel home again right away. Based on our experience I can highly recommend this hotel as a great place with beautiful rooms and an excellent staff. We would definitely stay here again whenever we get back to Tokyo.","Appleton, Wisconsin",10,5.0

We recently completed another vacation with stays in the Grand Hyatt Taipei, the Westin Seoul (should not even be included in this group of hotels because we would not return), the Conrad Tokyo, ANA Crowne Plaza Kanazawa, and the Kai Matsumoto--so we had a chance to compare several hotels. The Conrad Tokyo is not only by far the best of this group, but we truly believe the Conrad Tokyo is the best in all our travels around the world. We had two stays during our 8 days in Japan. First for 3 nights, then we returned 3 days later for another 2 night stay. Both times, the service was amazing! And both stays, the Conrad generously upgraded our rooms as Hilton Diamond members. The first stay we were upgraded to Executive King rooms with amazing bay views, and the second stay, they were super generous in upgrading us to an Executive King Suite with a bay view! Talk about WOW! The GM actually took the time to ask us when we would be back from sightseeing so that he could personally welcome us to the Conrad in person when we got back to the hotel. He also sent an email during our stay to check in with us. What a generous thing for the GM to do, to send us an email on a Saturday to check in on us! Contrast that with the Westin Seoul. I asked the concierge staff for the the GM's email so that I could provide the hotel with some feedback, and they are refusing to give me his email! It makes sense now why we felt the staff at the Westin Seoul didn't really care about customer service! It comes from the top and clearly the GM there doesn't care to get feedback from the guests! That made us appreciate more the Conrad Tokyo's service!Our friend Susan traveled with us on this trip, and she could not stop praising how amazing the service, the rooms, the Executive Lounge, the breakfast, just how amazing everything was at the Conrad. She was especially impressed that after stepping foot in the Executive Lounge for the first time and confirming her name and room number, it seemed like everyone in the Lounge addressed her by name for the rest of our two stays--even if she hadn't yet met them yet! It seems like such a small thing, but it was those little personal things that really set the Conrad apart. But on top of all that, there is the AMAZING Mieko--one of the concierge team members at the Conrad Tokyo. She provided over the top amazing service back in 2016, and she did it again for this trip. She started helping with plans almost a year before our arrival. She helped us pick the restaurants to try (with so many to choose from in Tokyo, that's a tough decision) and snagged us reservations at Ryugin, Sushi Yoshitake, and lunch at Ginza Hirayama (of the three, Ginza Hirayama is a must try!). She made dinner reservations for us in Kanazawa and Matsumoto (and sake tour reservations and Ninja temple reservations). I mention that because in Kanazawa and Matsumoto, even though I reached out to the hotel staff in those cities, it was Mieko who was the most responsive and helpful! So she ended up helping us more than the hotel staff in those cities! Mieko also remembered my partner's birthday is in April (from our visit in 2016), and she arranged a wonderful spread in our room to help him celebrate his birthday month! Honestly, Mieko has been such a standout that we are now almost always left disappointed by the other concierges at hotels around the world! We can't wait for our next visit, hopefully in 2021!","Dallas, Texas",101,5.0

The room size was critical when choosing a hotel in Japan because most hotel rooms were not as large as those in other countries. The bay view room of Conrad Tokyo was very spacious and thus left plenty space for three people living together. The location of the hotel was extremely convenient. It was just beside the Shiodome station where you could access to the New Transit, Yurikamome line and the Toei subway line. Around 5min walk, you reached the Shinbashi station from which you could go to almost anywhere in Tokyo through the JR line and the Tokyo Metro line. I have to mention Odaiba. If you travel with kids, Odaiba may be a good place for entertainment, shopping, foods and etc. You could either take the New Transit train at the Shiodome station or the Shinbashi station, the terminal station. Also, the hotel was near Ginza, the iconic place of Tokyo. Hamarikyu park was just across the street though we did not manage to go there due to tight schedule.Japanese 5 star hotels are always proud of their service. Conrad Tokyo also exhibited the high standard of Japanese service. From day 1 to the last day, form check in to check out, from your luggage sending into your room to your luggage sending to the airport limousine bus, you would notice that the service was full of details to make you feel comfortable. Staff were polite, professional and keen to help. If you asked for something, staff will respond fast. I’d like to mention Yamazaki san from the front desk, Kaori san as well as another young lady from the restaurant, the lady at the gym who gave my daughter an ice pack.Food was carefully prepared and the culinary team would change the menu a little bit every day.

This perk was incredibly appreciated. The hotel was also very helpful in forwarding our luggage to our next destination, and we were very comfortable in our beautiful room. The location was also perfect -- very conveniently located next to several subway lines, making transportation around the city incredibly easy.The one part of our experience that we didn't love was an evening visit to Twenty Eight, the hotel's lounge in the main lobby. The views are stunning, and as we came back exhausted from our sightseeing one day, we decided to just eat at the restaurant and have some drinks before calling it a night. We ordered two old fashioneds, and were served exceptionally sweet drinks adorned with pineapples, cherries, giant orange slices -- really a whole panoply of fruit. It was the right idea -- the drink had bourbon and a perfect cube of ice -- but not the execution we're used to. I was going to overlook this, as maybe it's not a popular drink choice in Tokyo and the bartender might not have been familiar with it, but we were also disappointed with our food.Advice -- book the hotel, but skip TwentyEight.","New York City, New York",21,4.0

Our experience was top notch. Guest rooms: Spacious, waterfall shower head, high end spread of bathroom amenities, perfect blackout shade (mechanical). We had a large window overlooking Tokyo Bay, and it was a great view each morning.Breakfast: Spread includes Asian and western offerings, as well as a daily ""specials"" menu. The space can get crowded and there were several instances where we waited exceedingly long for coffee (and subsequent refills), so a table carafe or self serve would've been welcomed. Either way, a plentiful spread to get the day started. Executive Lounge: wonderful staff and sufficient offerings. Two sided space with city and Tokyo Bay views to choose from. Breakfast offerings are generally the same as main restaurant, but on a smaller scale. On par with most executive lounges that offer you a space to get snacks, drinks and quiet time. Location: Walkable to Ginza area, but metro probably slightly faster. Pedestrian covered walkway access to two stations. ""walkway"" also includes access to a Starbucks, McDonald's, FamilyMart, TacoBell. It's a 7-10 minute walk to the stations, but easy enough to navigate. In cold months, it's probably quite cold during this walk. Staff: probably the highlight of an already fantastic stay. Every staff member we encountered was a complete joy to be around. We did not use restaurants for meals other than breakfast, and did not use the lobby bar - although many people did and it looked to be quite good. Also did not use the fitness center/pool, but we explored it. The fitness center has a lot to offer, but the pool is a 2 lane lap pool that appears to require lap swimming. No hot tub.

She led us to the lounge and checked us in there. The lounge has the Tokyo Bay view with a lot of free gourmet finger food and beverages. We felt welcome and pampered coming in after a flight. We took our time and was then led to the room. To our surprise, the room was already decorated for my birthday wife, with a box of gift chocolates from the kitchen on the coffee table. The room was luxurious, spacious, and had an amazing view of the Tokyo Bay. Amenities were top notched and there were different brands to choose from using the Conrad app.The included breakfast buffet had a great variety, and with a little up charge we could get a Japanese style breakfast bento box which we liked a lot. I heard it was no longer served though. If that is the case I would really love them to bring that option back.Throughout the stay communication was clear and staff were very friendly. On the last day of our stay, we even received a thank you note and little gift from the concierge. It was a very nice touch and my wife loved it and felt special.Thank you to all Conrad Tokyo staff who had helped me pull off this surprise for my wife. Special thanks to Neil McInnes who made all of these possible. Their effort in decoration, cards and notes, arrangements, gifts, services, and how well all of these were coordinated and presented, showed that they deeply care about their customer's experience.

When the room attendant came for turndown service, they just put the plug back in the sink, but it was not fixed.

Hand writing greeting card from our concierge and got us reservation to dine at Sushi Jiro in Ginza.Moving to Conrad for the rest two nights as I’m a Hilton diamond member and have enjoyed my Conrad experience at Maldives, Osaka, and Manhattan. Wasn’t expecting an upgrade since it’s cherry blossom season but still got a notification in the Hilton app saying that I’m upgraded to 3403 bay view room on the night before my visit.Everything looked perfect until I checked in, I was notified that they didn’t have the upgraded room prepared for me and gave me room basic 3528 which was assigned to another Hilton member (there was typed greeting card addressing to Robin G. on the desk). Understandable if the hotel was fully booked to offer upgrade but it is unacceptable they sell the room which was already assigned to customer. Shady operation......I spoke to the front desk about the problem but they just blamed it to the system/app...unprofessionally handling the situation. Not going to discredit friendly front desk and lounge staffs, but definitely avoid Conrad unless you want to experience people checking into your room/you checking into other people’s room or given benefits being taken back/double sold.Unrivalled Ritz experience, especially comparing to Conrad...Location wise Ritz Ropponggi is so much better/convienet with malls, restaurants and tourist spots. Plus, Midtown cheery blossom is right beneath the hotel.As for now, I’m ‘offered’ for the originally assigned room for ‘one night’ as the they claime the whole property is fully booked.

As on previous visits, the hotel absolutely wins on service – it was outstanding. The hotel was great; however, rooms could use an update.Room 3544: I don’t know if this was classified as a “suite” or an over sized king room. Large windows and I had a marginal view of the water, but then, views from a hotel room are not important to me (if I’m not looking directly into brick wall and/or there’s limited natural light). Looking out to water doesn’t do much for me. Light is important, however, and there was plenty of natural light coming into this room. The primary view from this room looked toward tall buildings. There was a living space with ample furniture and around the corner were two queen beds. (Maybe full beds; can’t remember.) There was no door separating the bedroom from the living space, but you couldn’t see the beds from the living space. While the room had enough space and somewhat comfortable, it could use an update to its furnishings. They’re a bit worn around the ages and slightly dated. (I hadn’t seen a DVD player in a hotel room in a very long time.) There was no formal desk, but the small, round table was fine for computer work. However, the available electrical outlets were not close, so I had an issue with ensuring I didn’t trip over the cords. They scored high for having a tea kettle in the room (yeah!) and very good English breakfast tea. Like another recent hotel room, there was no closet in the bedroom. It was inconvenient to walk through the living space to get to the closet, which was near the entry door. The bedroom did have a chest of drawers, but they were shallow. The bathroom was a good size and I always favor a separate water closet, i.e., closed off from the rest of the bathroom. Loved the shower, which had more than adequate water pressure. Nice soaking tub, but I’m not a tub guy. Overall, the room was fine, but I think it’s time for a refresh.Service was great!! Check-in/check-out, room service (food was good/very good), the Executive Lounge, the front door persons, the concierge desk, the gift shop, the maître d’s in the Cerise restaurant along with the wait-persons. It was all top-notch. Kudos to Simon and everyone else: friendly, helpful, personable; always trying to find a way to assist you or helping you solve a problem. In my case, I came to Japan without a tie! After exploring whether to leave hotel to find one, they opened the gift shop a bit earlier so I could select a tie. Worked out perfectly. Thank you.Other: The Executive Lounge is small, but that was OK. On this visit, it was never crowded. Service, of course, was just wonderful. Good array of different types of food along with excellent presentations. The gym was also small but had enough equipment (and not crowded) during the visit so it was fine. It was a great stay.

From the moment you arrive, all the way to your departure, every staff member treats their hotel guests like true VIPs.Service: This is truly where the Conrad shines. Our car pulled up to the Conrad at around midnight and we were instantly greeted by 3 extremely friendly staff members. All of them were wearing white gloves and assisted us with our luggage and escorted us to check-in. I was chatting with the woman who was assisting us with our luggage, and I told her how excited we were to be in Tokyo (being our first time) & I asked her some of her favorite places around town. She wished us a warm welcome & politely told me concierge can help with all recommendations & reservations. I later find a hand written note from this woman in our luggage, wishing my boyfriend and I a wonderful stay and how she was very sorry she couldn't assist with recommendations and wrote down to concierge number. The fact that the woman who helped us with our baggage was dedicated enough to write us a hand-written note really shows how every staff member goes above and beyond. After our 2nd or 3rd day, the staff members in the restaurant started to remember our names and greet us by our names every morning. After our 5th & final day, we were eating our last breakfast before check-out and the manager of the restaurant folded us an origami crane & presented it to us as a gesture of kindness to wish us safe travels on our next destination. The service at the Conrad was so spectacular, that when we checked into our next hotel (the Four Seasons Kyoto) we were disappointed the service was not as good, even though the Four Seasons was 3x the price of the Conrad. The Conrad truly exceeds the standard of service for all hotels in Japan.Rooms: We booked a Corner Room Suite and were blown away by the views, the spaciousness, and the luxurious finishes. I love interior design & this room was covered in stunning art, Macassar wood millwork, silk wallpaper, automated shades/drapes & beautiful marble in the bathrooms. Our favorite part of the room were the heated bathroom floors! If you love a good view from the shower/bathtub, definitely book the corner suite! Food: The breakfast buffet was absolutely incredible. They had different stations with Chinese, Japanese, Korean, American, & European breakfast options. In addition, the waiter gives you a menu for 1 additional complimentary entree (per person) prepared in the kitchen. The breakfast buffet served at the Conrad was far superior than the breakfast we had at the Four Seasons Kyoto. All in all, The Conrad Tokyo is a true hidden gem! Because of the incredible staff & service at this hotel, we had the best trip of our lives. We now plan on coming to Tokyo every year and plan on staying at the Conrad every time!

It is connected to the station underground, so you can walk inside if it is bad weather. It was a bit cold when we were there, so we were very glad to walk inside on the way to the subway station.The service was beyond our expectation. I emailed the concierge to ask for some help on restaurant reservations a few months ahead. I kept adding more restaurants and Emailed the concierge multiple times, and they were always very helpful and patient. They tracked when the reservations were open and followed up on time. They got us in for lots of hot restaurants. It saved us lots of hassle dealing with reservations from a different timezone. I mentioned to the concierge that we were here for our honeymoon beforehand. After we arrived there, we got upgraded to a better room, and the bed in the room was decorated with rose petals and a photo frame with some of our engagement photos. The hotel also sent over some free dessert as a gift.

Overlooking the historic Hamarikyu Garden as well as soaring skyscrapers, the 290-room hotel is minutes away from both Shiodome Station - a stop on the Yurikamome line which connects you to nearby Odaiba, the popular island entertainment destination in Tokyo Bay - as well as Shimbashi Station, which connects to JR and metro lines.CONRAD TOKYOThe hotel occupies the 28th to 37th floors of a skyscraper in Shiodome, with lead-in rooms starting at 48sqm (certainly spacious for a Japanese property). As you make your way towards the elevators which will bring you up to the hotel lobby, your olfactory senses will be immediately aroused by the arrestingly distinctive Bottega Veneta fragrance which permeates the ground floor lobby and sets the stage early for your upcoming experience of luxurious sophistication.The hotel houses five distinct dining concepts, costume jewelry boutique ABISTE, a fitness centre equipped with treadmills, weights and an aerobics studio, as well as an elegant and very inviting 25-metre heated indoor pool which holds infinite possibilities for meditative zen and tension-charged romance.Mizuki Spa offers Japanese-style treatments using local essential oils, with jacuzzi, steam room and sauna facilities available to all adult hotel guests. Unlike other Japanese properties, the hotel is not too fussed about guests having to partake in the traditional Japanese bathing ritual - think mandatory nudity, stool seating and wooden buckets - or be entirely naked whilst using the aquatic facilities. I shyly retired (in swimming shorts) into one of the four jacuzzi pods, which are partitioned from one another for greater privacy. It was quite a memorable, human hotpot-esque jacuzzi experience, with the formidable high-power jets feeling as though they were assaulting you from every direction.KING BAY SUITE CORNEROverlooking the green and orange mushroom-esque expanse of the Royal Hamarikyu Garden as well as the calm waters of Tokyo Bay through floor-to-ceiling windows, the 85sqm King Bay Suite Corner plays it all dignifiedly mature in its Japanese woodiness and motifs, neutral colours and lantern-inspired lighting. The living room features a work station, couch and dining table, while the pantry is equipped with a Nespresso machine, traditional tea-making facilities, a well-stocked minibar with various beverages and snacks as well as a predominantly whisky-centric spirit selection. A seasonal Conrad mascot bear awaits guests on the bed.The white tile-walled bathroom features double vanities with a large backlit mirror, an enclosed bathtub area which plays like something from the set of Saw 4, as well as a separate rainfall shower stall. Amenities are from Shanghai Tang, although complimentary facial products from French cosmetic and high-end treatment brand Omnisens are also available upon request via the Conrad Concierge on the Hilton Honors app. (Speaking of Conrad Concierge, I also ordered a diffuser with lavender essential oils via the app, which facilitated a very good night's sleep.)DININGBreakfast is served at Collage and Cerise, which exist as two distinct concepts within one large space after breakfast hours. The former is a modern fine French dining restaurant whilst the latter is the hotel's all-day casual dining concept, with guests having to pass through the latter to access the former. Whilst Cerise plays it more warm and orange in its vibes, the very brightly lit and Nordic-white Collage is decidedly more elegant in its countenance, being blessed with a wondrously high ceiling and floor-to-ceiling windows.The buffet spread covers the usual continental breakfast suspects, ranging from juices, pastries and Western breakfast to dim sum, congee, cooked snapper slices and fishcakes. There is also an a la carte menu available, with highlights including the Japanese-style Natto and Shiitake Mushroom Omelette with Bonito and Seaweed Sauce and Hokkaido Butter Milk Pancakes with Macadamia Cream.Kazahana is a modern Japanese concept offering specialty kaiseki and teppan menus whilst China Blue serves modern Cantonese cuisine, with both enjoying the same ceiling and window-blessed DNA as Collage and offering breathtaking views of Hamarikyu Garden and Tokyo Bay. Elsewhere, TwentyEight is the hotel's lobby lounge which is equally famed for both their afternoon tea as well as their live music-soundtracked libation experience.EXECUTIVE LOUNGELocated on the 37th floor, the decidedly Japanese-influenced Executive Lounge - think traditional pottery, bonzai plants and Japanese artwork - serves all-day refreshments as well as breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapes and cocktails. Whilst the lounge is bright and cheery in the day, the space is bathed in a warm and cosy glow once night falls, with a spell-binding rock fireplace taking centre stage (a similar one features at the entrance of TwentyEight).The evening canapes and cocktail presentation is very, very good. Instead of rehashing the same generic dishes on a rotational basis like some hotels do, the lounge instead showcases choice items from the hotel's different restaurant concepts, with the China Blue dishes leaving a strong impression. As per Conrad standards, the extensive alcohol selection is commendably reliable, with a spotlight on local whisky, plum wine and gin.I must take this opportunity to compliment the excellent service I experienced. During breakfast at Collage on the second day of my stay, I was presented with a purple origami swan which seemed to be an identifier for Hilton Honors Diamond members, as I then started receiving very personalized attention, with the very warm and well-spoken restaurant manager going as far as to escort me to the elevator whilst I was on my way out.I had seen a Halloween edition Conrad Tokyo mascot bear on Instagram, and during the check-out process at the Executive Lounge, I shared how it would have made an awesome collectable. The manager on duty actually offered to go down to the front desk to retrieve one of their remaining Halloween bears in stock for me as a goodbye gift. (He wasn't Japanese.) It was an excellent showing of the high standard of hospitality and service that I have come to associate with the Conrad brand, and I was very impressed.CONCLUDING THOUGHTSConrad Tokyo is known to be one of the more pricey properties in Tokyo, but this experience clarifies that this is with good reason. The high dining standards, commendable facilities, convenient location and impressive service makes the hotel highly recommended.The original version of this review, complete with pictures, is available at Secret Life of Fatbacks, my personal website.","Singapore, Singapore",215,5.0

That was big enough for the kids to even play some hide/seek in the room :)My kids couldn't get enough of the wonderful breakfast spread, they missed the pancakes and french toast most.Compliments to Ms Aisha at the front desk for checking up on us over the few days we were there and giving recommendation on places to go to with the kids. The kids simply adored her and is asking when we can go back to stay at the hotel again (even without the breakfast).Location wise - it was a short 7mins walk to the JR line where we took the train to Tokyo/Ueno (yamanote line) for our shinkansen transfer to Gala Yuzawa and Karuizawa. We would recommend getting the Tokyo All Wide Pass for 3 days as it covers the Shinkansen ride as well as the local JR lines.From the skybridge linking the hotel to Ginza, we took a 8 mins walk to Donki store and also the Ginza Toy Park. We spent an afternoon shopping / lunch at Ginza before taking a nice stroll back. Around the hotel, there are many food options.

From the time we arrived at 7 am after our flight from Australia and receiving an unexpected early check-in ( the guy to our left did not receive one so it was lucky or random or the fact we had four nights booked) from dealing with the credit card that our taxi driver retained after a mixup at the airport. The taxi driver was fantastic and took our card back at which point the Conrad staff witnessed the cutting of the card and let me know by email - no phone calls and no fuss. Two staff members stood out amongst the wonderful crew- Aisha and a woman in a similar role who helped us a few times but we didn’t catch her name. Aisha hugged my wife after we identified sharing middle eastern backgrounds. Twice she walked with us and waited until we were picked up by a taxi or escorted us in the elevator downstairs and out the door and showed us exactly where to go. We also availed ourselves of the spa showers after we checked out and before we left for the airport for our 10pm flight. The bar is exquisite and the view fantastic . Again the service was phenomenal , just like the staff at the pool and the spa who couldn’t smile enough or get you another towel or literally whatever you seemed to need. Cheap it was not but as long as you understand that ahead of time it was not just acceptable but still seemed to represent value for money in the way they treated you. We have stayed in countless hotels for fun over the years and multiples of that on business but this was right up there with the best client service we have received led by Aisha and her colleagues. We still don’t know why the young guy in reception was able to find a room for us at 7am but we were bloody happy about it. Try and find a good rate somewhere and then sit back and let the service wash over you.","Sydney, Australia",12,5.0

It was difficult to choose a hotel in Tokyo as there were many choices. We finally selected Conrad Tokyo due to our Hilton Points. We also stayed at the Westin Tokyo using our SPG points but was not as impressed.We loved the sleek and modern design of the Conrad lobby, located on the 27th floor. It is a great place to watch the sunrise across the bay. The rooms are equally chic, exuding a sense of quiet luxury. The bathrooms are the state of the art. As Hilton Gold Members, we enjoyed a wonderful Buffet Breakfast with an elaborate spread of both Eastern and Western cuisine. The Truffle Egg Benedict was to die for! The Club Lounge had a spectacular view and some afternoon snacks.The best part of our stay was the warm hospitality extended by the staff.

After a quick trip from Haneda to Shimbashi station it was a short walk to the hotel. As a Hilton Hhonors Diamond member I checked in at the Executive lounge on the 37th floor. It was a busy time to check in so I had to wait around half an hour to check in but was able to have afternoon tea in the lounge. The Execuitve lounge manager ( who was excellent) them came round and completed the checkin process and thanked me for waiting. He offered to upgrade me to a suite the following day for my last 2 nights which I accepted.The intial room was on the 30th floor and over looked the Bay but the views of the garden were blocked on this floor due to the step in the building ( you had a view of the crane used to wash the windows of the lower floors but this is not an issue on the higher floors) The room is luxurious with wonderful furnishings and blinds and shades able to be controlled from the bedside. The bath is huge and the shower was great.I loved the Japanese toilet!The fitness centre and pool were excellent.The next day I asked the bell desk to look after my cases whilst I explored Tokyo then when I came back at 3pm my suite was ready with the cases brought in. The suite is wonderful with a tv over the bath and a separate living room. On the 33rd floor there was great views of the gardens.The Executive lounge was excellent with a great range of breakfast food ( including made to order omellettes ) afternoon tea and evening snacks.The hotel is beside the Carretta Shiodome which had a wonderful Winter illumination show and the Ghibli clock. The monorail to Odaiba is just outside the hotel entrance and the odeo line is beside the hotel also as well as Shimbashi station.I took a taxi to Hamamatsucho station (Y570) for the monorail to Haneda airport ( Y490 and about 15mins for the express monorail to the International terminal)All the staff were excellent and friendly especially the Executive lounge staff and notably the manager who welcomed me by name whenever I came into the lounge and made you feel welcomed and valued.Overall a great stay with great service from the staff,Falkirk,87,5.0

From the outset, this was superb. Even though we were not fee paying customers, we were upgraded to a large room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the park, a welcome gift (including some tasty treats and a rubber duck in the bathroom) and lounge access. We used the lounge for a light dinner, notable here was the friendly service (which was present throughout) especially towards our two small children. Some hotels refuse to let children into the lounge in the evening, we really appreciated that they were made to feel so welcome. This sentiment applied to our whole trip, including check-out when they were offered juice or water (in Hello Kitty shaped water bottles) to take away. These small, classy, gestures, made us feel valued and appreciated. When traveling with a young family, how your children are treated - and the way in which the hotel staff interact with them, as well as you - makes all the difference. Children under three/four cannot use the pool however, even if it's empty. The pool, however, 20+ floors up (the lobby is on floor 26 or so) is beautiful, with a great view over the city. Note that children also cannot access the changing rooms of the opposite gender. So I had to leave my daughter with the pool staff while I got changed, and then had to change her in the toilet. Not ideal, but not the end of the world either. The main thing is we were able to use the pool, and everyone was very helpful to find a work around.There's several options for breakfast. We ate at the main restaurant downstairs. The food choice - from homemade energy bars - to ala carte options (you could pick one, I'd recommend the french toast, the frittata and also the salmon benedict) were superb. Everywhere you turn - both in the restaurant and the hotel as a whole - there's staff on hand to help. No request is too small. Every query is dealt with promptly and in a friendly manner. The quality of english spoken by the staff (in contrast to some hotels in the region, especially outside of the large cities) was exemplary. In short, we wish we could have stayed longer!

Plus when we stayed in September there was construction outside that made a wrong exit more of a hassle than it should have been. We stayed here using AmerExpress FHR program and were upgraded to a beautiful spacious suite overlooking the water upon check-in. Every day we had a delicious breakfast plus a property credit.

During that time, it has been consistently outstanding - the hotel itself is beautiful and modern but what really sets it apart is it’s people.In particular, I want to single out two people - Sarah who I guess is part of the concierge/welcome team - from the moment we arrived she remembered our names, greeted us warmly and helped us with several bookings and suggestions - thank you Sarah.The second person is Angelo - wherever I looked, Angelo was there to help - at breakfast - at the lobby bar - there to sort out a meeting room - it feels like he more or less runs the place and he does a great job.If I may, the one thing that was terrible was that they closed off the lobby bar for a private function, meaning that the dozens of people who use that for business meetings had nowhere to go - that needs to stop and stop right away as that is not acceptable in a hotel of this stature.","Sydney, Australia",52,5.0

Conveniently located, walking distance to Ginza and Hibiya, but also in business district and access to many metro lines and trains from Shimbashi. Hotel is very high-end, with service (and prices) as you would expect.Arrived early, but was able to use the gym before room was made available at 12pm. Rooms are very well appointed, walk in shower, roll-top freestanding bath, and very comfortable beds. No desks, but dining table with super comfortable chair - and chaise long running whole length of the floor to ceiling windows.Service is impeccable - I left my tablet in room in last stay, they kept it for me for next time (3 months later) and I didn't even ask for it - was left in my room with a note on the table thanking me for coming back. You get a Conrad collectable teddy with turn-down service, and lots of free water in the room replenished regularly.Gym is by far one of the best in a hotel I have seen - huge range of cardio and weights, going up to 50kg dumbells, and a smith machine - plus swimming pool. Personally not keen on the pool, but good views from floor 29! The changing areas have single-sex sauna, baths and steam rooms (Japanese style) and lots of free amenities.Breakfast is good - choice of a la carte, or wide buffet. Service can occasionally be slow (cappucino seems to take ages) but food is great.The lobby bar is super popular with afternoon teas, etc (especially on a holiday day) and isn't that geared to business travellers - it's also very expensive, as you probably expect, but £9 for a beer is a little steep! The caesar salad is nice though.Overall, great place to stay and get why it's so highly rated - will definitely be back.","Kettering, United Kingdom",61,5.0

About a week before I departed, friends who had been to Tokyo before advised us that you needed dinner reservations if you wanted to get into good restaurants, you wouldn't be able to just walk in the same day. As luck would have it, staff from the Executive Lounge wrote that same day and asked if I needed anything before arrival. I asked about restaurant recommendations, and they sent a seven page guide full of suggestions. They were then extremely helpful making all the reservations, and even clarifying some of our requests and preferences. We ate extremely well all week and it had a huge impact on the visit, the food was just outstanding. All of the staff in the hotel, from the minute we arrived until we left were incredible.

I stayed in an executive room with lounge access. Amica and the team in the lounge are warm and friendly and will look after all your needs. The afternoon tea and evening canapés were very good. It was nice to see Japanese spirits available as well, gin, whisky and plum liqueur.The room is large and extremely comfortable. I enjoyed a long soak in the tub after a day shopping in Ginza. The window seats are a comfortable place to relax and watch Tokyo from above. I didn't have time to use the pool and spa facilities, but they looked wonderful. For breakfast I was encouraged to use the restaurant downstairs as there would be more options available. I took this advice, but returned to the lounge to relax with a cup of tea. The restaurant was very busy, I found the lounge more relaxing and thought that the same range of food was available, including the menu items. So if staying again I would just eat in the lounge.The only discordant note of my stay related to the behaviour of another guest in the lounge. He conducted a very loud and aggressive business call on his mobile phone. This was very disruptive to everyone in the lounge and he should have been directed to make this call elsewhere. I appreciated being able to use the lounge facilities until 6pm before leaving for the airport. I hope to stay at the Conrad again in the future.","Newcastle, Australia",68,5.0

At first I was nervous arriving at this hotel, as it was one of the best hotels in Tokyo and maybe even Japan itself. I stayed at other Japanese hotels but this was next level to be totally honest. The hotel and its amenities are already top notch and the regular rooms are big by themselves. The glass window between the bathroom and the bedroom makes it even bigger. The automated blinds opens up to a beautiful view of the harbor. The view is just amazing at night. The Conrad Bears are a nice touch by the staff to the guests as well as the rubber Conrad ducks. The views from all the restaurants are exceptional as the main lobby level sits on the 28th floor. But what separates hotels apart are the staff. They are the ones that take time to get to know the guests. With that being said, I want to acknowledge the following: Ken (front office) for being welcoming and putting my mind at ease as the hotel was intimidating being so classy when I arrived; Fukiko (Concierge) for going up and above to get me a ticket to a last minute event (truly felt bad for making you work hard but thank you sooo much); Aisha and Nodoka (Front Office) for checking on me to make sure I needed any assistance and to make sure everything is well and lastly to Sarah (Front Office) for making me feel at home here as well as going beyond my expectations. You definitely made my stay here. Also, to the breakfast staff at Cerise. You guys are amazing and always on top of things. Great breakfast period!

They upgraded us with the Tokyo Bay view and offered us the access to the executive lounge. And as gold/diamond member, the hotel offered free breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet was amazing. It offered a lot of varieties to choose from.

We'd read great things about the Conrad Tokyo, and we certainly weren't disappointed.Even before we stayed, we emailed the Conrad concierge to book lunch reservations at Kyubey. No problem at all, and we were all set days before our arrival.We were early for our reservation, but the process to drop off our luggage at the ground floor couldn't have been more smooth. After a few hours, we checked in and were shown to our room, which was very spacious and had a stunning view of Tokyo Bay.The hotel itself is a stone's throw from Shiodome Station, where we hopped on the Yurikamome Line for a quick trip to Odaiba. If you'd rather walk around the area, it's very easy to do so. In about 15 minutes you're in Ginza, but not before a stop at the Don Quijote that's on the way.On our second day there we spent a sunny, peaceful Sunday across the Conrad at Hamarikyu Gardens, where we saw families and couples enjoying a late Spring day in an oasis in the city.The two days flew by in a flash, and we honestly can't wait to return to Japan - and the Conrad Tokyo - in the future.","Denver, Colorado",1,5.0

The Executive Lounge has terrific food if you have access, including homemade ice cream and gourmet tea sandwiches.Breakfast at the restaurant was really nice - the buffet is expansive and has delicious options. You can also order off the menu.The staff throughout the hotel are professional, gracious, and effective. The concierges in particular were very helpful on our last visit.If you like whisky, a huge bonus is that the hotel is quite close (via a walkway) to THE SOCIETY bar (a SMWS Partner Bar) in the PARK HOTEL TOKYO.The one downside to this hotel is that while it is in central Tokyo, it is in a complex of towers and it’s not really possible to just walk out the door and explore the neighborhood. So be prepared to use taxis, Uber, or easily learn how to navigate the underground train system, as the closest stop is a short walk from the hotel.

But the over the top wow moment is when we walked into our room, all we kept saying is wow and holy moly! Waking up in the morning to the massive shade opening with the turn of a knob next to the bed is exceptionally wonderful. Everything about the room was perfect and so immaculately clean. And the staff everywhere are so helpful and friendly, always smiling and asking us how we’re enjoying our stay.

Omotenashi is a japanese expression for act of providing detailed service in any ways to allow guests to spend a relaxing and memorable time by putting customers first. That is how we felt the day we stepped into the hotel until the day we left. The first feeling you entered the building is Zen. You are greeted with this big indoor tree which perfectly positioned before turning left to the lifts. Flights with Qantas from Sydney arrived at Haneda 5am in the morning. We asked for early checkin but we were told it’s too early and they could only charge us early arrival rate around ¥7000 yen which we agreed. We were told we could have breakfast with this early check in rate. Breakfast in the lounge was great but we found the breakfast on level 28 gave us more variety. Especially with a toddler.Executive lounge afternoon drinks session offers quality bite sized h'ordeuvres. Quality over quantity is the motto here. Great selection alcoholic beverages although I expected they serve Champagne but a good quality French sparkling instead. Umeshu, Sake and Japanese Whiskey are also available.Gym & Swimming Pool: We did not experience this because they have rules only kids over 4 years old are allowed in the pool. I guess this is for hygiene reason.Cons: Extra ¥300 (before tax) for A la carte Japanese Bento breakfast is probably nothing and earn nothing for the hotel. With a premium hotel rate, why would you charge ¥300 and make it inconvenience for guests? But I still recommend you to try it. It’s worth more than your ¥300 yenSpecial thanks to Aisha (CRM) who looked after us and always check everything is ok with us. Thank you also for the eye masks.

Room 3632 and 3630. The rooms are quite phenomenal, with beautiful bathrooms and quite a bit of space. Of course the views are really great. Check in was really great as well, with the host providing a cute Shinkansen water bottle for my toddler and some really great suggestions for some of the shopping items we wanted to purchase as gifts. She even went above and beyond to make suggestions for some more reasonably priced items than what Mitsukoshi and Matsuya would offer. She even called the store to ensure that they had the items that we were looking for and their hours. My parents enjoyed the snacks provided at the exec lounge while we checked in.Of course they had the cute Conrad bears and rubber ducks that my toddler enjoyed, and provided a very nice welcome amenity and card for my wife, whose birthday we were celebrating.We also took advantage of the breakfast down in the lobby, which was of very high quality. Selection is not as great as the Hilton Tokyo, but quality was good. One point is that I would have wished for a better variety of fruit. We didn't get a chance to eat breakfast in the executive lounge, so I can't comment on that one. Also, one thing that we all noted is that the sheets at this particular Conrad are amazing.

We normally stay at this property at least once year, and have been doing so for many years. We were so disappointed with this stay, we don’t know how such a perfect Conrad has deteriorated in 2 years and the Omotenashi (Spirit of selfless hospitality) has disappeared. It all started when we walked into the Exec lounge to check in, and we were met with a stiff smile. After the obligatory, corporate greeting, I was offered a paid upgrade to the KING DLX SUITE BAY VIEW which we reluctantly declined. We stayed in this one before and its nice but for our family, no real benefit for the price. Upon declining we were then told that because I have 3 children they wanted to charge me for at least one, even though I had sent the property the total family count at the time of my booking. Clearly, they wanted to salvage more revenue. Eventually some common sense prevailed and additional charges were waved.The whole thing left a sour taste. Breakfast (2/5): The breakfast is probably the most underwhelming buffet, this is not the Conrad it used to be more akin to a cafeteria targeted to large tour groups and not the truly inspiring place it used to be. The menu is now what you would expect from a Standard Hilton or Garden Inn. And I'm not talking about the one in the lounge. I'm talking about the main breakfast on the 28th floor. It seems the Old Super Crew that gleamed Omotenashi from years ago have moved on and now they decided to get people disinterested in what they do bar one or two.Another issue is when we asked to sit near the large windows with the view of the city, they tell you that it is full. The tip is to say you will wait for a free table and Surprise Surprise, in 30 seconds one becomes free. If you were in a large tour group or are wearing a Suit, you seem to be offered a table there. Service was slow and they forgot to order menu dishes. They did make efforts to rectify this mistake but only after 30 minutes upon me enquiring about it. You have to ask for coffee when you are seated, if you’re lucky you’ll get one at the start of your meal. Gone are the days when the first thing they offered was a cup of coffee (or tea) and would come around to offer you a top up with hot coffee. Sloppy for a 5 star hotel. Lounge (1/5): The Lounge happy hour food or lack there of, is the worst we have ever had while traveling in Asia. Service in the lounge was terrible. It seemed that service was better for you if you were from a large tour group if you know what I mean - which is odd because my experience has actually been the opposite in Asia. Both scenarios are wrong, you should treat all of your guests the same, especially in the lounge. By the end of my stay the workers in the lounge just rubbed us the wrong way. The lounge over the years was “Meh” but now it’s just a crap space with sour staff that struggle to smile.Location (5/5)In the heart of Shiodome overlooking the Hamarikyu gardens. The pros of the location is that it is relatively close to Tsukiji, Ginza, Shimbashi and Shiodome Metro and Yurikamome (Monorail). It is walking distance to Ginza (10 minutes) and to Shimbashi station (10 minutes). Rooms (5/5)Great rooms. The standard room size is large which, for a place like Tokyo is quite remarkable. The wooden panelling and extra high ceilings (3m) were nice touches. Bed was very comfortable and I had no complaints about sleep quality. Bathroom was clean and large sized. We also didn't have any smoke issues that some other guests stated they had.Tip: The Corner Bayview King Suite is a narrow shoebox, the standard Bay Suite is cheaper and, has a more functional layout. I unfortunately paid the premium for the Corner Suite but ended up asking to be moved to a standard King Suite (no refunds offered of course).Coffee (0/5)Coffee in the rooms are now crappy Nespresso machines you find in any 3 star Hotel, not the amazing French Press they used to have in each room. You now have 3 choices for crappy Coffee: Room, Exec Lounge or Breakfast. The coffee you used to be the best is Tokyo, now just like any standard hotel like the Hilton or Garden innPrice/Value (1/5)The price is always going to be steep with luxury hotels. My advice is that if you're wanting to stay here and price is an issue, wait for the Hilton sales which offer 50% off twice a year.SummeryThe overall service was a hit and miss. Since Conrad Tokyo has morphed into a Hilton anyway, you might as well stay at the Hilton in Shinjuku. The Conrad is a Luxury hotel with great rooms. However, a lot of work is needed to bring it up to the standard it had for many years. What makes a Conrad a ‘Conrad’ is its intimacy and attention to detail. Conrad Tokyo needs to reflect on what it means to be different from a Hilton, and stay true to the Conrad values. If they were to be true to the Conrad brand and provide its guests with a Conrad experience, they need to reflect on how they treat their guests from the moment a guest walks into the property till the time they check out. The old Conrad Tokyo lived and breathed the Japanese value of ‘Omotenashi’ and “Kizukai”- both of which seem to have been lost. Its hard to get inspired let alone stay inspired when you feel like you in sausage factory churning hundreds of people.We had a below average experience here want the Conrad we remember back. If management has changed please spend time at your sister property in Osaka as it possesses the ‘Omotenashi’ and ‘Kizukai’ in its pure form. Old Super Crew that gleamed Omotenashi Conrad Tokyo have retained some truly amazing people and I felt like I must mention them as they are a 10 out of 5. If I consider to give this property another chance it would be because of these individuals who totally possess Omotenashi and are true brand AmbassadorsNot listed in any particular order:Aisha NamaiNunzio L’OlivaYuka Kuramasu","Singapore, Singapore",25,2.0

Even amongst our family members we disagree on this point. What is good: 1. Great Location near Shimbashi Station with sweeping views of Tokyo Harbor and the city. If you bought an unlimited JR pass you need not spend another yen for local transport as Shimbashi connects you to all the major JR lines that takes you all over Tokyo and beyond.2. Great, efficient service. Seems like the whole staff is fluent in English with some having lived in USA. 3. Clean rooms with modern interior designs.What could have been better: Bar was set very high by Palace Hotel Tokyo near Imperial Palace. Possible disclaimer... We stayed at the Palace Hotel 2 years ago shortly after it went through a total renovation. Not sure what the conditions are today.1. Physical...Furniture and wallpaper had some scuff marks and small nicks. Bathroom needs to be updated. The toilet was not new or fully automatic. Still had to manually flush....seems funny to write, but if you have used the most up to date and modern Japanese toilet, you'll know what I mean. The one in the room is like the hotel installed a bidet seat on top of an old toilet instead of upgrading the whole unit.2. In room Coffee/tea service is functional, but nothing specialIn summary, Conrad is great for business travelers and strategically located.

The location is linked underground to two major metro stops, so it is convenient to explore the city. Yes, it is not as close to the touristy areas like Shinjuku, but those are easily reached. The hotel itself is beautiful. It’s the top floors of the Soft Bank building, and the lobby area is very impressive.

I know I am a tough critic, but what I experienced from this hotel defied belief. I generally do not believe poor treatment is based on anything but poor service, but my experience at the Conrad Tokyo makes me question whether other factors were at play, race, physical size, nationality, unconscious bias. Who knows, who will ever know. What I do know is that this was one of the worst service experiences I have had at any major luxury hotel. I don't mean those hotels that have a reputation for poor service, but what I mean is those hotels that consistently have high marks. First, the good - the rooms and hotel are magnificent. I was blown away at the nice facilities and the room I was given was in outstanding condition - absolutely no complaints about the room or hotel physical plant whatsoever. My issues were more around service and professionalism:1. As a Diamond, I received no upgrade at all. The hotel was not full and to provide no upgrade was outrageous. 2. To add insult to injury, the front desk agent did say to me, because you are Diamond, we upgraded you to a high floor King City View Room. I had booked the city view room and not sure what she meant by high floor, since all rooms start on the 28 floor and only go up a few more floors. I guess instead of putting me on the 29 floor, they put me up one floor higher. I think it was the fact that she though I, and presumbaly other guest were stupid and would fall for such an insane line - we upgrade you one floor. 3. Suites were available and I should have been upgraded.4. I was ignored completely in the club lounge. No one came to my table, no one offered me a drink, coffee, nothing. No one asked for my room number, no one said hello, goodbye, do you need anything. I was simply ignored. I note that the other more ""local"" guests were fawned over. 5. At check-in the bellman took my luggage, put it on a cart and placed the big cart to the side of me while I checked in. He then left. He never came back and it was only after three calls and 1 hour that I finally got my bags. They were brought to me by the front desk clerk, the generous upgrader one. No explanation, and she could not lift the bags or otherwise place them in the room. I had to do that myself. I assume the bellman may have had other more important guest to assist. 6. When I called to have my room cleaned, I was told it would take several hours and did I just want them to leave fresh towels if I did not want to wait. Not acceptable. 7. A request to change the soap and for other items, such as ice, took hours or were ignored completely. Not acceptable. 8. Room service quality and options are very limited and food quality is not good. Food arrived cold and the order on two occasions was wrong. Not acceptable. 9. When I called for bellman assistance as I had a car waiting to take me to the airport (I used a 50% off Blacklane offer - very good deal), I was told it may take 30 minutes or longer for the bellman to come up. Not acceptable. 10. I told them I could not wait 30 minutes and took the luggage myself. I was meet with an empty front desk, no guest at the desks by at least 8 agents standing doing nothing - and when I got down to the lobby, at least 10 doorman, bellman were standing doing (what appeared to be) nothing. Not acceptable.11. When I told the doorman I had a car waiting, we asked me my name and then said was I sure the care was for me and was that really my name (perhaps a language issue ?? - hey it happens). My assessment of my stay at this hotel = NOT ACCEPTABLE.","Arlington, Virginia",145,2.0

I communicated early check in via phone app but that message wasn't read until after I already checked in. Despite of 3 hours early check in, front desk willing accommodated my arrival and they were very friendly. He asked if I needed extension cords or adapters. I couldn't understand why he asked but after I got settled in my room, I learned why he offered extension cords. There were no USB or any electronic outlets by the bed. I found a few outlets by the table but not close enough if you want to use that table to work on your laptop. Perhaps it was only a junior suite room design but it wasn't really a business traveler friendly. Junior suite was very roomy and I really liked their bathroom. Double sinks and plenty of room.Breakfast was just average. Unlike Shinjyuku Hilton, they don't serve champagne at the executive lounge. I decided to eat at the lobby level restaurant as the executive staff said they have more options down there. When we took an elevator to go down, they weren't communicated that we were coming down. Staff knew we were coming right away, she could have notified of our arrival via phone to make it smooth once we got down there. Restaurant did sell champagne for breakfast at 1,500 yen and it was quite good. I highly recommend trying their champagne for breakfast. Food choice.... it wasn't that much. Lacking healthy options. I would have liked more fruits, brown rice and organic cooked vegetables. Pool is a good place to relax. I liked their big window, get to see the downtown Tokyo skylines. Changing room has shower, steam room and individual jacuzzi. Service here was excellent.If you are interested in running, I suggest run towards the imperial palace and do the loop. It was 12-13km including the loop from this hotel, and the imperial palace is a very good place to run.Despite of small minor mishaps, my stay here was comfortable.

Check in - Yukiko from Front Desk was helpful & friendly - She helped store our bags first as our room was not ready. As a Hilton Honors member I did a digital check in & chose my own room. Yukiko gave me another room so when I asked about my chosen room she apologized for not informing me earlier that it was not ready yet but gave another room on higher floor instead. Room - Room was impeccable. Extremely clean & large for Japanese standards. King sized bed was comfortable & additional pillows requested via digital check in were all laid out neatly on bed. We got a city view room so only saw office buildings all around but lucky enough to get a view of Tokyo Skytree albeit far away. My daughter loved the Conrad bears & rubber duck in bath tub - So thoughtful of Conrad to cater to children too Facilities - Pool was great. Divided into 2 sections one for play & other for swim. However it was very crowded on a Sunday so if you are looking to just play in water it is ok but not for serious swimming. There is also a sauna & Jacuzzi inside locker rooms. Plus iced tea & water which was a great touch to small details. Breakfast - On 29th floor at Cerise with city view of office buildings. Good spread of variety but personally I felt Hilton ( Conrad is also under Hilton brand ) is better as it has an egg station ( choose your own kind of eggs with toppings ) & greater cheese variety. Also at Conrad some of the food did not have display tags / signs stating clearly ingredients used which could be dangerous for those with allergies. Service was good overall but I felt puzzled as to why staff took initiative to keep refilling tea cup of a white female foreigner next to me. But they did not come to me to refill my cup & I had to ask them on 2 occasions to do so. All in all it was a fantastic stay & I am looking forward to my next Conrad experience.,"Tokyo, Japan",5,4.0

The stress-free travel was elevated during my stay at the Conrad, which exceeded my expectations. The quality and standard of service delivered by the Conrad's staff is nothing short of excellent. They are personal, professional, and informative. I was greeted by the porter who helped me with my bags and immediately called me by my last name. He whisked me up to the main lobby to check-in, where the personalised service continued. The concierge was brilliant and helpful in helping me structure an itinerary that helped me maximise the sites that I could see during my short stay. She went out of her way to coordinate a trip to Kyoto and had all of the details ready for me. This level of attention is brilliant, and is an example of what makes the Conrad different from other hotels.The business lounge happy hour offered friendly staff who remembered me. They offered excellent sparkling wine, and a tasteful choice if red and white wines. The food was excellent, healthy, and offered a diversity of choices that ranged from Japanese to charcuterie, and fruit and cheeses. My room was perfectly appointed: modern, clean, spacious.

But one place you must try is Sushi Dai. OMG, with the price you pay it’s a steal. We tried jiro and I have to say it’s comparable to the same level. It is very close to the hotel too, so it’s a must try for you. My personal recommendation will be go there around 3am on your first day.

This was our last night in Japan after 2 weeks and we are SO happy we decided to stay at The Conrad! We were immediately warmly welcomed with water (a Hello Kitty shaped bottle for our daughter and a bullet train bottle for our son - super nice touch) and told that our luggage we had previously sent was already in our room. Our daughter's excitement about the hotel increased immensely by teddy bears on the beds! We reserved a suite on the executive level. It exceeded our expectations! layout of the room with a sofa and a powder room in the TV area with a connecting large closet to a spacious bathroom was just what we needed. The beds are large enough so my daughter and I comfortably shared a bed with our son on the sofa and my husband stretching out in the other bed. My husband and I had hoped to make dinner at the French restaurant at the hotel but it closed at 9pm (we didn't arrive at the hotel until 8pm) so the 4 of us headed to the lobby bar for dinner. We were seated to a great table with stunning views of the city. The service was top notch and we were very happy to see a wine list with depth. (For some reason it is very difficult to find pinot noir and pinot gris/grigio in Japan). My husband was also happy to see the Suntory whisky he had hoped to purchase (and tasted) at the Suntory Distillery on the list as well. While most of the hotel guests seemed to be adults, our children loved The Conrad (said it even beat their previous favorite of The Waldorf in Chicago) and asked that we stay here longer the next time we are in Tokyo...which we hope to do!","New Orleans, United States",11,5.0

A group of friends and I (mixed couples and singles, total 10 of us) stayed in the Conrad in May. In general because of our many experiences of Japan, we order some items including Sumo tickets to be delivered to the hotel for our trip. Unfortunately upon arrival, having received all our other parcels, we could not find the tickets. We checked with the front desk and was advised that the envelope was delivered at the same time when our friends' luggage was delivered, without informing anyone. Due this is unfortunate event, it caused a fair amount of grief. To cut the VERY long story short, because we were heading out to Hakone and would only require the tickets upon our return to Tokyo. We left the issue with the hotel to be resolved. Nothing was heard from them until I emailed them about it, when we were about to return to Tokyo. They claimed they did their investigation, but agreed to replace our tickets (thankfully).I guess my issue is, I had to follow up with them about it, and that showed a lack of initiative on resolving the issue to me.On a separate matter, my friends and I shared a twin room with an extra bed. When I entered the room, the extra bed was placed in the middle of the room blocking both the pathways of other beds in the room.The reason why I brought up the 2nd matter, is because it surprised me the sloppiness of the Conrad, what more the Conrad in Japan.The good news is I was informed that the day after we reported the our loss, the front desk changed their process (of many years) to hold the envelopes for the guest and to be handed over during their check in. Kudos to them, and glad guest going forward will gain from our experience.In all, the front desk manager handed the issue resolution to Ms Hasegawa, who I must say worked very hard to resolve the matter.Lastly, I would like to commend the concierge / person who helped us load our MANY luggages, and noticed that I had a cut on my finger and gave me a plaster. That reminded me of how attentive the Japanese can be, and it was a real bonus given the overall experience.","Pulau Ubin, Singapore",64,3.0

Comfortable bed, clean, spacious, quiet room with electrically controlled blinds. I would be happy with just the room but the staff really puts this hotel at the top of the list. I requested reservations at a very difficult to get restaurant (Sawada - well worth the 2 michelin stars!). The concierge initially declined since other guests complained about the ridgid cancellation policy. They quickly reversed this decision when I mentioned it was my birthday and that I am willing to sign an agreement I would not cancel. All my requested restaurant reservations were made by the staff. When I arrived, I was given a packet with information about the reservations and detailed photos of how to find the places. I would have gotten lost without it, since they were all tucked away several floors above street level on side streets. I was also sweating quite a lot when I arrived since it was a hot day. The check in staff gave me a bottle of water without me asking before processing the check in. The friendly staff also chatted with us about our trip and wished me a happy birthday. I was already really happy that the concierge made sure to note this in my booking. When I arrived in our room, I was surprised with a card, the bears had little happy birthday tags, and an extremely delicious and large chocolate cake was sent to our room. This thoughtful service puts this hotel at the top of my list, I am looking forward to staying here again the next time I visit Tokyo.",linuxninja,6,5.0

Even though I was not upgraded at check in (given Hilton gold status) the twin suite city view was fantastic, spacious, and comfortable. Tokyo in this season can be very busy and crowded, yet the hotel is cosmopolitan and hip without being overcrowded. The hotel’s staff are truly great. I’d like to point out Nunzio, who at breakfast every morning would greet us and was really fantastic. The breakfasts at the Conrad are splendid, and are free for Hilton golds (not something available at SPG properties). Also, the hotel has some very expensive restaurants but also some more moderately priced ones as well. Another thing I liked was the pool and fitness center. The pool had great views and was quiet and relaxing, and the gym was also good. The hotel’s decor all around is swanky and chic but also understated and elegant, it has a good location, and also has phenomenal views of hamarikyu gardens and the bay. One thing I was disappointed by was the concierge. While the staff were lovely, they lacked the insider tips and advice I was hoping to receive and ended up having to do much of the legwork for our stay in Tokyo by myself. The staff had difficulty recommending and securing restaurant recommendations, and overall seemed not to know as much about Tokyo as one would hope (from a hotel of this caliber).That said, I can’t recommend the hotel enough, as it is a top notch property I will be sure to return to during my next trip to Tokyo!",,4,5.0

We had a corner king bay suite with views over Tokyo Bay and Hamarikyu Gardens out towards Odori Island. We spent two amazing nights here and found ourselves mesmerised watching the city and bay change as the sun went down. Not to mention, this room type is the only one in the hotel where the bathroom has unimpeded views so you can watch the city while you shower or enjoy it from every other room where there are floor to ceiling windows. The buffet breakfast on offer is one of the best I've encountered anywhere in the world, and the in-room dining experience is superb. Staff speak English extremely well and go above and beyond to make sure your stay is nothing short of perfect. Couldn't help but love the extra little touches as well like the Conrad rubber duck in the bath and the Conrad teddy bears on the pillows. We picked up a sale that made the Conrad cheaper than the nearby Hilton hotel. If you don't stay in a luxury hotel often, definitely consider treating yourself here, it's worth it, even if only for one or two nights. In terms of public transport it is extremely convenient with direct access to both the subway and monorail directly outside. It's also only a couple of blocks to the nearest JR station, most of which can be walked in covered walkways, so it is very easy to travel around the city from here.","Lake Macquarie, Australia",12,5.0

It wasn't the best view however I usually don't go for views. If that's your thing I'm sure you can request a room overlooking Tokyo harbour (?).Small things count for a lot at the Conrad for example:- there is an aroma diffuser throughout the hotel, so it's always smelling very nice;- ceilings are very high, especially in the lobby so there's this grand feel about the hotel;- shuttle bus service to and from the airport takes the hassle out of travelling to Narita Airport (cost is ~¥3,100);- newspapers can be delivered to your room in the morning;- all the staff are very well trained and serve you well and speak good English;The best part of the hotel for me however is the Sento / spa / gym /pool on level 29. This is free for guests so if you think about how much you'd have to pay outside for this kind of service then you actually save about USD$20 per day.The only thing is for all this you're going to have to pay up for it.

She is a huge fan of all things Snoopy and I had contacted the concierge prior to our visit about arranging something special. When we arrived we were upgraded to an executive level room and shortly after the concierge (whose name I regretfully can’t remember) delivered a cake to the room, along with a plush Snoopy, Snoopy handtowel and Snoopy card. She was very happy and surprised about this and I applaud the Conrad team for coming through in a big way. Really wish I could remember the woman’s name so I could single her out for praise. The room was very nice, though I have to say the bed was harder than I would’ve liked, though I slept fairly well. The electric blinds are a nice touch and the city view from our 36th floor room was pretty cool. The bathroom was well appointed with a particular highlight being the rain head shower nozzle. We also enjoyed the evening drinks in the executive lounge, especially considering the price of a drink in Tokyo. As a Hilton gold member I was able to get free breakfast in the hotel restaurant and the breakfast buffet was among the best I’ve had at any hotel. Huge variety of food to be found, all very high quality. You can also get a cooked to order breakfast entree with the buffet, with the eggs Benedict being a particular highlight for me, the eggs in Japan are awesome with bright orange yolks. The hotel location isn’t bad as it sits right above the Shiodome station of the Toei subway Odeo line and is about a 10-15 minute walk from the Shimbashi station (all an underground walk) which gets you access to just about everywhere else as it has Tokyo metro and JR lines etc. I will definitely return here again when we find ourselves back in Japan.

The only niggle which was a little problematic and would’ve knocked a star off my review was that the hotel was very fully booked for the golden week, and meant that the room given to us had to be combined with my moms into the Royal Suite. Which also meant a twin bed rather than king. The room itself however was spectacular. The views, tub, bathroom and Lounge access were fantastic. And service was typically Japanese and very much 5star plus. The location was delightful and breakfast every morning a delight. The lounge breakfast was more than adequate but you should try the breakfast at the restaurant which was abundant but high quality. The one dinner we had downstairs at the restaurant was really yummy as well. If a tad expensive. The location also makes it exceptionally convenient for you to eat around the area or even travel for yummy delights.All told this is a high recommend for me. Thanks for making the stay great.

We arrived at 10 am to the hotel, after disembarking from a cruise with 20 or so fellow passengers.The check in process was disorganised and we had to ask several times for our luggage to be dispatched from the bus to the foyer on the ground floor. No porters to be seen anywhere. It was actually chaotic and no one was clear in their communication. Guests were not informed that reception was on Floor 28.Someone asked to go to the toilet on the ground floor and was told that because there was a convention on in the adjoining conference room, the toilets were out of bounds and to get the lift to floor 28, where the toilets were located.Not great because it was a bit urgent and no one knew where anything was on Floor 28.Eventually we were instructed to go to reception on the 28th floor, where we proceeded to wait at least 20 plus minutes before being served. Check in to the room was at 3:00 pm and there was no way it would be any sooner. We were told to come back,in a fairly abrupt manner, after 3:00 pm. There were 2 concierge, so the whole process was underwhelming. Guests were organising tours, while others were checking out and checking in. Hopeless actually.We sat in the foyer for a while and then headed out to lunch. Friends of ours who were waiting in chairs near the window were told to move, as the seats were reserved. There was no reserved sign on the table and they felt quite offended. Yes the introduction to the Conrad left little to be desired and there were many disgruntled travellers.When we eventually got to the room we were pleasantly surprised by its size and splendid view. The servicing of the room is outstanding with changes of towels and room refresh twice a day and nightshirts left on the bed each not get.Breakfast offered a varied menu but unfortunately many of the hot items such as bacon and sausages were cold. Warm plates should be provided because putting tepid food on cold plates is not great.Overall we enjoyed our stay and checking out was seem less. I just wish that our introduction to this splendid hotel had been more welcoming. Maybe a refreshing towel and a cup of green tea.Or more organisation on our arrival with the luggage.

I mean if you want a grilled cheese sandwich delivered to your room it's going to be over USD $30 without anything to drink. If you want to eat in one of their restaurants, forget it. We didn't so I can't review their food. The prices were sky high - up to more than $200 pp for Prix fix menu options. It's unapproachable unless you're beyond wealthy.

The hotel was sold out of these rooms when I booked my 3 nights but guess what?

And talk of location: Roppongi is a very happening place in Tokyo for museums near by, Mori Museum for one, and endless fabulous restaurants. And to the Ginza is an 8-10 minute taxi.:A special note is their concierge services where all the staff are extremely helpful and very knowledgable , with great suggestions to dine and assist with reservations and print out instructions for a taxi. As well you are given direction cards in a Japanese for you to give to a taxi for the trip back. A special note is Koji Notake, one of Tokyo's best concierges, who can handle virtually any need promptly. Our airport car was very late and in less than 5 minutes he arranged a replacement. Many of our friends use OpenTable however there is nothing better than Koji and his team making your reservation. You are treated and welcomed as a local and the restaurants know they want a great report back to the hotel. During our 5 nights alone, he handled an assortment of Italian, Japanese Teppan, Chinese, an amazing restaurant for our second time, Inakaya Roppongi where they cook in front of you and serve each dish on a paddle. Steak fish, vegetable all so amazing all Its a great show as well as fabulous food.

The breakfast is all-encompassing with a full buffet as well as an à la cattle menu ranging from Asian to Western, all beautifully presented. Ask for a room overlooking the bay as it is a wonderful view and well worth the extra.

I’ve been to Tokyo many times on business, but never on a holiday, with the time to investigate the many exciting destinations that you read and hear about. We stayed at the Conrad Hotel Tokyo which is 5 Stars in every manner. From the design of the Hotel, the beautiful guest rooms, to the gracious team of Hotel Staff Members who welcomed us and made us feel at home. The Hotel location was strategic and convenient for us to start our tours each day. The breakfast buffet was an important start to each morning, serving both western and eastern style foods. The service was quick, so that we could begin our daily adventures. The staff were very friendly, offering insights on the city and sites to see. Namai, is a waitress in the restaurant, and became a welcomed sight each morning, making us feel like we were old friends who stopped by. The Treasure Hunt: 32 years ago, I received a photo from a college friend, showing him standing on a staircase while pointing to a crack in an ancient stone wall. There was a note with the photo, indicating that a vile containing a note and other special items had been hidden at this location, and he provided instructions on how to find it. The treasure site was located 2 1/2 hours by train from Tokyo. For years, I intended to retrieve the vile, but amazingly, 32 years of “life” had quickly passed in the process. To help us with the treasure hunt, I went to the Hotel Concierge and met with the very kind and resourceful Ms. Matsuzaka, telling her about the hidden treasure, and that we needed a Guide who could join our team. The world has changed over the last three decades, so I felt that it would be important for us to have someone who could explain (in Japanese) to any Security Guards or Police, that I was not a security threat.  Ms. Matsuzaka found us the perfect Guide to lead our adventure, with Mr. Yu Kono, Co-Founder of JapanWonderTravel.com. On the morning of the adventure, Mr. Kono met us in the lobby of the Conrad Hotel, filled with enthusiasm for our unusual adventure. He had already researched the best method for us to reach our destination, along with how to safely locate and retrieve the treasure.  I will discuss the treasure hunt in my review of JapanWonderTravel.com, but will leave you with the knowledge that the “Hidden Treasure” mission was a great success. After our adventure, when we returned to the Conrad Hotel, we were surprised to find in our room, that Ms. Matsuzaka had created a beautiful “Congratulations” card with a graphic of the historic site where the treasure had been buried, along with two beautifully wrapped gifts. Her kindness and resourcefulness, led to us finding the hidden treasure, and also led to one of our greatest discoveries......the treasured friendships that can be created through generosity and kindness.

It is a sleek and modern hotel with a great staff and equally amazing food. During our stay here, my girlfriend had an assignment due and this is truly a hotel that caters to businesspeople. It is brightly lit and has a lot of spaces to do work, such as a lounge with a fabulous fireplace and a breakfast area, which was designed in a traditional Japanese fashion. We upgraded our room to receive access to the latter and were not disappointed. In this penthouse lounge we were treated to the most fantastic view of the city and the bay as we munched on a fabulous breakfast and sipped tea. It was great! Our room was large and clean with a glass partition between it and the bathroom. If you wish for more privacy, you can let down wooden blinds electronically which was quite nice.

They have 5 different specialty juices, omelette bar, fresh fruits, and all foods for every country. When I say their food is AMAZING, it is really an understatement. What I loved is that they have food for every culture. It is not only Japanese food or western cuisine. They do an amazing job with every possible aspect.

They were running a 50% off flash sale, so we were able to get a significant discount on the room which made the rate workable for us. The Conrad Tokyo may have been our favorite hotel during our 3 week trip through Japan. The service began before we even arrived, as we had questions about shipping our bags from Tokyo to Osaka. The hotel provided rates for next day service and same day service, plus arranged all the paperwork. BTW, shipping a suitcase same day to Osaka only cost about 3500 yen, which is a great rate and allowed us to do sightseeing in Tokyo during the day and not have to drag our bags to Tokyo station or get it to our Osaka hotel. We used the airport limousine from Haneda airport and it dropped us right at the entrance to the hotel. As Diamond members, we were whisked to the executive lounge to complete our check-in. We had booked a Bay View King and were hoping for a Diamond upgrade to a suite. Unfortunately the next level suite wasn't available and they weren't willing to upgrade to a premium suite. That aside, our stay was terrific. The hotel isn't very big, so it's easy to get around and doesn't feel overcrowded. The restaurant breakfast was awesome with a great spread, plus several yummy a-la-carte dishes (the pancakes and whipped cream were amazing). The executive lounge was fine, though the evening food options were a little underwhelming.The room itself was very comfortable. I had some of my best nights of sleep in a long time in that bed! The bathroom was spacious, and the sitting area by the window offered a great spot to look over the bay. As for location, it was excellent. The Shiodome metro stop is right below the hotel, and the Shimbashi metro stop and train station are a 10 minute walk through the underground passage. This allowed us to get almost anywhere in Tokyo with relative ease. There are also lots of dining options as you walk towards Shimbashi station.Bottom line: this hotel is truly a 5-star experience. Comfort, food, service and location - it checks all the boxes. It's not cheap, but if you catch one of the flash sales, it's absolutely worth it!","Fort Collins, Colorado",118,5.0

Space is a premium in Tokyo and all this space is worth the price. Beautiful decor, comfortable bed, massive bathroom... it was a great hotel to end our mini-RTW on. The hotel is very close to Shiodome station (pratically right on top of it), and not too far from Shimbashi station. Walking to Ginza takes about 15~ minutes.

In the morning I went to order breakfast via room service when I was informed to would be better value to have the buffet! Which was a great choice. I arrived with ten mins to go. Instead of being met with grumpy waitstaff wishing to pack up, my wait person was so lovely, telling me to take my time and enjoy it. As they were packing up she offer to get me fruit and more things from the epic buffet (I was so happy to see cheese again!) The rubber ducky and the little bears (left behind during the turn down service) were sweet touches which added a sense of fun to what could have been a stuffy hotel.

It is a beautiful hotel design-wise and the colours and textures resemble, at times, an expensive peice of Japanese lacquerware. The flowers are stunning and we enjoyed the quiet ambience. It is very close to the train and bus stations and Ginza is a 15 minute walk.We stayed in an Executive Room on the 36th Floor which was worth the extra due to the size and view and of course the lounge upstairs which serves complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails. The food at the lounge was of a high quality. The housekeeping is exceptional in that details count in a hotel of this quality: the room is spotless, your clothes are folded, any items you leave out of your toiletry bag are lined up perfectly, and there are the little Conrad Bears on your turndown at night. Bravo to the staff in this area.Where I think the hotel failed a little is in the concierge and lounge service information area. Whether it's the language or not, we had some miscommunications and simple tasks taking an inordinately long time. (Check-in took a long time).If I am staying at a hotel of this standard I always ultilise the conciege BEFORE coming to the city to book or recommend restaurants etc. Whilst this was done very well, the instructions and time estimates were way off, causing us almost to miss a booking at a restaurant because we were over 30 minutes late due miss-estimating time needed. Getting taxis and getting help with luggage though was efficient and easy and after some backwards and forwards the hotel managed to get us some tickets to the sumo which we appreciated!All in all, I would stay again and look forward to doing so.","Sydney, Australia",131,4.0

We do at least one overseas holiday with our 2 young children every year. We don’t travel for work so it’s nice to see how hotels treat guests who aren’t business guests or gold tier members.The service at the Conrad Tokyo was exceptional. Throughout our 12 day stay the staff generally went above and beyond to assist with any query or concern we had.Jonas, the customer service relations manager was devoted to ensuring that every one of needs was met and took initiative to get things done. We could not fault his genuine manner and personalised service. He should be rewarded by management as he is a true asset to the Conrad.Rise from concierge was very helpful. The rest of the concierge desk were hit and miss but most tried to be helpful. We found that concierge were better when we sent emails than in person. Room:We stayed in a bay view suite on level 36. The room was large for Tokyo standards but small by international standards. It was still big enough for our little ones to play. We had 2 double beds and a toddler bed set up in the bedroom. The beds were comfortable and our toddler loved splashing in the big bath in the shower room while watching cartoons (there’s a tv in the shower room). The bay view was lovely and we left the curtains open in the living room so we could enjoy the lights. The blockout blind was brilliant at making the bedroom dark. The walk through robe would ideally have more storage space but I still managed to have the 4 of us unpacked.We emailed concierge before we arrived and requested amenities for our toddler and baby. The hotel was able to provide all of these which shows that they value families.Lounge:Harita, Amica and Miyoko from the exectuve lounge were fantastic hostesses. They remembered our orders, kids names, preferences for food etc. They also spoke wonderful English so we often asked them for recommendations rather than concierge.I would highly recommend paying for lounge access and kids are allowed in the club (although we did try to keep them quiet as a courtesy to other club users).Food:Buffet breakfast was much the same as every other buffet breakfast. The service downstairs for buffet breakfast was non existent so we chose to eat breakfast at the club which had a smaller selection but all the main items.The restaurants were good (especially the Japanese restaurant) except for the Chinese restaurant downstairs. Service at the Chinese restaurant was terrible and quite frankly the worst we received throughout our stay. The staff even pretended not to speak any English (we were told by other staff that they do speak English, just not to us I guess). Avoid that place.We ordered a lot of room service. It is expensive but you are paying for the convenience.Location:The hotel is set in the corporate area. Easy access to trains, monorail etc.We love walking which seems to shock people in Asia. We take our double stroller and walk 4-5 hours or more during the day. It’s the best way to explore a city and we love being outdoors.We walked from the hotel to Ginza (easy walk), Tokyo Tower, Imperial Palace, Tokyo station (to catch a bullet train), Roppongi Hills, Shibuya (took almost 2 hours one way) and lots of other places in between. Our tip:Email the concierge before you arrive with any requirements. Introduce yourself to staff and look for Jonas if you can. Have access to the lounge and enjoy Tokyo which is a beautiful city with lovely people.","Rose Bay, Australia",33,5.0

When I came back later that night the lounge was a lot quieter and was able to get a coffee and a drink. The lounge staff apologied for not being able to come in earlier and said that it would be a lot quieter the next day.The next day was a lot quieter in the lounge and enjoyed the hospitality.In the room you could set a wake up call on the phone and you got a personal call at your wake up time ( rather than an automatic voice) that was appreciated.The hotel is in a great location across the road from the Hamarikyu gardens and the Yurikamome line to Odaiba is just a minute walk from the front door.There is the Toei oedo line beneath the hotel and the JR Yamanote line at Shimbashi station is around 10min walk away.On my last day I mentioned to the lounge agents that I was leaving before the lounge opened and they offered a continental breakfast to be delivered to my room.

We arrived extremely exhausted on New Years day and our roms were not assigned the way we had requested which made us feel unhappy. However this is where the service shone. The front office manager, Mr. Yohei Asano , excelled in making us feel happy by trying his best to give us one of the best rooms the next day. We just couldn't have asked for anything more as it was the Royal Suite on the 37th floor with stunning views of the bay and gardens. The location of this place is perfect and you can walk to Tsukiji market and to Ginza as well. It is attached to the Shiodome station or else you can walk a few meters to the Shimbashi station where there are much more train connections available. We had access to the executive lounge which might be one of the best lounges in the Hilton group all over the world. There was a good hot breakfast served with a cook present to make eggs the way you like or you could partake in the extensive breakfast down in the main restaurant. It was always packed to capacity but the staff were extremely efficient in finding a table for you. I just cannot praise enough for all he staff, whether it was the lounge or the restaurant or the front desk or housekeeping. I just wish I knew all their names to thank them individually.

For our first room, we were upgraded to a King Corner Suite on the bay side. It was the nicest hotel room I had ever been in, until we got to the Conrad in Osaka. The second room was a more standardly-equipped Twin Executive room on the city side. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the fish market, where you should go for 5:30AM sushi. It’s also very close to higher end shops and stuff in Ginza. Overall, the experience at the Conrad Tokyo was an easy 5/5.Room: Both rooms were very well appointed and clean. Both also appeared to have the second-to-last generation of the room controls (curtains, etc) and Toto toilet. The King Corner Suite was massive, with a large entryway with half bathroom, seating area, separate bedroom, and very large main bathroom. It also had nice views of the bay overlooked the Hamarikyu Gardens.The Twin Executive room was of a more standard size, with a small entryway, bathroom, two twin beds and small seating area. The one annoying thing about this room is the window between the bathroom and bedroom. The whole wall is a window, with electronically controlled blinds in it. While this is fine for bathroom privacy, it bled quite a bit of light into the bedroom even with the blinds fully closed.Amenities: Aside from the room, the only amenity we used in the hotel was the executive lounge, where we went for happy hour a few times and breakfast once. The spread at both meal times was above any beyond any of the other hotels where we stayed. You could also go get breakfast in one of the restaurants on the main check-in level, but we did not choose to do so.Staff: The staff was among the friendliest we encountered in Japan. We were met by the bellhop staff at the base of the hotel, who escorted us to the executive lounge on the top floor for check-in. After check-in, we were taken to our room where they explained all the controls and features (very necessary since several things are hidden in cabinets). The executive lounge staff was always smiling and welcoming, and they were constantly walking around to see if anyone needed another drink.","Cincinnati, Ohio",49,5.0

The bed was comfortable, with good bedside tables and lighting on each side. There was a glass wall between the bedroom and the bathroom, but a shade provided adequate light control to avoid disturbing your partner if one uses the bathroom during the night. The bathroom had a dual vanity, plenty of counter space and good lighting.The breakfast buffet was delicious, with a good variety. We didn't try any of the other restaurants, but the lobby bar is lovely. Service was top-notch.

Firstly, I made a booking for 5 nights over Christmas - back in April. I have always wanted to have a large room with a beautiful view in Tokyo and told the hotel so when I made my 80 sqm corner suite booking, 8 months prior to arrival. The room we got must have had one of the worst views in the hotel, and how is it a corner suite when it doesn't have a corner view? Conrad, please don't describe rooms as 'corner' when your corner is occupied with the maid/cleaning stations. (A serious error made by the architect.) We got one of the lowest possible floor rooms and the view was straight into some very close and large office buildings, I could see some city if I leaned very close to one of the windows but that was it. So disappointed with that. If the Conrad had emailed me as I made the booking and made me aware of this I would have changed rooms to the other side or hotels. There is no excuse for this, your customer wished for something and you failed to deliver as well as failed to inform that the customer could've had what she wanted if she had made a change in the booking. We talked to reception but they said they couldn't do anything as the hotel was full. (Which proved to be true according to their website.) The room itself was fine, a little tired, furniture a little dirty - and the couch that looked comfortable on the photos was very hard and uncomfortable so sit on, it should never have been chosen. The bed was comfortable the shower pressure outstanding, blinds were truly making the room extremely dark, very nice. I got sick during my stay and stayed in the room more than what I assume is normal. I was extremely bothered with noise at what I believe was someone one floor above us. There was walking on high heels all day every day and it was extremely loud. I just don't understand how that is possible as I thought the room above us and below us were similar, and the traffic was so high like it was an office.There's a carpet in the room but the noise was horrible as if someone walked on bare wood or tiles with heels. Very strange. Probably not the hotels fault, but annoying nevertheless and marring the experience as I wasn't able to rest much. Furthermore, the hotel made a mistake on 4 out of 6 room service orders. Food that was asked left out (tomatoe due to allergy,) was inside a sandwich, we asked for a glutenfree meal that indeed was made with regular bread. Had I not had the glutenfree bread the day before and knew it would look different - I would have eaten it and gotten very sick. That is abysmal. Allergics be aware at the Conrad, I heard the order being repeated for glutenfree sans tomatoes and it happened twice. 4 out of 6 orders wrong for an overpriced 30$ sandwich is laughable. Also, the lobby area as well as the reception area is sprayed with disgusting perfume/chemical from a large diffuser that sprays into the air with an interval of minutes. The lobby stinks of perfume due to this and for us with perfume and scent allergies and I imagine for those with asthma - this is pure terror. I got really sick from it and had to walk fast through the common areas. Hotels everywhere do this and it's hard to get away from. Management at the Conrad: please consider stopping polluting our breathing air, it's horrible for us with allergies. (And probably not healthy for those with no current allergies as exposure to oils and perfumes are potential allergens everyone can react to at any time, I'd refuse to work in this environment if it were me.) The pool looked nice with a beautiful view, but felt stuffy and warm and very chlorinated so I couldn't swim there. The service was adequate, the level of English not what I expected, it was pretty rudimentary at best. They are sweet and service minded though. The executive lounge was nice but nothing exceptional there either. Food was okay but repetetive and very carb based. The concierge helped us with a package to be delivered to our room prior to our arrival, and helped us change a booking for a show, so our experience with the concierge was good. I agree with another reviewer, that the Shinjoku area would be a better for a first time visit to Tokyo as the Shiodome area is a bit boring and a bit of a walk to the fish market as well as Ginza, and you won't get a taste of the real Tokyo. All in all I'm disappointed in my stay at the Conrad and we will not be back.","Boulder, Colorado",180,2.0

The take away from this hotel is that while its rooms are great, their lack of attention to detail and mistakes really do detract from a 5 star experience. Bottom line is Its worth staying if you can get it on sale, but its not really worth the rack rate of $500+ price point at current. Hopefully this review will give an unbiased opinion to travellers. Location (3/5)In the heart of Shiodome overlooking the Hamarikyu gardens. I've stayed at the adjacent Royal Park Hotel (which is about half the price) and so I am familiar with the location. The pros of the location is that it is relatively close to Tsukiji and in some respects Ginza. It is walking distance to Ginza (10 minutes) and to Shimbashi station (10 minutes) but after staying in Shiodome twice - I wouldn't stay in the location again - and wouldn't recommend it especially for first time travellers to Tokyo. I would recommend instead a hotel next to a main subway/train line or in Ginza / Roppongi / Shinjuku itself. Front desk / Check in (2/5)Staff failed to direct us to executive level for check in - one staff member had no idea it was even a possibility to check in on executive level. Waited about 15-20 minutes for check in at the front counter. With a time like that, its slow for any hotel. Rooms (4.5/5)Great rooms. The siize i believe was 48sqm for their standard rooms which for a place like Tokyo is quite remarkable. The wooden panelling and extra high ceilings (3m) were nice touches. Bed was very comfortable and I had no complaints about sleep quality. Bathroom was clean and large sized. We also didn't have any smoke issues that some other guests stated they had. If I had only one comment about improvement, it would be the dated television (2012 model? in 2017). Lounge (4/5) Very good lounge. Service was generally good. Seating was well spaced apart and great decor. The lounge only very rarely felt crowded. The open concept with two sides having views of both the city and the bay was an excellent design choice. The food and spread were generally reasonable. The wine choices perhaps could be expanded and rotated a bit more.Breakfast (3/5)The spread is quite wide, but the quality of the food itself is par for the course. Its what you would expect in any 4 or 5 star hotel. The food and spread was slightly better in Cerise (the restaurant) than in the lounge as expected. Cerise allows you to select a further dish of the day. My main gripe is that Cerise is too busy, period. Feels more like a school cafeteria than a luxury hotel in the morning. Service was slow and they forgot both our dish of the day orders on the first day. They did make efforts to rectify this mistake but only after 30 minutes. Sloppy for a 5 star hotel. We didn't go back to Cerise after this, not because of the mistake but because it was too crowded. I generally wouldn't recommend breakfast at the hotel.. You're better off trying the local cuisine outside the hotel. Facilities (na)The hotel has gym, pool and spa faciltiies. We didn't try any of them so I can't comment. Concierge and service (3/5)Below par for the course - especially for a 5 star hotel. I compare this to our Concierge at Hotel Granvia in Kyoto (which is a far cheaper hotel). Compared to Hotel Granvia, the Conrad was (1) Slower to respond (2) Straight up refused to even try to make certain bookings saying it was too hard (3) Failed to go to the extra mile - which hotel Granvia did - when considering it was our honeymoon. The overall service was also hit and miss. They did put a fresh ice bucket in our room every night which was nice. However one night, we were busy during turn down service and they failed to come back later to try again (never had this happen before at a hotel).If your concierge is make or break (you want to book very difficult restaurants) - I would go elsewhere (peninsula / mandarin oriental / park hyatt).Price/Value (3/5)The price is always going to be steep with luxury hotels. My advice is that if you're wanting to stay here and price is an issue, wait for the hilton sales which offer 50% off twice a year. Overall (3/5)In summary the Conrad is a Luxury hotel with great rooms and lounge. However a lot is needed to bring it up to the standard one expects of a 5 star hotel. Japan is renowned for Omotenashi (Spirit of selfless hospitality). The Conrad needs to reflect on what that means to them and whether it needs to make changes. I had an average experience here for our honeymoon and I don't think we'll back in a rush.","Sydney, Australia",77,3.0

Its obvious from when you first arrive and it does not disappoint at any stage, both in terms of the quality of what you get (food, drinks, massage etc.) and the service received from staff. 2) The quality of service is Japan is typically very high, but some can find it a bit 'cold' as it can be a bit reserved. This is not the case at the Conrad, every member of staff was friendly, courteous, professional and very knowledgeable. There were three kids in our party (8-12) and every member of staff went out of their way to make each of them feel that they were the most important people in the room.3) The location of the hotel - is very close to the fish market - literally a 10 minute walk away4) Accessibility to and from the hotel - there is an airport limousine bus that services several hotels in this area including the Conrad, which is always a big tick for me. Just be wary that if you are arriving or leaving Narita late in the evening then the buses do not run very late, so you might need to organise alternative transport. Tokyo train station is a 10 minute taxi ride away, so that might be an alternative option (especially if you are arriving/leaving via Shinkansen). I can't talk about Haneda as we flew out of Narita. The hotel lobbly in not on the main road, but there were always a couple of taxis sitting by the entrance up so getting one was never a problem5) the view... If you are going to stay here then get a room with a view over the bay. it is spectacular, day or night. The rooms with this stunning view all end in odd numbers and it is worth waiting for. The view from the lobby bar is the same, so if you are in doubt then have a look out the window here. You will not be disappointed. The views on the other side of the hotel are fine, but they are the typical views you get from most hotels in Tokyo... of the city itself.6) The facilities - it has a lovely 25m pool that is simply superb. The lounge is great as well - with limited breakfast in the morning (6.30-10 am), afternoon tea (3-5pm... with ice-cream and fruit fondue). When we stayed (Jan 2017) the executive lounge was being renovated, so we had to use a temporary one just behind reception - but even that was better than most other lounges I have used.Would I stay there again? Yes, in a heartbeat. In fact, it is going to be very difficult to stay anywhere else on our next stay in Tokyo. ","Melbourne, Australia",27,5.0

Therefore we brought home a spray bottle of the hotel’s signature scent so we could enjoy the smell and memories at home. When we wanted to purchase another bottle online we couldn’t since they are made exclusively for the Conrad Tokyo hotel and only sold there.I remembered receiving an email from the hotel manager so I wrote to him to inquire about the possibility of purchasing a couple more bottles. However after some research and several emails back and forth, he informed me that unfortunately the shipping companies - UPS or Fedexp - do not ship liquids. I was disappointed, had given up and was saying goodbye to the last few drops of the spray scent left. Then the hotel manager mentioned he was traveling to NY in November and offered to bring me a couple of bottles. We live in Florida but by coincidence were going to be in NY during the same dates so it worked out perfectly. He was so kind that he even dropped the bottles off at the hotel we were staying. I want to thank and commend the Conrad Tokyo hotel manager for going completely out of his way to help me with my request, and for providing me with the best customer service experience ever.

As with most hotels in Japan, the facilities were beyond clean. Service on the other hand is the same you would get in all Hilton properties - corporate and impersonal - not what you expect from a luxury property. We had booked one of the top corner suites - this was a bit of a misnomer - with corner you expect views on two sides? For Conrad that mean literally a suite in the corner - why is it more expensive unless you are trying to mislead buyers. Next as a multi-year Diamond member staying for more than 7 days in a suite I was expecting an upgrade. I had even contacted the property in advance - but got the corporate response. When we got to the hotel, they did not even direct us to the executive check-in desk and told us that no upgrades were available for our whole stay, only for a few days. The suite was just plain and badly maintained - heavily scratched furniture and scratches on walls. The overall welcome was a small plate of amuse bouche - compare this to the Peninsula properties where you get turndown goodies and fresh fruits in your room everyday for an equivalent suite. I did note this online and I must say the hotel responded and upgraded us to a beautiful suite 3 days into our stay, But to be honest the hotel lacked a luxurious personal touch. The lobby was crowded most of the time and the executive lounge felt like an upgraded Hilton - breakfast was the same everyday and tea time service was sub-par in terms of selection and quality.The spa is nice, as is the gym and pool. A note however that if you are going to run a spa in an international hotel you may want to hire english speaking front desk staff.

I did not go out at all during my short two days stay however the stunning view of the city and the bridge plus the extraordinary food in the restaurants are enough Japanese experience I needed. The hotel is convenient to get to. As soon as you exit baggage pick up, you can go straight ahead and buy the limonsine bus ticket which will be just in front of you which takes you to Conrad, and you don't have to worry about carrying your bags around for public transport! It is cheap as well 3100 yen! worth it for an hour and a half journey! The hotel has perfect modern decor. I booked a twin room and it looked better than the picture! You even get a night gown too so no need to bring one! And a cute little teddy bear which is a nice touch :) Conrad service is on point, I ordered my Japanese breakfast to come 6.30 and it comes right on time! I spent most of my time in the fitness centre. It is actually a health club rather than its own private gym, so you get many locals running on treadmill at 7 in the morning already. The facilities were good as well as the swimming pool. However one thing I would complain about is the exercise classes. As I am someone who regularly practice pilates, I found that the pilates class was not pilates, more like stretching, no core work or anything. So I made a complaint to the spa receptionist. He was in denial and said that maybe I am too advanced, I said no! any old person could practice pilates! The instructor gave me a half an hour free of pilates. It was good. However when I got on the phone to book the afternoon class hoping that he had learnt a lesson and it got better, nope. The receptionist argued with me and said that the classes will not change style just because of me! I said to him that what they advertised there as having pilates and making guests pay for the class was not pilates and continuing to do so, is false advertisement! He made the same old excuses, that some are old blah blah blah. I simply could not stand this and this is so unprofessional. This is like advertising that there is a muay thai class but actually its a sumo class. It is a complete joke as this receptionist had no idea what he was talking about. Obviously not seen the class or have an interest of what pilates is, and have no trust in what I said. So if you are going to Conrad hoping to do some hardcore pilates workout in your stay too, DONT! Apparently according to Conrad pilates the abs or spine don't exist lol! I heard that Mandarin oriental even got the reformer, so go there. Anyway the restaurants are excellent. I had sushi that I never tried before in my life in the sushi bar and watched them made it. I ordered set menu and in the evening I ordered fine dining type of menu with many courses. Everything came out so beautifully with perfection! The gym is twenty four hours so I had a two hours session before I left. Don't forget to insert your keycard in the lift if you are going to that floor! The receptionist booked me the bus back in advance which picks me up straight from the hotel, again no carrying the bags around the train! Overall this hotel was an amazing experience and I hope they will make changes required in the future to make it even better!","London, United Kingdom",1,4.0

And for a bit more money, we also got an absolutely stunning bay view, which was a joy to go to bed with and to wake up to.- well-maintained public areas. Nice pool. Nice bar. - convenient location. Not hurt by the fact that it's an easy walk to the Tsukiji market.The bad:- service that is polite on the surface but not genuine: I've been told that that is the ""Japanese way"". I guess it's still much more preferable than the out and out bad/hostile service that you get from most other hotels/destinations. To be fair, the service at the Conrad was much better than the much more high profile (and $$$) Park Hyatt,- the concierge: the only restaurant recommendation that we sought from the concierge seriously ruined our trip and our impression of the hotel (oh hello Tenichi!). It would always leave a sour (or greasy?!) taste in our mouths when we suspect that the hotel is taking commissions for such ""recommendations"".In conclusion, will we return to the Conrad Tokyo?

The trip was very last minute, basically for next day travel. I tried booking for this hotel through my travel agent but he said it's fully booked. I then went on amex travel website and found that this hotel was still available therefore I made my booking there. It was so great to be able to stay at this hotel. 1. Location. This hotel is near the shiodome station. We took the skyliner from Narita airport to ueno and took the taxi there. Taxi fare was around ¥2500 as I remember. Although the hotel there isn't a whole lot of shops nearby, we found it to be quite convenient to walk to Ginza. Probably around 10-15 mins walk. The walk is easy and straightforward. For those who are into architecture, the famous nakagin capsule tower is just nearby. The station for odaiba is next door which makes a trip to the odaiba very easy. 2. The room was booked through amex fine hotel and resort program but they were only able to honor some amenities. Together with the Hilton gold status, all 3 of us received daily buffet breakfast, and usd120 to be used at the hotel. Unfortunately no upgrade was available. We got a room that is very spacious by Tokyo standard. Ceiling to floor window with city view, spacious bathroom. The room was very clean and well appointed. 3. Service was excellent. From check in, concierge to restaurant staff, all were outstanding. Japan is famous for their high standard in the service industry but Conrad does it even better. Most staff speak good English. 4. Breakfast was very enjoyable. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the breakfast spread has a great variety of food with the option to order from their menu. Restaurant staff was very efficient in general but one morning there seemed to be someone more important in the breakfast room so the staff took priority in taking care of that customer first.

In any luxury hotel (even mid-range for that matter) I would expect wifi to be included as standard.","Singapore, Singapore",21,4.0

The reception staff welcomed us gratiously to the hotel and from the moment we arrived we knew we were going to love this hotel. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the bedroom was incredibly comfortable and catered for every possible wish. There were tea and coffee making facilities and free bottled water every day. A necessity in the heat of a Tokyo summer. The usual well stocked mini bar had a number of extras too. The bathroom was well appointed and had a lovely free standing bath as well as an excellent shower. Toiletries were also in abundance. Food in the restaurants was also of a very high standard. We enjoyed dinner in the traditional Japanese restaurant on our first night trying out Teppanyaki dishes cooked by a master chef - who turned out to be a real show man. A great introduction to a much loved form of cooking in our family. The view from the restaurant was to die for. The buffet at breakfast was also excellent with an eye watering selection of dishes from around the world. Although we ran out of time to try it, afternoon tea in the lobby looked incredibly tempting. Everything the hotel provides or offers shows great attention to detail and is well thought through. Time is given to aesthetics as well as to comfort and practicalities. The hotel spa offers a true haven from the heat and fabulous madness that is Tokyo. It is somewhere to relax and unwind after a day of sightseeing and travelling. Can't wait to return to this fabulous hotel. ","Edinburgh, United Kingdom",13,5.0

There is the peaceful Hamarikyu Gardens just next to the hotel that allows for a great morning stroll. There are not many restaurants or convenience shops near the hotel, but there are plenty in Ginza. And of course, the hotel is right above the Shiodome station which is a good gateway to Tokyo Tower, Asakusa, and others. The huge, all-access Shimbashi station is about 15 minutes away.As a Hilton Gold member, we received complimentary breakfast for all 3 of us, and an extra bed was provided without additional charge as we booked a rate for 3 guests. I would note that not all hotels practice this (despite charging a higher rate for 3 guests), and we appreciate that. There was no available upgrade, unfortunately.On the service side, we had great help from the concierge to make a few phone calls and arrange reservations for us, as we were visiting places and restaurants without English-speaking employees.We also appreciate that that the room has been fully prepared with the extra bed and towel right when we checked in.","Singapore, Singapore",3,5.0

It's also located a 10 minute walk from the Fish Market, though you can't get into it before 10am as a tourist without a tour guide, but you can walk the perimeter. Breakfast was excellent - buffet - and Hilton Honors Gold meant we got it comped for free, which for 5 people was a $200 bonus per morning.

The bay suite was large, especially for Tokyo and had a great view being that all the rooms are on the 31st floor and up. The area is not great for exploring. Shiodome is a buisness area, so if you want to go right outside and have things to do, this is not the place to stay. Had dinner at Kazahana and spent almost 600 usd and walked out hungry, so if you are a big eater, eat elsewhere. Breakfast buffet was good, but I found myself comparing it to the St. Regis Osaka, whose buffet is just a bit better in every way. Also, if you are not a Hilton honors member, wifi is not free.

Location is ok- 15 mins walk to Ginza or 5 mins walk to shinbashi station. I used to stay at millennium mitsui garden all the time , where location can't be beaten . But I'd be happy to walk a little more as Conrad rooms are much much better. Room is clean with comfortable bed and all the amenities you will need. A nespresso machine would have made it better though. They welcome you with the Conrad teddy on the bed but since we have a twin room and obviously 2 persons staying, I'm surprised they only gave us one. I also read that they used to give you one each night but nope we only received one for the two of us for our stay. Not that it's that important but I guess if you decide to give a sovenier to your guests you would give them one each no?The staff are helpful with restaurant bookings, but for restaurant recommendation, there's just lack of personal touch. I use tabelog with I travel in Japan but just in case the staff had personal favorites, I asked if he had any ramen recommendations but to my disappointment was handed a ramen map with touristsy chain stores like ichiran and ippondon.

Plenty of chairs to also sit in poolside.The breakfast was one of the best, buffet plus you could order a variety of items off a menu. The blueberry pancakes were delicious.Executive lounge has great views of both bay and city. Good selection of drinks and food for the evening cocktails.Location is good, close to subway and the light rail over Rainbow Bridge.

Spent two nights there on a recent tour of Asia and wish I had spent more time here. I've been fortunate to stay at some pretty great hotels in my travels and not too many were as good as this Conrad. While we were checking in we realized what a place this was - fabulous view and truly amazing restrooms in the lobby. Great start. We were upgraded to a suite with a bay view which was amazing; lots of space and a great view. The bathroom was terrific - the shower (and crazy Japanese toilet) was as good as it gets. The club lounge was among the best I've ever experienced. Complementary adult beverages and snacks at night, including ice cream sundaes, which I'm not sure I've ever had in a hotel lounge before. Service was over the top too, constantly refilling champagne glasses and whatnot. The outdoor pool was also very nice. Breakfast was great in the lounge, and on our second day they allowed us to have complimentary room service because we had an early plane to catch. The ladies in the lounge took our order the night before and the food was delivered as requested, on time and as ordered. This is the kind of thing that makes you really appreciate staying at a truly great hotel. Well done, Conrad! I am trying to think of a negative, and the only thing I can think of is that the location leaves a little to be desired. We had a ridiculous time trying to get to the hotel from the Hamarikyu gardens, which are right next door but separated by roadways. But the Conrad is very close to two subway stations that are kind of easy to navigate and also walking distance from Ginza. All in all, the Conrad Tokyo is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. If you have some status with Hilton you'll be very well taken care of, and even if you don't I'm sure you'll be quite happy here. I can't wait to return. Thanks Conrad!","Huntersville, North Carolina",196,5.0

However most of the Japanese hotels were requiring us to get two rooms since we were three people. The Conrad was willing to put in a roll away bed so it turned out to be less expensive to stay there (though not inexpensive). We also wanted to be within walking distance to go the fish market. You have to line up around 2:30 am to see the tuna auction. Prior to arrival the concierges were very helpful and responsive, helping us with transportation questions and especially dinner reservations. Our daughter has a food allergy and we needed help making sure places were safe for her to eat. Check-in and check-out were efficient. Our room had a gorgeous view of the river/harbor. The room was spacious with two twin beds (but really full size). Since my husband and I shared a bed, our daughter had the other twin so we really didn't need the roll away. There was a nice window seat to enjoy the view. The bathroom was huge with a separate space for the toilet and shower and all the toiletries one could need. After walking 20K+ steps a day sight-seeing it was great to come back to the room and relax in the bath with a book and a beer. There was complimentary coffee and tea in the room which was nice to enjoy. The room was very quiet we never heard any noise from other rooms or the hallway. We felt spoiled.",new jersey,93,5.0

The view of Tokyo Bay was just breathtaking. The hotel is very stylish and aesthetically stunning--from the common areas to the room, and the personalized service was wonderful. We spent 3 nights there, and we felt as though we were coming home each time we were greeted by the staff (I wish my doormen at home were half as nice as the employees at Conrad Tokyo!).The Executive Lounge offered a spectacular city view, and I loved having breakfast there. They also had interesting small, fun things to nibble on throughout the day (loved their sparkling white grape jello!), and it was one of the most well-appointed and most comfortable Executive Lounges I have ever visited anywhere. Although it is a bit on the smaller side, it never really got close to full--so perhaps their Lounge access is properly controlled to match the size of the Lounge.On my third day, I was feeling slightly under the weather and I guess I mentioned it to the staff at the entrance...and breakfast staff offered to put together some ""get well"" breakfast items and bring them to my room. That was so nice of them, although I wasn't feeling THAT bad and ended up enjoying the regular Lounge breakfast.The location of the hotel is a little tricky, though, if you want to fully utilize Tokyo's amazingly reliable and efficient public transportation system. But it is central enough that, if you don't mind minor traffic jams, a quick cab ride can take you to places like Ginza and Odaiba for under 2,000 Yen/US$18.Overall, we had such a wonderful stay there, and I highly recommend this hotel.

Most staff have very good English skills, not that it's totally necessary in a foreign country but nice to have at times. Amazing and grand fit out wherever you look in the hotel. We had adjoining rooms on the 36th floor city side,both with executive lounge benefits (highly recommend this). The rooms were large, beautifully appointed with amazing views of Tokyo. There was a nice turn down service at night as well.This place must spend a fortune on staff as they are everywhere and always want to help or just say hello. The executive lounge is a bit like the icing on the cake, top floor with incredible city views one side and even better bay views and rainbow bridge views on the other. You can have breakfast here, afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapés, there's almost no need to leave the hotel! A special shout out to Yohei, aka George, the lounge manager. He totally looked after my family in many ways and was full of advice, he is a real asset. Breakfast is more extensive at the Collage restaurant on the 28th floor but much busier. The fitness centre on the 29th floor is great. Amazing to be swimming along at that height looking at the Tokyo sky tree. The gym is well appointed. The change rooms are extensive with jacuzzi, sauna and steam rooms.

The Salmon I had at the Japanese restaurant was similarly small, and the prices were high... we ended ordering a second entree at the Japanese restaurant while left their Chinese restaurant hungry. Their breakfast was decent with selections of western, Japanese, and Chinese options. Their service was sketchy, and the staff wasn't prepared Sunday morning for the number of guests, so the overflow was seated in the Japanese restaurant across the hall.  All in all it was an excellent hotel. We've stayed at a number of Five Star Deluxe hotels in Tokyo and found this to be one of the best! ","Paris, France",64,5.0

The airport limousine bus arrives at the hotel, which sealed the deal for me, as I am not fond of lugging 1.5 luggages through Tokyo's complicated subway.It took around 10 minutes to walk to Tsukiji. In addition, although one could walk along the overhead path connectors to the Shimbashi station (just follow the Yurikamome train track), it was just as convenient to take the new Yurikamome line to Shiodome station, one stop away from Shimbashi. Conrad was literally a stone's throw away from Shiodome. I did not attempt to walk to Ginza - It costs only Yen650-750 to take a cab to the area. Once I figured out the train system, it was just as easy getting to Yurakucho and Tokyo stations, where my food and shopping targets were.The interior designer of Conrad Tokyo did a fabulous job. The room seemed slightly larger than the Shangri-La, which could be a plus point if one needs the space for an extra bed.In my room on the 30F, there was an unpleasant urine odour emanating from within the toilet. Informed Housekeeping the next day who did a good job of clearing 90% of it. My sensitive nose could still detect its presence. Perhaps it was related to the cistern or plumbing. I would really be interested to know if my hunch was correct. In my recent stay at the Westin Nusa Dua, the same issue occured with a basic-level Toto bidet type cistern.On the bidet topic (trademark of Japan!), the one in Conrad wasn't as fancy as the ones in the other hotels that I stayed previously. The flushing system was not automated, nor were there motion sensors to lift the seat cover. While this is not a big deal, it does somehow feel like a gap between the other hotels which aimed to provide luxurious rooms and great service (and the Conrad Tokyo is already so close...)Booked a facial at the Mizuki spa which cost around Yen23,500. I feel asleep under the skilful hands of Ran (the therapist). The scalp and neck massage was so..ooo good. The hot mask compress literally melted all the traveller's fatigue away. I really wanted to try the Mizuki Spirit package but unfortunately the place was fully booked on a Sunday morning.Chanced upon an opportunity to top up my room rate for a day's breakfast (which was great as I wanted to eat at Sushi Daiwa on my other morning). There were buffet and ala carte option. Since I am not a big fan of mass cooking, the ala carte optionality was awesome. Ordered the eggs benedict, which was just as delicious as some of the other hotels I have been. (Hint: A sprinkle of caviar would have created the perfect balance!) Loved the juicy melons and lychees from the buffet section. The flat white and cappucino were both disappointing - bitter aftertaste and untidy foam presentation. I must say I have not yet found a good cup of coffee in Japan after all these years.Would I stay at the Conrad again? Absolutely! The limo bus would be the differentiator but do note the limited timetable.","Singapore, Singapore",83,5.0

I deliberated between a few hotels prior to making the booking as the location of a hotel is of major importance to us. As it turned out, we made the best decision as it was really nice to explore the busy part of the city and then in the evening retire to the quiet sanctuary of the hotel.We arrived very early and due to our Diamond Status we only had to wait an hour before we were given access to our bay view suite on the 34th floor. In the meantime, we were given access to the lounge and the staff were very helpful.The concierge in the lounge helped us enormously in working out our transport routes across Tokyo. It was so easy and their maps along with printed directions helped considerably. We travel extensively and I have never had such service where different coloured posted notes were marked onto where we were going, along with extra notes highlighted in the same color.. The attention to detail by Yohei was so appreciated. Thank you to Suko, Naomi and Jacquie who pointed out some potential food allergies. She remembered for the remainder of our trip and always made sure that I knew what food was on offer. I knew I could count on her and she is a lovely asset to the brand.The suite itself was very spacious with lovely views. The bed was very comfortable and the room was soundproof. There were no noises of trains, other people or anything else to wake us.......even in the morning. The only thing to mention is that the shower area grout needs a redo and the carpet needs to be spot cleaned in places. I am very fussy but this is why we choose the brand.Breakfast was fantastic and we have had many Conrad breakfasts. We chose to have breakfast in the main restaurant and Deepak and Hamada made breakfast a wonderful experience. The food off the menu came very quickly and was very hot. Fresh juices, fruit and many healthy options were also on offer.On our final day we had a late checkout due to a late flight and the Lounge Manager gave us the time to explain many things about Japan which really enlightened us more on the culture.In summary, it was a wonderful trip and we would highly recommend this hotel for a fantastic trip in Tokyo.","Sydney, Australia",37,5.0

It all started when when we walked in on the first floor and no one greeted us or offered to take our bags. And yes there was someone working behind the desk. So we just went up to the 28th floor on our own. Now they're supposed to greet you and take your luggage. So much for service. When we arrived to check in on the 28th floor we are asked ""checking out?"". Umm no I'm checking in. Now it was a little after 1 pm and we are immediately told that our room wasn't ready and that we can leave our bags and come back after 3pm. Now I know that this is the policy but I've never actually encountered this ever before. Almost always if this situation occurs, we are told ""if you want to wait we can probably have a room available in about 30 minutes"". And that's for hotels where we have no status. my wife and I both have elite status at Hilton. And the person checking us in knows this because he told us our room is being upgraded because of our status. We have access to the executive lounge so why wasn't it offered for us to be able to relax in the lounge while our room was being made ready. I know they do this because on a different day while we were in the lounge, we over heard them telling someone they could just stay here while their room is prepared. The whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth. Breakfast: The breakfast is probably the most underwhelming buffet I have ever experienced anywhere. And I'm not talking about the one in the lounge. I'm talking about the main breakfast on the 28th floor. In fact we have been to holiday inns that have better breakfasts. By far the worst and to top it off the food was always cold. Lounge: The Lounge happy hour food or lack there of is the worst we have ever had while traveling in Asia. It is on par to what you will find in the U.S. Also, one evening they had chicken skewers that were raw. When we pointed this out, nothing was done. They just left the chicken there. Service in lounge was terrible. It seemed that service was better for you if you were Asian. Which is odd because my experience has actually been the opposite in Asia. Both scenarios are wrong, you should treat all of your guests the same especially in the lounge. By the end of my stay the workers in the lounge just rubbed me the wrong way. Every time you walked by an employee, they would say thank you for choosing Conrad. It seems that this is their idea of service. It wasn't all bad. I just love the smell when you walk into any Conrad. And this one lived up to that. The bathroom in the room was nice and big. The mirror in the bathroom is awesome. And the room itself is a good size. So was this the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. No. But this was the worst 5 Star Hotel experience I've ever had. I wouldn't stay here again, and would advise others to look elsewhere if you want a true 5 Star hotel in Tokyo . ","Pembroke Pines, Florida",94,2.0

We stayed 4 nights in a city view room. We spent more a night than we normally do for a 5*. We might not get back to Tokyo so we didn't want to be disappointed. We chose (for the same money) city view with breakfast over bay view with no breakfast. As it turned out for us it was the best choice as we never once sat in our room and looked out the window. Breakfast was a choice of room service or lounge, or breakfast buffet in the restaurant. We chose the restaurant - I highly recommend the restaurant. If you have club access you can enjoy the bay view while enjoying an evening glass of wine or beer with snacks. We had a martini in the bar area - amazing view. Maybe one of the best dirty vodka martinis I have ever had - and one of the most expensive :) Rooms were clean, modern and comfortable. A short walk to the fish market and to Ginza shopping area. Great restaurants. The transit system is also right there which we took to go see the Imperial Palace. I tried to ask if we could walk but I could not get anyone to give me directions. It was so short of a train ride I am sure I could have walked. The JR GREEN LINE goes in a round loop and once we figured it out it seemed easy. We made a mistake and were trying to figure out their local line. We went to Shinjuku for the day using the JR line. We booked a bullet train and tour in Kyoto. We were picked up at the Conrad hotel lobby. There are beautiful gardens right outside the Conrad. Small fee to enter. We discovered there were boat tours leaving from inside this area, which we didn't do as we didn't have the time. If you are looking for more nighttime party atmosphere this is not the area to stay.

As Honors elite level member, 5 nights stay are priced as 4 nights. The original booking was for City View Twin, however Conrad was kind enough to upgrade us to a Bay View King. We were given complimentary breakfast due to our status, at the Cherise restaurant every day of our stay.Room:Large, I believe the website cites 48 square meter. Conrad's website has quite informative section describing the floor plan. The room overlooks Hamarikyu Garden, Tokyo Bay, Odaiba area and the Rainbow bridge. We could see part of Tsukiji fish market from our room as well. There is a couch/day bed along the floor to ceiling window which is enough for an adult to sleep in a pinch. Bathroom is large with stand alone tub, separate commode and shower room. Breakfast:Extensive selection. The only minus on our mind, we were not allowed to have breakfast sent up to our room. As Hyatt Diamond member, we could have breakfast in the room. Hilton will do well to match that.Staff:Concierge and hotel staff are all excellent. The one slight minus is not every front desk staff have good command of English, but it is in no way dampen our enthusiasm to stay here again. One shout out to Petrlik (I hope I spelled her name correctly). She is one of Cherise restaurant staff. She is very patient with us, explaining about how the restaurant prepped the place (we asked), and pointed to us some local delicacies that are in the menu. Location:Conrad is in the Shiodome area, walking distance from Yamanote train station which is a minor hub in Tokyo transport network. The walk can be done in about 5 minutes, through overpass on underground passage. It is also across from Hamarikyu garden, which is the only city park in Tokyo with water feature that take intake from Tokyo bay, so there are ebbs and flows on the ponds in the park. Waling distance from Tsukiji market, and Ginza (although for some Ginza - about 1 km away, maybe a bit of a stretch. Tips:The adjacent office building has several convenience stores (Family Mart), the closest one opens until 10pm. Another one further down on underground passage open 24 hours. They come in handy when you need snacks, beverages, etc if you do not want to spend money on room service. There is also a Starbucks that open early (7am), 1 floor down from the closest Family Mart.Still in the same building as the Family Mart and Starbucks, except on the 2nd floor restaurant area, each restaurant has take out offers every day for various kinds of bento boxes (Japanese, Korean, Chinese or Thai style) for 600-700y per box, and they are all very good and very filling.","Auburn, Washington",58,4.0

Good location, great amenities, great views in rooms, good service. Lobby smells great. However, hallways smelled smoky. We were on a non smoking floor. Soon after check in, we smelled smoke in our room as well as in the hallway. We called front desk who said that they will notify ""housekeeping"" to address this. (Although we were surprised they sent the housekeeper, likely the small Asian woman cleaning nearby to take care of the people smoking in their rooms rather than security). Still, this was addressed right away. By the next morning, the smoking started again (seemed like from another room). Since we were only there for a night and checking out in the am, we didn't make a fuss. It's a shame that smoke reeks in the hallway because this is truly a beautifully designed and appointed hotel. Restaurants are super expensive. For a family of four with 2 kids eating at the casual dining place ordering only burgers, it can almost $200 US dollars. I don't mind paying more for great food, but the burgers were good,but not that good to cost between 3800 and 7000 yen per burger. Breakfast was ok to good but typical for higher end Asian hotel. Service again was little slow because they were busy but again very friendly service. (They forgot my wife's order... we finally asked them if we can go ahead and pick up the now cold pancake ourselves that she had previously ordered, still sitting near the buffet counter 10 minutes after we noticed it was made). Rooms and views were truly great and perfect for our last night in Japan before heading out to the airport. Everyone was tired and really didn't want to do much but enjoy the views from our rooms. Check in was surprisingly slower than expected as they were busy but everyone was courteous. Check out was good. Still, we enjoyed this place.

Location is about above Shiodome station, but I think we almost always walk to Shimbashi station (a 10-15mins walk) as it is more conveniently connected to the Tokyo railway and metro network. From the ground floor entrance to the high ceiling lobby, the interior is somewhat modern minimalist style with nice subtle color palette and materials. We waited in the lobby for quite sometime before checked in around 3pm. The room were truly spacious by Tokyo standard. My friend's son were ecstatic when he enter their room and said the room is so cool and fantastic. The Conrad rubber duck on the bathroom, and a couple of little bear on the second night on the bed, were little nice touches. Staffs were just polite and unobtrusive. Too bad we packed a lot of activity outside so there's little time to enjoy the hotel. There's notice letter on the first day about power blackout for a few hours at midnight because of some maintenance, which occurred on our last night. I have to wait for around 20 mins on the ground floor because of the elevator was also off for around half an hour when I came back at that night and then I had to packed things in darkness and the room temperature is a bit chilly as the air con is also off. They did provide a flashlight though. 4 stars for the rating for this stay because of this, but I think this is extremely unlikely to happen, maybe less than once a year.

However, the building is connected to an underground pedestrian complex that permits guests to walk to the adjacent Shiodome subway station and (with a little further walk) the Shimbashi JR rail station. Because of the challenge of navigating through the maze of the train station and underground mall, as well as the extensive crowds at Shimbashi station, those traveling from Narita to Tokyo Station via the Narita Express will probably want to take a taxi for the first trip to the hotel. The hotel rooms are well maintained and are equipped with all the modern amenities that would be expected (even the top Toro toilets with the heated seats ....). The rooms can be modest in size, though, and can be a bit tight with a roll away bed (charge of 75 yen per night) added. The restaurants are, not unexpectedly since they are part of an upscale hotel, quite expensive. The food was of excellent quality, but for very limited quantities. There are a number of restaurants connected to the hotel through the underground pedestrian area that will be likely be of interest to the cost-conscious. For those able to use the executive lounge, the breakfast served there was solid, with a chef on hand to prepare omelets. Fresh pineapples, grapefruit and cantaloupes were served, together with pastries, meats, potatoes, drinks, etc. The offerings did not seem to change each day.The service at the restaurants and the hotel generally was excellent. Because of its quality and central location, I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Tokyo for the first time.","Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania",42,5.0

You can tell that every detail of the hotel was thought of, from the smells in the lobby, to the textures on every surface and lighting throughout, the hotel is studding. The rooms are incredibly luxurious - big windows overlooking the city, large bathtub looking out into the room and overall beautiful, contemporary design. I also wish to highlight the staff. We checked in with this delightful woman named Yuka. We had just arrived from the airport and she was just delightful. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived back to our room from dinner to find a note slipped under the door. She went above and beyond - wrote this beautiful hand written note to us wishing us a good time in Tokyo and then provided multiple maps where she highlighted route we should take and annotated what we should do in different areas. I've never seen such painstaking detail and time spent to help a guest! This blew me away - and these maps wound up being our guides while we were there. We never got to properly thank Yuka, but this was truly incredible and we appreciated her effort immensely! Lastly, we greatly enjoyed China Blue restaurant as well as drinks by the windows overlooking the city. The gym was also incredible, with great machines, weights and staff.

The RoomSince we had a suite, there was ample room for a roll away, with plenty of living space left over. The bedroom looked out over the bay via a floor length window, as did the living room and bathroom. The furnishings were comfortable and bathroom very large. The bed was perfectly soft with fine linens. They did a very good job cleaning every day. The bathroom had a typical fancy Japanese toilet and large shower / tub with an extra TV…just in case. AmenitiesThe hotel pool had an amazing view of the city and the spa was like a private onsen. The massage quality was good and much cheaper than you find in most Conrads. We were impressed with the breakfast selection and service, especially the made to order breakfast items. The view from the bar was impressive and was very relaxing. The ground floor reception had bottled water and towels every day as we entered and left. What a nice touch. The hotel is very close to Shimbashi station and is a good home base for Tokyo.

Ignore obvious discontent? Then the Conrad Tokyo is the place for you.On the last night of a twelve-day trip, I had a twenty-hour layover in Tokyo. I originally had booked a room at the Hilton Tokyo Narita Airport, with the intent on going into the city until the trains nearly stopped running, then heading back out for a long night's sleep. After some thought, I decided to splurge and book instead at the Conrad Tokyo. I figured that the combination of Hilton Gold status and booking through the American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts* would ensure a great stay.I was wrong.The Conrad Tokyo is located in the Shiodome/Shimbashi station complex, near Ginza, on the 28th through 37th floors of its building. Getting into and out of the hotel is relatively easy. Once one enters the hotel, one must proceed to the 28th floor to check in. I checked in around 18:30 or 19:00. The problems began then. During the process, I was greeted and welcomed as a Hilton Gold and Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts member. Fine. The agent informed me of the benefits, but mentioned I would not be receiving an upgrade because ""the hotel was sold out tonight.""Note the choice of words. The whole hotel. The problem is that her statement was categorically—and perhaps more importantly, verifiably—false. At 21:15 that dinner that night at Kazahana, the Conrad Tokyo's Japanese restaurant, I checked availability on a whim. The hotel was anything but sold out. Not only were base-level rooms available (cut off on the photograph because I didn't bother taking a photo of them), but multiple tiers of suites were available.Any statement that ""the hotel"" was ""sold out"" were categorically false. The desk agent either (1) lied to me, or (2) was uninformed, either because she failed to inform herself of crucial information or because management failed to disseminate that information to employees who need it.Conrad Tokyo rooms are divided into two categories: regular and suites, with both categories having executive-floor flavors. Each room can either be city- or bay-facing, with bay facing rooms being more expensive, but apparently physically no different than their city-facing siblings.I detail this because twin suites were available throughout the day. This is the category into which basically every other Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts participant would upgrade my room (including even the SLS Beverly Hills, which was otherwise a fetid disaster). Failure to upgrade when an upgrade was available is a huge, huge strike against the hotel. The staff's lies or incompetence in the matter compounds the problem.As mentioned above, the hotel is split amongst ten floors. There are supposedly three or four elevators, but for a short hotel with what should be plenty of lifts, it takes a painfully long time to make it anywhere in the hotel. Plan accordingly.The decor—both rooms and common areas—are Japanese minimalist. They're nice enough, but let's be honest: One can find equally nice decor in hotels with competent staff.I dined at Kazahana, partaking in one of their kaiseki menus. It was fine, but the problem was that it was only fine. It is disappointing when a meal onboard ANA's first class is better than a meal at a Japanese restaurant specializing in kaiseki menus. Sure, the ANA seat would cost far more than the meal had I not booked with miles, but under no circumstances should a pre-prepared and reheated kaiseki meal outclass a ¥14,000 kaiseki meal.Finally, check-out was disappointing. When the bellhop asked how my stay was, I said, ""I should have stayed at the Park Hyatt."" No follow up. When the desk agent asked me how my stay was, I shrugged. Again, no follow up. No one cared.But you should. There are too many fantastic hotels in Tokyo for you to waste your money here.* For those unfamiliar with Amex' Fine Hotels & Resorts program, booking through the program affords guests a suite of amenities, which, for the Conrad Tokyo, include:• Noon check-in, when available;• Room upgrade upon arrival, when available;• Daily breakfast for two people;• Guaranteed 4:00 pm late check-out;• Complimentary Wi-Fi; and• US$125 property credit to be used during the stay.Many of these amenities overlap with Hilton Gold status amenities.","Roanoke, Virginia",13,2.0

Conveniently located to a couple of train stations, so despite its office building neighborhood you can still easily get to the major sights of Tokyo. Made it to the park across the street this time, and it was beautiful. Management should really do more to promote guests taking advantage of that natural asset. And I was very pleased to see they eliminated the one complaint I had from last visit, when smoking was allowed in the lobby bar and it was the first thing you smelled off the elevator on the 28th floor. Now it's pure luxury and service from top to bottom. Breakfast buffet as a Gold member was great too. Can't go wrong staying here; we will be back.","New York City, New York",28,5.0

I felt that my review for the hotel probably is not going to add much but I do want to sing our praise to one particular employee that we had the pleasure to know.The Hotel is great just like any other reviewers described, but the greatest asset Conrad Tokyo has is its employees. The biggest gem of all is the Concerige, Mr. Chapay Deepak.My husband checked-in the Hotel before me and when I was trying to locate him, Mr. Deepak chased after me and told me that he would go and let my husband know of my arrival. He told me I should just go up to my room and relaxed and he would take care of everything. I was totally impressed and wondered how he could identify my husband. Well, he did his job and my husband came to the room shortly. What can I say? This Concierge worked magic.Throughout our stay, we always ran into him and it almost made me feel like he never went home. He always greeted us with the biggest smile and inquired our well beings every time.The concierge lounge was very small and crowded at the time but I read that Conrad has since expanded the lounge, so problem solved.Conrad also has the cutest bears they left on your bed during the turndown service.I like the Hotel and will return when in the area. Great service is equally important as the hotel itself. We could not praise enough about this Concierge, Mr. Chapay Deepak, he was the best concierge we have ever met in our overall travels.",san francisco,11,5.0

It had a nice living area, large walk in dressing, guest toilet, a large modern bathroom and a twin bedded master bedroom. The beds were a bit hard but this is often the case in Japan and in general we always had a good night’s rest. As usual with Conrad, they offer a number of different bathroom products and a good choice of amenities. Housekeeping was prompt and consistent, even when the hotel was booked solid for the Sakura season.For Japanese standards the suite is rather large and had a nice view of the surrounding city. Most prefer the bay view rooms but we really enjoyed this side. The bay is visible from the Bar “28” also from the executive lounge.The hotel’s location has been a point of discussion in earlier reviews but we did not find it badly located. Yes, there are more centrally located hotels and if you only a very short time, these might be worth considering. The Shiodome subway station is directly beneath the hotel and the Shimbashi station is roughly 10-15 min away depending on the platform you need. From here, you can basically get anywhere. The fish market, Hama-detached garden and Roppingi/Tokyo Tower are within walking distance.Check in took quite long and they were very strict with the 15.00h check in (we were told to wait until 3 PM around 2.55  ). The staff was courteous and professional. The concierge knowledgeable and they arranged some ticket for us, even before we arrived. The bar Twenty Eight is truly a gem with a wonderful setting and interior. It seems to be very popular for the afternoon tea. Cocktails are expensive but perfectly made and also here the service level is high.The executive lounge on the 37th floor was nicely decorated and offered a selection of breakfast (we never tried this), afternoon tea (good) and evening snacks and drinks. The selection was good but not very extensive. You cannot compare this for instance with the typical range offered at lounges in Hong Kong, like the FS, RC of Conrad where you can have a true meal in the lounge with champagne. That being said, it was a nice place to relax for a while before going out to dinner. The staff at the lounge were very nice, made us feel welcome and remembered our names after a few days. (FS always makes a point of this, here it depends a bit on the part of the hotel)The restaurants are high quality. Breakfast in the main restaurant is excellent although the service can be a bit off when the hotel is completely full. They offer a nice variety and partly you can also order a la carte. This ensured we never got bored at breakfast although we stayed here for a long period. Quality wise the food is excellent.The wellness and pool area are nice as well and are a bonus in a hectic city like Tokyo. The pool temperature was OK but personally we would have liked it a bit warmer.All in all we had a truly wonderful stay in this very well run and well maintained hotel. It is among the best of all the Conrads we have stayed in so far. We would not hesitate to return. They are not (yet?) at the same level as the Four Seasons but it certainly is among the top hotels in this city and they will provide a true 5-star experience.

Before I complain please note one of my companions loved the breakfast buffet because of great salmon. I was appalled because they were in chaos - the buffet was out of eggs and juice and I wasn't offered the cooked egg menu until we were leaving for on the first day, second morning we ordered eggs Benedict in the room to avoid the chaos - THE WORST EVER - one solid congealed mess.

On the last day, we were going to check out at 1:30 pm as we had been allowed a late check out, my wife who is a vegan ordered grilled asparagus which is a side portion at around 1:10 pm and the room service person taking the order went on this trip that you are checking out at 1:30 and it will take 50 minutes to prepare this dish, my wife was really furious when all they had to do was grill it. When my wife vented her anger, they brought the dish in 7 minutes. The manager at check out was very apologetic but this is truly a very poor experience. Somebody needs to address this issue. The hotel is nicely located close to Ginza district. There are two metro stations underneath the hotel. Starbuck is also there. The hotel has an excellent pool and gym.

The hotel was full so we did not get an upgrade for my Diamond status, but the room was so beautiful that it was not a big deal for such a short stay. The room was very elegant and well-appointed. The blinds were all touch-button and the toilet was a Toto Washlet! The bed linens were so soft and comfortable that we did not want to get out of bed. Nothing was missing. The only very minor complaint is that the towels were not that soft . I would have expected something a bit more plush and luxurious in a hotel of this caliber. Breakfast in the restaurant was very good and the lounge was nice. It has a great view and the staff are wonderful. Food was quite limited compared to the lounges at other Hilton group properties we have stayed in Asia, however, the staff in the lounge was first-class in every regard.

Only sparkling wine is served there and no champagne. I felt that the quality of the food could be improved. I stayed in the city view room this time and certainly the view of the Tokyo bay is way better.

I was grateful that I could visit two 1-michelin-starred sushiyas, giving them only 10 days advance notice. Room was sooooo spacious by any standard. Bed was firm and soft on top.

From beginning to end, it's a stay I won't forget. As my husband and I arrived, the bellhop in the lobby freed us from our heavy ski gear. Staff escorted us to the elevator bank, where the sakura scent is unforgettable - I wish I could bottle it and take it home with me. The concierge greeted us upstairs with confirmation of our dinner for the following night at Jiro in Roppongi, a reservation he had secured for us a couple of months in advance. Desk staff was friendly and efficient, and when we mentioned wanting to see Tsukiji fish market in the morning, they gave us helpful maps and made sure we knew how early to arrive if we wished to see the tuna auction.We we delighted by our room. Our bed was extremely comfortable (and graced by two adorable little Conrad teddy bears), the closet was spacious, and the bathroom was delightfully roomy and modern. There was a tree in the entryway to boot.We had drinks at Twenty Eight every night of our stay, and we really enjoyed the bartender, our server, Peter, and the view. We had an excellent sushi dinner at Kazahana the first night of our stay, and there was something for everyone at breakfast at Cerise (try the smoothies!). We were impressed by the gym facilities (even if you don't swim, at least go look at the pool - it's beautiful).The location was ideal, as you can head downstairs toward several train options and not even have to head outside. We were a short train hop from Ginza (close enough that we walked back), the Shibuya scramble, the Imperial Palace, the Skytree, and Roppongi Hills, and a very short cab ride from Tsukiji.

We also walked a lot in combination with using the subway. I was a little nervous when we arrived via the limo bus when I saw all the construction outside the hotel. It was not an issue while out walking. You had to pay a little more attention to when walking to the fish market or the gardens by the hotel as you passed through all the construction. But when in question there were plenty directing traffic who were willing to send you the right way. Arrival at the hotel was simple, they catered to bringing you up to the lobby and to your room. our room was a king with bay views that were simply fantastic. Very helpful when battling jet leg at 3:30 am to have the beautiful view. The breakfast in the morning was fantastic as well. So many choices and well done. Most Hiltons have gold members eat breakfast in the executive lounge but here we are gold and did not have those privileges here at the Conrad. It was better I hear to eat in the main dining room anyway and we enjoyed it. The views were great and so much food! We also enjoyed a light dinner at Cerise in the evening. Drinks are very expensive in the lounge. It is a beautiful room and often there was piano or other music. I am not sure if you are allowed to just go sit there without having drinks or food. It seemed a little intimidating and other then your room it seems the only place to just sit or gather.

I fully expected to be blown away and to have my best hotel stay ever but sadly I left disappointed.First of all, let's start with the positives. The location of the hotel was excellent. Some people might say that the area around the hotel was pretty dead at night and on weekends. While it's true to some extent, I did find the location was perfect. Far removed from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet close enough to a couple of major train stations from where you can explore the city easily (one stop away from Ginza and Tokyo station!). Secondly, for a standard room, the size of the room was among the biggest I've ever had and everything was top quality (although the room wasn't without problems). Thirdly the service was very good (nothing that blew me away, but very good nonetheless) and the food offerings in the Executive Lounge and during breakfast was top notch. The selection wasn't as large as what I have accustomed to in Asia, but everything was very tasteful and of extremely high quality.Now to the not so good part. Granted I was staying on points (otherwise I will not be able to afford the exorbitant rate), but the upgrade for Diamond members was quite measly. The upgrade I received was just to the same type of room but with a different view. Yeah, the view was marvelous, but the hotel didn't even put me on the Executive floor (like other Conrads do) even though there were still rooms available. On top of that, the condition of my room upon closer inspection was quite disappointing. Dirty carpet (owing to the light carpet color) and visible wear and tear everywhere. The white office chair was dirty (again, due to the light color that they chose) and the chaise alongside the window was especially dirty that I had reservations about sitting on it. Shame. The room was beautiful and spacious, yet when I looked closer, I pitied those folks who paid the asking room rate. The room condition wasn't five star at all. Also my so called pre-assigned room wasn't ready when I checked in (at 3PM, the official check-in time). Mind you, I didn't request for a particular room number, but this was pre-assigned to me by the hotel and I had noted my arrival time of 3PM. Luckily they found another room that was ready at that time albeit on a different floor.Also the hotel didn't even disclose on their website that the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor was closed for renovation. Their reasoning? They have moved the Lounge space to a meeting room on the 28th floor and it still had the same service. But a meeting room is a meeting room and it is not a lounge space. The ambience is of course different. Shame. Service was good across the board, in that all staff members are polite and reasonably friendly and helpful, but it didn't feel any different when comparing to other hotels I have stayed in. In fairness perhaps it was because of the language barrier as I had observed that the staff interacted better with the Japanese guests but still I had expected better, especially due to this Japanese service myth that I had. Housekeeping service wasn't that great either. They did get better day by day, but they were not really that thorough, every single time they would miss some little details here and there, like not replenishing some amenities or clearing the rubbish bin, you know, all the details I would have expected a Five star hotel to get right. Shame. Lastly, the thing that really bothered me a lot was the presence of management at breakfast. Breakfast was supposedly a leisurely affair for me (and I would imagine for many folks as well) as I was on holiday and yet the presence of these managers (suited Caucasian and Japanese managers) made the breakfast experience quite stressful as I felt that I had to be on my best behavior at all times. I thought that their matronly presence was only to serve to oversee guests so that they didn't take too many buffet items and so that they didn't linger. And as other reviewers have noted, they would shower their attention to other guests (I would assume regulars and high spenders) and ignore the rest of us, plebeians. I bet they hope that we would finish and leave soon so that they could turn around the table for the next guests. Especially disappointing. One manager (Hispanic-looking) even didn't allow me to pass and the Japanese male manager didn't even smile back nor say anything when I smiled at him and said thank you when leaving the breakfast restaurant. Wow. My eyes did meet his.Overall, my high expectations on the hotel weren't met and I did feel somewhat uncomfortable every morning during breakfast due to the presence of the managers. I had booked this hotel only because I had HHonors points burning a hole in my pocket and that I had thought I would receive better service in a 290-room hotel versus one with many more rooms. However, other than a better room and amenities, I didn't think I receive better service overall. As much as I loved the location of the Conrad, I will save my points and stay elsewhere next time.","Madison, Wisconsin",30,4.0

Since at the time of my booking, all other hotels in this category were booked up, I was left with no choice. Here is the Positive:Room: Spacious, well appointed, bright, clean and in good condition. The floor to ceiling window /wall allowed an expansive view of the Tokyo bay. Bed was very comfortable, however, the hotel sprayed the room ( Also in public area, I think) with an aroma that was too pungent, and suffocating in my opinion ! Location: Conveniently located with easy subway access ! Gym: clean, bright and with a nice view looking out to the bay and the pool below. Housekeeping : Timely and responsive ! The not so Positive:Breakfast: Not as good as when the Hotel first opened, but still a pretty acceptable spread if you preferred to have your breakfast before you head out for the day ! Service: My biggest dissatisfaction with this hotel was that the service level varies, especially during the breakfast time. The management seemed to prefer certain customers and ignore others - on what basis I had no idea. I had observed during my 8 days stay how they lavished on certain customers and ignored others like they were transparent, why such differential treatment ? Weren't we all paying hotel guests, so why the discrimination ? Which I have to say put a very bad taste in my mouth, and therefore the 3 star rating ! Also as a reminder to the readers, the last Narita airport limousine service to Conrad Tokyo is at 16:05 ( check the hotel website), so if you can not make this last bus, you either have to take the express train to tokyo station or you have to take a taxi. In my case, I missed the bus, and because I had two large luggages with me so I had to take a taxi all the way from Narita airport to the hotel ! Would I recommend this hotel ? Probably not, given there are so many comparable offers in Tokyo that provides much better services ( I had stayed at some of them) than Conrad Tokyo, I would recommend people to go elsewhere !","Boston, Massachusetts",37,3.0

This was my first stay at the Conrad brand. It won't be my last!!The Conrad Tokyo is in an excellent location, both for the metro and for walking. We were able (as the weather was excellent) to walk to the fish market, the Meiji Shrine and Harajuku area, and all around the shopping in Ginza as well as the park lands around the Imperial Palace.In the evenings, we took the metro, with Shiodome station right at the hotel and Shimbashi station less than 5 minute walk away.Also, for airport access, the limo bus to/from Narita was a very convenient and comfortable way to arrive at the hotel, and ran exactly on time.The Conrad hotel has fantastic views on the harbour front side (where our room was located), as well as from 28 bar. The hotel starts on the 28th floor of the building, so I imagine all the rooms have pretty good views.The room itself was excellent for two friends travelling together. The living room was very spacious, and the layout of the closet area/bathroom/bedroom meant that each room could be separately closed off, while leaving the other rooms open for use - certainly made life easier!! The beds were comfortable and the room very quiet.My friend arrived quite early, and despite her HHonors Diamond status, was unable to have an early check-in due to the limited number of twin bed suites. It would have been nice for them to allow her access to the executive lounge, and/or spa area for a shower, but this was also refused.The hotel was happy to store her luggage for her while she waited, so she was free to go out and explore Ginza. We typically had breakfast and then left the hotel to go out sightseeing, having lunch out, and then returning in the late afternoon. Despite being out of our room for typically 5-7 hours, on three of our five days, the housekeeping was cleaning our room as we returned. I thought it strange to happen so often, particularly as we were out of the room fairly early. This was a little frustrating, as we were usually coming back to shower and prepare to go out for supper.Because we were on the executive floor, we took advantage of the lounge breakfast. The buffet includes dry cereals, oatmeal, meats and cheeses, fruits and vegetables, yogurts, breads and pastries, as well as asian dumplings and porridge toppings. And there is an egg station for fresh hot eggs. We were very impressed with the quality and selection of the lounge breakfast buffet.The afternoon tea was also excellent in the lounge, although we only partook on the days we returned to find housekeeping in our room.We ate at Kazahana one night, and had a teppanyaki set menu, which was great. The chef was friendly and informative, and we enjoyed the food, wine and view immensely.All in all, a great stay!","St. John's, Canada",60,4.0

The hotel is conveniently located just South East of Ginza near the main market and some beautiful gardens. It occupies 10 floors (28-37) in a large building with beautiful views (urban or harbour) on all sides. As HHonors Diamond, I found the reservation team very responsive and efficient before our trip. We booked an executive floor suite and were kindly upgraded to a nicer suite. The suites are very tastefully decorated and have great bathrooms with a nice choice of toiletries (Aromatherapy Associate, Tara Smith, or Shanghai Tang which I really like) and beautiful views. However, we only got a limited late check out (but in fairness the hotel was very busy). One thing I found a bit disappointing was the executive lounge. It was extremely busy especially in the evenings, and on the second night, the lounge was unable to accommodate us when we came and asked us to return to the room where they would call us when there was space. When they called it was to say there was still no space and they had booked a table for us in the main bar. The bar is actually beautiful and much more quiet but drinks selection was even more limited than in the lounge and we got an uninteresting tapas plate instead of the more Japanese lounge hors d'oeuvre which was a disappointment. Even the evening we could make it to the lounge, the offerings were ok but by no means exceptional. For instance, having previously stayed at the Shangri La Tokyo, its Horizon club offerings for both breakfast and cocktails are vastly superior to the Conrad.Breakfast was very good. I went to the main restaurant to have a Japanese breakfast (not the best but still very nice) and choice and quality were plentiful. We also tried the Japanese restaurant for a wonderful kaiseki lunch, and a good but expensive sushi dinner.The Conrad is one step in luxury lower than the likes of the Mandarin Oriental, Shangri La, and Four Seasons, but it is still an excellent hotel and one where we'll return with pleasure.",,148,5.0

Tired from the trip, I was greeted by a chap on the 27th floor. I asked to be checked in, and he kindly obliged. I was upgraded to a bay view room on the 32 floor after he saw that I was a diamond status. I am a frequent Hilton guest amongst other hotel chains. I have to say, this is the first Conrad I have stayed in and is definitely one of the upper echelon hotels I have seen in my lifetime. The decor and location is unprecedented to many others.Here are my standard good and bad points:Good:- Hotel staff tries to help wherever they can - Hotel staff tries to make themselves invisible to give guests privacy- The view is literally to die for. You will never get to see this side of Tokyo if you are just a normal tourist- Location is for business (next to tv station tower and a funny Shiodome train station. It is a 20 min walk to the closest JR station (Shimbashi)Bad:- Executive lounge is way too small to service so many American tourists in December- Lounge is always packed with people for the breakfast and dinner sittings in December- Business centre on the 27th floor. (Should be in executive lounge)If you are interested in my experience, please read on:I was offered Executive lounge access due to my Hilton Honors diamond status. Usually when you arrive at a Hilton affiliate hotel, they see you are a Diamond member, you will automatically get sent up to Executive lounge to check in. Lucky I wasn't considering how many people were in the lounge at the time.The room I was given had a view of Tokyo Bay. You can see planes coming in and out of Haneda. Good picture moments. The room was huge for Tokyo standards with a separate bathtub and shower. The mirror was huge and circular with bright lighting around. I immediately wanted one at home :) The bedding used were top quality and I had a good night sleep.Knowing how full the Exec lounge can get, I knew breakfast downstairs is a better option (at Ceres). Breakfast buffet was good. The first item of ""hot menu"" was free. Then the buffet was quite good with a variety of eastern and western foods. Quite happy from this experience.I asked for a late checkout. Usually it is not such a big ask given a diamond status. But I think most people who stay here is probably on a diamond or gold level given how much they are willing to spend on the rooms. I was given a 1pm checkout and it seemed non negotiable. I ended up leaving at 10am anyway.Would I come back again to this hotel? Probably if I wanted access to Haneda airport or on company business. However, I am keen to try other Hilton chains in Tokyo since there are so many of them.","Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",28,4.0

Inside it is incredibly clean as you would expect and the service is good, however I would expect their English to be better. I do hate it when you go to a foreign country and visitors expect everyone to be speaking English and elsewhere I did not have this expectation however I did at the Conrad especially as it is situated in the business district. We found it incredibly hard to be understood by the concierge ( I do have an English northern accent but it isn't that bad...honest!) Also directions they gave us to restaurants did not work out and me being lost in the middle of Tokyo, hungry is not an ideal situation (just ask my husband). However we could walk lots of places and we worked a lot of things out ourselves. We used a JR pass during our time in Japan and I did ask at the hotel if we could use it for the Narita express which they said we could but they never advised us that you had to make reservations which did make things slightly stressful at the train station. I can't understand why they would not know that and pass the information on!Moving on to the good stuff! We told them at check in that it was our honey moon and as we were let into our room, cake arrived as a congratulations (nice touch and very prompt). The room was large, bathroom as big as most of the rooms we had stayed in other parts of japan and felt very luxurious. It was uber comfortable and we got a great nights sleep. The cleaners were excellent, toiletries were refreshed promptly and the turn down service was good too. Breakfast was a mixture of east & west as expected and again was as you would expect of a 5*.

I stayed on the 34th floor - the executive level, in a king suite. Upon entrance into the hotel, i was in total awe of the interior designs and the size of the lobby. The wooden like walls and earth-toned features created a warm and relaxing atmosphere. An ambiance i could never forget. I was welcomed to my room and could not have been happier with my double ensuite bathroom featuring a bathtub, shower and pretty cool robot type toilet! The bed was extremely comfortable, and the complimentary slippers and pyjamas were an awesome addition. My room had wall to ceiling glass windows with a fantastic view of the city, in particular the iconic rainbow bridge which lights all sorts of colours from 6pm until midnight. The button controlled blinds were definitely a favourite of mine. The massage service is obviously expensive, like the in room dining, (i paid $14.50AUD for a red-bull!), however it was an experience totally worth my $500AUD for a 50 minute upper body massage. The massage room and the customer service is unbeatable and I have never felt so relaxed as i did during the massage service and after. The relaxation room post massage is a delight, where you're served with your selection of a hot Japanese tea, where you can lay down on the provided comfortable banana chairs with a blanket for as long as you please to really enjoy the total massage experience. The in-hotel restaurants were yummy! Great location of the hotel - about a 20 min drive from Tokyo Haneda International Airport (depending on traffic). The hotel is situated next to a train station which offers a prominent subway service, although a bit tricky to understand the ticketing system at first, it is easily worked out! It is similar to the french metro system in Paris.The staff are amazing and their service is a solid 10/10. Concierge extremely helpful in suggesting dining locations whether it be for breakfast lunch or dinner if the in-hotel restaurants aren't your fancy for the evening.

We were then told that at the reception they can't check us in as we were hotel members and could only be checked in on the club floor - again we were only given directions to the lift. The club floor - greeted by the club manager and was made to wait again to check in - all in all it took 45 minutes to check in! The guest room is good size and nicely appointed. The next day when we went to the club floor for our coffee, we helped ourselves to the Nespresso coffee and water. The club manager approached us and asked if we had taken a whole sleeve of Nespresso capsules for ourselves? Not sure if this was lost in translation but we told him we had used 3 capsules for our coffee and rather insulted that they could ask if we took a whole sleeve of Nespresso capsules? We told him it was insulting to ask us if they thought we took a whole sleeve of Nespresso as if we were stealing from them! The club floor provides complimentary tea, coffee, breakfast, drinks etc. to all hotel club members and to be asked such a question is truly insulting!

Our stay was for four nights. The primary reason for selecting the Conrad was the King bed availability (very few King beds in Japan) and it being next to Tsukiji market for our 2:30am wake-up call. We didn't have the opportunity to try to restaurants or bar at the Conrad but they looked busy. There was also live evening entertainment in the bar area.

They secured a reservation at a sushi restaurant of our choosing and that was amazing. Unfortunately when we arrived I found their recommendations lacking. In fact, we asked for recommendations on 3 separate occasions and were disappointed all 3 times. In my opinion a concierge should provide unique insider information not just cookie cutter recommendations. My recommendation to other guests is to do your own research and have them assist you from there.

Pure luxury. A lot of 5*'s in Tokyo have the top notch service, but the rooms are quite dated, and not many have that 'boutique' feel. The Conrad certainly achieves that wow factor however. The turndown service is so great.

The staff were so amazing, and greeted us like they'd known us for years, and remembered all the little details - remembering our names by heart, asking us how our day was remembering specific details and always offering us a bottle of water before we headed out. Specific mention to Ari - the concierge/manager who always took the time to chat and answer questions and always greeted us so warmly and genuinely. He really loves his job and the social aspect of it and it definitely shows. All the staff spoke impeccable English and nothing was ever a problem. We drank in the bar which always have live background music - piano one night, guitar the next. Felt like we were in a movie. Drinks were well made and all the staff so friendly.

I initially hesitated among the other top-rated hotels in Tokyo. In the end we chose the Conrad based on the very good reviews and location.Among the 5 hotels we stayed at in Japan this was by far the best.I will start commenting on the location: despite some negative comments, as a tourist I can say location was excellent. The hotel has direct access to two major stations Shinbashi and Shiodome, which will allow you access to the main sites in Tokyo. It is worth noting however that these are large stations and required some walking. The hotel is also at walking distance from Ginza.Secondly regarding the hotel itself, it fully meets the standard of a luxury hotel. Decoration and amenities are superb. Rooms are extremelly well apointed and look very modern, with very stylish furniture and design. Service by the staff is also very good, in line with what you expect in this class of hotels. English command was excellent in all the people I interacted with (which is rare in Japan)The only drawback I can comment on is on the access to the swiming pool. To acess it I had to go through the spa entrance. There I had to go through access procedures by signing a document and was actually forced to read and accept a set of rules and regulations to access the swimming pool. I must admit I felt somehow patronized by this whole experience. In any standard western hotel I would have directly accessed the pool. Nevertheless this was just a minor glitch in an overall excellent experience.So to conclude, I can fully recommend this hotel. If you can make the effort of the high price tag, this is an excellent choice in Tokyo.","Toulouse, France",37,5.0

The hotel is beautiful and very modern. You'll enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and feel easily as home either at Cerise, the casual restaurant, or having a drink by the large fireplace in the lobby bar (live music some nights, excellent views of the Bay). Our room was an Executive Bay View Suite which the perfect amount of space for our family throughout the stay. The bathroom is awesome, with floor heating, large tub (my toddler swam in it) and luxe amenities are provided. I particularly enjoyed the doors which closed off the bedroom to the sitting area, so that if our toddler was napping we could comfortably hang out and watch TV, work, etc in the other room. There is also an additional half bathroom in the room and large walk through closet. I really can't say enough good things about the room, we loved it, and it was definitely worth booking if you need (or just want) the extra space. The Bay view was also nice considering generally, you get a lot of city view in Tokyo, we enjoyed that change of pace. With executive lounge access we enjoyed breakfast every morning, tea time and evening reception (appetizers and drinks) daily. The lounge is rather small but the staff was very helpful and became fast friends with our son. The hotel was excellent with housekeeping, turn down service (we even had some surprises left in our room) and timely room service. The gym is also small, but it does have a variety of equipment including extensive weights which can be hard to find here in Tokyo. There is also an indoor pool but guests under 4 are not allowed...at all. That was a huge bummer to us as a family with a toddler and one of my only complaints about the hotel. Spa is also nice, enjoyed a massage while we stayed, the locker rooms all have large whirlpools and saunas as well. Overall, we loved the Conrad, it really isn't a hotel geared toward families (in my opinion) however, they easily accommodated us during meals and our son even became somewhat of a staff favorite throughout our stay. Hope to enjoy future Conrad stays in our future!","Minato, Japan",7,5.0

Combining an excellent location in Tokyo, walking distance to Ginza and close proximity to several subway lines, with extremely nice rooms and decor, and top-notch service, this has always been our favorite hotel in Tokyo (which has so many wonderful places). Even the regular rooms are spacious and nicely appointed, with comfortable, supportive mattresses, huge windows, large bathroom with separate tub and walk-in shower, and of course toilets with Toto Washlets.The most significant problem with this hotel is that smoking is permitted in open areas off the lobby. This forces guests to be subjected to tobacco smoke while walking between the guest elevators and the ground floor elevator (a long walk when one is suffering from severe tobacco allergy). Since Japanese people smoke in higher numbers than other modern countries, it's reasonable for the hotel to have smoking floors and smoking areas. However, it's entirely unreasonable for these areas to be open to the lobby. This eliminates any choice in tobacco exposure, forcing all guests to be exposed to heavy concentrations.The Executive Lounge is an inviting place to relax. There should be better signs explaining what the food items are, since people are constantly asking each other and lounge staff. When the hotel is at high occupancy, the lounge becomes stressfully overcrowded, with waiting lists for a table, and no room to walk to or from or at the buffet without getting in people's way and vice versa.We breakfasted at the Chinese restaurant at the far end of the lobby hallway, which boasts terrific views of the bay and a small but high-quality buffet, However, it too feels overcrowded even when only just over half the tables are occupied, since there isn't much space around the buffet, so it's stressful trying to maneuver around people and not block other people.The health club has a 25-meter indoor pool, but it's very narrow (two lanes wide). It is often undivided, but when crowded is divided into two lanes, one packed with adults and kids ranging from infants to teens, the other signed for circle swimming. However, circle swimming really needs multiple lanes segregated by speed, since it only works when everyone in the lane is doing roughly the same speed. It's a disaster when four or five people are paddling at 4-5 minutes a lap, and two or three people are trying to swim 1-2 minutes a lap, and someone wants to swim at 40 seconds a lap.",South Pole,270,5.0

The area this hotel is in is much like all of them... It is above a major station, it is walking distance (10 min) to Ginza and it is across from the most idyllic park that you can spend an afternoon in. So that being said we arrived to the hotel that is incorporated into a much larger building and located on the upper floor. We were met at valet and escorted up to check in... at the elevator they meet you and make you feel like you are the only one staying there as they take you to check in. Our room was not ready but we sat and had High Tea (see pics) and enjoyed the incredible view of the bay. Once our room was ready we were taken to our Suite that was modern yet warm and probably the most well laid out hotel suites I've stayed in. There is an entry foyer with a small visitor bathroom you walk past a double entry walk in closet towards a spacious and well decorated living room, office space and views to die for! Off of that area is the master suite that can be completely separated from the living room if you have guests visiting by simply sliding the doors closed. The master suite has a wonderful bed and sitting chaise lounge to enjoy the view. Both of these main spaces have large LED TV's and excellent lighting. Off of the master suite is the master bathroom with excellent walk in shower and deep soaking tub. Double sink and WC separately enclosed. Did I mention heated floor! You can also access the walk in closet from the bathroom side as well as the foyer (and all of your cloths or mess can be closed for no one to see!). The suite/room is excellent. The pool and spa can be fully accessed and is shared by the residence from what I could understand but there was never anyone in either place. It was like using a private spa with all the service and excellent amenities you would want and it was included in our stay. The hotel has several restaurants beside the lobby area which is where they have the bar and high tea. We tried China Blue and it was exceptional and from what I understand a few years back a Michelin star dining experience. It still could be in my mind. We did not try the other restaurant nor have the buffet for breakfast but we did have room service for breakfast and dinner. Service, presentation and food were spot on. They even accommodated a special non menu food request. This is our place to stay in Tokyo and that is not given away easily especially with the quality hotels and services that are available. It was not stuffy but had 5 star appeal. Part of why you stay are the amenities but a big part is the service. From valet to room service we were treated with a response that insured they cared about giving only the best. Ari and Yuku set the tone for many days for us. They would alway be meeting us at the elevator and going beyond to help our special requests. Ask for them but likely if you meet a sweet stylish man and friendly lady somewhere near the lobby you will be engaged with them and they will make your stay even better.

But you can also walk to the hotel from JR Shimbashi station (Yamanote line), and it takes only 15 minutes. It is possible to go from JR Shimbashi station to the hotel completely by the underground, which means you don't need an umbrella even on a rainy day. There are a drug store (Shiodome drug), a convenience store (Famima) just down the escalator from the entry of the hotel as well as some other shops. The hotel is on the upper floors of a tower, and the reception is on the 28th floor, if I remember correctly. There are city view rooms and bay view rooms. The rooms on higher floors are executive rooms with access to the executive lounge. The executive lounge is very good, offering breakfast, afternoon tea and pre-dinner cooktail/appetizer.We had a bay view room, with a nice view of Hamarikyu garden and Tokyo bay. When we arrived, we found a Conrad duck, and on returning after cocktails, the turndown service left us two small Conrad teddy bears, which was a nice surprise. A small detail, but there was only one box of tissue paper in the rather spacious room, which,, we thought was a little strange for a hotel of this class.For breakfast in the executive lounge, there was a good choice of food and drinks. There was even a cook, who prepared different kinds of omlets. We noticed that smoking was allowed in the restaurant next to the lobby, which is not really agreeable.As a whole, we think this hotel is a very good choice to stay near central Tokyo, as Shimbashi is one of the stations of JR Yamanote loop trains, which allows you to go todifferent parts of Central Tokyo easily, with easy access to Narita airport (Limousin bus from the hotel, Narita Express from Tokyo central station) and to Haneda airport (Limousin bus from the hotel, Monorail from Hamamatsucho), for instance.","Lyon, France",163,5.0

Food is average for a property of this caliber.My only issue is the smoking (which admittedly is everyone in Japan) in the large bar on the main floor is awful and recirculates to the restaurant and elsewhere.

The location of the hotel is not at a busy area but centrally located above the Shiodome Subway station and within close proximity to everywhere. We took a car or cab everywhere, and everywhere took us no more than 10-15mins. The hotel is located above an office building at the 28th floor, thus every room should have decent view of the park across. It's a really huge park (almost like NYC central park). lovely.From the doormen to the room hospitality service staff , everyone of them is Super! We have stayed at many lovely hotels and combined with the famed Japanese manners, every member of the team at Conrad takes customer service to a different level. I must say, we are very impressed with the level of service, almost everyone remembers us upon our return 2 weeks later. Room service staff made special efforts to get to know my teen daughter/ son who opted to stay in for in room dining a couple of times making their stay extra special. We had breakfast included on the club floor during both stays so I can't comment on the breakfast downstairs. However, in room dining and the restaurants downstairs are very expensive if you ask me. We are foodies and we go everywhere to hunt for awesome food and won't mind paying for it, but I am not sure I will pay for a $30 salad.Spa is very expensive as well but well worth it! I had massages and made a couple of purchases too. Wifi is not included so everyone has to purchase a pkg or you can use the public wifi at the lobby. Purchased wifi is glitchy. I wasn't pleased with that but it did not bother me too much since I only use it to check emails. As with all other hotels, they tend to overbook and on our return on the last leg of our tour the front desk personnels could not find us the adjoining King suite we reserved and was very professional to honour the booking by providing us an alternative suite compensating for the one we had booked.

The curtains and blinds were powered electrically. We also like the glass wall to the bathroom which has electrically powered timber venetian blinds. The blinds can be set at different heights with the venetian blades at any angle. So the blinds can be used to adjust for any preferred lighting level during daylight hours.The full length couch along the width of the room below the window was so useful and comfortable. The bed and sheets were very comfortable, the pillows smelt of lavender and we slept very well.We were impressed with the excellent attention to details in the room- I noticed the bathroom mat never moves out of position as there was a non slip mat under the former. Only one wishlist item missing from our room, according to my wife, was a full length mirror.We had the buffet breakfast in the restaurant which offered American, Chinese and Japanese food. Service was swift, no sooner than a plate or cup is empty, then it is taken away. The variety and quality of food were very, very good. We especially enjoy the fresh fruits.The executive lounge had set times for breakfast and for afternoon tea. It was a very relaxing lounge with Service in there being excellent. There were also a good range of snack food in the afternoon.Finally, my wife tried on a dress in a shop in a shopping mall 20 minutes by Metro from Shinbashi Station on our second night and left her long necklace in the fitting room. When we needed help to find the necklace (as the Shop, amongst numerous other shops had closed) the Lounge Concierge, Terao Naomi, went out of her way, on her day off work, to goto the shop that morning to retrieve and bring back the necklace for my wife before we check out.

Before we went out for the day, my husband called the front desk or housekeeping for them to fix the drainage problem while we were out. When we got back that night, it was not fixed. As we were too tired and it was too late to have someone come in to do it, and I really wanted the use of both sinks (3 people including our son), I ended up fixing the problem myself (which turned out to be a fairly simple fix), but it did annoy me. However, the overall experience at this hotel was so amazing that it made it easy to ignore.It would be nice if the Sauna/bath hours were a little longer. I waited until later to do my lap swimming so it was less crowded, but by the time I was done swimming at 9:45pm, I had no time to enjoy the amenities in the bathroom.

My husband and I left before 3 am to walk over but there were no signs to direct us on where we were supposed to go to get our tickets. We read the information sheet given, but unless we missed it, there was no map indicating where the check-in was. We had bad directions from the workers at the market and were led deeper into the restricted sections. We were lost and no one were willing to help. By the time we got to where we were supposed to, they had just given out the last ticket. As such, we missed the tour and were deeply disappointed because doing Tsukiji Market tour was the reason why we chose to stay at the Conrad.  Aside from some of the issues we experienced, the hotel stay itself was impressive.","Redondo Beach, California",16,5.0

One of two very minor drawbacks of the hotel for me was that it is a bit out of the way for pedestrians. My second thought for the hotel would be to somehow increase the size of the executive lounge.

We enjoyed the spacious room, well-designed public spaces, and abundant art. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful. Thanks especially to Lambert, who helped manage breakfast in the main restaurant. He was super-friendly and recognized us each day. He provided helpful sightseeing tips for a later trip to Kyoto and also suggested a favorite Japanese white wine. The location is very good and a nice refuge from the bustle of Tokyo. The hotel is close to both the fish market and Ginza. We used public transit extensively. The Shiodome station is right outside the hotel but only serves one subway line as a local stop. The Shimbashi stop is a 7-8 minute walk and has many more connections. (The Shiodome stop is also on the monorail, which goes to Odaiba. I’d recommend taking that for some interesting views of the bay and just a nice break from walking.)In terms of HHonors, I made this reservation last year using points as a Diamond, but slipped down to Gold this year. The basic award room is a city view. They offered us an upgrade to a bay-view room, or a city-view room with lounge access, but not both. We chose the bay view room since we typically aren’t around to enjoy the hotel happy hour. Very happy with that decision, since the breakfast in the hotel restaurant was excellent and we loved waking up to the bay view from the room. (But the city view is still interesting and we probably would have been fine with that, also.)One con is the smoking allowed in the lobby and bar area, but it wasn’t a huge deal – just a little unpleasant. I’d also note that the water pressure in the room sinks was very low, enough that we would have asked for a fix if we’d stayed another day. Also, the rooms have very few electrical outlets.","Denver, Colorado",73,5.0

As the years, passed, even as that hotel began to fade at the edges and many new, more glamorous properties entered the Tokyo market, I found the Okura to be the epitome of gracious, unobtrusive service. Even brief experiments with the Park Hyatt and the Mandarin Oriental, as beautiful/spectacular as they are did not induce a change of heart. But, alas, after my final stay at the Okura last August (the Main building’s final weekend before its scheduled demolition), I found myself without a preferred hotel in Tokyo…Last month, as I began planning a birthday trip, I was surprised to read the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor about the Conrad Tokyo. A Conrad? A part of the Hilton portfolio? I just couldn’t see it as a replacement for my beloved Okura. But fellow travelers on TripAdvisor have more than once introduced me to wonderful properties around the world so I decided to give it a try.To skip to the punch line, my experience at the Conrad was AMAZING!I stayed four nights in an Executive King room overlooking Tokyo Bay (an unexpected and very welcome upgrade from my City View room.) The view was breathtaking and the room was spacious and airy with a large, beautiful bathroom. Less than an hour after arriving in my room, an attendant rang the doorbell to offer me a slice of birthday cake; later that evening, I returned to the room (housekeeping makes up the rooms twice everyday) to find a teddy bear with a Happy Birthday tag on my bed…are you kidding me…? :-)Yes, the property is stunning; rooms and public spaces are beautiful with spectacular views (great Martinis at the bar) and the location is a dream: easy walk to Ginza; Tsukiji (go soon if you want see it in its present location); and Shinbashi Station via underground walkway. But what sets this property apart is the standard of customer service one encounters at every turn. From the moment I stepped out of a taxi to the moment I was escorted to the Airport Limousine Bus, I was made to feel like a special and honored guest. And believe me, I am allergic to over-the-top, artificial niceness – somehow the staff at the Conrad Tokyo manages to get it just right.The Executive Lounge is small but cozy with kind, attentive service; on the weekends, the staff bring you composed plates with a selection of the evening’s appetizers and snacks to enjoy with your preferred drinks. One morning, I tried breakfast in the main restaurant (included, if you like, when you stay in an Executive floor room) and although the food and ambience were wonderful, I found that I preferred breakfast in the Executive Lounge which even has a chef on hand to cook your eggs to order. At the very last minute, the Executive Lounge concierge staff was able to book a lunch reservation for me at Kyubey; they must have informed the restaurant that it was my birthday as the restaurant not only had created a special decorative place setting for me but even assigned me my own private sushi chef for lunch!While I could go on at length about the many kindnesses I experienced while at the Conrad, I will use the following as an illustration. Having checked out and done a bit of last minute shopping in Ginza, I was sitting in the main floor lobby waiting for the Limousine Bus to Narita Airport. Deepak, a member of the customer relations staff whom I had met the day before, saw me and immediately came over to make sure I was alright. When he realized I had a bit of a wait, he stayed with me and we had chatted until the bus arrived at which point he walked me to the bus and stood, waving, until I was on my way. This is the sort of kindness that I have only experienced at the very best Japanese hotels among which I now count the Conrad Tokyo.I am already planning my return and I urge any fellow traveler who relishes the idea of luxury accommodations and impeccable service in one of the world’s most exciting cities to give the Conrad a try.","Chicago, Illinois",38,5.0

You can see how luxurious and high end the rooms are from the pictures if you have never been, but my favorite part about the room that the pictures don't do justice for, is the bathroom. The bathroom is huge for a Japanese 5 star hotel. And if you were to ask me, why stay in the Conrad with such an expensive price tag with a plethora of options available in a mega city like Tokyo....I would say the ace of this hotel is the concierge. Being a non-Japanese speaker, Tokyo was a destination for us to do a ""Foodie Trip"". Many restaurants have difficult to pronounce, say, and or read Japanese signs and names. We used the Conrad concierge for almost every restaurant reservation we needed. This where we extracted value from the high costs of the room. Overall, if you stay in Tokyo for 2-3 nights only. Conrad is worth it. ","Manila, Philippines",180,5.0

The standard room which we had booked was very large by Tokyo standards and all the hotel amenities were beautiful. The hotel was located close to the train station so it was fairly easy to make it all the way from Narita by Train (you do switch trains and walk about 5 minutes after). The spa was also very nice with saunas and whirlpools available for use even without booking a spa treatment. The staff also sent up special little gifts and desserts for our honeymoon which was a nice touch. We also had a package delivered from the US which arrived with no problems.

We had a city view room, with a beautiful bathroom with a large glass wall separating it from the rest of the room.

In the past when we've redeemed loyalty points our experience has sometimes been that we're treated like ""second class"" guests because the hotel doesn't see cash revenue from the room rental for us. In another instance, the hotel assigned us to a horrible room. When we went to the front desk to ask for another room, the Front Desk person actually said what do you want for free? It was in this context that we were wondering how we would be received at this totally elegant, and ultra luxurious hotel.OH MY GOODNESS! Our fears couldn't have been more misplaced. From the moment the doorman took our bags all the way until someone walked all the way to the lobby with us we immediately felt comfortable and welcomed as good friends might. The lobby was up on the 28th floor with the restaurants and bar. The view was absolutely stunning. Again we were greeted warmly. We were able to take an earlier train so we arrived much earlier than we anticipated so our room was not ready yet. The front desk had someone show us up to the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor to wait while they prepared our room. No sooner did we relax with tea and scones then the Concierge came to present us with the key to our room. We went down to the 36th floor and walked into our Executive King room with a stunning view of Tokyo Bay. We had sushi in the hotel's Japanese restaurant that evening with not only incredible choices, but an absolutely delightful time with the engaging sushi chef. I can't possibly say enough about how genuinely welcomed we have felt, nor how wonderful everyone on the staff has treated us! Even with a couple of odd requests from us, the staff was spot on. This is a wonderful example of what the Conrad brand stands for. Clearly the Tokyo Conrad sets a high bar for service and concern for their guests.

This hotel offers beautiful accommodations and common areas (which you can also find at other luxury properties in Tokyo), but the main thing that stands out about the Conrad is the service. I have never had such wonderful service at any hotel in my entire life. Every member of the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful at all times. It almost became humorous at times, but the staff was so well-trained that it never was overwhelming.My only minor complaints were the location (which is not great for tourists) and that this hotel did not do a great job of recognizing HHonors status. I am Diamond and I did not feel like I was treated much differently than any other guest. Of course, since this hotel appears to treat all guests so phenomenally well perhaps that is simply to be expected.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",16,5.0

We have previously stayed at The Imperial Hotel and my husband has stayed at many 5 star hotels in Tokyo on business. Husband suggested The Peninsula or The Palace but I found the Conrad Tokyo on Tripadvisor and wanted to stay here due to its location and very positive reviews. The Conrad Tokyo is excellent in every aspect and surpassed expectations! It is the only place we will stay when we return to Tokyo!We received a warm greeting at the front desk and upgraded bay view room #3611 which was ready within 15 minutes of our arrival. I normally book the night before when I arrive early in the morning but took a chance as we have Hilton Diamond status. We took this time to speak with the lobby concierge (unfortunately I can't remember her name) who worked hard and went out of her way to obtain great seats behind home plate to a sold out Tokyo Giants baseball game. The tickets were delivered to our room that evening along with directions to Tokyo Dome. Thank you! The executive room overlooking Hamarikiyu Gardens and the bay was new, impeccably clean, comfortable and very well furnished. It was quiet and provided an excellent nights sleep. We could have used a few more drawers tho as we had brought lots of clothing with us for a month long trip. Housekeeping and turn down service were also excellent. The lounging sofas against the window were very comfortable and a great play to read or just soak in the beautiful view. The bathroom with a view was excellent. We loved the little stuffed Conrad bears they put on your pillow! The personalized welcome note from The General Manager and box of sweets were very much appreciated. There was no question this was a true 5 star hotel.Service in the executive lounge was excellent. They made dinner reservations for us at China Blue, Kazahana, Tempura Tenkuni and at Inakaya East in Rappongi. Unfortunately they were not able to obtain tickets to Eric Clapton for us at the last minute regardless of the cost. I don't think they have concert ticket brokers in Japan. Breakfast service was great including a chef to cook eggs if you so desired. Nice variety of appetizers at night. We were disappointed there was no Rum available to enjoy a Rum & Coke cocktail at night so we opted for good Japanese beer instead. Very friendly, professional staff.Dinner and service at the hotel's Chinese Restaurant China Blue was very good and held its own compared to the Chinese food we ate two weeks prior in both Shanghai and Beijing. Teppanyaki dinner and cocktails (No wine) at the hotel's Kazahana restaurant was the most expensive dinner for 2 we have ever had at 81,785 yen or $750 US, but it was well worth it!!! We had our own chef in a private room with a view of the bay. From the salad, to the sashimi, whole live lobster, huge live abalone, 2 types of Kobe beef, vegetables and fried rice everything was PERFECT! Our dessert was served in the restaurants lounge. It was a most enjoyable evening. We must do it again!We had drinks on 4 occasions at Twenty Eight which is their lobby bar/lounge. While they prefer you to have a reservation, we were seated each time with no problem. There was both live music fas well as a DJ at night. Smoking is allowed although they do have a non smoking section by the DJ. Drinks are expensive for Tokyo standards, but you are paying for the beautiful view. We were joined for drinks one night by our son who flew in for the weekend and stayed 2 buildings down in a luxury apartment with one of his high school friends who is going to University in Tokyo. They were underdressed by my standards but we still received excellent service.We loved the location of this hotel in Shiodome. Perfect for Hamarikyu Gardens and the ""water bus"" to Asakusa, Tsukiji fish market, shopping and The Lion Beer Hall in Ginza. We also walked to The Imperial Palace, Hibya Park, Yasukuni Shrine and the War Museum but chose to take the Metro back.What stood out the most this visit was a wonderful gesture by Deepak at the front desk. We had a very nice conversation with him at check in while the concierge was on the phone securing the baseball tickets. When we returned to our room in the evening on the first night our doorbell rang. Deepak had sent up a lovely tray of fruit along with a very nice note. This touched my husband deeply. We enjoyed speaking with him throught out our stay. He is an asset to the hotel and should be commended.If it was possible to give this hotel 6 stars, we definitely would. We are 'younger"" retirees and travel extensively. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel as THE BEST hotel in Tokyo. It is among the BEST in the world. We will definitely return.","Los Angeles, CA",94,5.0

The Conrad is graceful and sleek, while maintaining a comfortable atmosphere. The rooms are beautifully appointed and the views are stunning. I was graciously welcomed by Daisuke (who went to college in California so we had lots to discuss), and then shown to my room by Marie, who was absolutely delightful. I decided to splurge on a massage which was, by far, an excellent decision. The entire gym, pool (don't miss this) and lounge area are peaceful and inviting. My massage therapist, Ran, was excellent. The experience began with a cup of tea, followed by the massage, and then off to the relaxation room - a quite dim room with comfy couches and down poufs. Ran brought me more tea, some light snacks and left me to take in the whole experience. Once done in that room, I adjourned to the spa where they offered individual jacuzzis, a steam room with eucalyptus and a dry sauna. Frankly, i did not want to leave. I only stayed one night, but it was just perfect. The Ginza area is within walking distance and as others have mentioned, the metro is under the hotel, which is very convenient. There is a gorgeous garden/park across the street and the Fish Market is also within walking distance. Ari, the front office manager, made my check out a dream. He handled a very busy desk with efficiency and many smiles. I couldn't think of a better person for that position! Thank you everyone for a job very well done!","Los Angeles, California",2,5.0

We stayed three nights, and the Conrad Tokyo was by far the best of the bunch. Even before our arrival, Mieko, a member of the concierge team, spent hours exchanging numerous emails to help us plan our itinerary for our stay in Tokyo. She also made reservations for us at Sukiyabashi Jiro, Kondo, and Toriki well before our arrival to Japan (there was a miscommunication regarding Toriki, which she fixed after we arrived at the Conrad). Though we were not staying at the Conrad until the final 3 nights of our trip, we still emailed Mieko with questions instead of asking the concierge at the other hotels (Gora Hanaougi, Hilton or Park Hyatt). We had communicated with them prior to arriving and all three places gave us the sense that we were bothering them, they answered with short responses. Whereas we could sense Mieko wanted to help and all her responses were thorough and she was more than willing to answer follow up questions.) Another example, while staying at the Park Hyatt (we wanted to check out the hotel bc of the movie), we asked the concierge if he could direct us to a store to purchase Suntory whiskey. The concierge pretty much told us there were no places in Tokyo, that it was all sold sold out, and told us that we might be able to purchase it at duty free at the airport (but he didn't offer to call to find out if we could or not). Luckily, we did not take the Park Hyatt's information as the final word. I emailed Mieko and within an hour, she sent directions to a store she had contacted that she confirmed had Suntory in stock.! A completely different level of service!The hotel was gracious enough to upgrade us to a Bay View Suite since we were celebrating my partner's birthday. And Mieko had a very nice spread (fruits, cake, chocolates) sent up to our room! The room was very nice, and the view was great! You could choose from 4 different brands of bath products. We didn't know which we preferred, so they provided a set of products for all four brands! The breakfast downstairs was very nice (though we'll admit the breakfast at the Grand Hyatt Taipei was nicer, with more variety). And the Executive Lounge was very nice, with a good selection of sweet and savory offerings, and also a good selection of drinks. Each evening, we looked forward to going to the lounge after a day of sight seeing for some bubbly and snacks, before we went back out for dinner. The hardest part was having enough self control not to eat too much in the lounge!The Airport Limousine bus picks up directly from the Conrad and we decided to take that to Narita since we had 4 bags and did not want the hassle of going up and down the train stations. We purchased a one way ticket plus one day unlimited subway pass combo ticket from the ticket office at Shinjuku Station.Ask the hotel staff for detailed directions on how to walk to Shimbashi station. We walked the ""long way"" a couple of times before we figured it out.The Lounge had views of the city while we had a bay view and the bay view is definitely the nicer view, in our opinion.Everyone at the hotel provided excellent service and we will definitely try to stay at the Conrad Tokyo again the next time we are in Tokyo!","Dallas, Texas",101,5.0

The hotel is within a ten-minute walk of Shimbashi station and directly located above the Shiodome subway making it ideal for those who wish to travel around Tokyo – Shimbashi station itself is only a four-minute train journey to the nearest major station, Tokyo station.As we had three suitcases, and given how busy trains around Tokyo can become, we made two separate journeys in which the reception team very kindly stored our suitcases until the room was ready. There was a couple of hours wait as the previous guest had bought a late checkout for 3 PM, albeit this was not an issue as the receptionist very kindly offered us a different room or use of the executive lounge straight away as we had already upgraded via the Conrad Tokyo website before we flew to Japan. Given the excellent standards of the hotel, I fully believe the wait was an exception. We chose to wait for the room to be turned around instead of taking up the offer of a new room as the hotel is situated very close to the Ginza district meaning there was plenty to do. We also chose to appreciate the bar for an hour – the Sakura drink range is highly recommended! The room itself located on the 37th floor was grand – spacious, yet paired with a cosy feeling. The two small Conrad teddy bears and rubber duck were a nice personalised touch. The room was accompanied with a spectacular view overlooking the Tokyo bay and Hamarikyu Gardens. If there was any view I would choose as my favourite in Tokyo, it would be this one. It was the icing on the cake for an already fantastic room and stay. The upgrade to the executive floor cost around 10,000 yen per night but was worth every penny. This included access to the executive lounge with complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea, snacks and cocktail hour – between us; we comfortably covered the cost of 20,000 yen. A big thanks to the all the staff for their friendly attentiveness and also help with printing our boarding passes – they are a credit to your exceptional establishment.","Whitby, United Kingdom",11,5.0

Facilities were new or well maintained and view from hotel rooms were fantastic!Stayed 4 nights for honeymoon and it is always a joy to come back to the hotel for a rest after each enjoyable day of sight seeing in Tokyo. In room dining was delicious if u r too lazy to walk out for meals.,"Singapore, Singapore",7,5.0

From the magnificent lobby on a high floor with great views of Tokyo Bay and park below. The famous fish market is only 10 mins walk away for convenient early morning sushi. The outdoor walkway connecting hotel to other buildings and areas is wonderful strolling (kind of like the Highline in NY City). One subway station is right downstairs and another train stop is upstairs for easy transportation. Our room was a Triple and is very grand, great seatee window view, large bathroom. We actually had the third additional bed removed as the ""twin beds"" were large enough for a couple in one and our Son was in his own. Room service was delicious as was breakfast buffer downstairs although quite pricey. As an alternate, there is nice coffee bar in office building next door on way to subway which is convenient for breakfast. The pool and Gym was fantastic to combat Jet lag...

This is right up there with some of the other excellent Conrads I've stayed at, namely Hong Kong and Dubai. Excellent property.I could tell that the property was going to be beautiful based on pictures online, but I was a tad worried about the location. Not knowing Tokyo very well, and being there as a tourist, I just wasn't sure where to stay. The Conrad didn't seem terribly central, since it's right up against Tokyo Bay, although it is close to Ginza, which I know is a major shopping/tourist district. Well, location turned out to be fine. Tokyo is so big and spread out, you are going to be taking the subway a lot no matter where you stay. Thankfully, the Conrad has very easy access to several subway lines, so it's pretty easy to get just about anywhere. And you can also walk to nearby Hamarikyu Gardens, Tsukiji fish market, Kabuki-za theater, and Ginza shopping.The Conrad itself is a beautiful hotel. It occupies the top 10 or so floors of an office building, but you'd never know it once inside. The lobby is on the 28th floor and has amazing views that take your breath away as soon as you get off the elevator. Very high ceilings give the whole lobby a very glamorous feeling, including the swanky bar/lounge off to the side where they have live singers at night.The room was also excellent. Chic design without being gimmicky. I love the modern elegance vibe that Conrad has going, so much better than many of the stuffy old Ritz and Four Seasons properties. The room itself was the standard king room but I was upgraded to bay view, which is the same room, just on the side of the property that overlooks the water. Rooms are very large (over 500 square ft), especially for Tokyo. Lots of technology in them, but easy to use. Gorgeous finishes, very quiet, fantastic views. My only small complaint would be about the mattress, which was VERY firm. You notice it as soon as you sit on it, feels like you just sat on a concrete slab. But, surprisingly, we didn't have any problems sleeping on it and didn't feel uncomfortable. I would prefer a softer, lush mattress where you sink in and feel like you're floating on clouds -- definitely not the experience here, but it wasn't really a problem.The only other negative I can think of for this hotel is that it's not 100% non-smoking. I know a lot of people in Japan still smoke, so maybe all/most hotels allow smoking to some degree, but I just find it so off-putting. We were on a non-smoking floor, so the only time we ever smelled smoke was in the lobby, where I think they allow smoking in the bar/lounge area. It wasn't very bad, but you could definitely get the faint odor of smoke sometimes as you passed through the lobby.As a Hilton Diamond member, we had access to the executive lounge on the 37th floor, which was fantastic. Beautiful space with more incredible views (toward the city, so a nice change from the bay view in our room) and a nice spread throughout the day. We'd go up there to get water, maybe have a coffee, and just relax and enjoy the view. The staff there were very attentive and friendly. After our first visit to the lounge, they remembered us on future visits and didn't ask for a room key or anything to prove we were entitled to access. Nice.As a Diamond, breakfast is incredible. You can go to the executive lounge, where they have a pretty nice buffet and cooked-to-order eggs, but you can also go to one of the main restaurants (Collage) in the lobby. They have a larger buffet there, plus you can order one main dish from the menu at no charge (all of this is free for Diamonds). It's a pretty swanky restaurant space, so the whole experience feels very luxurious. And they have a ton of staff constantly checking in on you, refilling drinks, taking care of anything you need.In fact, the staff throughout the hotel are superb. There are always a lot of staff milling around just looking to intervene if you needed help in any way. They all spoke English well, were extremely warm and friendly, and just made you feel welcome. I loved that we could approach the front desk at any time and always find someone to help us without having to wait in line. There is only one concierge, so occasionally they would be busy helping someone else, but we never waited more than 5 minutes to get to them. I also called down to the front desk a couple of times from the room and they would always answer immediately, including greeting me by name (a pet peeve of mine is hotels who never answer the phone at the front desk).Oh, I should point out the elevators. I've stayed in hotels where elevators are a problem (not enough of them, long waits, overcrowded, etc), but never had elevators stand out as a *positive* experience -- but that was the case here. They are super fast, plentiful, and just very pleasant to be in. I know, it sounds crazy, but it was a joy to take the elevator. One feature I loved is as soon as you hit the button to call the elevator, one of the banks immediately lights up to tell you that's going to be the one you board. It might take a minute or two for the elevator to come, but it knows right away which one will be coming. Oh, and once you get on, as soon as you hit the button for your floor, the doors close right away -- loved that.We didn't use the gym on this trip, but we did check it out and it was nice. The lap pool was beautiful, with great views of Tokyo skyline. Just can't say enough good things about this property. Highly recommend and look forward to returning sometime soon.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",79,5.0

After checking in at an upstairs reception area we went for a walk round the Hamarikyu Gardens which had lots of blossom being admired by many tourists. The walk took us over several crossings and past lots of road works which are happening at present. We returned to the hotel by the same route and had afternoon tea in the lounge before returning to our room which had wonderful views of the park. We ate in the lounge again that evening when a buffet which included mixed crudities was available. Breakfast in the morning was served in the Cerise restaurant. There was an enormous choice available for the buffet .We had time in the morning before leaving the hotel to visit two more Temples near Shimbasi. We then returned to Shidome on foot by overhead walkways.Our luggage was kept at the Concierge downstairs as we remained at the hotel until the afternoon.

The service here is personal and professional. Front desk was fast and attentive; concierge was always willing to help (a bit more about them later), restaurant staff were friendly and attended to the little things. One really cannot fault them for the service. The staff here really go the extra mile to make you feel welcome and special (some might find them overly effusive but not us).The room was big and comfortable. I have to say that the beds at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo are the best but I slept very well here. The best thing about the room must be the view. It is magnificent. The only food I tried here was breakfast, which was good but not great. I still enjoyed it.If I had to criticise this establishment, I would say that I wish that the concierge had better knowledge of the restaurants in the city. We had asked for a recommendation for a teppanyaki place and we were directed to a dated, touristy place that had the most sleazy ambience. Still, the service of the concierge in terms of sincerity and warmth was top notch.Finally, I want to say that I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo for two days prior to the Conrad; at the Conrad, for less money, I got a bigger room, with a better view, with one of the best service I've experienced.

We originally reserved a Twin Bay View Room, and since I had HHonors Diamond status, the hotel upgraded us to a Twin Bay Executive Suite without any hesitation. Although I had to physically call-in for the upgrade request to be processed, it was a pleasure to speak with the hotel staff. On the phone, all of them spoke excellent English and customer service was simply outstanding. This is a hotel that has been consistently ranked in the Top 5 for Best Hotels in Japan. You would not regret choosing this property. My family has stayed in dozens of Hilton-branded hotels in the past. From the Towers of Waldorf Astoria in New York City to Conrad Maldives, Conrad Tokyo is easily amongst one of our most favorite hotels. Breakfast was excellent, service was great, room was fabulous, gym was outstanding. Everything was carried out in perfection. This property is now my preferred hotel to stay at in Tokyo, both for leisure and business. If you want advises on sightseeing or to make a dining reservation, the concierge desk would be your friend. The highly dependable service can certainly be trusted. I had to get a new pair of glasses while I was in Tokyo, the concierge recommended a shop in Ginza, and I received my new glasses in less than 48 hours. They arrived in perfect conditions. I also shipped a mobile router to the hotel prior to my arrival, and when I arrived in my room, they were already on the desk waiting for me.

From there one can catch New Transit YuriKamome 1 stop to Shiodome (190Y JR pass not valid) but it is just as quick to walk along the level path which follows the course of the rail track. From Shiodome station follow the signs down an escalator and round the corner to hotel.Alternatively hotel is a 1400Y cab ride from Tokyo Station.Let me describe our experience. We arrived at the hotel at 1pm way too early to check-in (we thought) but at least we could leave our bags. Bags dropped at ground floor we were directed to the express lift to 28th floor reception. There the receptionist apologised for our room not being ready (why should it have been? we were 2 hours early) took our details, said she was upgrading us to executive club and took us to the 37th floor lounge. We had coffee and nibbles and had just started afternoon tea when we were told our room was ready and to our surprise and delight found ourselves in a suite on floor 36 overlooking Tokyo bay.The suite had a large sitting room, a large bedroom, a deluxe modern bathroom and every conceivable comfort. Best of all were the large picture windows with a view to the park below and out across the harbour, a great view by day and spectacular by night.As part of our package we had the option of dinner in one of three restaurants, we choose the Japanese which was first class, see review. Before dinner we went back to the lounge where drinks (soft drinks, quality wines or spirits were available) as well as delicious snacks.Breakfast the next morning was in the lounge with a wide choice of food and cooked to order omelettes. Check-out was at noon, but tempting as it was to linger in the hotel we wanted to see something of Tokyo so we checked out and left our bags on the ground floor before spending the day in Tokyo. We returned to collect our bags before starting our onward journey.So what was so special? In truth the whole package but especially the service. All staff were exceedingly courteous even to the extent of being greeted by a housekeeper in English. When asked for directions say to a different area of the hotel the member of staff walked you there rather than simply giving directions. The service in the lounge was unobtrusive but first class.The location worked well for us with easy access to JR lines and the views from the lounge and our room were stunning. When I booked the room I thought the cost was outrageous, but accepted that this was the going rate for a 5* Tokyo hotel, having experienced such luxury and service I now think it was remarkably good value.Others have described the hotel as world-class. I would not disagree.","Eastbourne, United Kingdom",465,5.0

Good location with easy access to JR and Metro line. And short cab away from Tokyo Station (1400Yen). The room are wonderful, the staff amazing! Tried the Japanese restaurant and service was sublime! The view from city room view is gorgeous. The reception is very helpful. All in all it made my 5 night stay really good! The one exception I would say is the bar area. Every time I came for high tea, it was full and with reserved table empty! I was slightly frustrated! I read that there was a smoking section from other reviews, i dont mind it just as long as I am not sitting next to a big smoker! What I find is missing is just a regular bar area. There is something of that sort but it isn't like a normal bar with a barman that you can see them work. It would help have more seats available for solo travellers! I almost had a sense that they didn't want to give me a table that could seat two people. I felt badly which I don't like the feeling when I choose an hotel so carefully. I wanted the special for the tea and that too was sold out. So I was quite disappointed. I decided to have a drink! Lolol alcohol does the trick lololThey did try to make it up by offering me to change table. But it was too late for me! Better luck next time!So would I recommend this hotel absolutely! I would just warn you to reserve in advance if you really want to have tea in the non smoking area!","Montreal, Canada",19,4.0

Having been to Japan before and stayed at other 5* properties there, we would easily say that this hotel is by far one of the best hotels we have stayed in. Yes, the room is as fantastic as they say, the breakfast is probably the best we've had in any hotels, but what really sets this hotel apart from others are the staff. Particularly, Lambert who worked at Cerise was so pleasant and we felt that he genuinely wanted us to have a good time in Tokyo. He made us feel very welcome every morning at breakfast. Also, when we ran into trouble cancelling a restaurant, another team member, Ari spotted us in the crowd and offered his help. We really feel that he went up and beyond his call of duty to help us.

This hotel did everything right. Before I even arrived, I was in constant contact with their concierges setting up airport pickup, dinners, spa appointments, and communication was friendly, helpful and super- easy. Pickup was without a hitch, check-in was so easy, warm and welcoming. The lobby is in a word, stunning. I was immediately put at ease and could not wait to see our room. I'd heard that hotel rooms in Tokyo were tiny like in NY, but ours was not. Our room was perfect. Sitting room/ living room, nice- sized bedroom, closet/ changing area and large extremely functional bathroom. Little things often bother me when I stay in hotel rooms when we travel... (not enough storage space or hooks, annoyingly large glowing alarm clocks, bright lights on smoke detectors on the ceiling, etc) but this room was so thoughtfully designed- plenty of hooks, super-flattering lighting, beautifully designed fixtures, plenty of storage, high end furniture and details.Service could not have been better. They were super- accommodating as we had to tweak our reservation, they actually had an available curling iron they loaned me for my stay (?!) The concierges were more than helpful- everyday as we requested our destination written out in japanese for taxi drivers, provided excellent advice while planning train travel, setting up dinners, setting up dinners in other cities after we left Tokyo. Most importantly, at certain times of day, concierge desks are mobbed- usually dinner time is the worst. At the Conrad, they have extra people working the desk and had floaters at the ready so no long wait times. Super- efficient. One team member I must mention was their amazing executive manager, Azwin Ferdauz/Ari. We had a package that was too fragile to hand- carry back home. He personally oversaw the packing and sending of our package and it was inexpensive to ship and beat me back to NYC!This is a fantastic property not far from the Ginza area. We went to see the other hotels we considered staying in on this trip... the Park Hyatt and the Ritz and honestly, The Conrad was the most modern, updated and stylish. It's not right in the center of everything- but then again everything in Tokyo is 20min in a taxi from everything else... it's a very spread-out city. Getting around was fast and easy. Beautiful bar/ lounge area (excellent sake-tinis!) extensive and delicious breakfast buffet, prompt and yummy room-service. EXCELLENT massages at the spa.Staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Property was gorgeous. Would absolutely stay here again. (didn't want to leave!!)

We decided to upgrade our room to a suite on the executive level, our room was incredibly spacious fitted with everything you could ask for. Arriving late from Hong Kong we ordered room service (teriyaki chicken) that was tasty and prompt in arriving and more than enough for two people to share. We had breakfast downstairs at the main restaurant, there was a huge choice and you wouldn't get bored of the selection after a few days. However what made the trip memorable were the gracious, friendly and very helpful staff..especially Ari and Nanusa who were a delight to talk to and gave us great tips to help us make the most out of Tokyo during our short visit. The executive club lounge was also great, I loved the pre-dinner drinks and canapés or just sitting with a coffee and a chocolate whilst waiting to check out.

I am a Hilton Diamond member and I booked a regular room with a city view. When I checked in online I saw they had me in a suite with a bay view. I did not think too much about it assuming that it was a mdest room upgrade. When I arrived I discovered my room was a spacious two room king suite with living room, powder room, bedroom iwth large closets, and a huge bathroom with a walk in rain shower, soaking tub, separate toilet room, and double sinks. My room had a head on view of the bay that was lovely. It's clear I got an upgrade that was a couple of levels above my booked room level and this is well above what Hilton requires the Conrad to do for an upgrade. I was so grateful to have the lovely room that I ordered room service several times rather than going out for meals. The hotel gym is very nice they have extensive weights and an elliptical machine, a bike, and some treadmills. They also have a lap pool. It's hard to find a swimsuit in Japan if you are a larger American so bring your suit with you if you want to swim in the pool. I ate breakfast downstairs in the restaurant rather than the executive lounge. The food was good but not over the top like some other Conrad properties (I can not name them here because Tripadvisor will disqualify my post if I do). The executive lounge is modest size but very very nice. The lounge staff let me come back in the evening of the day I checked out, to sit for a few hours before my late night flight out of Haneda. One thing I will say is that my bed had a very hard mattress. So if you like a firm mattress this is a good hotel for you, but if you want a soft mattress you might not like the beds at the Conrad.",southern california,104,5.0

Incredibly luxurious with great restaurant(s) and impeccable service. The lobby is located on a high floor, you need to get there via an elevator. But once you are there the experience starts. You are greeted like you are at a 5+ star resort. Check in was very smooth and warm. And there was an art exhibit at the lobby at the same time, so we managed to get some cultural program during the check-in as well :)Another elevator trip and you are in your room. We chose the club floor and never regretted it. The room itself features high ceiling, large window and a huge bathroom with shower and bath. The bathroom is state of the art including amenities, rain shower, two sinks and the heated electronic WC (a must in Japan, of course). The large windows are there for a reason - the view was just amazing. We spent a significant portion of our trip just admiring the Emperor's garden from the 30+ floor.The club lounge was on our floor and provided breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner snack for free. Food selection changed every day and to be honest, we could not justify going to a restaurant for breakfast or dinner with lounge food of this quality.You should however try at least one of their restaurants: French, Chinese and of course Japanese. We went for a sushi dinner at the Japanese restaurant, and I will never forget that experience. Michelin-grade sushi is something that is worth a trip to Tokyo.You can get a drink at the bar as well if you are not too hungry. Lobby becomes a nice night lounge in the evening with a nice view of the aforementioned garden and skyscrapers nearby.

From the moment you arrive, it really is pure luxury. We were upgraded free of charge to a bay view which is much nicer than the city view, the city room view room is mainly two tall buildings directly in front of the room, still not bad but go for the bay view. Our room was huge, my daughter and I had two large twin beds. The bed are comfy with luxury linen, beautiful soft pillows, I loved the turn down service, where they place a little teddy in your bed with a fresh pressed night gown, which of course I wore every night. The bathroom was huge with a lovely stand alone bath and views out of a huge glass panel into the main room and out to the bay(don't worry you are able to shut the blind!). The toiletries in the bathroom are of excellent quality with everything from toothbrush to shower cap, body cream, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, hairbands, razors, nail files, hairdryer, literally everything you could ask for. Bedroom and bathroom is immaculately clean and faultless with a stocked mini bar which we did not use. The breakfast buffet was small and compact however there was everything you could ask for. We explained to the waiter that we were vegan (no meat, no dairy) and he prepared porridge with soya milk for us every day. On the last day he even remembered us and had the porridge already made for us and knew we were checking out today. I particularly liked the fruit section with fresh kiwi, pineapple, apple, melon, orange and grapefruit and other strange fruits i didn't know the name of cut up and displayed perfectly . I used the gym one night which was adequate and open 24 hours, an abundance of fresh towels, water, bananas and apples were there for you to take. The Jacuzzi was fantastic, they are single use jacuzzis and absolutely perfect for a short 5 minute blast, again the sauna and steam room is perfect with lovely high quality body washes . Be prepared to go naked, it didn't bother me but it may some people. The staff are very friendly and go out of your way to help and assist you. Thank you for an enjoyable stay.The only complaint is that the maid took my daughters pink blanket which was in the bedding, you must ask the maids to be careful as if a child loses something like a teddy or a blanket it could affect them the whole holiday. The only other thing which is not the hotel's fault is getting around, its so difficult to work your way around even getting to the train station from the hotel is so difficult even though its only a 2 minute walk under the subway. The closest train station is Shiodome but Shinbashi is a 5 minute walk through the subway system.","London, United Kingdom",213,5.0

There were many more people than the last time we visited, and I believe it's for this reason that some issues with service and functionality arose. My family and I were guests during Christmas Holidays 2015, and I believe the hotel was fully booked. This caused quite a lag in the delivery of room service, as well as the suddenly slow and unreliable wifi service (last time we were there, it was lightning fast ). Most annoying however, was the constant presence of smokers at the bar directly across the lobby area where all guests must go through to enter and exit the hotel. For a strictly non-smoking family, this was a huge disappointment. The kids were exposed to it, as well as the asthmatics and there was really nothing we could do about it but hold our breaths as we hurried our pace to get it over and done with.When last we stayed, there would be a smoker or two but the ventilation easily purged away the smoke. This time, I guess, was just too much for the system to handle as revelers were jam-packed in the spacious bar with just slats to separate from the lobby.I do hope The Conrad addresses this; even if the issue is sporadic and wouldn't bother many other guests who aren't as particular about their environment being smoke-free as we are.

There was jogging route map around the hotel so we went for a run too.Breakfast, I enjoyed everything , specially my one and only vanilla latte served in Japan!Unfortunately we felt rushed since after 10:30am buffet is close(we woke up late and got there around 9:30am and we're done taking food by 10:30am, just wanted read newspaper and plan what we can do in Tokyo) and the lady server removed almost all dish plus unfinished my bf's coffee.It was sad that we felt we must go, since it was only us left in window side but when we go out we saw more people siting other side.Only negative about this hotel but next time hopefully we get up early!All staff was smiling and asked us how's everything and we felt very welcoming in our entire stay.Special mention/thanks to - young porter guy(sorry we didn't get his name but he loves Herschel bag!) He made sure we get airport shuttle ticket and there was change where we take shuttle so he showed us who will take us the bus stop.He was very cheering and positive!- gentleman who drove us to another hotel to take our airport shuttle! I know it was less than 5 min drive(haha) but he offered us water and took care of all the suitcases(it must be super heavy). We had 10 more min to take shuttle when we got off from Conrad car so he told us to wait inside. We thanked him and waited inside because it was cold. When we saw shuttle and went outside, he was still there and silently smiling and making sure we get in and our suitcase was taking care of. Wow! I was so surprised and I think I saw true customer service!Thank you! Big Arigato!Thank you Conrad for making our stay memorable!!! We'll be back ;)",,33,5.0

We loved Tokyo and The Conrad so much the first time that we decided to come for 3.5 weeks! After that amount of time you really get the true feeling of a city and of course, a hotel. Needless to say we are totally hooked! Japan is the best country on Earth and if you are lucky enough to get to Tokyo, I highly recommend staying at the Conrad. There are many reasons as to why but firstly the location is great. Directly above a metro station and 5 mins walk to the Shimbashi JR station, getting around is really easy. There are plenty restaurant options nearby. In general the food in japan is outstanding. From corner bakeries to Michelin restaurants we never had one bad meal. The Japanese take cleanliness really seriously, so you don't need to worry one bit about where or what you eat. Even 7/11's have delicious and fresh on the go meals. Secondly the service. It was amazing! The staff do whatever they can to make your stay more enjoyable. Check in was quick and efficient. We arrived really early and even though our room wasn't ready they gave us another room to rest in until our room was ready. We massively appreciated that after a 24 hour journey! The concierge team is superb. I've got to give a special thanks to Tomoko and Ryoko who took care of all our restaurant and show bookings and recommended fabulous sights and points of interests. The housekeeping staff kept our room spotless and the turn down service was consistent. Someone who made our stay extra special was Deepak. He went above and beyond for us and took the time to find out how we were enjoying our stay every couple of days. That meant a lot to us so thank you Deepak. Another shout out to Ari and Ayodo who were fantastic.The rooms are beautiful. Spacious and equipped with all the best technology. The beds are quite simply one of the most comfortable I have slept in. The curtains are total black out and not a sound can be heard from the hallways or neighbours. A good nights rest is guaranteed! The linen and towels are amazing. The only fault is the cupboard space which is pretty small especially for two people. The bathroom has a separate tub and shower and a double vanity. The breakfast spread was very good, many hot and cold options. A real treat is the view from breakfast room. In fact the views all around the hotel are amazing. Aesthetically the hotel in general is gorgeous, really well maintained and spotless. We miss Tokyo and The Conrad already and cannot wait to return. You won't go wrong with staying here I assure you!

I booked a King suite with bay view, and was not disappointed. What impressed me the most was that there were two toilets in the room, the main one in the bathroom, and another one in a small powder room situated next to the main door. The staff were efficient and quickly set up the room appointed to us, which includes my requests of an extra rollaway bed, (and as a HHonors member) some extra pillows, some adaptors and a humidifier. I caught a cold during my stay in Kyoto and wanted to see a doctor, and it was really awesome that a clinic was situated in Shiodome itself, the complex where Conrad is. In fact, getting to the clinic was just basically an elevator and escalator away! While located on the fringe of the main tourist area, most areas were accessible via the Shimbashi and Shiodome railway lines. Both stations are linked via an upper open air link way (which is really lovely to walk, weather permitting), or via the underground link way where restaurants and shops abound. Our room came with breakfast. On the first day or our breakfast, we noticed the absence of an egg station and we asked one of the staff where the egg station was. She came back with a menu where different egg dishes (and waffles) were listed but they were all priced separately. So we thought that these dishes would incur additional cost should we order them and thus we didnt. On the second day, once we were seated by the captain, he immediately informed us that the egg dishes on the menu were inclusive in our breakfast buffet and we were somewhat miffed that we werent informed of that on our first day. That said, special shout outs to two staff (we didnt get their names unfortunately) who made our stay seem more special: - the staff who came with a paper bag of stuff (extra amenities for the third person i the room) and set up the rollaway bed and humidifier. He was helpful, cheerful and efficient - the staff member who drove us to Royal Park Hotel to catch our shuttle bus to Narita Airport. He provided us with a bottle of water, accompanied us and our luggage every step of the way, making sure that our luggage were safely transferred, and that we were warmly ensconced in the van while waiting for the shuttle bus to arrive. Small things but on a freezing cold morning, these are truly appreciated.","Singapore, Singapore",10,5.0

Walking to Ginza takes about 10 minutes so it's not bad. The hotel occupies top 10 floor of the building and we stayed on 36th floor , in a suite with sweeping views of the bay, it's beautiful. The room itself is comfortable, bed is firm, large, and there is a separate living room area. It has a powder room for guests and also a walk in closet. The bathroom, however, was slightly disappointing. It's clean and neat, but not luxurious. No marble but with basic tiles. I guess this is really the only complaint. And of course I am comparing to other luxury hotels such as mandarin and peninsula ( which remains as my favorite in Tokyo) We had access in the lounge on 37th floor, funny it doesn't nice bay view but views of the city. Also it is way too small as each time I was there it was stuffy and full. (Breakfast, and early evening drinks) I think it needs to be at least double the size. We had breakfast here on 3 mornings and the omelettes were great!I also used the gym which was nice, the changing room has steam, sauna and a generous bathing area like a Japanese bath house with 4 individual jacuzzis. Concierge is also quite helpful in securing tough to get tables at restaurants. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would be returning in future. ","Hong Kong, China",60,4.0

We chose to stay in this hotel in Tokyo because we wanted strong service, particularly in helping us look into restaurants and other sights. I found the service lacking. Two examples as follows:First example:We checked in at 10 pm, and the concierge there spoke to us about a restaurant reservation we had made. We asked her about the tuna auction the next morning at Tsukiji Market. She recommended that we leave the hotel at 3:30 am. The next morning, bright and early at 3:30 am, we prepared to leave the hotel. We asked the staff in the lobby about directions to the market. He told us that his information (a printed sheet of paper that appeared to be for Conrad staff) showed that the market had been closed starting mid-Dec all the way until January. We were surprised because the concierge the night before hadn't told us it was canceled (and in fact gave us precise directions on time). He proceeded to double check the site, and informed us that indeed it was closed.We were disappointed to miss the auction, but also aggravated that we had gotten up at 3 am while being misinformed. I assume that the concierge staff should have known this given it is such an attractive tourist attraction, so near the hotel, and in fact the closure was for several weeks long. Second example:A member of the staff in the lobby asked if she could help us, so we asked her to help us confirm our restaurant reservation the next day. She had a lot of trouble communicating with us in English (a little strange - shouldn't they staff someone who has a better command of it to ask guests if they need help?). Finally she told us that the concierge was not here on Mondays and would be here at 7 am the next day. She also told us she would check on our restaurant reservation and would tell us upon check-out.We checked out several hours later. To our surprise, the front-desk staff told us the other staff member had left, and did not seem to have looked into the restaurant reservation. We had to wait for this new staff member to re-confirm our reservation, which made us nearly late for our lunch.I reached out to Conrad concierge to voice this complaint. I did receive a response back saying they are looking into it and apologizing for the confusion. At the end of the day, I expected better customer service and more professionalism.","San Francisco, California",122,3.0

We were especially impressed with the design and scale, including our room and the public areas especially the bar/lounge, China Blue restaurant, fitness/spa/pool and lobby/reception areas. Although the exec lounge quality and breadth of food and service were excellent, it seems to be too small of a space for the size of the hotel. The breakfast was outstanding as expected. Of particular note is the China Blue restaurant which although expensive, it was well worth it as the food is superb and unusual in a very good way! The hotel is located in what seems to be a central business area and is surrounded by other buildings and transportation network, so getting places is easy. It is located next door to a famous gardens, although we were not able to experience it as it was Jan. 1st and it was closed. Bay views are lovely which can be enjoyed from the bar/lounge and China Blue restaurants, but we had a room on the city side which was very comfortable but the views were nothing special. In contrast, we had also stayed at the Mandarin Oriental earlier in our trip where we could see Mt. Fuji at a distance from our room. We stayed on Hilton points which required 85K points which is very high but we were glad to have done so for the experience as it didn't disappoint.

It's an awful experience going through the lobby.The room is decidedly average, other than good shower pressure I wouldn't rave about anything.The breakfast is quite good and they serve the inclusive breakfast in the room, plus points for that.The location is ok, it's near Ginza (not walking distance), Shiodome, where the hotel is, is convenient for urban life but not necessarily for tourism. The club lounge offerings are boring. The alcohol selection is sub par. I like good whiskies good sake and shochu I drink most things. The vodka was absolute and the whisky was Johnny Walker Black. No single malts, no Japanese whisky, no Grey Goose/Belvedere, no Champagne, no decent wine. Not good enough for a five star hotel. Especially given how cheap alcohol is in Japan.The Consierge are not helpful, we asked for good sushi, they recommend Sushizanmai, which turns out to be a chain. We were looking for ""good"" sushi. I ended up going to Sushizanmai another night at 3 am when I discovered that another one of its branches is 24 hours. It's perfect at that time, but when we asked for good sushi at 1pm, I don't expect them to recommend a chain. Not that Sushizanmai is bad at all, my complaint is about the consierge's recommendation when we were looking for a fine dining experience. Another more serious complaint about the Consierge was when I requested to arrange to visit the Hakushu distillery. They could not tell me the price for a car with driver, they told me it's closed, which seemed unrealistic and strange, and when I asked for alternatives they were dumbfounded. This really spoilt my trip as visiting a Japanese Whisky distillery was one of the main things I wanted to do on this trip. It's worth nothing that when I enquired about a car with driver, the response was a ""whaaa very expensive"", which is very strange in a 5 star hotel. I was willing to pay, but clearly they weren't willing to check.A different day a member of my family asked about visiting Mount Fuji, and the consierge told them there's nothing to do there, again seems very unrealistic. They don't clean the rooms particularly well either.About the best the consierge could do was point out the nearest convince stores, anything beyond that seemed like too much work. Last time in Tokyo I was at the Park Hyatt, I don't know if it's deteriorated at all, but at that time it was a million times better than the Conrad is today. The reason I didn't pick the Park Hyatt again is because I prefer Central Tokyo, eg Ginza, Maranouchi, Shimbashi, Shiodome etc. to Shinjuku, which can be a bit rough and ready in comparison but given the quality of the Park Hyatt it's a fair trade off. Next time I will book the Andaz Toranamon or Mandarin Oriental. For anyone's first visit to Tokyo, make it the Park Hyatt for sure, it's not all talk it really is the experience you want and worth every penny. The other point to note is they are very stingy with upgrades. I am a HHonours Gold and even though rooms were available they didn't upgrade me. ","London, UK",79,2.0

The staff were all as efficient, polite & respectful as any top class Japanese business would be. We were upgraded to a bay-facing room on the 37th floor with Executive lounge access, a very well-received & appreciated gesture (thanks David Constantine!)My wife commented that the hotel room was one of the best rooms she had ever stayed in, a big brownie point to me. The high ceiling & wall to wall window offering a majestic view soothed even the most weary travellers. Everything spells class, from the plush soft room slippers to the extensive bathroom amenities completed with nice yakuza sleep gown to the electrically controlled blinds separating the glass wall between the room & the bathroom. We were pleasantly surprised by a nice plate of goodies with a personally signed card congratulating us on our anniversary in the room too (attached photo).The location is conveniently located next to Shiodome train station, and a short 15min casually walk to the Tsukiji fish market. This was an extra benefit of the hotel as we were able to walk to this famous attraction after an enjoyable breakfast at the Executive Lounge. We had enough time to get to Asakusa by train after Tsukiji & returned back with ample time to spare. Being Christmas time, the beautiful & magical Christmas illumination display was only a 5 min walk next door at Caretta Shiodome (we got there before their closing at 11pm!)The Executive Lounge offered ample breakfast range, both Japanese & Western style. While it may not be the biggest lounge, it is fairly spacious in Japan's standard when space is at a true premiere. Complimentary WiFi (Honours members privilege) in the room was also fast, with our request for a late check out also granted to accommodate our late afternoon flight departure at Narita airport.I need to also commend Conrad Tokyo on the efficient & prompt email communication before our trip. I was deciding on which hotels to book in Tokyo, and Conrad Tokyo helped made up my mind with their efficient & detailed responses to my queries which range from transportation to & fro airport, local attractions, hotel details etc. Thanks to the Conrad Tokyo staff that corresponded with me : Fukiko Matsuzaka, Azusa Ono, Sanae Sonobe & Mayuko Imamura.We were also greeted & farewelled by Mr Gearoid Lyons, Director of Operations, who took the time to make sure we were well looked after. This was the icing on the cake for a perfect overnight stay in Tokyo before continuing our anniversary holiday to USA.Thank you Conrad Tokyo & Mr Lyons for making my wife's first trip to Tokyo a truly unforgettable & happy one. We will be back.","Perth, Australia",65,5.0

I ordered a hot cocoa for my kids and they made it with bottled Hershey's syrup and charged me 1200 yen for it. Food is not this hotel's strong suit.

The hotel is also in a very good location, as there's quite a few things to see around the area, but it's also very well connected, so you can get to anywhere you want to go. The rooms were great, with great views. We had 2 double rooms, as we're a family of 4, and they were incredibly spacious and cozy. The indoor pool is stunning, with a stunning design and amazing views. We had room service while we were there, and the food was very good. I'm sure the breakfast buffet will be as enjoyable.

The hotel is just quality from start to finish, but my gripe with all such hotels is they can be a little overly helpful at times. I am quite capable of making my own toast. They also wouldn't allow cigar smoking until after 9pm, in the smoking area, to respect people having Christmas dinner; but they would have been perfectly happy for me to smoke a pack of 20 cigarettes. Silly rule. Don't serve food in the smoking section if it's an issue, but I assume the diners chose that area because they were smokers themselves. A good selection of cigars though. In room dining choice was excellent and the hotel location is within easy walking distance of the Ginza shopping district and its subway line which takes you all the way to Shibuya district.

Our king bedroom had a separate sitting area that could be closed off, a half bath in addition to the large bathroom and a large walk-in closet. The room faced Tokyo Bay and the beautiful Hamarikyu Garden. The room itself and the hallway were very quiet. The Lobby is on the 28th floor of the building making it necessary to use two elevators coming and going, which is a little inconvenient, but actually still feels more private and luxurious than the Peninsula. Many times an employee would see us walking to the elevator down from the lobby and press the button while asking if we would like to have a taxi called - nice touch. The gym is a nice size with sufficient machines and free weights and best of all is always open. The buffet breakfast was very nice and provided good variety during our 7 nights stay. The hotel is close to the Tsukiji Fish Market (soon to relocate and be replaced with Olympic Venues). It is also a short walk to Ginza and the Kabuki Theater. Train and subway stations are convenient to the hotel. The Service Manager, Ari, greeted me at check-out and was genuinely interested in my experience at the hotel.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not OCD. I just find it nice to be having the same habits I have at home--hence my last review for your hotel I mentioned ""like coming back home"".The following are the incidents during this one week stay with your hotel:1. On the third day of my stay, upon returning to the room I saw that the toiletries that I have arranged in a glass was partially ""spilled"" unto the basin area— two items were behind the basin, and one on the floor. It seemed like there was an accident, and the housekeeper left in a hurry.Also, the loungewear/pyjamas was placed in a diagonal fashion top on my worn, folded clothes on the drawer top in the closet— instead of putting it in the drawer or on the bed.2. On the fourth day of my stay, I went out before turn down service. Upon returning later in the evening, I realised that the used towels and one loungewear/pyjamas were collected but not replaced. I understand that there are usually four towels in a room, and two loungewear/pyjamas—and while i don't have a problem with two less towels in the room, i thought this is somewhat unusual.3. On the fifth day of my stay, upon returning after the day's sightseeing, I came back to the room seeing that the water bottles were not replenished. (Note: I highlighted to the front desk and it was sorted out.)But I have five bath towels in the room that night. And the lid to the box for the sanitary bag was not put on.4. On the sixth day, I came back to the room and saw the housekeeper's card in the card slot. I knocked and she allowed me INTO the room. This is a real shocker to me because during my previous stays, when this happened—the housekeeper would remove the card, and would ask me to use my own card to open the door. Security, right?Security is always a priority, and I think this shouldn't have happened anywhere. What if we are not the registered occupants to the room?5. Sanitary bag was not replaced on the sixth day during turn down service.6. Wash basin area and pedestal was noticeably dusty from second to fifth day.-----I do understand that this may be a very busy period for the hotel and the housekeepers; and I also understand the difficulties in maintaining a room, and that errors happens every now and then.Then again, some errors are just unacceptable, and should really be rectified.I do look forward to staying at Conrad again, and going 'home' once more.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",0,4.0

Our rooms were well appointed, with very comfortable beds and large bathrooms with tubs and showers. The rooms included complementary tea and water, with a full mini-bar and in-room options. Wifi is also complimentary with average speed, though the upgrade option provided very good speeds.The executive lounge was well run with great full breakfast buffet options in the morning, including omelette and Japanese-style options. In the evening, they had light hors d'oeuvres featuring small bites from one of the three restaurants in the hotel, plus champagne, wine, etc. Though the bar has a smoking section, the executive lounge does not allow any smoking.The staff always went out of their way to ensure we had a pleasant stay or help with suggestions for shopping, reservations for restaurants, etc. They also kindly held our larger suitcases for 5 days while we toured other cities with our smaller carry-on sized bags.Though the location is clearly in a business district, you have easy access to the incredible Tokyo subway (either by walking on the skywalk outdoors or underground if the weather is bad). You are a short walk to Ginza, a short taxi or Uber to Tokyo's main station, and the beautiful Hamarikyu Onshi Gardens are a 5 minute walk behind the hotel.Overall, I can easily recommend The Conrad to both business and vacation travelers looking for an excellent stay in Tokyo.","Bethesda, Maryland",63,5.0

I made a last minute change in hotel and decided on the Conrad due to the trains and subways available at the station located under the hotel.This is probably still one of the best ""modern"" hotel that I've stayed in Japan. Everything about it is spot on. check in was painless and they even had a guest relations officer greet my son and I to find out if there was anything else we needed. Well I needed 2 tickets to the car show, and the ticket machines at the 711 were hard to understand and I also wanted to eat at a specific restaurant that night. She immediately took care of it, and 10 minutes later in the room all was set.The room and view was perfect, Tokyo bay out the window, cant ask for more. The controls for the lights, blinds, curtain A/C etc. were all analogue buttons/knobs and easy to understand, this is something a lot of modern hotels don't get right. Most hotels, try to go high tech with touch screen controls, and preprogramed light settings, without realizing there is a learning curve that travelers sometimes have no time to deal with. Also touch panels don't work well with wet fingers, and have a 1 to 1.5 second delay between entering the command and execution.

The room we got was an executive on the exec floor, and it was fabulous: very large (not just for Japan) with a see-through modern bathroom (with an electric blind if you must) that had the biggest circular lit-up heated bathroom mirror I've ever seen in a hotel room, two lovely sitting sofa-ettes by the floor-to-ceiling windows, and all first-class amenities. Nice smell, very comfy bed, and quiet.The executive lounge was bijou in size, and perhaps a little full on one evening, but it had uber-efficient staff hurrying platefuls of canapes to guests who didn't even know they needed them. Ice-cream, cakes and a (small) selection of Japanese snacks complete the afternoon tea and evening service. No booze during teatime, but a somewhat economy selection available in the evening. Breakfast was good, with more tasty Japanese items in addition to a western breakfast with an in-lounge, live-but-grumpy Mr Chef turning out super-fluffy omelettes better than a French one could.The only gripe I have is that the main bar on the reception floor (34th or so floor, how nice!) was poorly served. After a loooong wait someone eventually came to us, then another looong wait, and we get a pretty good cocktail, marred by billowing clouds of smoke. Smoking area was choking off half of the big and long bar. We asked if we could move, ""sure I will come back when we have another table"" and no one came back even to say ""still busy"" (it was not too much) during the 45 minutes we stayed there.

We have done about all of the rest, from the Waldorf Astoria line, on down - but the first in the Conrad Group.We booked a ""Jr Suite,"" with HHonors points, and my first interaction was with the Concierge staff.We are very discerning diners, and wife has one food allergy (Bi-valves, so no Scallops, Oysters, Clams or Mussels), and I made our schedule and desires clear. The Concierge was excellent, and did all of the ""heavy lifting"" for us, giving me great descriptions of all of the options, for the nights available. I could not have asked for better service, or a better understanding of what we were looking for, including that one allergy. Absolutely great!As we had booked a pickup from NRT, that was our first physical encounter, and it was very good - everything just as outlined. Now, the only slightly downside of the entire stay was the road construction all around the hotel, and even our driver had a bit of an issue getting us to the front door (though he had been there just the week before - things had changed).Check-in was flawless, and we were given a complementary upgrade to a full suite. Remember, I booked with HHonors points!The suite was spacious, lovely, and the amenities were excellent, as was the view of Hamariku Gardens below. Other than having to explore the lovely shower's controls a bit, plus find where all the light controls were (should have asked our host), we were greatly impressed. At this point, I need to step back a bit. We have had the pleasure to stay at several Michelin 5-star hotels/resorts, plus some fabulous inns. The full suite at the Conrad Tokyo, gave them all a run for the money. Even doing the math (what that room ran with money, and not points plus an upgrade), the value was about as good as it gets, including many ""Presidential Suites"" around the world.All of the staff of the hotel were excellent, accommodating, friendly, professional and extremely helpful. We wanted nothing.After the trip, we reflected on the choices and reservations for the restaurants, including notice to each and all, of wife's allergy, and could not have asked for anything different. So nice to work with such a professional, and expert Concierge staff. They are the best!We visited the Penninsula Tokyo, the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo and the Ana Intercontinental, and none offered more, than what we encountered, in general terms.For us, loving to walk a bit, and to explore, the location was great, and when all of the street construction is done, I would deem it perfect, unless someone had a very specific location need.We are looking to go back to Tokyo, just to stay at the Conrad Tokyo again - it was THAT good.Photos to follow.","Phoenix, Arizona",2110,5.0

For context, we were 3 days in Tokyo, 3 days in Kyoto, and then 1 day back in Tokyo.First off – the pros: they kindly stored our luggage for us for our 3 day trip to Kyoto. Overall, service was top notch – attentive staff upon check in, in the lounge, and in the restaurants. Knowing we needed non-smoking room, they kindly checked the assigned room (on the smoking floor but next door to the lounge) to assure us it did not smell of smoke. The concierge was very helpful in arranging activities. In fact, the highlight of our trip was a Sumo practice we were able to attend that was arranged by the concierge with a former Sumo wrestler serving as the tour guide.The Exec Lounge was great with a nice breakfast, snacks and happy hour. The pool on the 29th floor, overlooking the city, was great. The sleeping rooms are larger than average with nice amenities. We enjoyed the city view – I don’t think the bay view is worth the extra $$ as you can get that same view from the Reception lounge, though smoky (see note below).The hotel location was good for us. You’re walking distance to a park where you can pick up the water taxi. It’s also walking distance to the morning fish market. There are lots of easy public transportation options nearby.Cons – You check in on the 28th floor and the reception is open plan with a connecting bar overlooking the city. The bar is smoking, so you’re greeted with the strong smell of smoke immediately upon exciting the elevator. Also, the Executive Lounge claims a no mobile phone use policy, but does not enforce – we had to listen to a family do facetime for 30+ minutes during the cocktail reception. Not cool. Also, as a family traveling with children we did allow our children into the lounge during the day but made sure they were well behaved. I was surprised at the number of people in there with babies – late at night – and noisily with rattles, screaming, etc. I believe there should be a no kids policy at certain times of the day (i.e., after 8 pm). And the lounge attendants should enforce the no mobile phone policy for all.Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. You pay for the privilege of staying here, but our family, the price tag was worth it.","Singapore, Singapore",112,5.0

From the marvelous breakfast buffet to the Japanese specialities restaurant, the foods and their presentations are very appealing. The guest rooms are spacious, well appointed and have numerous grace notes. [To an American like me, the self-sanitizing, heated toilet seat with its water rushing sound was interesting and instructive of the Japanese ideas about privacy and luxury.] The push button shades and draperies, etc held the theme of one's room being a tiny castle. The staff could not have been more gracious, solicitous or well-informed. From suggestions for activities to arranging transport and museum directions, they were great.It is easy to get the airport shuttle to the hotel before 8pm.

This is also a couple of walk to the well known Tsukiji Fish Market. Just outside Shimbashi station is a variety of shops and restos thats literally alive 24 hours a day.

It was very hard and first two nights my wife and I slept very poorly. When I enquires if we could switch rooms to a softer bed, was told apparently they are all the same. I think they must get this question often as they offered to add some blankets to the top to soften it a bit.

Location is in a quieter area than Shinjuku or Tokyo Station, however there are plenty of food places to eat at nearby. After a few days, we actually preferred this area since when you experience the amount of people traffic whom use the Tokyo metro system, you appreciate being somewhere which is quiet especially on a weekend. Btw, it is only 5mins walk to the Shiodome metro station or 10mins walk to Shimbashi station (larger station, basement food/shops to explore, great ramen place) which has the metro & JR line (can be accessed via underground walkways no need to worry about the rain).Stayed for a total of 5 nights split 2/3 since we also travelled to Osaka in-between.Booked a standard city view room on both occasions which was a great size with a full room length chaise long to lounge on.Was upgraded to a bay view room on the second occasion which has the same room size & format albeit, a slightly better view outside.Breakfast was of good quality & adequate mix of Japanese & Western fare.The staff at the Conrad are very much an international team with all speaking good English.

The only part which stopped me from giving full marks is the location, while the good part is you can walk to Tsukiji market from the hotel, the not so good part is its not near any mall and the station closest is not one of the key stations, a small disadvantage but if you can walk its about 15 mins from a key station and 1,000yen to grab a cab to Ginza.","Singapore, Singapore",20,4.0

We were arriving from the Roppongi area and finding the hotel from underground was easy. Location wise, we found the Conrad excellent for getting to different parts of the city, especially Ginza and Odaiba (the hotel is right next to the Yurikamome line as well). Also, it is very convenient to get to Haneda from here).Although we only had one night, we were happy with our stay. We were given a large suite-like room with two queens which was more than adequate and extremely comfortable. The room was clean, modern and overlooking the city.We did not get the chance to dine in the hotel or partake in the facilities but the lobby lounge looked very nice (though smoking allowed it seems). The little interaction we had with staff was efficient and friendly and they answered all of our questions. Also, Ari was a hoot.A nice stay and I would consider coming here again.",Canada,29,4.0

Admittedly we had kids with us so we could not explore the urban landscape as much as we wanted but we didn't find ginza to be all that exciting. Shinjuku had their alleyways full of unique local restaurants and shopping and is only a few stations away by train to harajuku, omotesando and shibuya. Ginza felt like orchard road in Singapore, big buildings and big luxury brands. Except for the Ginza Hakuhinkan Toy Store (http://www.hakuhinkan.co.jp/guide_en.html, which apparently also has a branch in Shinjuku), a 15 minute walk from the hotel, we can't find any particular reason to revisit ginza.Odaiba is nearby but we did not get a chance to visit.Service was great, as Conrad's are known for. We asked the concierge for suggestions for quiet spots for sakura viewing and was recommended a place close to his house. It was the height of sakura season, and there was practically no one walking along the river lined with sakura trees! amazing.The hotel had no kids club (understandable since it's a business hotel) but it would have been nice to have. We are used to going to bali where practically every hotel has a kid's club.Convenience store is located in the same building, exit the hotel and go down one level via escalator. Train station to (I believe) odaiba is right next to the hotel, also to shinjuku or shibuya (if memory serves). The bigger train station with more connections is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel.Look for rooms facing the bay.

They have 4 restaurants in the hotel, all requires dresscode except the cerise restaurant. The menu at cerise restaurant is the same as room service.

But the swimming pool can accommodate only 3 lap swimmers, and the other 1/3 of the pool reserved for kids.The hotel is mostly suited for couples or business travelers. It's not really a suitable for family with young children.Location wise it's walkable to Ginza using the underground passage and shiodome city centre is just next to the hotel.The staffs at the hotel are commendable, and if you have any problem with the hotel please tell them immediately and will try to solve it as best as their abilities.

However a bigger miss was a mirror in the main area of the bedroom. There is an admittedly large and well lit bathroom mirror, but to access that is likely to mean encountering a wet floor from the shower, so not ideal when barefooted or wearing socks while getting ready. There is a mirror opposite the wardrobe but the passageway is narrow so it is difficult to get a view from any distance to check how your whole outfit looks.

However there are two subway stations connected to the hotel (around 7-10min walk) and you are quickly in various parts of Tokyo. Depending on your schedule the limousine bus to Haneda is convenient and good value.Rooms:We had a lovely bay view room and the room is large and well appointed. The bathroom is huge and the beds are comfortable. The decor is very elegant and modern and the layout is very well thought out. I still think though that the Peninsula has the best room layout.Service:Service was impeccable throughout and every staff member we interacted with was very polished , polite and helpful. I would like to especially thank one female staff from the concierge desk on the ground floor who was so helpful when I noticed that I forgot an item in the room just as I was boarding the limousine bus. Unfortunately I did not catch her name in the rush but she managed to retrieve the item with light speed so that I could make the bus. She is a true gem.

What can I say! Let's begin with the level of service. Every employee takes great pride in what they do and this is made evident by the great level of service they provide. It is amazing how much pride everyone takes in their job and how they go the extra mile to make sure you feel at home. You can sense that this is something that runs deep in Japanese culture and is truly reflected at this hotel. Will be hard to stay at a US hotel from now on after experiencing this level of service at the Conrad Tokyo. Facility - impeccably clean, as is most of Tokyo. Might seem insignificant, but the hotel lobby and hallways smell amazing!!! We asked and it is a fragrance made of lavender, green tea, and orange. Didn't get to use the pool, spa, or gym facilities, but everything else we experienced was great. Room - our room was a standard king-bed suite facing the city. Room was spacious and even accommodated a rollaway bed. We were on the 37th floor facing the city. Room had everything you would expect from a hotel such as the Conrad. Executive Lounge - did enjoy staying on the 37th floor and having access to the executive lounge. The lounge is open early in the morning until evening. We were able to have complimentary breakfast and had access to snacks all day, plus beer and wine in the evening. It was definitely a nice perk. Omelette selection included salmon, brie, asparagus, and much more - delicious! Location - given my limited knowledge of the city, we felt that the hotel was in a very good location. First of all, it is about two blocks from Tokyo's famous fish market (our guide did mention that the market will be relocated to a different part of Tokyo given that it needs serious remodeling. But for now, you can walk to it from the Conrad. One side of the hotel faces the beautiful Hamarikyu Gardens and Tokyo Bay. The building itself is part of the Shidome area and train station. This means that you are surrounded by office buildings, shops, coffee shops, and walking distance to the Shidome subway station. Very convenient!! Wifi- had free wifi, but not sure if this is because of my diamond status or every guest enjoys free wifi. Wifi was much faster than what I usually experience in US hotels.

My tip is you change station in Daimon, hop on the Oedo Line and alight at the Shiodome station. This is much easier and luggage friendly instead of alighting at the Shimbashi station.I grabbed a great Black Friday deal on a 3rd party site for our stay here. I booked the King room with City view with breakfast.I advice the hotel regarding our stay and we are celebrating our anniversary. I tried to get a complimentary upgrade to bay view during check-in. However, they did not budge even if there is availability during our stay (they tried upselling the room). Although they sent us a complimentary cake which was very much appreciated.Our room was fantastic and I must say that one of the biggest non-suite room that I have stayed in (it was even bigger to standard size suites in other comparable 5 star hotels). The view was not to scoff about and it showed a very busy cityscape.Turndown service is as expected from the Conrad brand with the cute teddy bears that my girlfriend collects. The hotel went the extra mile by providing my girlfriend the whole set of the teddy bears as souvenir. The bathroom is very big and the heated toilet is welcome from the cold weather. They use Aromatheraphy as default but you can request Shanghai Tang and Tara Smith brand if you prefer.The concierge and the front desk staff had great command of the area and was really good in suggesting the correct walking routes and train stations that we need to take during our stay. With their direction, we were able to walk comfortably to Tsukiji market and Ginza area.The breakfast Cerise was fantastic and we enjoyed the Conrad signatures such as the Eggs Benedict and Huevos Rancheros ( must try). The service was efficient and it was not crowded from 7am-8am. The sushi was fresh and delicious.Even if it was 5 degrees outside, we were able to enjoy swimming in their indoor pool. The pool access is free for all guests of Conrad ( I even asked this question before staying). Also, they have sauna I think in the locker rooms. Although, we did not try this facility. They can also provide with you with swimwear if you need ( not sure if this is free).The not too perfect part was our checkout when the we called for assistance for our bags. They never came. So we just lug our luggage on our own. Although, the concierge was very apologetic.We'll definitely consider staying here again if the prices and dates are right.","Manila, Philippines",30,4.0

The hotel itself is luxurious without feeling like it is trying too hard. The rooms are large and the view of Tokyo Bay is worth paying a little extra for. It is not in the centre of Tokyo (wherever that may be in such a sprawling city!) but travelling around is easy and it's nice to return somewhere slightly quieter after a day and night exploring Tokyo.

This Conrad hotel is not very far from the Hakone Airport. A lift with a Taxi could be quite affordable - but I didn't do it in the 2 times I stayed in this lovely hotel. The entrance to the hotel is rather vague, mostly due to the construction that is going on in front of the hotel. A warm welcome from the staff from the first floor, but you actually have to get up to the 28th floor to check in, which is not too much of a hassle. Using the very very fast elevators that let you get to the lobby, you are greeted with people who speak perfect English. I had no trouble of getting a room in light-speed and grace. The room I stayed was a just a room (suprerior? deluxe?). The size was not that smaller compared to the room I had a year ago (which was a junior suite). I loved how cleverly the bathroom was oriented, and also how I could have the blinds down and up, to reveal (or cover) as much as I want of the activities in the bathroom.You are given the choice of amenities from Aromatherapy to Shanghai-Tang. Breakfast was on the club lounge, the lack of space and menu is recovered by the good service and the quality of the food. I was a little disappointed that they charged you extra, for the 'signature egg menus (e.g. Egg benedict, and other fancy egg dishes - which was complimentary before) The room was what you would expect from an excellent hotel. Spacious. Comfortable bed, good lighting, magnificent view, cleanliness, useful stuff all filled in neatly and conveniently into the space. I really could not ask for more.And to top it off the crew of the hotel was very kind and helpful, and knew and understood what you wanted right away, even if their English fell a little short. I definitely would love to stay here again and again.On the downsideWe rented a car and parked it in the hotel. In that case, most hotels would let you park your car complimentary. We had to pay 3,000 yen/night for parking. A little dissappointment which takes out one star from this hotel.","Jeju Island, South Korea",33,4.0

Tokyo is an absolutely stunning and beautiful city, but rather busy and at times chaotic. This hotel takes all of that away. The bar makes you feel like you're in a movie ( lost in translation, to be exact!) and the pool is out of this world. Swimming 30 stories high and enjoying the views, at any time of day, is simply magical. The rooms as also excellent, elegant, and spacious. The bathrooms are very large and spacious, offering both a tub and a shower, and the toilet and shower are separated from the rest of the bathroom. The rooms are also very comfortable, with excellent views of Tokyo and ample space. Breakfast is very good, and we ordered room service while we were there, and the eggs and pancakes were excellent. If you're looking for an alternative, there is a Starbuck right outside of the hotel. The hotel is situated 2-3 minutes walk from the metro/train stations, and you could literally go anywhere from there. It's also fairly easy to reach from Narita airport, it's only one connection. Beware to travelers! Narita is basically in the middle of nowhere, so it takes about 1-2 hours to get to the hotel from the airport, but if you take the right trains you only need to change once. There are also several good restaurants around there. The taxis are not too expensive, so getting to a restaurant is easy. I would recommend Heiroku Sushi, which is a bit further away (10 minutes taxi) but really quite good, as well as the Robataya restaurant, which is rather expensive but definitely worth the experience if you're willing to pay the extra price. It's good for couples and families, and the kids will definitely enjoy it. If you do go to Heiroku Sushi in Omotesando, there is a dessert place right across the street called Max Brenner -- definitely worth it! I would recommend a walk through the Ginza area, which reminds you of fifth avenue, as well as Omotesando. I liked Omotesando more, and it's especially nice at night. The hotel concierge was excellent while we were there, so you shouldn't have any problems finding somewhere to eat or something to see! I would suggest a minimum stay of 3 full days in Tokyo to get to see everything, and 5 would be the ideal number for me.","Milan, Italy",27,5.0

Its not a big lounge so booming voices on that ""vital call"" travel very easily! We couldn't understand why the hotel has decided to have the lounge facing the tower blocks when there is a beautiful view of the bay on the other side.. Commercial decision maybe.

Sitting in the lounge on the 37th floor as I am a Hilton Diamond member is nothing short of spectacular. The view from every window is incredible but what makes this hotel stand out is the people who work here. From the moment you exit the taxi you are transported to another world. The staff can not do enough for you and are so polite. This is my third time staying here and it is by far my favorite in Tokyo. I have stayed at several of the other highly ranked hotels--Park Hyatt etc but this hotel is truly wonderful. The rooms are spacious and well appointed with all of the amenities of home. I had no issues charging my electronic devices as there are plenty of outlets available in my room.

In my previous visits to Tokyo I had stayed at Shibuya. There are pros and cons to staying at Shimbashi area. Personally I really liked Conrad Tokyo's location for its proximity to Tsukiji and Ginza (both within walking distance) and other places of interest such as Akihabara, Ueno Park and Tokyo Imperial Palace. The hotel is easily accessible and well connected to the transport system. The Oedo station (subway) and Shiodome station (Yurikamome) are situated just beside the hotel's entrance. The nearby Hamarikyu gardens is a hidden gem and great for taking photos of the cherry blossoms during the Sakura season (hint to photographers).The rooms and views of the bay area were without a doubt the highlights of Conrad Tokyo. The rooms were generously sized for a hotel in Tokyo with an understated modern luxurious appeal. The RH suite in particular was the most impressive room I had seen and it is hard to be impressed by other hotel rooms after this experience. The shower pressure was simply divine and felt like going to a massage everytime, very therapeutic and relaxing. I was however slighltly letdown by the lack of electrical outlets near the bed. The indoor heated pool was another one of my favourite things about the hotel. The 25m pool was a good size for those who demand a serious workout and was never crowded whenever I was there.Service standards throughout my stay was generally good and efficient but nothing memorable. For some reason, the frontdesk was always busy and always had a queue. Breakfast at the lounge was decent and even better at the restaurant with a larger buffet variety. I had dined at China Blue and Kazahana as part of the stay package. Food at the China Blue was very good but somewhat disappointing at Kazahana as I was expecting the same quality and flair as a Kaiseki served at a high end Ryokan. Foodies would get more satisfaction and value from the Tsukiji restaurants nearby (while it last). Afterall the proximity to Tsukiji market in itself is a reason for staying at Conrad Tokyo!Notwithstanding its flaws, Conrad Tokyo ranks among the best five star hotel that I have stayed. I would definitely return in a heartbeat. (I'm hoping the Tsukiji market will be there the next time I return.)",,31,5.0

We have stayed at the Four Seasons, The Park Hyatt, the Mandarin Oriental, etc., but had never tried the Conrad Tokyo. Having just stayed there, I can assure you that our search for the perfect Tokyo hotel is over: the Conrad Tokyo is IT. The rooms are extremely spacious and what is more, the space within them is well thought out. There is an upholstered bench seating that spans the length of the entire room; we laid our suitcases out open from end to end on this bench and if you have ever had to dress from a suitcase on the floor, or stuck in a too small closet on a flimsy luggage rack, you will know what a luxury it is to have such an arrangement. The bathroom is fantastic. A double sink, large, excellent shower, separate WC and a lovely free-standing ""egg"" shaped tub in plenty of room for two people to use at the same time. My only complaint about the room is that the bed is a little too hard (but I find this to be the case in most Japanese hotels). It is still quite comfortable. The attention from the staff is unbelievable. We had our room serviced constantly, silently, swiftly. We do not know how this was done; we were in and out of that room all the time, showering, changing, dropping off packages, etc., yet each time we returned, the room had been serviced. The staff at this hotel are tremendous. We had several requests that I think were very demanding of us, yet the staff at the Conrad Tokyo were so helpful and efficient that they were able to accomplish all of our wishes which included car service from Narita, a two hour viewing of Sumo practice and a reservation for 4 at Jiro Sukiyabashi Ginza and a reservation at Birdland for 6. Virtually impossible requests, done apparently effortlessly!The breakfast buffet is absolutely first rate. There are a great variety of foods, both Western and Eastern and everything is completely delicious. We broke a family rule and one night had dinner at the hotel restaurant (instead of going out), and found the dinner to be as delicious as the breakfast. The staff is fantastic and gracious. Topping the list of them is Ari who makes coming back to the hotel everyday a complete delight. His warm and caring personality completely captivated our family, especially our children who remain totally smitten with him. And he goes above and beyond any expectations. One evening we were having drinks in the (very beautiful) bar across from reception and we spotted him and waved him over. We told him we were planning to go to a salon the next day where little fish eat away at the dead skin on your feet. (a very Japanese experience!). That is all we said about it; just chatted about other adventures we were planning. He excused himself eventually and before we got up to leave the bar, he was back with a map of the salon we should visit, with the name of the salon and their hours!!! As well, after we checked out of the hotel and went to Shanghai, my cell phone was stolen as I got off the plane. As I knew I was going back to Tokyo for a night before my flight back to the States, I wrote Ari care of the hotel to help me find a cell phone I could rent while in Japan. He was forwarded the email by the hotel staff and he wrote me back immediately. Ari exemplifies the spirit and kindness that every employer is looking for in a team member. He is a lovely human being and a bright and shining star in the lovely crown of the Conrad Tokyo. The hotel is located walking distance to the Ginza (and even from Tokyo Station if you like a longer stroll). The WiFi was excellent. This is now our Go-To hotel in Tokyo.","New York City, New York",8,5.0

While the trip was for business I also wanted to see a few local highlights. Fortunately the hotel is across the street from one of the nicest gardens in Tokyo (Hama-rikyu former imperial garden) as well as a short taxi ride from the Tsukiji Fish Market - so I was able to fit in some local attractions in my limited free time. The Conrad found me a guide service for more in-depth tourism on the week-end.While Asian hotels in general have a superior reputation for service, the Conrad shines with both friendly and efficient support, providing information and services that truly met my needs. Staff are nicely attentive but never invasive. My room on the executive floor was spacious and well equipped. The hotel has a vast array of in-house amenities including restaurants, gym, spa etc. that I rarely used as I wanted to see Tokyo. During my few visits, I found the restaurants a little pricey but there are dining options in the Pedi Shiodome building which is 5 minutes by foot from the hotel.Although this was primarily a business trip, I would recommend the hotel as a base for Tokyo tourism and plan to return with my wife.

The King Suite had a separate lounge and bedroom, open-plan bathroom (with separate shower/bath and also two WC areas) and a walk-in dressing area that connected to the room's entrance. Electric blinds and curtains came down to ensure you could completely black-out the room for a peaceful night slept.The hotel is located conveniently next to the Shiodome complex (which has a metro that connects to Haneda) and Shinbashi Station as well as the Tsukiji Fish Market. The hotel also has free (standard speed) wifi throughout which was sufficiently fast and reliable.The 25m pool is stunning and the fitness facilities are excellent.

From the emails to the staff prior to check-in to the help on luggage storage afterwards, most everything was seamless and very enjoyable. We were in a King Suite with a bay view, and there were many thoughtful touches.First, the hotel accommodated us with our two kids -- with one in the crib and the other in the same bed as us. Even if we had wished to, the suite wouldn't have fit a rollaway bed. That said, the room still felt spacious and comfortable. We also received a nice amenity due to our anniversary, and they gave us Conrad bears as well. The shower/tub combination was nice, and a big hit with our toddler, who loved taking baths there.Location-wise, it is very close to the fish market (for now), and it's proximity to Shiodome and the JR station makes it convenient (though the walk to the latter is not a short one). My absolute favorite thing, though, is the shower pressure. It is very strong!The only negatives I'd have to share include: the bed was surprisingly not that comfortable; and while there was super enthusiastic and service-oriented folks, like Ari (believe he's a manager of some sort), the staff can feel rigid and cold, so compared to other top hotels in Tokyo (such as the Park Hyatt), it falls short.Overall, we really liked this hotel, and you will too if you're looking for something that delivers the Conrad experience.","Arcadia, California",93,4.0

From Haneda airport, we took the Keikyu line and hopped off the Shiodome station. It's a 10min walk from there. There is a mall underneath the hotel where there are various resto like McDonald's, Starbucks, Din Tai Fung, and Family Mart. But this is a good 5 to 7 minute walk from the main entrance of the hotel. Just the same- meets my first requirement of the hotel being near a mini mart and lots of food choices. Conrad's main reception is at the 28th floor. But they have a concierge desk at the first floor whose personnel is more than willing to assist their guest up the lift. On the 28th floor, checking in was a breeze. The only glitch was I chose the 34th floor via their internet check-in, but it was not recorded in their system. So settled for the 31st floor. The good thing about being in the lower floors, the trip up and down the lift is much faster.The basic room is huge as compared to Tokyo standards. I love the glass bathroom which is a signature feature of Conrad. Since the bathroom is elevated, expect your steps to echo a bit. But all around, the room screams class which is expected from Conrad. I requested for firm pillows and was given Tempur pillows to sleep on. Amazing.We had breakfast at the coffee shop. The view is amazing but the seating capacity is limited. If it's full, you will be requested to move to another resto nearby but the buffet spread will be different.

As the building is modern, don;t come expecting traditional charms, the hotel appeals to those with a modern taste and who like contemporary design with expansive views out over Tokyo Bay or back towards the city itself.I had a bay view room which was very spacious and roomy (By far the biggest room I saw in Japan in a city where space it at a massive premium). Bathroom was clean and crisp with all the modern facilities. Bed mattress was on the hard side but far from uncomfortable and I found the combination of the blinds and room heating meant my stay was warm and comfortable.I used both the restaurants and room service at different points during my stay. Room service was very speedy, the food came in half the time that they initially said. It was piping hot and great quality. Breakfast is a buffet but you can also order from a cooked menu too. The food itself was perfectly adequate and came very quickly. They do have a slightly strange policy of guiding you to a table, once despite there being eleven tables free and only two being used in one area of the restaurant I was escorted to a far corner table in a totally different part of the restaurant, rather hard to understand but just go with the flow.All in all expect to be very comfortable at Conrad Tokyo and the room size and feeling of space are really what set the hotel apart from the competition in my view. Expect Japanese efficiency and service at its finest.","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",11,5.0

The rooms are huge, especially for japanese standards, very clean, very well designed. The service is impecable, and one day that they forgot to make our room the moment I called, after apologizing, they immediately sent someone to fix it.Abe, the concierge , was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and he helped us with dinner reservations all 3 nights we stayed there.The pool is very nice and with a great view. I didn't enjoy the jacuzzi though, they were a bit claustrophobic and not very clean. One area of improvement I see is the bar. It has a magnificent view and I would love to have spent more time there, but smoking was allowed at that part and this was something that made us not use it.I hope we return to Tokyo and when we do this is where we will stay, we really enjoyed it.","Dar es Salaam, Tanzania",236,5.0

To get to the point (as it was for me when looking for hotels in this part of Tokyo), the hotel is connected basically to Ginza by a series of recently built, glass walled (but open-air) elevated walkways. At a leisurely pace maybe 10 minutes to Ginza. The last 100 feet arriving in Ginza is blocked off for construction so you have to take a detour to a less desirable (but safe) iron walkway down to the ground but I believe it will be gone soon.Okay, now to the hotel: It occupies the top of a 37 story building. It has a separate entrance on the ground level but the lobby is on the 27th floor. I don't usually like these kinds of entrances because it means taking ""two"" elevators up to your room (cp. to the Park Hyatt Tokyo etc.) but the foot traffic has been meager so you don't really feel too inconvenienced.I stayed in a bay view suite and it was very peaceful. The room is very well appointed with modern, minimalist decor.There is an executive lounge on the 37th floor which offers the usual amenities throughout the day, and is warmly appointed with staff to help you with your stay. It was not a very large lounge however so I never partook of the breakfast offered there because there is a breakfast buffet at the lobby level at the restaurant called Cerise.During my stay I also ate at their Japanese restaurant. The service was very good at the restaurant but it was odd that they had no sushi offerings. There was a sushi bar area but it was unstaffed, so maybe it is being retooled or just off that day (Monday)?There were lots of families. I would say during breakfast as an example, over 50% of the tables were families with children. But you rarely see them or run in to them in the hotel. I believe it is because it was April and holiday time for many regional expats deciding to visit Tokyo. Lastly, there is a small arcade of restaurants and a starbucks in the basement, both in the adjacent office building.","Atherton, California",29,5.0

We were ""given"" a paid upgrade to a bay view suite (the odd numbers are bay view, even numbers are ""city"" view, but really look at taller buildings across the street). The upgrade was less than $100/night, we had booked the hotel using points, so it was a steal, and the view was spectacular. The bathrooms have wet rooms with a great shower head coming out of the ceiling, and a large round lighted mirror. I also was in a room with a king bed, and it was quite spacious. The staff will do anything to make your stay pleasant. The breakfast, snacks, and evening drinks in the Executive Lounge are all great with fantastic staff to take care of anything you need. I used the gym, which is quite reasonable, and the spa, which has private bathtubs for a good soak. The hotel is at the Shiodome metro stop, which is on a loop that goes to Shinjuku and Shibuya (two places tourists like to go). The hotel is walking distance to Ginza and easy to get to other neighborhoods in Tokyo by metro or taxi. When we returned to Tokyo we had booked in a ryokan, but when we arrived the room was maybe 9 x 7..just enough room for two futons on the floor. I loved the idea of a ryokan, but there wasn't even room for our luggage. I got online and found that The Conrad had rooms, booked using points, and when we arrived were given a complimentary upgrade to a bay view corner suite, which was larger than the first suite, and about 10 times larger than the room we had just left. THIS was the way to end a fabulous trip to Japan...in a corner suite overlooking Tokyo Bay with attentive staff doing everything they can to make your last couple of days in Tokyo memorable. I had never stayed at a Conrad before this, but will certainly look for them when I travel in the future due to a very positive experience at the Tokyo Conrad.","Los Angeles, California",34,5.0

The Executive Lounge is set beautifully on a high floor, but we found the team only OK relative to other Executive teams we have encountered in other locations. They are very polite and helpful but not as sophisticated with knowledge of the area that we would expect of a property that clearly caters to Western business travelers. Ari on the Concierge Team greatly exceeded our expectations - he couldn't do enough for us, he remembered several days after making dining recommendations to ask how we enjoyed that restaurant and his service skills are impeccable.

It will LITERALLY blow your mind away. I have never experienced such attention and courteousness as I did in my recent Japan trip. I book a Twin City Suite in the Conrad for 7 nights with Breakfast plan. This is a 5-Star hotel that affords impeccable customer service and however luxury amenities could be better. Every team member I encountered was professional and courteous, and each went out of their way to ensure a wonderful stay. This is the what impresses the most! Special shout out to Mr. Deepak, in Guest Service. He was very caring and gave us a personal/professional personalized attention. Fantastic!Whether you are dining in the 5 (FIVE) restaurants inside the hotel or ordering room service, the food is excellent! I ordered room service for dinner and had breakfast everyday downstairs, and both meals were superb. For breakfast you have the choice of 6 different types of eggs. I had the Eggs Benedict and it was the best I ever had! Breakfast experience was incredible! Special shout-out to ""Mr. Italian"" (Sorry I forgot your name Lougi(?) that works as a supervisor in breakfast restaurant. He was very attentive to make sure everything was in order for us everyday.

The concierge desk was extremely helpful with booking dinners and arranging a top notch tour guide for us.The location seems a little out of the way but it worked perfectly for us. It was within close walking distance to the famous fish market and a short ride away from Ginza (the flashy shopping/dining area). It is also conveniently located near two subway lines.

We decided to burn some Frequent Flyer points and stay at the Conrad because of its good reputation (and the points deal was good too). Our room was ready at normal check-in time, and check-in was a breeze. We had a regular suite overlooking the Gardens and the Rainbow Bridge. The suite itself was well appointed with 1.5 bathrooms and a nice tub (with the usual ugly Conrad duck, no offense)/shower combo. Double vanities were well maintained and looked good with all the standard amenities.The downside was that the furniture was a little worn. The chair and the couch were a little stained and they did not look too inviting. On the upside the walk-in closet was great, and the bed was very comfortable. We missed a electronic control panel for the blinds, etc. - you had to get out of bed to control them by the window, which we found a little odd as most hotels of this standard has some sort of electronic controls. I found the air conditioner to be a little noisy and I ended up turning it off during the night.The facilities on premises are great. A wide choice of restaurants (Cerise restaurant was suprisingly good, albeit not so lively) - as we only stayed for one night we did not get to try the other ones. The bar looked nice, but I disliked the smoking there.As we were leaving for the airport the next day, I wanted to inquire about transfer service to the airport. Approaching the concierge desk they didn't seem to understand me at first, and seeing as I was wearing an overcoat I think they may have thought I was not a guest of the hotel? We did end up reserving a transfer for the next day which went rather smoothly. Checkout was easy and we were helped with our luggage. The transfer to the airport was easy as the airport bus takes you straight to your terminal.The breakfast in the morning was great (and included in our room rate), and the service was again spotless.The location of the hotel is great. Direct access to Shimbashi station. It is a business area, but a 15 minute walk to Ginza and easy access to the metro station. Taxies are outside too, and we did use them once in a while. Maybe we were just unlucky, but the two taxies we took to the hotel did not know where it was located, so we had to try and guide them there (we did have the name in Japanese as well as the address). I expect this is because the Shimbashi area is fairly new.Overall the stay was great, but the rooms (that do have an amazing view if you choose the Bay side rooms) were a little worn and the service had a slight hiccup.",Copenhagen,12,4.0

After running a check on all the conference hotels, I chose Conrad Tokyo. While reading materials on tourism in Japan, I got to know that acquiring a sim card in Japan and using it in an unlocked phone is more expensive than renting a phone. Before my departure, I rented a phone from Advanced Global Communications which among others, gave unlimited internet access. The phone company sent me the number of phone before my departure and assured me that the phone package would be sent to Conrad before my arrival. On arrival in Conrad, the package was waiting in my room. After one week of using the phone, I concluded that the cost was reasonable.On arrival at Narita airport, I and a colleague seamlessly purchased a bus ticket which made runs to Conrad, among other Hotels. At Conrad, my double room at the Executive Lounge was upgraded to a suite on the same floor may be because I am hhonors silver account holder. My suite has a commanding and amazing view from the floor to ceiling window. Checking-in was professionally done by ever smiling and dedicated staff. The Executive Lounge gives access to beer, wine, snacks, etc.The rooms were clean and spotless! They remained so till my departure. Indeed, the rooms were truly meant for the 21st century! The hotel is in a safe and good environment with very easy walking access to train and metro stations. The trains were very clean so is Tokyo. Notwithstanding that some Japanese I met could not communicate very well in English, they still went out of their way to help when they were approached.I enjoyed taking breakfast in the hotel’s restaurant which came with the room rate. The choice was wide with continental and Japanese menu, hot and cold options.At the end of my stay of 6 nights, the hotel arranged for a bus transfer to Narita airport.

From the moment you enter the building from the bustling streets outside you are met with a sense of calm. The staff are super attentive to your every need, the restaurants are stunning, the food is incredible and the rooms- just WoW! We stayed in a King City view room - I loved the innovative design to have a perspex wall between the bathroom and the bedroom- it made the room seem even more spacious and when privacy was needed a blind to divide the space was accessible at the touch of a button. The views at night were especially incredible with a sea of multi coloured lights in the buildings in front that looked like stars in front of you. There is also a Bay View side which looks over the garden and looked lovely- I hope to stay an equivalent open plan room that side of the hotel next time to see the Rainbow bridge lit up.There were also lovely personal touches- a Conrad crowned rubber duck to keep you company in the bath, an iPod speaker station, well stocked gorgeous scented amenities, a Conrad bear keyring at turn down and a delicate stem of live plant in a tiny test tube vase to bring outside life in to the room. Even the blossom carpet and bird wall motifs complemented the gorgeous colours of the room perfectly. To get an entry category room that has the light and lay out of your perfect room was like a dream and simply stunning.Everything was the very best quality and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to work colleagues and friends alike in the future.

We loved our stay and will definitely try the Conrad brand in the future, and be back to Japan!!!PROS:Service: I don't know about other Japanese hotels service but after hearing great things and expecting a lot, the Conrad delivered! Everyone was so kind, helpful, attentive, and efficient. One night I requested a wake up call and in the morning when I didn't pick up the phone, a man came to our room to make sure we got the wake up alert.

No complaints there!Location - near a large subway station which many lines ran through. Some walking required to get to the JR line but it was connected if you dealt with the labyrinthine subway stations -- which put any subway I've ever seen to shame, by the way! Near to Ginza and Shimbashi area. Very close to the Tsukiji fish market if you're into that.Amazing view from our room - get a Bay View room - we paid more but it was worth it!Since it was our honeymoon they gave us access to the Executive Lounge - nice happy hour nightly with wine, beers, snacks - good cheese plates!LARGE, IMPECCABLY CLEAN ROOMS!

They provided slippers, robes, and fresh pajamas nightly which was a cool touch. Incredible. Randomly found the Japanese toilets fascinating and now my husband wants to install one in our home.CONS:The one snafu is I had emailed in advance to make restaurant reservations through the hotel and ended up falling ill the day of the reservation, which was going to result in a 100% cancellation fee (several hundred dollars). Luckily the hotel worked this out with the restaurant on our behalf so I guess it wasn't a con after all!Slightly hard beds. But we were so exhausted I still slept soundly every night.

Well you are in Japan, and they do have a 'certain' way of doing things. So you just have to put up with it.We had executive lounge access and this lounge was quite basic. In the evenings during happy hours it did get very full.Service was so so, sometimes you did have to wait a while before someone came up to ask you what you would like to drink. But wasnt a big deal and in general they were helpful.In the room package, breakfast was included. Surprisingly for this hotel breakfast was somewhat dissappointing. Hotels in Asia, breakfasts are usually excellent and a little more than amazing I find. For Conrad, this was surprisingly below par.I stayed for 6 nights, and the breakfast selections which was quite limited especially the hot food didnt change once. So if you stay for more than 3 days I would say the breakfast does become a little boring. They do offer a menu to order eggs made to order, and this is the most shocking thing I would have not expected from a high end place like Conrad. I ordered the eggs benedict, and when I got it the 2 supposedly 'poached' egg was very very hard, and the shape was funnily enough resembling a hard boiled egg. after poking at it I just left it on the side. I put this down to a mistake so jsut left it as that. On the 3 or 4th day I was intrigued to see if this was the case, as you know a place like Conrad surely they can do a simple pached egg, rule of every kitchen chef, and I'm sure you would agree with me on this. So I ordered just a simple poached egg, when it came it confirmed it was the same oval shaped hard boiled style egg. The shape looked exactly like the first day it came on the eggs benedict, so I came to the conclusion they must be using a machine for it.Not a major factor, but doesnt look too good if an establishment like Conrad cannot do a simple poached egg.The breakfast did include lots of fresh fruit and juices, which was a bonus.Service of Staff in general including reception, house keeping, room service, laundry service and restaurant/breakfast service was good.The lobby does have a cafe, bar which has a good view of the city and the river so great for meeting up with friends or having a high tea, drink.Gym was good, well equipped.Stayed 6 nights.","London, United Kingdom",29,4.0

The high quality and service is our benchmark for judging other hotel stays. The tea session at the Executive Lounge has the added touch of ice cream.

Top notch service, tranquility and an aesthetic that resonated with us.Service: After an early morning Redeye from SFO, we were ready to refresh ourselves before venturing into Tokyo, but our room wasn't ready yet given the early hour. The gentleman at the bell desk not only offered to keep our bags safe until check-in, but also arranged for us to use the spa facilities and showered therein to wash off some of the jet lag.Once we returned for a proper check in at noon, the desk staff clearly explained all the amenities made available via my HHonors Gold status and the AmEx FHR program we had used to book the room. They then explained that because of those programs and because we were on an anniversary celebration trip, we had been upgraded to a suite with a bay view! A small cake and two tiny bears were presented to us later to mark the occasion, a very nice and unexpected touch!From there on out, all our interactions with the staff at the restaurants and elsewhere where great. No hassles, and incredibly gracious service! We felt totally welcome and cared for.Room: The BayView King Suite was magnificent. Panoramic views of the Tokyo Bay, and a modern, dark wood and light surfaces motif made for an incredibly elegant space. The bathroom was well equipped and the heated floors were a nice addition! No shortage of space.Be advised that the beds are what we would consider on the hard side, at least compared to hotels we have stayed used in other regions. We didn't have any trouble getting good sleep, but we were mighty jet lagged for sure :)Et cetera: Holy cow the Conrad Breakfast! If you're going to order this for your room, come hungry. It's a lot of very, very tasty food.We couldn't get over how peaceful the hotel was. Yes this is very much a business hotel, but everything from the decor and layout to the service made this hotel an incredibly calming place to stay.---While we haven't stayed at a huge number of high-end hotels (several Four Seasons properties, Park Hyatt Washington, Shangri-La Sydney), the Conrad Tokyo is at the top of our list, and we wouldn't hesitate to come back next time we get to visit Japan!","San Francisco, California",3,5.0

The people and the city of Tokyo are so clean and organized. Everyone goes out of there way to help you out. This mentality extends to the Conrad Tokyo. A fantastic hotel, very well located in Minato. Everything from the view, to the service provided was top notch. I always love staying at a Hilton property as breakfast is included if you are a Gold member, regardless of the brand. This perk is something a suspect sways many customers into choosing Conrad/ WA over other brands. When one is looking for the best place to stay during a trip, reviews always provide insight albeit somewhat subjective. I personally think it is worth paying a premium to stay at a lovely hotel. Although we spent most of our time out and about, the place where you rest after a busy day can effect the trip throughout. As mentioned the staff was very attentive, willing to help you without hesitation. When I have the opportunity to go back to Tokyo, I will definitely make it a point to stay at this Conrad again.","Atlanta, Georgia",47,5.0

What an amazing experience! We were blown away by the size of the room and the ammenities it provided. We especially appreciated the size after we chaged hotels a few times. Apparently with space being limited in Tokyo, the hotels like to conserve it by limiting the size of their rooms. This was not the case with the Conrad. Our room was lovely, with automatic blinds separating the bathroom and bedroom, as well as automatic blinds on the windows. Not only were the views from the room spectacular, the views from the lobby are amazing as well. My boyfriend is a member of the honors club as well and we had access to the lounge that provided breakfast. This might have been my favorite part of the stay, the breakfast here was spectacula!!

They couldn't fulfill the early check-in and room upgrade. My room had an AMAZING view of the Hamarikyu Gardens and Tokyo Port. Service and food at the China Blue and Cerise were great as well. Another highlight was the 25 meter pool that I was able to swim laps in. Great value especially with what American Express' deal had to offer.

We planned a last minute trip to Japan over Chinese New Year and most hotels were booked up for the week. We were able to book a Bay View Suite for a reasonable price (for Tokyo) and weren't disappointed. The room itself was big and well appointed -- I do think some of the furniture (which is white) can use a little spruce up as could the hardwood floors, but nothing to deter from enjoying the room -- it was very big, bed was really comfy and the shower was very good (great water pressure!). We didn't eat at any of the restaurants, but we did order room service one night, which was good. Lobby bar was fantastic with great service and nice ambience, especially night with the fantastic views. We utilized the concierge services quite a bit to make dinner reservations, get dinner recommendations and to book tickets for two jazz concerts we attended. Everyone who helped us was great, but I'd like to give a special mention to Ryoko, who really spent time entertaining all my crazy requests! Location is fantastic with one subway line right below the building, and an interchange with other lines a mere 10 minute walk. Gym was well-appointed, and the pool was fantastic.

Everyone would greet and smile.I have to mention Ayado san at Cerise restaurant during breakfast. She really made my day with her personal service and cheerfulness.The internet was great, very fast connection.Seamless perfect service, especially in the executive lounge.Cons;Breakfast buffet, has a small menu to select a hot entree.Executive lounge when busy, only has a sample platter during cocktail hour, not like the Seoul Conrad which had the food all laid out. I booked both hotels thru the visa signature collection. The Palace had a great rate which the visa program matched. Visa had a stay 4 nights or longer and get one night free rate at the Conrad. I like the location of Palace better, but if you are going to Makuhari Meese with Conrad, it is easier to take the metro to Shin Kiba and catch the Keiyo line there. You have to transfer, but it is better then walking the 500 plus meters thru Tokyo station to catch the Keiyo line when staying at the Palace. I would love to try the executive lounge at the Palace , but the rates are $500.00 plus a night .Both hotels are great, but I find better rates for the Conrad and I like the value and comfort just right for me.","Honolulu, Hawaii",27,5.0

Not all reach the standards of their price or reputation. One which far outdoes the expected performance is the Hotel Conrad in Tokyo. it is a perfect package of facilities, location, offerings and above all of staff. Reading some of the reviews in this column, i have the feeling that some Americans do not know how to react to polite, quiet and self-effacing service which is typical of Japan wherever one goes. At the Conrad the friendliness is evident everywhere. But this friendliness is always understated and slightly distant. This built in sense of deference should not be confused with disinterest or even arrogance as some of your reviewers seem to have believed. On the contrary, it is a sign of the highest respect. The atmosphere created by the staff helps one enjoy the beautiful rooms, spectacular view and excellent facilities even more. This is one hotel where splurging on the executive floor is well worth the added price. The 37th floor lounge offers a perfect refuge from the loud Tokyo streets. The same can be said for the expansive health club and the excellent restaurants. Taking tea or a cocktail in the 37th floor bar and lounge is also an experience. We chose the Conrad for its location as well. It is an easy walk or short cab ride to the Ginza, the Imperial Palace, the fish market and many other sites. It also sits astride two subway lines which with a little practice can be used to go virtually anywhere in the city.","Berlin, Germany",27,5.0

The hotel is situated in a business district Shiodome that has pretty much nothing except businesses, a few restaurants and a starbucks. The closest subway station is Shimbashi Station 新橋駅 which is a pretty major station that can take you to the other big stops like Ginza, Shibuya, Shinjuku or Tokyo. That station however is at least 10 minutes away by feet. The first day, one hotel staff told me to walk outdoors to get to Shimbashi station and that was not a good move. I had to ask 3 times on my way as to how to get there and the neighbourhood was fairly quiet so there wasn't a lot of people I can approach. On my second day, the hotel staff suggested I walk underground which was a lot more straightforward and there were many more passerby. Still it took 10 minutes. So not exactly the most convenient hotel for someone who doesn't want to take taxis and need to leave the neighhourhood. Having said that, the hotel is very modern and new.

Pros:The Concierge Desk is as good as I have ever experienced. I was a high- maintenance guest, dealing with them for months before my arrival regarding restaurant reservations and various other tickets and transportation needs. They were extraordinary. In a country where service is tops, these guys (women actually), were just great. The service is excellent. As to be expected in a five star Japanese hotel, but still, truly great service from (almost) every staff member and department. I had a small problem with the hotel, and the way the management dealt with it was superb; they really did everything they could to keep me happy.The Rooms are beautiful. Spacious and beautifully designed, I could not ask for a nicer hotel room. The Cons:The Location. Though located on the edge of Ginza, the hotel is not in a walkable location, and is not part of Ginza. It is part of a modern complex called Shiodome, and due to the street layout,the hotel entrance location, and construction, it takes literally between 10 and 20 minutes just to cross the street and get to the hotel entrance. So, while on a map it looks close to Ginza and to the fish market, in reality, it is not in a pedestrian friendly location. And though it is directly above a metro station for one or two lines, it is still confusing to get to the right train (though this is Tokyo, and that's the way it is); but the larger train station which appears to be just a few minute walk, can often take much longer due to the very confusing tunnels and streets to get you there, and to get you to the right train.Smoke. I do not smoke, and I do not like smoke. I am not fanatical about it, but I am a little allergic to it, and I do not generally enjoy being in a smoky atmosphere. The Lobby is laid out in an open floor plan, and the bar/ lounge is adjacent to the main lobby, and the restaurants are on the same floor. Not only is smoking permitted in the bar, but the smoke smell goes into the lobby and sometimes into the breakfast room/ casual restaurant. Smoking is still prevalent in Japan, and I have no problem with this; but I do not want to be in a hotel where smoke permeates the lobby, and where it impacts my desire to spend time in the bar or lounge. For me, these ""cons"" are significant, particularly the location. For you, they may not be.In summary, this is beautiful modern hotel with gorgeous rooms and exemplary service, however, the location was not ideal for me. I like a hotel located in a pedestrian area with shopping and restaurants; this can be a challenge in Tokyo.","Beverly Hills, California",188,4.0

Nice.The Bathrooms are separated from Bedroom by glass Panel and you can put the Blind up or down with an electronic switch for Privacy.

There was a Bath and ample space in the Bathroom.The Beds are comfortable and rooms modern with all amenities to be expected from a 5 Star Property.Check in was relatively easy as we arrived in the evening. Note# The Lobby is NOT on the ground. Take a lift up to Lobby.Two negative points to make unfortunately.1.Location. The Hotel is difficult to find as there is NOT ENOUGH SIGNAGE with a myriad of alleys and passages to and from the stations including Shiodome.2. On checkout the same Duty Manager and Mr Yok... (Surname) were at the desks. Requested a Paper with the Hotel Letterhead and 2 Lines stating that the 3 Guests had stayed in the Hotel for the dates stayed. Mr Y... was CLEARLY annoyed. This took no longer than 5 minutes and was a requirement from the embassy.This took a lot less time then one would take to give you a receipt.It is not just a Mr Yok.....problem attitude. Unfortunately i have witnessed this not only at Conrad with this particular staff member but have CRINGED and experienced this at other Japanese Hotels.. PROBLEM is that the attitude and Behaviour of Japanese Hotel Staff, NOT ALL is rougher-less Polite towards Westerners and OTHER ASIANS than Japanese. I have experienced this myself and have witnessed it many many times. PLEASE treat every customer with the same respect.Your BAD impressions from Western movies should not be reflected back on the customer through your poor attitude, otherwise you are in the wrong job.

Short walk from there to the hotel which is on the 28th floor. The lobby is quite small which was a bit crowded when we got there (it must have been check out time) however, the staff spoke to us straight away and we were dealt with quickly and efficiently. Our room was bay view which was worth every penny. The hotel knew it was our honeymoon as I had emailed to ask for a nice view from our room which they delivered on. We were also delivered a lovely honeymoon cake from the hotel which was a lovely thought. Rooms are well appointed, huge bathroom with the biggest mirror I have ever seen. Loved all the extra touches such as electronic blinds and the subtle and calming decor. The leisure facilities were amazing, the pool has some jaw dropping views of the city and the spa staff were very helpful and welcoming (One man in particular who had lived in Edinburgh but I don't remember his name was very welcoming and friendly). The ladies changing rooms were luxurious and had many high quality Shiseido products. We had breakfast in the hotel which had a great selection and amazing views to match.

We checked in late at night after a long train ride from Nagoya and was greeted by one of the sweetest ladies I have met. (I wish I remembered her name.) She welcomed my husband back and recognized him as a diamond member, then went through the benefits he receives due to his status. Then noticing that we were staying only one night she asked if we had a flight the next day and what time it would be. When we explained that it wasn't until late in the evening the next day, she offered us a substantially late check out with no hesitation and no fee whatsoever! Now that is impressive service! Once checked in, Sakuramoto escorted us to our room and managed our luggage. He too was very kind and friendly and welcomed us back to the hotel. We enjoyed a wonderful night's sleep and a delicious breakfast in the executive lounge the next morning. A fantastic mixture of traditional Japanese style foods mixed with our ""western"" favorites.

I was going for business and they put us up in this Conrad Hilton. I knew the hotel would be nice, but I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by this place.The service, from the moment you walk in their door, is unbeatable. The hotel lobby is not on the main floor of the building, but several stories up (cannot recall which one). But when you walk in, someone meets you, offers to take your bag(s) and walk you to the elevator. They will even ride WITH you up to to the main floor and hand your bags over to someone operating check in.Everyone I met with spoke English extremely well. I was never confused or made to feel like an outsider. They upgraded me to a bay view on the 3rd to top floor. The bed was incredibly comfortable (which is great after a 12-13 hour flight), the bathroom was top notch, and everything was as modern and technological as possible. The shades were controlled by a wall switch near the bed. There were even shades for the bathroom in case you wanted natural light in the room, but wanted the bathroom privacy.Let's discuss the bathroom actually... the mirror was bright and excellent for getting yourself ready. There was a gorgeous porcelain soaking tub lined up perfectly to enjoy the view from your room. The shower had a rain shower head and there was shampoo, conditioner and body wash built into a dispenser. The toilet... holy crap (pun intended). It had a seat warmer, so you were never jolted by a cold seat. It had a built in bidet with warm water too! It was honestly the most high-tech toilet I've ever seen.I ate at one of the restaurants on site, which had a fantastic buffet and excellent views. I also enjoyed the lobby bar and some cigars (something you can't do indoors in the US anymore). I found the prices to be reasonable considering the level of service and beauty surrounding me. At all times the staff was extremely helpful. They even helped me find the fastest route to the subway trains so I could go explore the city on my own.If I ever return, and I can afford it, I would DEFINITELY consider the Conrad.","Gurnee, Illinois, United States",113,5.0

My 3 Excellents stand for: Excellent in Service, Excellent in Comfort and Excellent in location. This hotel impressed me from 3 weeks before my stay. I requested the Concierge to help make reservations at some popular restaurants for us, I got an email from the head of the Concierge within a couple of hours with reservations already made. I had also made inquiry to upgrade our rooms etc and I also got feedback quickly. This is the first evident that this hotel takes every customer and every request seriously. To make a long review short, The room was spacious with modern decor and a big bathroom. The entire layout of the room was well-thought out. I particularly loved the stand-alone mirror provided which was very handy for me. No other hotel I stayed so far had this feature. This was a small detail but an important one to make my stay more pleasant. The breakfast choice was elaborate, dining area was very pleasant and we loved the food at the Exe Lounge. The staff are not only friendly and polite, they are efficient and would go the extra mile to entertain your request. This is from the moment you stepped out of your car, to asking the housekeeing lady for 2 adaptors, to Sato san who took great care of us at the Executive lounge to Ari san, who's in charge of customer service at the hotel, whose personal greetings and sincere customer care attitude. These people made our stay came above and beyond all our experience with other hotel. I would recommend everyone to try this truly 5-star hotel out! The location of the hotel is great for us. It's only one station from Ginza and the fish market.

It was our first stay, and a very good one. We loved the size of the room, the decor, the bed, views, the breakfast spread.. The location is nearer to Shimbashi than Ginza, but Ginza is really a stone's throw away. The bathroom had a separate bathtub and was truly huge in Japanese standards. The floorboards in the bathroom made this hollow sound when you walked across, perhaps because the floor was elevated? Not a big issue. The blinds are all on automatic, and of course the toilet itself was a Japanese classic automated one.I have to commend the Concierge for their very efficient, thorough and prompt responses to our requests. Prior to arriving, I emailed them to ask for help making 4 restaurant reservations for us. Not only did they make them, but they also printed out detailed maps, and specified if a restaurant took only cash. This was all before we arrived, so by the time we really set foot on Japanese shores, we were all set to go, and everything went very smoothly.Location-wise, the Conrad is pretty convenient. The airport limo bus didn't take us to the hotel door, but to a nearby transport depot, where we took a cab (roughly Yen 1,700) to the hotel. On the way back to Narita, however, there was airport limo bus pick-up service right at the doorstep of the hotel... Exit number 7 or 8, at Shiodome's subway station, is almost right in front of the hotel also. Otherwise, it's just a 5 min walk from the hotel via elevated platform to the Shimbashi JR station. A great place to stay if hanging out in the Ginza area is your goal.

Service in the ""China Blue"" restaurant was a bit hit and miss. The food is very good but on one of my visits it was served far too quickly.

Breakfast: A full buffet with a good mix of cuisines stations.Bar/Lounge Area: Great ambiance with breathtaking views of the harbour. Con: This area has a designated smoking section which is in the open (although rather odd for a hotel as it wasn’t closed off like most smoking areas throughout the city), also is somewhat annoying for a non-smoker, even though the area seems well ventilated, there is still a hint of cigar/cigarette smoke in the air. Hotel Location: In direct proximity to the Shiodome subway station and a 5 min walk to Shimbashi JR station. Also, an easy walk to Ginza shopping area as well as the famous Tsukiji fish market, the largest in Japan!General Tip: Recommend grabbing a coffee or a quick bite at some of the cute coffee/café places in the adjoining mall as a cheaper alternative to eating at the hotel. Also, the subway is clean, prompt, safe and really easy to use; it’s a quick way of getting around the city.

I thought I knew what great customer service is until I stayed at this hotel. The staff goes out of their way to make sure your stay is perfect. The executive lounge was one of the best that I have been in. The staff there was very friendly in helping us find things to do and suggesting good places to eat. They would write down names and addresses of locations in Japanese for us to hand to a Taxi driver. The people at the front desk were also very willing to do this as well. The view at this hotel was amazing. The rooms were spacious and extremely clean. This the first hotel that I have stayed at where they offered a turn down service. The staff would leave a small teddy bear key chain on the pillows after turning the covers down. I also never knew I needed a heated toilet seat until I stayed at this hotel. Who knew having a slightly warm toilet seat would be such a nice amenity. Being an American there were some other options I chose not to try that the toilet offered.

Our stay was comfortable and the rooms were of a high standard with a great view of the bay. The pool and fitness area were also good. But overall I felt a bit underwhelmed. I was expecting a little more refined service from a hotel in Tokyo. The reception area feels chaotic and the staff, while friendly, feel like they have an artificial smile permanently painted on their faces. I didn't really feel like I was in a Japanese hotel - it felt like I was staying on the planet ""Conrad"". Perhaps that's a good thing for the ""Hiltonites"" who want the same creature comforts whereever they are in the world but I just felt the service would have been better if it was more sincere rather than false smiles and marketing gimmicks. We arrived a little early (at 2:30pm) and our room wasn't ready, which was absolutely fine (check-in was 3pm) but we were given a pretty hard sell to upgrade to a suite for a pretty extortionate amount of money (around £150 GBP) to avoid the 30 minute delay. Even the receptionist must have realised that was a dreadful deal! In a Japanese brand hotel we would have been politely told that the room wasn't ready and to come back at 3pm, and in a way, I think I would have far preferred that to an unwelcome sales pitch.I was also very unimpressed that smoking is allowed in the bar area. There is no way of adequately ventilating an area that size so you can still clearly smell tobacco everywhere in the reception area, even in the non-smoking area which I am afraid to say is absolutely unacceptable for a hotel of this calibre and therefore renders a 2 star review. If you have to have a smoking area inside the hotel then it needs to be in a completely separate room (as is the case for many other airports/train stations/hotels in Tokyo).Overall, I am afraid that the ""Conrad"" brand just doesn't translate well into ""Tokyo"". Perhaps try a little more ""Tokyo"" and a little less ""Conrad""?","London, United Kingdom",188,2.0

It's place in the Hilton Honors award night redemption tier structure (the highest tier) is an accurate reflection of the quality of this hotel, the quality of the staff and their service, and the hotel's location in the Shiodome / Shimbashi area of Tokyo. We enjoyed our second stay in November 2014 as much as our first stay in March 2008. You will not go wrong booking at this hotel.The first thing I will note is that while this hotel is located in a business center area of Tokyo, it has a much less ""business traveler hotel"" feel to it than do similarly situated Conrad Hotels in Singapore and Hong Kong, which we stayed at immediately prior to staying at this hotel. While this hotel does cater to business travelers more than family travelers, and is certainly an urban hotel, not a resort, the hotel's predominate ambiance, in my perception, is a warm, relaxed, friendly feel. As leisure travelers (staying on award night points), we felt very comfortable, relaxed and ""at home"" in this hotel. I am not sure how I could pay the staff of this hotel a higher compliment. Rooms are very spacious by any Tokyo hotel standard you may choose to apply. Rooms have floor to ceiling windows with bay (odd numbered rooms) or city (even numbered rooms). Our city view room had a SkyTree view as well. There are floor to ceiling windows the width of the room, with ""window"" seats in front of the windows. There is a spacious desk and plenty of room to move around. The bathroom is quite large, and has a window with blinds that can be raised or lowered to offer privacy or to open up views of the city / bay (through the room). The entire room is kitted with high tech switches and automated open / close buttons. Amenities are well stocked and always kept refreshed. We had breakfast daily in the casual restaurant in the hotel, the Cerise. While not large, it is sufficiently sized to accommodate typical usage patterns, and offers a wide variety of Japanese and western breakfast options. Service is good and attentive. Oddly, when ordering tea, they serve it from a pitcher rather than bringing a small teapot, which I found to be the norm at most hotel restaurants. We did not patronize any other of the hotel's restaurants.We found the executive lounge, although not extremely large, to be a warm, inviting, relaxing place to unwind in the evening and enjoy the lights of Tokyo. The place is designed for quiet conversation. If you have an urgent business conversation with more than two - three people, it is perhaps best to hold it elsewhere. We found the service and food selection to be very good. There was one negative to our experience, and I do not recall it from 2008. On the 28th (main lobby) floor, where the elevator lobby hallway intersects the main lengthwise hallway, there was consistently a smell of cigarette smoke. The odor was very noticeable but very localized. Ten feet away and it was hard to ""smell."" Although not really able to smell the smoke from the Cerise restaurant, because I am quite sensitive to cigarette smoke, my eyes did start watering the one morning we sat along the hallway in the restaurant.Except for this one fluke, our stay was exceptional and we would highly recommend this hotel.","Cypress, Texas",253,5.0

It seems fickle to say but it becomes wearing after a while to have to take two elevators/lifts to your room- The rooms are nicely sized and appointed but I wish the room was a tad more open. For example, the shower and toilet are behind frosted glass. - The restaurants were priced for folks on expense accounts. That shouldn't be a surprise but it's worth noting. There are more reasonable restaurants in the buildings either side - don't hesitate to investigate- Made in China shampoo, body wash, shampoo etc seems cheap for such a high end hotel- View from the city side of the hotel isn't much to speak of (most you see is 2-3 offices opposite)Conclusion:Good hotel, nice service. It's a bit far from the cites but not impossible to get to where you need to be in Tokyo via the Tokyo underground or JR lines. I previously stayed at the Cerulean hotel in Shibuya. I liked the room a little more (the bathroom in particular) and the view was spectacular. That may have been my good luck but that was my experience.

Like a lot of Japanese hotels, it doesn't actually begin until the higher floors, with the main lobby being on the 24th or 27th, i cant remember.Yes the hotel is relatively expensive for most, but if you have Hilton Status for executive lounge, or get a room with lounge access, it is well worth it.The only issue i found was getting there, by train/subway specifically. If you are coming into Tokyo having never been there before and heading straight to Conrad, dont even attempt to get there by Metro/subway following their directions on the website. It will cause nothing but grief. I suggest getting a cab/car all the way from the airport, or catch the NEX train to Tokyo station and get a cab to Conrad from there. ""Shiodome"" stations would have to be one of the more difficult ones to get to on the network it seems, invariably you will end up at Shimbashi, which is kind of connected to Shiodome but via a very long walk in true Tokyo Metro/subway style.Check in was fast, unfortunately they didnt have a room upgrade avaiilable for my Hilton status (Diamond), so was sent up a nice 'Amenity' instead (bottle of nice spanish wine and some very nice snacks).First impression of the room was - Wow. Much bigger than i expected, very well laid out, great window space offering good views of the Bay. Even a 2nd bathroom/powder room near the entrance, which i definitely wasnt expecting. Main bathroom included a good sized bath and spacious shower area. Good mirrors and lighting for the ladies.The executive lounge was fantastic. As usual, the busiest at breakfast, but still not really too bad. Afternoon tea was exceptional, with all sorts of sweet and savoury treats. If you weren't a big eater, you could easily eat all your meals here in the lounge.Its important to understand, tokyo is a very big place. So you have to choose your hotel location wisely. Although the JR & Metro systems are quite comprehensive, sometimes its better to stay in the district you're most likely to spend the most time.That said, the famous Tokyo fish markets are right nearby the Conrad (take on metro stop), as well as the Hamarikyu Garden, just a short walk. this is a great garden to have a look around and you can also have a quite traditional Green Tea in the Tea house on the lake.Ginza is also quite nearby by Metro.The view from the lobby bar is fantastic - over the bay.

You could basically just hang out there all day, but of course that would be a waste of a trip to Tokyo. The hotel is conveniently located with lots of high-end shops within close walking distance, although it is not the most convenient for using the subway. However, even that is only a couple blocks away, and the hotel staff were helpful in explaining the details of how to get there (it's somewhat complicated for a first timer). The bar, the spa and the indoor pool were all very nice and well maintained. We didn't have occasion to try the restaurants on site. My part was the complimentary stuffed animal that housecleaning leaves upon cleaning the room. It was just a nice little touch. The only potentially negative thing was there seemed to be a faint smell of smoke from the bar area.

The hotel is impressive in every way. Our room was well decorated in a simple style that looked fresh and light. Located on the 36th floor, the room provided excellent views across the bay through floor to ceiling windows. The beds were extremely comfortable; the bathroom spacious with a large shower area. The standard of housekeeping was first class, the room was kept perfectly clean throughout our stay. The communal areas were also well decorated and spacious. Breakfast was excellent; a wide choice of Western and Asian food, all of high quality and well presented. The service was attentive and polite. The 28th floor breakfast area was divided into 2 sections. The area by the window was most impressive with a high ceiling and large windows giving a real sense of space. The area away from the window was fine but felt a bit average by comparison. We secured a window seat 5 days out of 6 so hopefully most days you can do the same! We did not use the restaurant for evening meals, purely because we wanted to try some other venues in Tokyo. The bar area also provides great views at night and the bar staff were friendly and welcoming.The reception and concierge team were polite and very helpful. As an example the lady on the concierge desk wrote down our request for a bullet train ticket in Japanese, just in case the station staff had any problems with English. All the restaurant bookings we made through the hotel worked well.The location is close to the Shiodome station; for a large hotel it can be a bit tricky to find until you get used to the layout of the surrounding office blocks.Overall a great experience.

I've stayed in many 5 star hotels in Tokyo and this is one of my favorites. My only complaint is that the lobby cafe allows smoking. it must be a big draw because it is CLOGGED with cigarette smoke, which drifts throughout the lobby area as well. It totally spoils the lobby in my opinion, and there is no way i would have a coffee or tea in the cafe with all that smoke. Luckily it doesnt seem to get into the air ducts--there is no smoky smell in other areas such as the restaurant or the non-smoking guest floors.

There was no regret. It easily beats many other hotels I had stayed in the past. The room was big, given that Conrad is situated in the heart of Tokyo and near Ginza. The design was not really chic but best described as traditional. I liked the carpet that came with sakura flower design, as well as the wall behind the bed. The bed was very comfortable and offered very good sleep quality. The bathroom was spacious and luxurious, but it could be better if there was a small window for some view outside while soaking in the bathtub. But I'm asking too much in the first place! There were 2 separate basins, which was very thoughtful and convenient. Other than a bathtub, there was also a shower area with rain shower head. One thing that easily exceeded my expectation was the service quality of the staff. It was simply unmatched. All of them would not hesitate to greet guests with a smile and some even wished me a pleasant day knowing that I was leaving the hotel for my tour. I left a note for the housekeeper to provide one more Conrad duckie before leaving for my shopping and I did find it when I return at night! The hotel also left a note on my table on my last night of stay and gave a box of 4 Conrad bears! Every night was a surprise!The hotel was located very near to Shiodome Station but the more relevant station was the Shimbashi Station, which the JR line runs through. It was slightly further away, about 5 to 10 minutes walk. But the walk was quite pleasant as there were shops and restaurants along the way. The only minor complaint I had was that the free wi-fi was intermittent occasionally, although not to the extent of being disruptive to my surfing.

The bed is very comfortable and there is even a day bed style chair in the suite, which made lying by the window, staring at the magnificent view of the bay a wonderful activity during my stay. The executive lounge is located on the 37/F,and I thought (compared to the executive lounges in Hong Kong and Singapore) it was a bit small, and the food offering also lacked a bit (in terms of variety) but staff was super helpful and ambience pleasant (though it gets quite crowded during the daily happy hour period)We had breakfast at the restaurant on 28/F which offered more japanese and western offering, but again their variety could do with some expansion as well. Food quality was very high, try and sit on the ""collage"" side which had very high ceiling and stunning looks over the cityAll in all a superb property, with some minor details/improvements to be made. Proximity to HND definitely a great plus for us when considering our next stay in Tokyo","Hong Kong, China",86,5.0

Say you have a smartphone and a computer, if you want to connect a third device, like a tablet or a second phone, you'll have to pay. At the rates of the room this is frankly ridiculous...- It is a bit off center wrt Ginza and not as conveniently close to the action as The Peninsula. The Shiodome station is unfortunately not on a direct line to Tokyo's hot spots.- Breakfast buffet was a bit disappointing: soba were not great, scrambled egs were coldish.

I felt so special and my only complaint is that I left many kilos heavier!!!! We had an amazing Tepanyaki experience in their restaurant with our own private chef (organised by Ari and the best who also knew english and had worked in the best restaurants in Europe) at their restaurant Kazahana. Stunning views and the best quality food with a the best Japanese chef I have every experienced and all to ourselves. Wow!!! What a birthday!!!!! Not only was I surprised in the executive lounge with a cake but also after our Tepanyaki meal and then as if I hadn't enough spoiling Ari again organise another incredibly decadent and unbelievably yummy chocolate mousse cake with champagne as a surprise. I was stunned and so humbled by the generosity of the staff especially Ari. They made me feel like royalty. Unforgettable.We arrived at Tokyo after Osaka and the already magical Kyoto experience but the Conrad Tokyo is the most unbelievable experience of perfect professional luxury I have ever experienced. Absolutely all of the Conrad Tokyo facilities are stunning and perfect my only regret is wanting for more personable guidance when it comes to discovering Tokyo as a city. In comparison to Kyoto and Osaka we found it a little full on and exhausting. Our last night we found out later we arrived right in the heart of Yakuza district that is in no way charming but then it was our last night (and I do recommend what they call memory lane before 10 pm for very cute bars and restaurants) so overall a very entertaining trip. Would definitely vista Tokyo again if only for the Conrad Tokyo experience. Absolutely the most perfect hotel we have ever stayed in!!!","Melbourne, Australia",15,5.0

There was a hiccup during checkin as I was told that the luggage was placed in a wrong room. However, Jones at the reception was quick to rectify the problem.The hotel room is what I expected of a premium property. Even though the following may seem trivial, I find that having remote control blinds for the windows and sensor lighting in the cupboards offer some level of premium not seen in most other Hilton properties. Room was spacious especially in land scarce Japan, which could even fit a fairly large round desk. The exec lounge is very small, had a contemporary kitchen concept. Had a chat with Ani (not sure if spelt rightly) who was very friendly and helpful. Most of the activities in the hotel seem to be at the lobby bars and restaurants. The lobby bar is a nice to chill place in the evening, the lighting and fire place creates a very nice atmosphere for relaxation.Had a kiseki dinner at Khazahana at the lobby, but prepare to pay a premium for the meal.

I emailed the hotel concierge before our stay and asked if they could make some restaurant reservations for us. The head concierge Yasutoshi Abe emailed me back in a timely manner with all my reservation details.

The hotel is in a great location (although it took us a while to figure this out!), close to the metro which includes plenty of restaurants and a short walk to Ginza. The bedrooms were alright, nothing exceptional, clean and in good condition. The housekeeping was very good and what a lovely idea to leave kimono style sleeping shirts on the beds in the evenings!. Free WIFI was good. The breakfast was great with freshly prepared options or an extensive buffet, after only 1 day the staff knew what coffee/tea we drank, very impressive. One of the highlights was the lovely Ari & his team. Ari was always on hand to greet us, offer advice or just have a little chat when we were arriving back into the hotel or departing for a day of sight seeing!. I was probably spoilt by the other hotels we stayed in during this trip but they had all been advised that this was a special occasion by our travel agent. As such, in Hong Kong we were upgraded to a breath-taking room and given lounge access on the executive floor with free food, drinks and a complimentary mini-bar. In Macau we were upgraded to a $3k a night suite and lavished with gifts. On arrival at Conrad, the staff asked us if we wanted to pay extra for a better view ( if they have this available, why not give it to the guests who are already here and have paid a lot of money to do so??) Staff remembered it was a special occasion on our last day and kindly said they would do something to help us celebrate... they wrapped our towels in the shapes of swans. Very nice of them but pales into comparison with others efforts!. I have stayed at other Conrad/Hilton hotels and feel they skimp on the very little touches that could make them outstanding. I certainly won't be searching out Conrad's in the future but this hotel is good enough.","Belfast, United Kingdom",102,4.0

All rooms are floor 30 and above so I assume all have great views. Gorgeous full window views of the bay. Bathrooms (and the way they interacted with the room itself) were really cool/fun/glamorous design - check out a picture to see what I mean. Very striking. Attentive and extremely polite staff. Nice breakfast buffet and nice choice of restaurants. I went to the general restaurant one evening and had some Italian food that was good with good service and ambience. They also have a Japanese restaurant and I believe their French restaurant is Michelin starred. Nice bar with a fireplace for evening drinks if that's your thing. Unfortunately they put us in a 1 bed room instead of a 2 bed room due to being full (it was a National Holiday weekend, which is understandable but we had booked well in advance and didn't find out until we entered the room), so we had to have a rollaway bed for the night and repack the next day to move to our 2 bed room. Due to that I didn't completely relax into the ambience or feel that our every need was catered for the way you would expect at a hotel of this level of luxury. I felt a more valued guest at other hotels we stayed in during our Japan trip (Ritz Carlton Osaka, Prince Park Tower Tokyo, Togetsutei Kyoto). In the pool/spa the pool and jacuzzi area were separate which was a slight inconvenience, but both were great facilities. Jacuzzi was right off from the changing room so I think this may have been so people could use the jacuzzi naked in the Japanese onsen style. Great view from the full length windows at the pool. Great toiletry amenities in stations around the pool/spa and nice big loungey chairs pool-side. All the hotel toiletries smelled gorgeous. And the hotel slippers are very comfortable. Although there are 2 train stations right next to it on the map, it is quite a walk to them through underground or overground passages - especially the Shinbashi one. Can feel tiring if you're stopping off at the hotel during the day and have to make 10-15 min walks each time. In general the hotel felt more far out on the edge than I thought it would be. Although the many different train lines were convenient to go anywhere, the very immediate surrounding area seemed to be just highways and hotels, with a mall in the underground passages on the way to the train. Seemed like a hotel area when you stepped outside rather than stepping out into a bustling area of the city, like our other hotels. On the occasions when we took cabs at night it ended up being a little more expensive to get back here than our other Tokyo hotel which was about 1 train stop away.","Cardiff, United Kingdom",7,4.0

We tried 2 restaurants, one onsite, and another in Ginza. They were both great dining experiences, although the Conrad was a bit on the pricey side, but we expected it and the ambience and dining experience was well worth it. Check in was quick and easy, they had everything ready for us before we arrived and the room was large, clean, and very comfortable. The view was amazing. I chose an executive King - Bay View, and the service at the executive lounge and the snacks was well worth the price of upgrading. The service from the bell-hop to the GM was exceptional. I actually felt a little uncomfortable since one girl insisted on carrying all 3 of our oversized luggage by herself, but she was so nice, I didn't want to offend her. The location was great as well, within walking distance from the fish market and Ginza, and easy access to the Shimbashi station, so it was very convenient.

Everyone from the greeters, concierge, bellboys and reception are extremely helpful and kind. If it's in their power they will do their best. Everything here was topnotch. The hotel itself is interesting. When you walk in on the ground floor there is a desk with a greeter who will tell you to take the elevators to the lobby which is on the 28th floor. It's weird to me, but you get used to it. The lobby is very sleek and modern. Checkin was easy for us on both of my trips there. The room is very beautiful. It doesnt feel small or cramped due to the nice layout. Our room had a couch that spanned the windows. The bathroom was very clean and it had blinds that could be closed for privacy. Automated blinds that is. SO COOL. I'm easily impressed. Also they provided free toothbrush, hairband, sewing kit along with the usual hotel shampoos and conditioner. The pictures show more than I can describe.If you have access to the lounge, you are in for a treat. They have evening cocktail service with hor d'oerves from the hotel's restaurants and also a full breakast in the morning which included egg station, pastries and also traditional japanese breakfast with shiozake and rice congee with toppings. **TIP** if you want to get to the Subway/TokyoMetro, you can do it from the street level, but I find it's easier to navigate underground if you are not familiar with the streets around the hotel. In order to go underground, you would need to take a left out the double doors and just out the door there will be escalators going down. There are a series of tunnels that will take you to Shimbashi station (They have a Beard Papa at this, you must try the cream puffs!!).

Hotel reception is on the 28th floor with guest rooms from Floor 29-37.Rooms are a good size with floor to ceiling windows with electronic curtains and blinds.Bathroom also has a full glass wall allowing view across the room to the picture window - an electronically controlled blind allows privacy in the bathroom if required.Amenities were very good - good quality shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion, razor and gel, toothbrushes/paste, comb/brush etc.I could not fault the room ... excellent in every way.Service of the room was consistently high though one evening the turn down service was a little lax compared to other services (i.e. bin wasn't emptied as it had the previous night)I had access to the Executive Lounge ..... one of the best I have experienced with different canapés each evening sourced from one of their 4 restaurants (Japanese, Chinese, French, all day dining) and a wide selection of drinks available. Ambience was very good including a gas fire place to sit in front of if desired.The first morning I had breakfast in the main restaurant then the following two mornings in the Executive Lounge. The breakfast in the main restaurant was probably one of only twee disappointments of my stay. If you wanted eggs in any way other than the scrambled on the buffet there was a 900yen additional charge. I asked for sparkling water .... again an additional charge.The subsequent 2 mornings in the Executive Lounge were both very good.The Bar named Twenty-Eight (on the 28th floor adjoining reception) was very welcoming and had the same excellent Bay views. Quite expensive though with 2 glasses of wine almost 5000 Yen. Depending where you sit in the evenings it can be quite dark. My only disappointment was that one end of the bar allows smoking..... I was very surprised that such a high quality hotel still allowed smoking inside in close proximity to non smoking areas.On the final day I had a quick lunch in the all day dining restaurant ""Cerise"" Although I was in a hurry it was still an excellent meal with faultless service (again expensive at 3842 Yen for a grilled prawn salad).As I said previously Conrad Tokyo is an excellent hotel with faultless service that I would certainly return to. My only two negatives:- the ""silly"" decision to charge surcharges for eggs other than scrambled and sparkling water at breakfast- having a smoking end of the bar","South Australia, Australia",136,5.0

The location of the Hotel is spectacular, being almost entirely located 28+ stories up thereby affording uninterrupted views of the City and the Bay with the former imperial gardens in the foreground. The Hotel is situated in a predominantly office precinct but within easy walking distance to Ginza and quality restauants were close by. The excellent subway system was accessible from a station directly under th Hotel so getting anywhere downtown was not a problem. The elevated railway passed alongside the Hotel building with a station outside which could whisk you over the bridge to the other side of the Bay with little delay.The staff are, without exception, pleasant, helpful and well trained and the concierge service is amazing. The recommendations to nearby restaurants were accurate and well-considered, also providing a range of price options.The rooms (particularly those facing the Bay as mine did) are spacious, well-maintained and appointed including comfortable beds and furniture. Hanging and clothes storage space was sufficient. The complimentary wi-fi service was quite adequate, (no apparent need for the premium system offered at extra cost.) The bathing products, towels and robes were high quality.Ice is provided nightly for after-dinner drinks. The choice of TV channels was a bit limited and the use of a Japanese voiceover superimposed on English language channels was a bit bizarre.Possibly this could be switched off but not being a big TV watcher I did not bother. In any case, the TV programming is more down to the local networks rather than the Hotel. Hotel bar prices are high but this is an international Hotel in a relatively expensive city. Liquor for consumption in the rooms is readily available nearby.The breakfast spread has enough variety to suit most tastes and you can get good expresso coffee. I did not book this Hotel so I have no idea how it compares in value with others in Tokyo but it is a safe bet, particularly for a first time visitor to Tokyo.","Mornington Peninsula, Australia",6,5.0

In particular, Ari, the Service Quality Manager stands out as one of the most attentive and eloquent hotel property staff I have ever interacted with. He immediately addressed a room issue we had and personally oversaw our seamless transfer to a much nicer room. Throughout our stay Ari and his immaculately trained staff personally checked in with us, proactively anticipated our needs and offered personalized concierge services that would rival any ultra luxury high-end hotel property in the world. Apart form the amazing service, the hotel property is world class. If you're able, I recommend staying on the club floor and utilizing the club facilities in the evenings for a drink overlooking the city. The club staff are also wonderful.

The suite was extremely large by Tokyo standards and similar in size to suites in USA. Suite had a well appointed master bath and a separate powder room.Evening turn-down service was efficient with water and towel refresh. However, no chocolates that some other hotels provide at turn-down.As a Diamond member, we had Executive Lounge access. We never had trouble to find a table for breakfast.

Then, asked for my food tastes and arranged an exquisite Japanese vegetarian meal through chef Tamura. Their exec lounge feels special too with the its ambiance and service.

In our opinion, hotels do not get any better than this. Please note - Conrad's do not seem to follow a particular architectural or decorative style say like 4 Seasons (modern - we've stayed at the 4 Seasons Hong Kong and Seattle) or Rtiz Carlton (traditional). The Conrad Hong Kong was traditional. The Conrad Tokyo was decidedly very modern.My wife prefers traditional. I prefer modern. We both agreed that style preferences notwithstanding, the Conrad Tokyo was magnificent in all regards. The rooms (we booked an extra room for our son) were spacious, clean beyond possible, and of excellent décor. The common areas are spectacular (again, within the context of modern or ultra modern). We did not eat in any of the restaurants and so cannot comment on them. We were, however, as Diamond members, given access to the Executive Lounge. While we did not consider it ""over the top"", we did feel that it offered good selection of very good quality food in a pleasant environment. We only ate breakfast there as we were in Tokyo in part to see the sights and in part to savor the food. And you do not savor food , with the possible exception of breakfast, in an executive lounge. You savor it in fine restaurants and local holes in the wall or some combination of the two.Within this context, the concierge staff at the Conrad was particularly sophisticated in discerning exactly what we were looking for in both lunch and dinner venues and their suggestions were spot on.We travel extensively as a family for pleasure (25 countries in the past six years).

My husband and I stayed at other 5 star hotels in Hakone, Osaka, and Kyoto, during our 3 week first ever trip to Japan. Without a doubt the Conrad was the best stay of them all by a quantum leap. On our last leg of the trip back from Kyoto to Tokyo, we were welcomed by Mr. Ari Ferdauz with a wide smile and a warm embrace. Everyone at the check in desk, Ms.Miki Saito, Mr. Yasutoshi Abe (he tells me he is not related to Japan's PM of the same name) acknowledged our return with smiles and greetings. It was like coming back home, yet we were still in Japan, and that is what the Tokyo Conrad is all about. Every single team member made us feel like we were guests in their special place, their and our home. It is amazing that a hotel this size in one of the largest cities in the world shows this type of genuine hospitality day after day. Consistancy of genuine caring is what makes people come back to great hotels and this is part of the fabric that makes up this hotel. Ari introduced us to the GM, Heinrich Grafe who also welcomed us back as we were checking in. Ari personally escorted us to our upgraded room on the executive floor with a Bay view. I had previously written that we liked the city view room we previously had, so Ari wanted us to compare.I could probably write another article on the gorgeous Bay view, but after 3 more days in Tokyo the Bay wins handily.When we went downstairs for breakfast, the first thing Ms. Hiero Ayado asked us, was not what is our room number, but how was our trip going since we saw her last! She wanted to hear all about it, just as our friends and family do back home. When we told Mr. Nunzio L'oliva, the supervisor of the breakfast room how wonderful breakfast had been each and every day, he asked me if he could get one of his colleagues, Ms. Asatani Eriko, so she could hear our accolades. Mr. l'oliva graciously gave her all the credit for the superb service we constantly experienced for 9 breakfasts at the Conrad.Three day later during our departure, Mr. Chapay Deepak,Guest Service Executive, saw us wheeling our own luggage through the lobby to catch the airport limousine bus. He hurriidly ran from behind his desk to take the luggage from us and escort us down to the ground level. He waited with us for 15 minutes until the bus arrived,getting to know one another better. Mr. Deepak had previously helped us when we were waiting to talk to the concierge the day before. Rather than have us wait, he again came from behind the desk and asked if he could be of assistance. He truly has a sixth sense of anticipating guest's needs and knows when to intervene.I have purposely not talked about the great facilities,rooms,bathrooms, executive lounge, sauna, swimming pool(not to mention the surrealistic view of the pool overlooking the skyline). That has all been talked about in TripAdvisor. The real story about this hotel is the people. That is reason enough for us to revisit Tokyo sooner than we would have ever imagined before this stay at the Tokyo Conrad.","Houston, Tx.",1,5.0

As for the room, spacious, beautifully and stylishly decorated with lots of natural light from the large windows. Bathroom supplies, three different kinds of high-end bathroom toiletries was a simple way to feel spoiled. As for the executive lounge; very neat set-up with a cool fireplace! Food selections were good, especially the lobster dip! Breakfast in the main restaurant was beyond what I expected, but kept up with the Conrad brand; lots of fresh fruit, numerous bread and pastries selections, eggs, ham, sausage, dumplings, and so much more!! And the pool, a fabulous pool to relax by and to do laps. And Lounge 28, they have a non-smoking section which is fabulous for us non-smokers!

The gym is above average (only because more equipment would be great). The lap pool is fantastic! And there is a fantastic steam, sauna, and whirlpool (4) in the men's room - very clean. Even places to shower, shave, brush your teeth with amenities supplied. One of this great bathing suit spin-dryers as well. Upon leaving on my last visit I was quickly stressed. About 20 people in line before me. In most any other hotel I've been at I could expect at least a 30 minute delay.

And for good reason: Shiodome is very well connected to subways and monorail lines. It is a short walk from Shiodome to major places like Ginza (5 minutes), the Panasonic Visitors Centre, Hama Rikuyu Gardens, several shopping malls and numerous restaurants. Also, the Shiodome area is a true marvel of architecture and one simply wants to be there.The Conrad Hotel is said to be the best hotel in Shiodome. In fact it is listed as one of the 25 best hotels in all of Japan. So I had high expectations. From the very start these expectations were met. Checkin was quick and courteous. And... this is one of the very few hotels in Japan that allows guests into their rooms before check-in time (that is: if the room is cleaned and ready for the next guest).The room is very big and beautifully decorated. There's lots of wood and strategically placed lighting to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Over the bed is a minimalstic art work depicting a blossom tree; at the very end of it is a 3d sculpted bird. Beautiful! Instead of the usual chocolate, the turn down service (house keeping) will put a little teddy bear on the bed on the first day.Since there are so many hotels closely packed together, my view was blocked by other hotels. I found out the hard way that ""city view"" is a eufemism for: ""you won't see a darn thing from your room"".One reason for choosing a top hotel is top service. After reading some of the bad reviews of the hotel I can only conclude that the Conrad really did learn from these customers' unsatisfactory experiences and improved itself with every bad review. For starters I experienced the personnel to be very kind and sincere. After just one day they knew my face, remembered why I was here and asked about my job and my work at the end of the day. I appreciate that!When I wanted to go to a car show the congierge didn't just help me to find the place, he even managed to get me free tickets to the show!A day later I bought a Blueray disc in town. In my room was a DVD player, not a BlueRay player. When I asked the congierge for a solution, a Blueray player was installed in my room within half an hour. Now that's great service!Still there are a few points of critique:- it seems like most of the staff is none Japanese. This may reduce the language barrier, but it also takes away the magic of being in Japan.- there's no 220 volt wall socket in the room. Some of these top hotels offer both 100 and 220 volt to the guests, which eliminates the use of adapters, transformers and other gadgets.- smoking is allowed in the bar, making it a no-go area for most none smokers. Come on, this is 2014 ban smoking in public areas!- the Internet in the room is VERY slow, not just compared to other hotels but even compared to ten years ago. Even when using a cable instead of wifi, the average upload speed is shameful 10 kb per second. My old phone line modem was quicker than that! The 3G connection on my phone is faster than that! This was not an accident, the Internet connection was this slow every day, every time of day. Since I need to submit my work to my office via Internet daily, this slow connection is the sole eason not to stay at the Conrad again. And please Condrad, don't start about ""premium"" Internet because I've paid enough of a premium price for the room itself and other top quality hotels do provide proper Internet as standard.","Tokyo, Japan",291,4.0

Upon checking in we got upgraded to an Executive Room overlooking the beautiful Hama Rikyu Gardens and were wowed with the service and professionalism of the staff (excellent English , if I may say so myself). Breakfast was also a delight and made us make it a point not to skip out on the most important meal of the day.

We stay here every other month at our own expense ( not company's )for leisure. My husband and I agree that this is the most enjoyable and comfortable hotel that we've experienced in Japan. ( We've visited Japan more than fifteen times over the last three years and have stayed in 4-5 star hotels in Tokyo as well as other cities). Other reviewers have pointed out how well appointed the Conrad Tokyo is and I agree. The beds are a dream to sleep in and we have never had a bad experience at all during all our stays. The staff at the executive lounge always make a point in remembering us and welcoming us back. Although its location is a little way out, the Oedo train station is directly below ( less than 1 minute away). The Ginza / Shimbashi station is a little further away, but with both stations nearby,transportation is very easy.There is a bus that goes to the Conrad from Narita airport. However, I can only recommend that during off peak hours as it took us almost 3 hours to reach our destination in the late afternoon. We have learnt how to take the Narita Express train to Tokyo station and from there, we catch a cab to the Conrad. The train ride is one hour and the cab ride is another15 minutes . From Haneda airport, the cab ride is only about 30-40 mins. to the Conrad ( 6000 + yen ).The bus and train tickets cost about the same ( 3000 yen ) but there is the additional cost of the taxi fare ( 1000+ yen ).

We took the Narita Express train from the airport to Tokyo station and then took another train to Shimbashi station, which is very conveniently located near the Conrad Hotel. Admittedly, the nondescript front of the hotel and labyrinth of walkways made finding the hotel initially challenging. Once you figure the area out, you'll realize its quite convenient. We would purchase the all day Metro pass (approx $10 USD) and made excellent use of the subway system. If you are a Hilton rewards premier member, this is most definitely the place the be. The executive lounge and especially the complimentary breakfast is just simply astounding and the free Wifi is quite fast. Our room was quite large and the blackout drapes were very nice. The very minor inconveniences we experienced while at the Conrad were: 1) lack of English channels on TV (even CNN & BBC are dubbed with Japanese); 2) the right bathroom sink of our room drained extraordinarily slowly. Regardless, we'd definitely stay again. We also stayed at the Peninsula Tokyo during our trip and would choose the Conrad between the two.

Had an excellent stay.Location - This was our first trip to Tokyo and I found the location to be excellent for our touristy pursuits. You can walk to Ginza in about 10 minutes over pedestrian bridges (so no crossing busy streets). You are one minute walk from the Shiodome subway and maybe 5 minutes or so from Shimbashi. It is about 15 minute walk to Tsukiji market. Overall, the subway connections and proximity to the fish market make it a quite ideal location for a tourist. The hotel also always had taxis available. We took a Limo Bus to Narita from the hotel and took a private car from Narita to the hotel (timing didn't work for the Limo Bus).Public Areas - As others have mentioned, you arrive in a small lobby and then take an elevator to the 28th floor. Unlike the US, elevators are fast, and it takes maybe 10 seconds to go up 28 stories. The 28th floor lobby is basically a large bar and a small check in area. It does get busy when conferences are going on. The main floor has a gift shop and a few restaurants. The lobby is clean but does get smokey. In Japan lots of people smoke in bars and it is allowed.Room - We were upgraded to a bay view room which had an amazing view. The room was spacious - large comfortable king bed, sitting area, flat screen TV, large bathroom with a soaking tub and rain shower. The room was very clean. Our minor complaint is that the smoke from the lobby would sometimes filter up so sometimes you get a whiff of smoke. Also, in-room free internet was highly variable - slow as a snail and then sometimes fast. If you need to do work, rent a MiFi device.Service - Service was excellent. All staff spoke perfect English, smiled and were friendly. The concierge deal with our chaotic requests for reservations without issue and tackled some difficult reservations. Very happy with the staff.Breakfast - If you room includes breakfast, it is great.

A separate bath, shower and toilet, with everything you might expect in a 5 star hotel. Great bed, and very quiet. So what's wrong? It starts with the way the hotel is designed; the arrivals area is non-descript, more like the forecourt of an office building, which is in fact what it is. The hotel reception is on level 28, which has a sizeable bar area...not sizeable enough, though, to cater for 300 or so conference attendees who were having drinks there when I arrived. Rooms are situated on floors 29-37, so a second lift bank has to be used. This became an issue as my key did not work (in fairness, I read the room number incorrectly), and I had to return to reception and get someone to go up with me. Staff were excellent; a reliable attribute of all the hotels I have stayed in in Japan.The area is well served with restaurants, though it lacks the pedestrian appeal of Ginza. Still, a good business hotel, let down only by its adaptation to the building.Be aware tat if you are arriving from Narita, it is a long way...at least km.

If you don't like this hotel, then nothing is going to please you.A practical note: when arriving for the first time, the hotel is a bit of a challenge to find from the subway station (particularly the Shimbashi station).

This was our first trip to Japan and you certainly welcomed us with open arms. From the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out, we were completely spoiled by your friendly and efficient staff. The concierge at the front desk were most helpful in going over routes, time schedules and making suggestions of activities and sites we might enjoy. The concierge on the executive level were also great, getting us tickets to a baseball game we had looked forward to for months. We took advantage of the executive floor a couple of times daily to enjoy tea after a long day of site seeing and to enjoy a drink before dinner. Twice we used room service and have never in all our travels seen such efficiency! Every day we partook of your fabulous breakfast buffet. It reminded us of the wonderful ones we had at the Hilton Cavilari in Rome, as well as those in Berlin and Istanbul. Great variety. One of the most salient features of your hotel was the that all your staff showed a genuine passion for what they were doing and a professionalism that exceeded our expectations. Notable individuals we want to mention were Mr. Abe and Miss Saito, who were very patient and provided excellent guidance in obtaining our rail tickets to Hakone, Osaka, Kyoto and back to Tokyo. But the one individual who stood out as the most enthusiastic and passionate about his work was Azwin Ferdauz (Ari). From the moment he greeted us upon arrival, each time we encountered him, Ari showed us a warmth usually only shared by family members. Thank YOU for a memorable stay. We look forward to many visits in the future.","Houston, Texas",53,5.0

The evening offerings are very tasty and inventive. The new executive chef is from Mexico and they now feature Huevos Rancheros on the breakfast menu in the restaurant.I have to mention by name, Ari, who is the guest service manager. He is amazing and is everywhere. I had met him last year when he held the same position at the Hilton Osaka and when he saw me at check in he remembered me. He was constantly interacting with guests and always had a big smile and can do attitude. He actually escorted us out to our transfer to the airport to make sure our departure was as good as our hotel stay.We will be back again for a 4th stay next year again.

My company was having a large meeting nearby and so I ended up in The Conrad and not my usual ""home-from-home"" The Mandarin Oriental. The Conrad is modern, immaculately run and excellent value. The staff from the ground floor lobby, reception, restaurant, bar and room service speak perfect English and have turned service into a fine art. They are all warm and welcoming and deliver efficiency with a smile. The ground floor lobby provides a taste of what is yet to come with its large expansive and minimalist modern decor. The main reception on the 28th floor is also the location for the restaurants and bar, the view from which is stunning. Check-in was a breeze and being given a cool wet towel was very welcome. The rooms are large by any standards but are rare in Tokyo. The bathroom has a large soaking tub, an excellent separate shower and has a good range of the usual ammenities. The Venetian blind provides privacy between the bathroom and adjacent bedroom but also gives an open and very modern feeling to the room. The white ""rubber duck"" is a nice touch and brought a smile to my face. There is plenty of space for hanging clothes and general storage as well as facilities for tea and coffee and a well stocked minibar. The layout of the room is excellent with good workspace, comfortable seating areas and is immaculately maintained. The bed is on the firm side so any one expecting a soft, plush mattress is going to be disappointed. The bear (which you can keep if you so choose) is another amusing touch. Room service was first class and the menu is one of the best I have come across. Lots of choices including Japanese and Chinese items along with a wide range of breakfast choices. The gym is also very good. It has a reasonable number of ellipticals, treadmills and bikes. I wish there was a spinning bike but that's me being picky! The pool is excellent and the spa certainly looked very inviting. Finally, the Japanese restaurant ""Kazahana"" has an excellent Sushi bar and good range of premium sake. The chefs deliver mouth watering creations with understated flare with each dish prepared with an attention to detail that is riveting to watch. The Conrad delivers everything you expect and more from a luxury hotel and at a price that gives you excellent if not unbeatable value for money. ","Chicago, Illinois",87,5.0

Given that in Japan the square meters are scarce, the guys who designed this hotel obviously did not pay much attention to that. The rooms are oversized and exquisitely decorated, the view on Tokyo's harbour are breathtaking. The bathroom is kind of the middle of the room, so that you can get the view of the harbour from it.

And I've learnt a new excuse of refusing members' benefit: ""Sorry, our hotel is fully occupied"". And this apply to both Hilton and Conrad Tokyo. Fellow HH members may note that recently the upgrade rates for both properties were not too high even for HH Diamond. This is what I heard from some HH members who recently stayed/staying in those properties, as well as my own experiences. Of course YMMV, maybe we were just unlucky. Check in:To be fair, It's my fault to arrive early. I thought the check-in time was 2 pm but it's 3 pm. Reached the hotel around 2 and front desk staff told me ""Sorry, our hotel was fully occupied LAST NIGHT"" and I've to wait until 3 pm. That's fine, I arrived earlier than normal check in time and I can wait in the lounge as a HH Diamond. Finally I got the key around 3:10.I didn't get an upgrade to executive floor. ""Sorry, our hotel is fully occupied TODAY"", as told by the staff. When I asked for a late check out as my flight was going to depart at 6:30 pm, the staff told me last check out is not possible, with the same reason of course, ""Sorry, our hotel is fully occupied TOMORROW"". At last they granted me 1 extra hour late check out. I really appreciated her effort as the hotel was fully occupied EVERY DAY.If the hotel was really fully booked, I wouldn't mind. As all benefits are based on availability. After checked in, I checked the hotel's availability on the next day. Guess what? Nearly every room category, from normal room to executive room to suite, king or twin, all available for booking on the official website when I did a dummy booking. I was very interested what will the hotel give me on the next day if I really click on the confirm booking button. Was the hotel still overselling its rooms in late afternoon on the day before even though they have confirmed 100% occupancy? I couldn't tell.Executive lounge:I remember the food offered in the lounge during my previous stays was very nice in terms of quality and presentation. For this time, food offered in tea time was not as attractive as before, but still fine. However for pre-dinner canapes, I think it's not up to Conrad standard. I entered the lounge at 6 something, the only food available were some Chinese dim-sum which didn't look fresh, and some cookies which was already there since my first visit at 2 pm. However there were some good points for my stay which I really appreciated. The breakfast in the restaurant was excellent. And the staff from the concierge was very helpful. I really appreciated her effort when helping me to arrange the delivery service.This hotel was my favorite one in Tokyo. And I always stay here before I depart, as it's very convenient to travel to Haneda Airport. But the experience of my recent stay was quite negative, especially for the executive lounge.

The location is good, next to siodome station which goes to limited places, but less than 10 minutes easy stroll to Shimbashi station where you can get JR lines to tokyo, ueno etc, also only 3 stops to Shenagowa station for Shinkansen, which avoids having to go via the huge tokyo station. Also has subway at Shimbashi station. Can walk to fish market and Ginza easily from this hotel too. There is also a garden right next to the hotel, which is well worth an hour or so to walk around, especially if you are on a business trip with limited outside or tourism time.Book an exec room if you are likely to be in during the evenings. Otherwise there are plenty of places to eat within the office complexes surrounding the hotel, many very reasonably priced. The in house Japanese restaurant very good, but definitely a special occasion place rather than a general eating restaurant. Lovely swimming pool, did not use gym, but it is good too.","Oxted, United Kingdom",41,5.0

It could be a good brand but it looks cheap and doesn't smell that nice.Before booking this hotel, I was concerned with the location after reading the reviews on here. It turns out the location is not bad at all. I actually find the location convenient to where I wanted to go. From Shiodome station, there is Ginza line that takes you to Shinjuku and it's not that far to walk to Shinbashi station.

The hotel is set in floors 28 to 37 of one of the taller buildings in the city and generally affords very good views. The only slight challenge is that it takes a little time to master the access at street level and the need to take a separate elevator to the lobby on the 28th floor.I was upgraded to a corner room which had great views over the river. The room was very nicely appointed and the bathroom was terrific - a very large walk in shower and separate tub - it all made me feel very spoilt.There seemed to be a good selection of restaurants although I only got the chance to try one, and the executive lounge on the 37th floor was a really good amenity - very comfortable with great views. The bar on the lobby level (28th floor) also had a very good view. Smoking is permitted in the bar, which was not ideal for those of us used to a smoke-free environment but presumably follows local custom.The service was as you might expect from a top notch Asian hotel, but is nonetheless worth commending - very friendly and helpful staff.

I stayed on both the city side and the bay side. The bay was much better, but the city side isn't bad. It's like choosing between a ton of gold or a ton of platinum. It would be nice to have the platinum, but you won't be disappointed with the gold. Location: Shiodome is a small station with local train lines. It does have easy underground walking access to Shimbashi station. The walk is about 9 minutes from door to door. Then you can take the JR Yamanote line around the city and you're within walking distance or a short cab/train ride of most places you would need to go. There is plenty of dining near the hotel. The Shimbashi night life is very active as well. All this is within a 15 minute walk. Breakfast: The continental breakfast is excellent. That being said, I would walk the 15 minutes to Tsukiji for fresh fish or any of the local places if I had to pay full price. The views are nice and the service is excellent. Fitness Center: Quite a few exercise bikes and treadmills. I just wore shorts and a t-shirt and walked my somewhat sweaty self back to the room via the elevator. I felt like I should have been wearing nice clothes and showered/changed in the locker room/shower, but I'm lazy and would probably do the same in the future. The entrance is a bit involved as well. Room: You can make the room almost pitch black and there is absolutely no sound from adjacent rooms or outside. This is the best hotel I have stayed at for sound and light. Another nice convenience was the light and shade control panel next to the bed. You could turn on any light in the room or operate the shades while laying in bed. Executive Lounge: I didn't use it, so I got nothing. Staff: The staff spoke very good English. I was in the country for 8 days, but spent 1 night in Kyoto. The hotel held my bag while I was gone and they handled the limo bus reservation to Narita for my return flight.","Chattanooga, United States",4,5.0

I was little worried how my kids (7) and (4) would fit into this 5star business hotel . I requested 2 double beds ahead of time and they accommodated my request no problem. The ride from Narita to Conrad was about an hour and half. The non stop limousine bus ride was very convenient with tired family in tow. Once arrived it was very nice to have the bell boy waiting for the bus and take our suitcase right away. It was very slick. They guided us to the 28th floor and was greeted by a bell girl who noticed we had two little girls and handed them juice and cookies upon arrival. That was a nice touch!Check-in was very quick. The hotel layout is just beautiful and the view of the city is breathtaking. I have been to many hotels probably more than most people because I am a flight attendant. I must say the hotel is one of the ""BEST"". The rooms were beautiful and big. We had the city view and it was still just breathtaking as well. The whole stay was luxury! The kids loved the bath tub and played fishing with toys every night we were there. The turndown service was so nice. They actually managed to pickup all the toys left on the floor and neatly put them on the bed and even folded my daughters sweatshirt.  I wish they had a directory for what is available around the hotel. We were awake at 4am for three nights due to jet-lag it would be nice to see the names of restaurants surrounding the hotel not just whats in the hotel. We did not take my little kids to the hotel restaurants it was definitely not kid-friendly or should I say not kid-friendly prices. I know there were lots of places but with two kids in tow it would have been nice to plan and execute with listing of whats available. The workout room was very nice.

The hotel lobby is located on the 28th floor and excessively high floor-to-ceiling height is very welcoming as well as the beautiful view of Tokyo. Whilst the hotel was fully occupied during our stay, it never felt too crowded and there was never too long a wait for lifts. Little things in the room help make it great, usb charging ports, automatic blinds, heated toilet seat, well-pressured rain shower etcFacilities like the gym, pool and spa is equally high standard and even provided shiseido skin care in the changing rooms. A visit to the sauna/steam/spa after a day out exploring tokyo was a real treat. The Executive Lounge on the top floor had great city views and offered a good selection (for lounge standard) of food and beverages for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapes and was quite popular with guests. Concierge was really helpful with ticket booking, giving directions etc. Most of the time we'd walk out to Shimbashi station (10mins walk, covered walkways) to connect to other places of interest but taxis were reasonably priced too. Alternatively, you can take the Yurikamome (automated transit line) from the Shiodome station which is 2 mins from the hotel. (Odaiba, on the Yurikamome line is beautiful so make a visit if you have time).We'd highly recommend trying out teppanyaki at Kazahana located on the 28th floor, dinner works out to be AU$200-$300 per person but is well worth the experience and it'd definitely be a lot more expensive for the same food in Sydney.Overall, Conrad Tokyo is a very well-run hotel and we'd definitely stay again and wouldn't hesitate recommending it to others.","Sydney, Australia",71,5.0

The hotel reception, business centre and coffee shop is located on the 28th floor and all the rooms are situated on the floors above that, thus giving the guests a lovely view of the city. I was booked in a base-category room facing the bay. I have to say this was one of the nicest rooms I have stayed in thus far. To begin with it was spacious room with ample space to walk around (dispelling the reputation of Tokyo rooms being crammed, think that must be limited to Europe strictly)and equipped with all the amenities you can think of and need. The bath is very nice too with a separate, )shower and toilet (which I like) and vanity space and a bath tub.

Beautiful lobby with spectacular views; very chic restaurants and wonderful, friendly, helpful service. Can't speak more highly of the hotel. The only nit - and a minor one - is the two sets of elevators as the lobby is on the 28th floor. But no big deal - give yourself an extra couple of minutes.The location: This was our first trip to Tokyo so was nervous about location. Didn't need to be. Via both skyway and subway, you can walk to the nearby Shimbushi train station which has the Japan Rail train that circles Tokyo. Two stops and you're at Tokyo station whereby you can head anywhere. Moreover, the skyway leads to a set of stairs which, given a block, takes you to the beginning of the Ginza shopping district. Perhaps 10 minutes. If you walk through the Shimbushi station - literally in one side, out the other - you are in a very dense neighborhood full of restaurants, shops, groceries, etc. Get your JRail pass, explore both the skyway and subway - from the Conrad just take the escalator from the parking lot lobby either up or down via the Softbank building next door.

One particular staff member have also displayed a rather cynical nature during my stay but most staff are polite.

The gym is well equipped, and the pool was very nice, great for laps.

It maybe quicker if you actually catch the bus to Tokyo Station (runs every 15 mins) and then cab it (10 mins) to Conrad Tokyo from there (about Y1500). Don't forget to get Conrad Tokyo written in Japanese for taxi drivers as they speak little or no EnglishWe tried Kazahana restaurant in Conrad Tokyo. We tried Kaiseki because we were thinking it would be hard to try this type of dining outside of Japan. The food and service was very good but we feel it was quite expensive. However, though, what an experience to try our first Kaiseki and you won't come away still hungry!Conrad Tokyo may seem on the expensive side but when you factor in the service, location, spacious rooms and overall experience it is definitely recommended. We wouldn't hesitate to put Conrad Tokyo on our shortlist next time in Tokyo",London,58,5.0

This hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in so far, this was mainly caused by the lowered rate as part of the conference (the rack rate would have been substantially higher and thus you would expect a very high standard from this hotel).Check in and welcome by the reception was very good. English is always a bit of a challenges, but I was quickly directed to a check in staff member with good English. Check in procedure was quick and efficient.The room was huge, which was unexpected for Tokyo standards. Floor to ceiling windows, a large desk, a large couch, huge bed and even bigger shower/bathroom. Everything was clean and meticulously organized as you would expect in Japan. A nice touch was the fact that the mini bar consisted of both normal drinks as well as a special section with special whiskeys (unfortunately significantly overpriced). Breakfast was included and the breakfast buffet had plenty of choice. On top of this there was a selection from the á la carte menu. Quality and selection were very good. As the lobby floor/restaurant floor is on the 28th story the view is spectacular.Locating the hotel is a bit of a challenge. Obviously the easiest is to take a taxi, but if you do take public transport finding the entrance on this multi level pedestrian labyrinth is a challenge (no tips I can give you there....hope you can find an English speaking local who can direct you).There was lots of construction going on in the neighborhood, so there were plenty of detours.

MO is about 10% more expensive and is worth every extra penny - SO much nicer/better than the C, in every regard.My biggest problem/frustration with the C was with my booking and room assignment. I booked the ""Conrad Be Yourself"" plan which gives you the choice between free continental breakfast for two or an upgrade. We chose the upgrade because we get free breakfast as Hilton Gold Members. I let them know that the upgrade was our choice over two weeks in advance and received an email confirming it. Yet when we checked in, they said it was unavailable. I asked if my room rate would be adjusted down and they said no. We were exhausted from a very long flight and didn't want to argue so we went to our room. I later called and forwarded my confirmation email. After over 12hrs of silence we got many nice apologies, access to the Executive Lounge, the offer of a fruit plate and the addition of full American breakfast (eggs), but it wasn't enough. I bought a certain type of room and did not receive it - period. I shouldn't have to pay for something I didn't receive (we paid around $70 per night extra for the package). I was wary of the huge list of room rate options on the website when I booked and should have listened to my gut. Oh and another thing to note, the Executive Lounge is NOT worth much - small room crowded with people, with mediocre food and drink - don't pay up for it. I can't say whether club level rooms are better.In terms of the Conrad Hotel itself - it's fine but not great. The lobby allows smoking and the odor is strong in the evenings. The décor in both the rooms and the common areas is uninspired. Our corner King suite overlooking the bay (VERY nice view - might be worth paying extra for) was decently sized but the bathroom set up was unappealing and messy with the tub in the shower room - hard to describe but it resulted in water all over. And we were assigned a room right next to the service door/center - created a TON of noise which was truly a nightmare in conjunction with our jetlag.Gym is just ok.Location - close to a lot of things but we felt a little out of the loop. Like staying in Battery Park in NY.There was always a long line at the front desk - hard to get service there quickly.On a positive, the requests we made of the concierge in advance were handled perfectly.

My suggestion is to visit any of the buildings nearby / adjacent; there are several places where the exact same beverage is 800Y, I understand there would be a partial price uplift for ambiance, but 1000Y extra seems excessive.- Lounge waiters and waitresses I experienced at TwentyEight were extremely slow and it was difficult to get their attention to order more 1800Y drinks. Granted this was an experience on a single night (14 October), but it was quite frustrating. This happened the entire evening. Between the service and the pricing, that was my only night remaining in the hotel for drinks or food.- As just a Gold member I was not lucky enough for the room upgrade. While I appreciate the continental buffet, it was not nearly as diverse as many other hotels, and the upcharge of 900Y for getting some eggs was not worth it. I tried two different hot dishes, both were mediocre. My suggestion to the hotel is that for Gold/Diamond, simply include the hot breakfast as part of the included benefit.Again, overall a very nice hotel and experience.

The views are amazing (the lobby is on the 28th floor, so all rooms are either at or above that level). There's simply not much to really write.

The rooms are decent size. I had access to the club lounge and recommend getting one. Though, the morning breakfast does not offer that many choices. But I think overall it pays off given that in the evening they offer some nice food as well top quality wine, beer and scotch. Staffs are wonderful, always there to help you. I am not sure about the location as I was not using subway system but saw 2 stations very close by. Most of the times, I used cab and max I paid was around $20-$25. So I think that’s not bad at all. The airport bus departs from their property and cost $30 or ¥3000. So, keep in mind that option as it is 75 min ride and cab may cost you around ¥30,000 one way. BUT, that’s Narita airport, way far from the city. Few things needs impovment. Fist is choices at breakfast in lounge area. And gym need some improvement as well. Need some more machine.

We have stayed at many Relais & Chateaux properties, for example. This Conrad rates high on our overall list. The lobby is on the 28th floor and the hotel occupies floors 28-37. We stayed on the 37th, Executive Floor, next to the Executive Lounge. The decor is elegant and attractive. Special to us was the spaciousness and quality of the rooms, as well as the many amenities. The power shades were not only efficient, but they truly were room-darking. The rooms also were very, very quiet. So, we had superb sleep and could sleep late in a very dark environment. (The closet door did not block the hallway, as it occupied 50% of the passage.) We could not contemplate anything more for the room in this high-rise hotel in a major city. The restaurants we attended, for which separate contributions are placed on TA, were quite good in general, albeit not tops in Tokyo, except for the buffet breakfast at Cerise (see below). Service was spectacular: housekeeping, turn-down, information, restaurant staff, and concierge. Indeed, this hotel had the best concierge service imaginable. We got reservations at top, hard-to-reserve, restaurants with limited seating; excellent sumo and kabuki tickets; travel instructions/ directions; etc., etc. You just name it and these folks delivered with verve and efficiency. As for location, the hotel is around the Shiodome area, which is a short walk from the Ginza shopping district, a walk that can be done largely underground or on and elevated walkway. We had taxi rides of 15-20 min to all of the fabulous restaurants that we opted to dine at. As to the breakfast (see separate TA review on Cerise), yes, the Eggs Benedict mentioned elsewhere, which we were wise enough to not order, looked pretty poor on another table. But what can one really expect for this dish in Japan. My wife is an Eggs Benedict fan and they rarely please her anywhere in the world. The absolute best was at the NYC Plaza's Palm Court some years ago, and we have not had anything comparable since. You could smell the lemony Hollandaise in that dish from 10 feet away; it was perfect and there was plenty of it. The point about Cerise for breakfast are the great selections at the several buffet tables; an amazing diversity of food items! So, if you are staying at the Conrad, it is highly recommended that you stick with the outstanding full buffet. The free standard internet was adequate for all of our many needs, not slow, but we did not stream video. We could have had free premium internet, as Hhonors Gold people, but we had no reason to do so, and we used our computers and devices a lot.

For instance, Grand Hyatt in Rappongi Hills is a lot more convenient, with plenty of nearby options for a late cocktail/meal/business meeting. Close to public transport (but this is pretty much par for course in Tokyo).Room serviceMost of the hotel restaurants close at 9pm, so I was involuntarily relegated to room service. Room service does not serve Japanese food between 9:30pm and 11:30pm. On top of that, room service menu is probably one of the worst value-for-money I've seen in town -- e.g. 2800 yen for 7 standard-tasting buffalo wings (that's US$4 per wing). Everything else I had off the menu was similarly ""just okay"", far from being great for Tokyo's high standards.BfastInteresting interpretations here. Eggs benedict came with a practically solid Hollandaise sauce. Huevos rancheros was pretty much a soup.

Any downsides, can only think of one.....its slightly tricky to navigate to the hotel by car - it even stumped a taxi driver who was so ashamed he refused his fare.

The breakfast buffet is good, but lacks in variety and you get the same food everyday if you stay for an extended period of time. I however loved the French press coffee that's made fresh for each table. The location can be a little remote but if you want to stay near the hotel, there are a good variety of restaurants in Caretta Shiodome building which is next to Condard, both on the ground floor and on 46/47 floors. There are also convenience stores within a short walk for light snacks. Despite some cons, Conrad is by far my favorite hotel in Tokyo.",NYC,120,5.0

Requested a room facing Tokyo bay to see the fireworks show (Aug 10,2013) and I got it with additional price of 15,000yen ( a bit pricey but worth it). The good thing is when I asked to get the other room (which is not facing the bay)to be in same floor, they didn't have it the same room level, but accommodated it by upgraded our room to suite for free, so we can be at the same floor with kids.Suite room quality is top notch! Abundance pillow, big living area, huge bath room with TV. 3TVs in a room.Breakfast however, should be better for this level of hotel. Restaurant is too small, people got to line up. We were placed at table at Japanese restaurant across the breakfast buffet restaurant, so basically we got to walk out and in of other resto to get food.Service at resto was also poor. Diet restriction instruction prior order was not noted carefully so food served totally wrong. Twice. Amount of food at buffet line and glass at juice bar should be added. I got to asked glass to get orange juice. Twice.If this can be improved, plus the speed of check-in and check-out, this hotel will be perfect. Oh I should mention the pool. So small and over-charged.

The lobby is in the ground floor, you need to take a lift to the reception in 28th floor, and from there another lift to your rooms. Check in lasted less than a minute. Ours was a super-spacious King suite with city view. The bed was super comfy, and two huge TVs, one in the bedroom and one in the living room, both rooms had city view of the river and the high rise buildings. Service was very efficient and unobtrusive. Every day, after hectic sightseeing, it was bliss to return to an impeccably made room. The staff were available any time to answer our queries. Reg food - The buffet breakfast, which was awesome, was served at China Blue restaurant. My husband found it a bit repetitive, but I didn't - the fruit / cornflake / bread / cold cuts / porridge / cheese / pudding stations were extensive, and the egg menu had 9 different options which offer variety. The food itself was very tasty, obviously, being made in a 5 star hotel! Yes, the location is not fantastic, but that's hardly the hotel's fault! Minato is generally not the right place to stay, if one needs to be central.... To be near tourist sites, better to stay near Shinjuku or Shibuya. We knew Conrad was a business hotel, so we were prepared to tackle the transport connections (a metro map is a MUST, if you don't want to spend a fortune on taxis). From Conrad, we enjoyed daily metro rides from the Shimbashi metro station (15 min walk underground, starting from the Shiodome City center basement, located under Conrad).

On close up inspection wear and tear was obvious on the soft fabrics in the rooms but cleanliness could not be faulted. My main issue during our stay was that Louis Vuitton was holding some kind of sales event in the hotel and had taken over various parts of the premises. This resulted in the executive lounge being moved to a ground floor meeting room. I disliked the feeling of staying in a Louis Vuitton shop for several days and the numerous Louis Vuitton staff running around had neither the grace nor manners the hotel staff had.

The rooms are huge by Tokyo standards and much better than similar properties near Tokyo station. It's a 10 min walk to jr station shimbashi so if you are using a jr pass you will need to go to tokyo station for the bullet trains.

Places around the hotel shut down early though so not much to do nearby however the train connections are at the doorsteps.

The Conrad Tokyo is an exceptional hotel. Spacious rooms, comfortable bed, spectacular views of Tokyo Bay and the garden through full-length picture windows, and service that is even a cut above the generally fantastic level that you encounter just about everywhere in Japan. That said, we had an extremely difficult time locating the hotel. We arrived at Shambashi station and found that the Shiodome in which the Conrad is located is not just a single building, but rather a complex of many buildings. There is no signage anywhere near the station that points to the Conrad, and people we asked for help (e.g. the workers at the Starbucks) had never heard of the Conrad. After wandering around for nearly a half hour, we finally located the hotel. Later we discovered that there is a monorail that runs from Shimbashi station to the Shiodome station. This would have made our arrival much easier, as the Shiodome station is very near the Conrad, although signage even that close to the hotel leaves something to be desired. Our tribulations continued later in that first day when we attempted to take a taxi from Ginza back to the Conrad. The driver had never heard of the hotel, and, even with the aid of the hotel address (which we provided) and the taxi's GPS, we spent another half hour driving around the Shiodome complex before finally finding the Conrad entrance. Unfortunately we had a similar experience the following day when another taxi driver also was unfamiliar with the Conrad and spent fifteen minutes circling the Shiodome before finally locating it. Our problems with the taxi drivers were not language-related. My wife speaks fairly fluent Japanese and communicated with the drivers in their language. Other than our problems with finding the hotel, the Conrad was a wonderful experience, and one that I would hope to be able to repeat on a future trip to Japan.","Lahaina, Hawaii",10,5.0

Make sure to get a room with the bay view - it's worth the extra cost - and get a package that includes breakfast.

The bathroom is one of my favourite features and it is divided from the main room by a glass wall (with electronic blinds should you want privacy), I love that you can take in the astounding views from the comfort of your bath tub! The beautiful spa is also an impressive element of this hotel, it is located on the 29th floor and faces the city skyline, the treatment rooms have blinds should you require, but they are purposefully left open during your treatment so you feel exposed in one way but equally relaxed and the city lights are surprisingly calming. The indoor pool also overlooks the Tokyo skyline with windows allowing you to take in the expanse of the city whilst swimming your laps! The spa also has sauna and steam rooms and one of my favourite things to do here is to pamper myself and I could happily spend all day in the spa! I love to explore the local sushi spots and the Conrad is perfectly located near Tsukiji Fish Market, a favourite spot of mine when struggling with jet lag as it is open very early in the morning – you can eat the freshest sashimi and sushi here, literally right out of the sea!

First time stay here.The entrance of this Conrad is a bit odd as it is located on one of the upper floors of a large office complex. I thought there was too little signage to get to the right part of the building. Not a cracking start.Once at the check in desk it all started to improve. Speedy service and I was soon in my room on the executive floor. Superb views out over Tokyo Bay - almost expected Godzilla to rear out of the water.Rooms are your standard sort of thing for this quality of hotel. I didn't see anything lacking that I needed and it was perfectly clean. No complaints. As usual, loved the Conrad rubber duck which I took home for my son.Breakfast I took in the Executive Lounge - not a fabulous selection by any means, but sufficient for my purposes. I suppose others mightn't say the same however. The view was bizarre - straight over into the office building next door...Location of the hotel wasn't brilliant as far as I am concerned as it was a decent way away from Ropponggi where our office is. You are reasonably close to Ginza though if you're a die hard shopping fan.I've no real complaints about the hotel in any respect other than the location - which is a personal view given my purpose in Tokyo, so I haven't marked it down.

Pleasant view overlooking the harbour from the lobby lounge. Check-in took a little longer, about 20 minutes, and then went up to my room on the 35th floor. Once again, as son as I opened the door, fantastic view of the harbour right in front. Unfortunately, I needed t change room because they put in a smoking room. They said they would call me back but they never did. It took me 3 calls and another 30 minutes to wait for the change of room. The room was first class and basically they have everything you need. After that we took a walk to Ginza, about 10-15 minutes, where there are tons of shops and restaurants. On our way back at around 3pm, we walked past the Cerise by Gordon Ramsay which is one of the two restaurants by GR. The menu on display only carried the appetizers without the rest so we asked for the dinner menu but was treated cold by one of the waiters who simply replied ""the menu is there!"" Well, maybe one of his bad days! Anyway, we tried it at night and they do have the rest of the menu available. Food is ok. We also tried their breakfast and it's ok. If I compared this with the hotel opposite side, their F&B is better than here!

As an aside, I've been a Hilton Diamond member for seven years, so my frame of reference is Hilton and their various properties...I've also made several stays at the Hilton in nishi-Shinjuku...I'll first say that the hotel is top-notch and deserving of five (5) stars based on amenities, quality and comfort of room (bed / bath / shower), executive lounge experience, staff friendliness and helpfulness, lounge and bar options (love the 28 Lounge!), etc. It really is a first class experience, and the views of Tokyo Bay, Sumida River and Hama-rikyu Park are excellent (assuming you're on the south / east side of the hotel - city views on north / west side are ok; basically a view of a few tall buildings.)Regarding the location, I think it rivals most of the hotels in Tokyo in the sense that there's plenty to do in walking distance, and there are several convenient subway stops in proximity to the hotel to take you anywhere in Tokyo (or farther afield!) that you would want to go... Within walking distance is the Tsukiji fish market, Ginza (need I say more - food and shopping and parks for the kiddies abound), Shimbashi (just on the west side of the Shimbashi station are plenty of places to eat and shop), and Hama-rikyu Park and the Sumida River (affordable and fun boat rides up the river to Asakusa [famous shrine and shopping] and the Sky Tree can be had just across from the hotel)...plus, walk out the north / west side, down an escalator and you have an underground walkway to subways, food, shopping and entertainment...just ask the front desk / concierge and explore...Now, regarding the subway options, the Shiodome stop on the Oedo Line is basically under the hotel. The Oedo line will easily transport you to, among others, Roppongi, Yoyogi (Yoyogi Park), Shinjuku (busiest train station in world - great people watching and tons of stuff around) and Ryogoku (sumo mecca with a great park and Edo-Tokyo Museum)... Moreover, the Shimbashi station on the Asakusa Line is a short walk and opens up even more options...Point being, anyone that reviews this hotel and denigrates the location clearly hasn't taken the time or lifted a finger to ask and / or explore... Had they done this, they would've realized this is a great location!Tip: ask the front desk; there's a very easy, nice and cheap option to do laundry a couple of subway stops from the hotel... It's a laundromat at a local residential building and it is nice! Staff is great and there's a 7-Eleven next store to grab some drinks / grub whilst doing laundry... if you're on an extended stay, it beats the heck out of paying hotel prices to wash clothes; i.e., you can wash and dry your clothes for what the hotel would charge to wash one pair of socks or undies...","New York City, New York",6,5.0

Breathtaking!We paid a lot but no breakfast was included.USD 86 for an extra bed per night.Pros1) It is a exceptionally laid out Hotel with luxury underlined and the rooms are large, especially by japanese standards and very well appointed.The bed is large and very comfortable, and well accomodated 2 adults and a child.The bathroom is a absolute pleasure to use, the shower cubicle is decent sized with a powerful shower and there is a seperate bathtub which the children revelled in.Room has automized blinds and love hotel rooms which can be darkened completely!Awesome coffee too!2)The concierge is very well informed about restaurants and very helpful in procuring restaurant reservations.3) There is definite eye to detail, which is not the case with every hotel. For eg, on check in they gave my son a water botlle shaped as a shinkansen and my daughter one in the shape of hello Kitty.4)It is located close to Shiodome Station on the Odeo Line(not part of metro day pass), and Shimbashi staion(metro) is a 10-15 minute walk but through a covered area.Cons1) the biggest inconvencience for me personally was that there was not very much around and in that sense, Ginza, the closest ""happening"" area was a 15 -20 minute walk. There is the Carretta Shiodome which has somes shops and restaurants, but limited and basic. On that note there Is a 'Din Tai Fung"" in the Caretta Mall which is A MUST! But otherwise nothing around in close walking distance.2) Shimbashi is very much walking but note does take 15 minutes or so to get to it, and we couldnt use Shhilodome as we only had the day metro pass, but that was our limitation.3) Steep charge to use pool, gym and all extras, unless you are a Hilton Honors Gold!4) Upgrades seldom happen even if you are gold or Diamond!  Acid test - Would I stay there again? Would be tempted due to the comfort and luxury offered, but may not due to the location, as I personally want to be in the middle of action!

It is a beautiful hotel, with a massive & clean lobby. It is very grand in it's appearance and impressive when you first arrive. I will say I dislike the fact that the front entry to the hotel is on the ground level, but then you need to take an elevator up to the 28th floor for the hotel lobby/check in. The check in area was crowded when we arrived and we were asked to have a seat and wait for our turn. We then asked to check in in the executive lounge which we were directed to and that saved a great deal of time. We were upgraded to a Deluxe Bay View Room despite using HHonor points for this stay and being a diamond member. The room itself was great. The view looked out over a wonderful garden and the bay. It was clean, surprisingly large in size and had a wonderful bathroom. The bathroom was separated from the main bedroom area by a glass wall which had a button controlled wood blind. There was a large bathtub, separate shower, toilet room and sink area. It was one of the nicest hotel bathrooms I have seen. The room itself was very clean, comfortable and had plenty of space for two people and all of our belongings. The executive lounge of the hotel was a disappointment. It was small, crowded, and had limited seating. In fact, the seating was so minimal that we hardly used the lounge. The food offerings however were good - despite being limited. It seemed odd that the staff would only put out enough for two or three people at a time. On one evening we were served a small plate by the waiter working the room which had a sampling of food on it. It is not your typical executive lounge. I would suggest going early or late in during the happy hours to make use of it.The hotel breakfast was ok, not bad, not great. The buffet which our room came with was limited in its offering but for a small price ( 10 usd) we could order hot made to order eggs. The french press coffee was nothing to write home about and the service in the restaurant was slow. The staff was very small on busy mornings which made getting coffee refills nearly imposable. As far as negatives go - the location despite seeming great on a map - was not really that great. Yes it was located above a train stop, but it was about a 10-15 minute walk once you get underground to the Ginza Line which is a line we used often. There was not much walkable from the hotel other than the fish market, but given the road construction and difficulties getting around - we took a taxi there which was about 15 dollars, but worth it. My biggest problem came in terms of noodles. Not the ones we ordered, but the one that was inside the bathrobe provided in our closet. Nothing like putting on a robe and finding a cold noodle in the sleeve. Despite that, I would stay here again and already miss the view.","New York City, New York",4,4.0

The rooms are huge and well appointed and the beds are extremely comfortable. The bathroom is huge and the high-tech toilet was very amusing. I stayed in a King Bay view room and the views over Hamarikyu Garden and Tokyo bay were spectacular. I did find this hotel to be less conveniently located as a tourist in the city; I think it is much better suited for business travelers. It is above the Shiodome, but 90% of the time I had to walk to Shimbashi to access most tourist site. However, I would absolutely stay here again on future visits to Tokyo as the rooms were so spacious and quiet. This hotel is deserving of 5 stars, but I have taken one off my review for the following reasons:1. Wifi is slow. 2. Included Breakfast selection in TwentyEight is boring and does not change daily. 3. There was a soba noodle inside the arm of the provided bathrobe. For an otherwise impeccably clean hotel, I was surprised and grossed out to see such an oversight. 4. Executive Lounge is very small and was often full when I tried to go there. Overall I would not hesitate to say in this hotel again or recommend it to anyone else going to Tokyo.","New York City, New York",15,4.0

Service was exceptional. The world should learn from the Japanese when it comes to true customer service and hospitality. The hotel is ideally situation on top of several subway stations all within walking distance from the hotel making this place very easy access to many parts of the city. Ginza fish market is only 10 to 15 minutes walk away.I arrived at 8am in the morning and the check-in staff asked me to wait in the executive lounge for complementary (HHonor Diamond member) breakfast until my room is ready. I should of requested early check-in prior to my arrival; the invitation for breakfast cannot be passed. The lounge is located on the 37th floor overlooking the beautiful city. Food was fantastic. I especially enjoyed Japanese style breakfast which consist of rice congee, fish, seaweed, pickles and other little dishes that made their breakfast standout compared to most Western breakfast buffet.At 9am I was informed my room was ready. My room on the 36th floor was large and overlooked the park which still had some cherry blossom--fantastic! Separate bath and shower. A lot of space. High tech toilet...etc. perfect and well appointed room with comfortable sofa along the window.After settling in, I went to visit the gym, pool and sauna. The heated pool is located on the 27th floor and had many chairs and sofa to relax. Hot and cold tea was also readily available. I cannot imagine a better place to unwind in the middle of a large metropolitan. Sauna and steam room was fantastic as well. The gym has the latest equipment available. The following morning yoga class was offered...I didn't sign up.At night, the lobby bar had great atmosphere but I prefer the executive lounge for less foot traffic.I am looking forward to return to this hotel in the future.","Taipei, Taiwan",87,5.0

Certainly has the wow factor when you come out of the elavator on the 28th floor lobby.We stayed in a bay view executive room which was excellent. Great views of the bay and lounge was nice for breakfast and evening drinks. Can second the positive comments already stated on the cleanliness of the hotel etc.The hotel has free wifi in the public areas, in the room you have to pay.The Shiodome metro line is right by the hotel. If you want to use the JR Rail Pass you need to use the Shimbahsi station which is about a 7min walk away. If you are accessing the hotel from Shimbashi station I would follow the signs to the Shiodome building or Shiodome offices/metro line. This will take you closer to the hotel where there are actual signs to the Conrad hotel. It is a big underground shopping mall which can be confusing as you'll need to get out of the underground mall to actually access the hotel!If you are coming via the Narita Express you may want to stop at Tokyo station and get a taxi from there it is only about 10mins journey. Have the address or a map of the hotel just in case.The location is away from the main busy areas of Shinjuku/Shibuya so if you want to be close to all the neon and night life then perhaps this isn't the location for you.You can walk to the fish market in about 15mins and Hama-rikyu gardens in 10mins which are both worth a walk around.Overall loved this hotel!",,23,5.0

Here is a full review of the pros and cons:Pros: Great, big rooms with awesome views, modern fixtures, comfy beds. The rooms are awesome. Another great thing is that you really can't hear the next room, nor any other noises. The pool and the spa are AWESOME as well (especially the pool). If you are a Hilton Gold member, you can use the pool for free, but if not, you may not want to pay the fee. The continental breakfast (also complimentary for Gold hilton members) is also really good and filling with both continental foods and japanese noodles (and great ham). My son and I enjoyed it a lot. Cons: This are just nits, but I want to write a full review. The location is a bit out of the way. If you are on business and are taking taxis, then no problem. If you are taking the the JR lines, you will have a good walk to the Shimbashi station. You can also take the Metro, which is pretty close. But, if you are walking, you may well have difficulty finding the place first time around. The hotel is walking distance to the fish market and also Ginza, and for kids, also close to the Pokemon center. Otherwise, just a bit off the beaten track.

The hotel staff was very friendly although they didn't quite understand that we were asking where the parking was and valeted our car (it just cost about $10 more, no big deal) the decor is amazing. If you ask the hotel about it, different parts are each modeled after Japanese poetry - even in the elevator (bamboo and the moon in there) it is very peaceful and serene. The restaurant overlooks the city out towards the harbor, and is an ideal place to get afternoon tea. The rooms are exquisite, with the usual Conrad touch, great bed, comfortable seating and as in Conrad in Asia, comfy slippers! Great rainforest shower, and a nice selection of teas. The Conrad Bears (I try and collect them every time I stay in one) are adorable made from kimono fabric that changes every year. Different from other Conrad's, the duck in the bathroom is actually a swan, so he is white rather than yellow. Cocktail hour has a good mix of Japanese and western food, and breakfast is the same with a good hot breakfast selection and the best fruits in season in Japan. I've stayed in the Park Hyatt and the Grand Hyatt as well in Tokyo, and of the three, while the Grand Hyatt probably wins as far as convenience and location, the Conrad had the best views of the three - though admittedly, I like the harbor view much better than the city view personally.

However, the room we received was still incredibly nice and perfect for our short time in Tokyo. I had been in contact with the hotel via email prior to our arrival about securing a very difficult dining reservations at Sukiyabashi Jiro. They replied to my email very quickly and thanks to them we were able to get a reservation for 3 people in a restaurant that only seats 10! Dining there was truly a once in a lifetime experience and I highly recommend attempting to book a reservation while in Tokyo.I normally wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, but due to the recent massive Hilton HHonors devaluation I have decided to switch hotel programs.

We firstly doubted to stay at the Intercontinental but after some comparison we booked our stay at the Conrad with Hhonors points which was an excellent value for this property. As always we booked for two adults and one child under our Diamond Hhonors account. In advance of our stay I emailed the concierge department with some arrival and transport information. I quickly got an extensive reply and detailed information which impressed me. We would arrive by Emirates flight at 19:00 and there were some possibilities to get to the hotel. The simplest thing was to take a normal or pre-arranged taxi but for European or US standard they are extremely expensive ( 450 USD one way ). The cheapest thing is to take the Narita Express train to Tokyo station and then take a cab from there. The train costs 35 USD and a taxi to the hotel from Tokio station 15 USD.Once we arrived by taxi at the hotel our luggage was taken and we went to the reception which was on the 28th floor I believe. We went to an available receptionist and checked in. There was still a small language barrier between us and the person who checked us in but all details were correct until the moment we spoke about the persons. We booked a room for two adults and one child like we always do. As we book for three persons we assume there are beds and room enough for three persons. Apparently this is not the case in Conrad Tokyo. He took the official price list and gave it to us and pointed out an extra bed is chargeable in this hotel. I really think he was joking so I asked for his superior or his manager but unfortunately he told me he was the highest possible person on duty that evening. I did not receive his business card so I could not check that. When our conversation became a bit more serious he was almost afraid, he walked away and somebody else came to us. Strangely an Assistant front office manager, Mr. Takuto Y. came and we told him the same story. As we are Diamond members we stay a lot in Conrads, Hiltons etc and I explained in all our stays we never ever had to pay for a bed when we book for three persons and I declined to pay it. At the end they refused to give a bed to us so we left ( shocked ) to our room on the 37th floor.We were extremely shocked about this kind of service in ‘the best hotel in Tokyo’ . We never had such a negative and disappointing check in experience in our entire life. We even thought of moving to a better hotel but because it was late and as we were tired we just went to our room. We did ask for another manager on duty or the GM Mr. Andréewitch but unfortunately for us there was nobody else.Later that evening the receptionist who checked us in called me and asked if I could meet him outside our room as he had a solution. He showed us a room on a lower floor with water view with two beds. He told us we could have this room at no extra charge. I was a bit confused as they were able to give us a further upgrade but can’t give us an extra bed. The upgrade was more expensive than an extra bed. Where is the logic behind this …I forgot to mention we received an upgrade to an executive room on the 37th floor. We walked past the executive lounge which was some doors prior to our room but it was already closed. The room itself was spacious and had high ceilings. We had not the water view but had some nice views over Tokyo. There was one King sized bed, a desk, a big TV and of course a spacious bathroom. There was a separate big bath, shower and a strange toilet. It was very funny and sometimes complicated to use the technologically high end toilet.There was a small welcome glass with spicy nuts and a welcome back note from the GM even though this is our first time in Tokyo. I have seen better welcomes in rooms. In the meantime I contacted Hilton Helpdesk in the US as they probably would help me. As it was late they promised to get a solution as soon as possible. Unfortunately that night our third person had to sleep on the kind of sofa next to the window which was not at all meant as a bed.After a horrible night sleep we woke up and went to the executive lounge for breakfast as we were not allowed to have it elsewhere in the hotel. The breakfast selection was small and very local. It was hard to find some other things like fish to put on our breads. It took also a while when breads were refilled. Service although was excellent !After breakfast we went to the concierge desk and asked some basic info and directions but we were a bit disappointed about the knowledge of the concierge assistant. We received some pre printed information folders so we made our own plan.When we came back in the afternoon I received an email from Hilton that they have contacted the General Manager and that a solution would follow quickly. An hour later a small delegation knocked on our room and the Front office manager Mr. Yoshihito K took the word and told us they would deliver the bed free of charge for the remaining nights and they apologized for the inconvenience. Well they could just make it easier and give the bed on the first night. Because of such an experience I probably would never come here again. I have been to many Conrads ( Hong Kong, Cairo, New York, Brussels, Bali, Bangkok , .. ) and we never had such a weak and unprofessional check in. Maybe it is something we only see in Japan.The happy hour at the Conrad is almost every evening different. Each evening they get some snacks from the different restaurants in the hotel. Overall the China Blue and Gordon Ramsey restaurant supplied most food. Strangely sushi was never served. Drinks were good and alcohol was both table served or self service. As mentioned before staff is excellent but the selection of food is not the best. There is a lack of simple or European food and as my sister was allergic she could not eat anything but staff were happy to look up the ingredients for her.On our check out day it was my birthday but unfortunately was not offered something like a small cake like I received in the Cavalieri Rome Waldorf or in Hilton Cancun in the past. Fortunately on my flight back I received a nice cake.Location of the hotel is excellent and has almost direct underground metro access which is very easy to use. Next to the hotel is also a park from where you can take a boat ride. Taxis are also available on ground level but I try to avoid them for long distances as they are extremely expensive.Overall a good hotel with spacious rooms but due a weak check in experience I am not sure if I would return here.","Antwerp, Belgium",323,4.0

Flight arrived very early in the morning, resulting in us checking in at 9 in the morning. The lobby is on the 28th floor and it provided magnificent views of Tokyo Bay, the Rainbow Bridge and Hamarikyu Gardens. With previous experiences of Japanese hotels being very uptight about check-in times, we were lucky that they allowed us into our room so early. It's probably because they saw that we were hauling a baby.We booked a regular twin bed room facing the city but was upgraded to a bay view room due to our Gold status (Executive rooms were not available). The room is definitely massive by Japanese standards (48 square meters according to the website) with a nice sofa laid out next to the windows facing the bay. The crib for the baby is also one of the biggest we have ever received which was terrific since we can also use it as a play circle.Continental breakfast was included as part of our rate and it was served at the Gordon Ramsey restaurant. It was a simple affair with bread, fruits, yoghurts, soba, congee and for an extra charge, you can have hot eggs. Amazingly, they do not change the spread at all during our week-long stay. I know some people don't like the Shiodome location but I LOVE IT!!!

If that's not enough connections then a 5 minute walk along covered walkway will take you to Shinbashi for the JR line. Shinbashi station is of course surrounded by tonnes of shops and restaurants. The hotel is also next to Hamarikyu Garden. It's 300 yen to enter and it is so well maintained and so serene. A truly nice escape from the bustle of Tokyo. My daughter absolutely loved the park!!!Pool is only for those above the age of 4 so we didn't use it at all but I heard there's a charge unless you have a gold status or above. Wifi is also chargeable unless you are an HHonors Gold or above.As long as the price is right, I will definitely stay at this hotel again.","Tokyo, Japan",67,4.0

It is a bit of a walk from the train station and not much around near the hotel, but it is very spacious especially for Japan.Our room was clean and large and had a beautiful bathroom and an amazing view. I don't have much experience staying in Conrad properties, but I was a little annoyed when we had to pay an extra fee per a person to use the swimming pool. In my opinion I would rather pay for it when I am booking my room and not be hustled afterwords. We also went down to the TWENTYEIGHT lounge on a Monday night at 6pm dressed up before a nice dinner and got an attitude from a male host for not having a reservation when we requested a table by the window in an empty bar. It wasn't lost in translation if that is what you are thinking as one of us is a native Japanese from Tokyo. It was also a big surprise because in Japan people are usually extremely polite, plus I don't know who has time to make a pre dinner drink reservations when they are traveling.Over all we had a nice experience in Conrad Tokyo, but the location makes it a little hard to explore the city and I think I can definitely find something better next time for the amount of money that we spent.","New York City, New York",58,3.0

I wouldn't stay here for leisure and for business, depending on where you need to be, there are better choices more centrally located.Likewise in terms of service, its ok but can be variable between staff members, some very good and others quite lousy. Like the lady who handled my check in which got my stay off to a rocky and very annoying start - I arrived at 530am following an overnight flight. My secretary had requested early check in without charge and was told it should be possible given occupancy. When I arrived at the counter, the lady there seemed confused as to why I would try to check in, then rather smuggly told me if I wanted it would cost be one nights charge and that check time is 3pm. I highlighted that it was indicated early check in would be possible and at the Shangri-La the week prior (see my review on the Shangri-La) that I was offered early check in without fuss. Anyway this went no where I ended up changing in the hotel gym to be ready for my morning meetings. It was obvious rooms were available, they just didn't wanted to oblige me.Anyway, once checked-in, the rooms are fine - tastefully decorated, clean and functional albeit a little bland - not really that warm or inviting.I had breakfast in the Gordan Ramsey branded cafe - the buffet spread is ok, but the eggs benedict I ordered were disappointing. Not enough hollandaise sauce and tasteless at that. I also had drinks at the lobby lounge one night which a great view of Tokyo Bay both in the day and at night and it a nice place to relax. The hotel has a good selection of restaurants but I didn't have a chance to visit.On balance, its ok but having stayed at the Shangri-La Tokyo the week before, the Conrad came off a distance second choice.

I believe that some of these (really minor) issues have been changed in the meantime.The rooms are flawless, service too, they have one of the best breakfasts I have come across in all my years of travelling. I have to agree to one of the other reviews however that the connection to Narita airport is awful. The shuttle bus is not particularly frequent and stops at three or four other hotels before it actually arrives at Conrad. The train connection is a challenge for first timers and includes quite a bit of walking. Both is a bother when you have just come off a 10+ hour flight from somewhere.","Vienna, Austria",9,4.0

The hotel boasts beautiful interiors, impeccable service and excellent food. However there were a few glitches that surfaced during my stay, the main reason why I cannot give this property a 5 out of 5 rating.Getting to the Conrad Tokyo might be tricky, especially for first-time visitors to Tokyo. The airport limousine bus services, which take you to the hotel's doorstep, seem to be less frequent compared to that of other hotels, and if you miss the bus, taking the train might be challenging. The nearest train stations to the Conrad Tokyo are Shimbashi (JR Yamanote Line) and Shiodome (Tokyo Metro Line). While the Shimbashi station and JR Yamanote Line are best for getting around Tokyo, the hotel is a good 10 minutes' walk away, longer if it is your first time as underpass and underground walkway instructions are not always clear.Shiodome is a relatively quiet neighborhood comprising mostly of office buildings, so there are few things of interest in the hotel's immediate area. Among the better attractions is the Hamarikyu Gardens, which are just next to the hotel. Some rooms at the Conrad overlook the gardens and the Tokyo Bay area beyond. If you are game enough to experience a little alternative Japan, there is a Don Quixote store near the hotel. This chain store, popular amongst younger people and said to be the favourite haunt of some Japanese celebrities, sells almost anything from cheap Japanese snacks to second-hand branded designer bags.I had booked a King Bay View room, which promises a king-sized bed and a view of Tokyo Bay. Having arrived early at 10am, I had expected to be asked to wait out until check-in time. As such, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my room was ready, and that I had been given a corner suite upgrade.My corner suite on the 32nd floor was at the end of the corridor, a quiet heaven from which I could see a sweeping view of Tokyo Bay. The room was very well appointed, with a floor area that is almost unheard of in Tokyo. I especially liked floor-to-ceiling windows in both the living room and bedroom, as well as the large bathroom with a separate bath, rainforest shower stall and double wash basins. Subtle touches, such as the iPod dock on the bedside table, and a guest bathroom for visiting friends (or a last-minute gussy up before heading out the door) made this room quite simply out of this world.However, it was into my second or third night in this suite that I realized things were quite literally falling apart. I was in the bedroom surfing the Internet one evening when I heard something fall and clatter to the ground quite loudly. Upon entering the living room, I noticed that a metal coat hanger knob in the entranceway had somehow detached itself from the wood-paneled wall and fell to the ground. Guest services was prompt in sending someone up to check, but the broken fixtures sadly did not quite end there.Another evening, I noticed that the wall lamp on the right side of the bed was flickering, then the bulb burned itself out. Minutes later, the lamp on the left side of the bed started emitting a shrill, whiny sound and I had to turn it off. As I was tired, I did not call guest services.On a third night, the reading lamp above the left side of the bed ceased to function. After attempting to turn it on and off several times, but failing to rectify the problem, I gave up and simply went to bed.Glitches aside, my stay was very pleasant, and made even more so by the ever attentive hotel staff. For people who do not speak Japanese, the hotel staff I have encountered all speak excellent English and I had almost no trouble communicating with them.I especially appreciated the daily turn down service. Although it felt a little childish, the addition of a little Conrad bear on the bed and a rubber duck in the bath tub was a nice and rather fun bonus. I also liked it that the staff went the extra mile to make my stay more pleasant. One particularly cold evening, I happened to slip the extra heavy blanked under the duvet to keep warm. When I looked in the wardrobe the next evening for the blanket, it was gone. I was about the call guest services to bring a fresh blanket up when I decided to look under the duvet first, and there it was. The staff had carefully laid the blanket under the duvet while making the bed, ensuring that I need not do it myself. I really appreciate these little details that Conrad adds to its service.I am not a very picky guest, so the glitches I experienced did feel rather minor to me. The room, in all, was spacious, luxurious and very comfortable. The service too, was five stars. If you plan to stay at the Conrad, go online to the airport's homepage to check the limousine departure times first, or familiarize yourself with the train route before you reach Japan.For those who are looking for a bit of peace and quiet in the lap of luxury, the Conrad Tokyo is an ideal choice.",Singapore,78,4.0

We couldn't believe all 3 rooms were ready! What a welcome surprise after a long flight. We had our rooms on floors 36 and 37. The rooms looked gorgeous, very comfortable, spacious and had a lovely warm feel to them. And then there was this stunning view of Tokyo Bay. WOW!!! We couldn't stop looking.

Sometimes we'd come back for lunch and drop off some stuff before heading out again in the afternoon. We absolutely loved China Blue for lunch (we also had dinner there once, but preferred lunch). Taxi's just outside the hotel are easy, but we liked using the metro and train during the day: easy, cheap and quick. At night we mainly used taxi's to go to different restaurants and because there were 6 of us, we arranged them trough the concierge. She also made our restaurant bookings for us on request. We loved Ginza Ukai Tei (Michelin star Teppan Yaki restaurant) and K'shiki at Mandarin Oriental. For a cheap but delicious meal, try some of the places at Shimbashi station.

From the airport the most convenient alternative is the Limobus with hourly direct service from Narita to the hotel. Otherwise there is the Narita Express to Tokyo Station and then a short taxi ride to the hotel. 2. Rooms - Very Good. As a HHonors Diamond member I was upgraded to an Executive Floor Room. The rooms are big even on US standards, modern (the hotel is 7 years old), with great views of either the city or the bay. Comfortable beds, extremely clean and with good turndown service. One thing that was not as great was the poor selection of TV channels. 3. Restaurants - Good. The hotel has 3 restaurants at the 28th floor: a Gordon Ramsey restaurant a Chinese restaurant and a Japanese restaurant. The Japanese restaurant was really good even if a bit pricey but the Chinese restaurant was not very good (and still very pricey). Both restaurants have a great view of the Tokyo Bay and very good service. The Executive Lounge at the 37th floor has a decent selection of food for breakfast.4. Service - Excellent. During my entire stay I was really happy with the service starting with the check in and finishing with the check out. The concierge in particular was very useful in helping me with reservations and directions. Overall I had a very good stay at the Conrad Tokyo.","Bucharest, Romania",60,5.0

There is an easy to find shuttle bus that goes from Narita airport for about $30 U.S. per person (note Tokyo is about 1.5 hours away from Narita airport). The shuttle bus was on time to the minute and clean, quiet, and comfortable. We had a regular room with a spectacular view. All of the rooms are on the top 10 or 15 stories of an office building. One wall of the room was entirely glass looking out over the city and the bay. The bathroom was huge and clean with a tub and separate shower and two sinks. The staff at the hotel was perfectly welcoming and even patiently answered many, many questions from me about the hotel and area. Note this is NOT the hotel where the movie ""Inception"" was filmed even though it looks exactly the same. The atmosphere is sleek, modern, and clean. The famous Tsukiji fish market is a very short walk from the hotel (10 min or less), which is a great place for an early morning exploration if you are jet lagged and can't sleep. There are also some huge shopping centers within a few minutes walk of the hotel that hold dozens of restaurants. Finally, there is an easy-to-navigate subway line next to the hotel that can take you almost anywhere. We had an easy time taking a direct train from the hotel to Sensoji temple (a big tourist area).One important thing to note is that it's probably tough to find the hotel if you don't come by bus or taxi and get dropped off right in front. If you take the train from the airport, the area around the hotel is so built up with commercial stuff that you could easily get lost trying to find the hotel. Also note a taxi from Narita to pretty much anywhere in this part of Tokyo will cost over $200 U.S. Finally, in what is apparently Japanese fashion, the bed was a little bit hard.I can't say a lot about value as I was staying here on a fixed rate negotiated by my employer.","Beirut, Lebanon",94,5.0

I had an overall excellent experience in this hotel with just a few minor, personal quirks. I rank this hotel as top three in Asia, and in no particular order, I'd put them together with the Shanghai JW Marriott, Bangkok's Renaissance, and Hong Kong's JW Marriott.The hotel was relatively easy to get to from Narita airport. Taking the Narita express to Tokyo station and then the Tokyo Metro subway to get to the hotel involves only one transit. It is a bit of a walk (around 7 minutes or so) from the subway station to the hotel, so I wouldn't recommend this option if you are not traveling light. I also tried another option of transport upon my return, which is to take the hotel's airport shuttle. This is much more convenient because they transport between the hotel and the airport terminal directly. Both method will cost about the same (around 3,000 yen). The only downside to the shuttle is the schedule, which I believe runs every hour. So if you happen to land at the awkward timing, you may have to wait for a while. Check the airport information desk for their schedule.The hotel staff was very accommodating. I arrived much earlier than the 3 PM check-in time, but they were willing to help me out and provided me (very) early-check-in. Perhaps this is because I have status with HHonors, or it could be because I indicated far in advance that I expect to be checking-in early due to my flight arrival time. I was upgraded to the executive level due to my status, so I'm not sure how the regular rooms are like. The room I was assigned to was obviously nice. Had a good view, comfortable bed, and high ceilings (rain showers are great). The executive lounge, for those of you with access and status with HHonors, is one of the better ones I've been to. For Asian standards, I'd place it in the top three, the other two being JW Shanghai and Renaissance Bangkok. Staff in the lounge pampers you (in a good way) as soon as you walk in and they are very friendly. Food is decent and the view from the lounge is nice.This brings me to my one and only personal quirk about this hotel. It is located above the office section and it takes two elevator rides to get to the ground (I'm a walker). In a way, it provides a certain level of avoidance from the noise in the ground, but it also provides an extra step to take every time you want to get out of the hotel. Not a deal breaker, and when you stay in this hotel, it is likely that you want to spend some time in it. Location wise, the hotel is nicely located near a JR railway station, which makes it convenient to get to other areas of Tokyo. Don't forget to visit Tsukiji fish market in the morning while you are coping with jetlag, it is only a short walking distance away. Walking around the area is also interesting since it doesn't really look like the rest of Tokyo. I imagine most of the housing in this area is uber expensive, and it has a strange Japanese / European / North American mix of theme around this area. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to sample the other facilities due to my short stay, but I'm definitely looking forward to coming back.","Toronto, Canada",52,5.0

Location is not best for the tourists, but reasonable. Hotel itself is great, fabulous views to Tokyo bay and city from lobby, rooms and executive lounge. Check in was not too efficient and I have experienced the same in may Asian Conrad Hotels. We managed to get our room and had access to Executive lounge which offered good snacks and wide range of drinks during the day and evening. Also service experience at lounge was a little bit unfriendly or maybe it was more like unwillingness to serve. During the breakfast cleaning the tables was pretty slow and maybe a little bit short of staff compared to most of luxury hotels that I have visited.The pool at the Conrad Tokyo is a own story. My wife and two sons went to swim. First of all the price for swimming pool was extremely high (around 50 € for one adult and 2 kids under 10). There happen to be some language difficulties at pool and it ended up to situation that kids had to be by their own in changing room and showers even otherwise was agreed at the Spa area check in. Anyway, views from the pool was excellent!Our room was Executive city view room and it was excellent. Spacious room and very good bathroom also. Beds where excellent and we had very good sleep there.A little bit more friendly and efficient service and reasonable price to pool would make me to give almost perfect points for this hotel!","Hameenlinna, Finland",35,3.0

Hotel located across from park with water taxi service into old Tokyo city which is a must for a temple visit and to experience the real Japan. The staff at this hotel are extremely courteous and efficient. I was paricularly impressed with the attention to detail when dealing with my dietary needs (I am gluten and wheat intolerant) when we ate in the Hotel's Japanese restaurant. I also loved watching the man that turned down our room at night and the care taken to ensure that all was in order and that towels changed and even glasses and water bottles placed precisely in correct position on bedside tables.unfortunately, I did not have time to use the swimming pool , but had the opportunity for a look round at it looked smashing (extra charge for use of this facility on our B&B package).My only criticisms were that snacks and drinks were very expensive eg £30-£40 for a club sandwich! Smoking is allowed in the lounge and the practice of seat reservations overlooking bay and city view(which remained empty whilst we had our drinks at the bar ) takes place. (Staff did however move us when an available table did become free).Arrival and departure to Narita was by airport limousine (return journey vouchers arranged by hotel) which was extremely efficient and on time and for 3k yen was much cheaper and cerainly less hassle then using the train with luggage ( few escalators at stations).All things considered a wonderful short 2 night stay in a wonderful hotel on our retun journey from Perth and look forward to doing it again some day.","London, United Kingdom",25,5.0

Love the service. the room, the view and the small little touches.Conrad Tokyo is situtated in the Shidome/Shimbashi area which is just next to the Shidome metro line. It is also connected to the Shimbashi train station via underground walkways and mall, and the Shimbashi station is serviced by numerous train lines including the Shinkansen. Similar to many of Tokyo's large train stations, many buildings are connected via underground but do expect to walk from one location to another. Walking from the more useful Shimbashi to Conrad Tokyo will take you 10-15 minutes, but it's doable even with a luggage or two. From Shimbashi Station, Ginza is just 5 minutes walk away. The Tsukiji Fish Market is 10 minutes walk from the hotel.Service at the hotel is top notch. Everyone that I have encountered, from the reception, the housekeepers and those manning the gym and health club always greet you with a smile and offered their best help and services. The room is extremely large, with very practical layout and fitted with all the modern technology (automatic blind for the room and bathroom as an example). Since Conrad Tokyo occupies the top 10 floors of a 38 Storey building, one will be greeted with superb city & bay views at the lobby, executive lounge and in the room. As part of the Conrad tradition treating guest with small little touches, love the cute conrad teddy bears on the bed and the conrad duck on the bath tub.My only small complain would be the limited variety of food offered during breakfast and evening cocktail at the executive lounge. Although the hot food served during the evening cocktail is changed daily, the same does not apply for the breakfast. Drinks during the evening cocktail is good though.The health club is also very well equipped with a large gym, lap indoor pool and sauna/steam/jacuzzi. I love the small little touches like the 2 different types of cold drinks and one hot drink served in the sauna/steam/jacuzzi room.In short, this is an excellent luxury hotel that I would definitely recommend to anyone and hoping to return soon!","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",29,5.0

It is beautiful, has amazing views so it was a pleasure to stay here for my visit this time. The bay view room we had was great, very spacious room and bathroom with one of the nicest furnishings and decor I've seen in a hotel. However we felt let down by the service:-upon check in in the morning after a long overnight flight, we were told that we could not be given an early check-in. I understand that this could not be guaranteed but seeing as we have requested for this before our stay and also having Hilton Honours Gold membership, I felt that the hotel could have been more accommodating. It was also the manner that the staff Mr Kitaki ( hope the spelling is correct) informed us, abrupt and very unhelpful. It was just like, come back a few hours later without bothering. Although he later on checked us in early, we had already an unpleasant first impression.-we were out of the city and checked back in again for the second part of our stay. This time it was after 1pm and again we were told that no rooms were available for check in yet. Seeing that check out time is at noon, surely there could be at least some rooms that were already available. However this time the staff Ms Kajio was much more helpful and quickly helped us find a room. As we were led to our room we noticed that there were many rooms that were in the midst of being cleaned. This gave the impression that the hotel did not have enough housekeeping staff to get the rooms ready for the next guests. Surely such a hotel as the Conrad is able to do this better than asking all their guests to wait for check in.- concierge service was average especially from Mr Abe who is ironically the chief concierge. His manner was quite rude and he told us he was very busy. Overall for guests outside Japan, the service might be considered ok but as I've lived in Tokyo and know that the Japanese provide incomparable service to anywhere else in the world, the service shown by some of the front desk staff is sadly lacking and marred what would otherwise be a memorable stay in an amazing hotel.",London,50,3.0

I cannot rate the experience high enough.First of all, the facilities are excellent. The hotel is located in a business area (Shiodome) beginning on the 28th floor. The lobby is attractive, overlooking a beautiful shogun garden. There is a bar which almost every evening had live music. We (my travel buddy and I), were quickly accommodated after the 12 hour flight from the West Coast. We were graciously given executive lounge access. The room itself was well appointed with a view overlooking other office buildings (the side which overlooked the garden/Tokyo Bay would have been even better if one wishes to make a request). The room had automatic shades, HDTV(with 4 English channels in addition to the Japanese ones). There was a large bathroom with separate shower, bath, and toilet with heated seat. My only criticism was the automatic shade separating the glass enclosure for the bathroom did not completely seal out the light from the bathroom. On the 29th floor there is a wonderful health club which included a great 25 meter lap pool, gym, changing room, etc. Having gold status, we were comped. The workout room had fruit every morning. The executive lounge offered continental breakfast plus sausage and an ""omelet of the week"". Throughout the day there were snacks. The variety seemed to vary by the time and day of week.The complementary(for gold and diamond Hilton members) buffet breakfast off the lobby in the restaurant contained both Japanese and Western offerings. Though it was continental, there was hot rice porridge and ham.However, what made the stay even more satisfying was the outstanding professional and friendly service. Whether it was the front desk, restaurant and executive lounge personnel, health club workers, or cleaning people, all were always friendly and willing to do whatever it took to make our stay memorable. They were always willing to go the extra mile. I have never stayed at any hotel anywhere with service so impeccable.

In short, if we were to return, this would be where we stay. It is expensive, but worth every penny. Even though level of service in Japan is generally very high, the Conrad manages to impress. The location, view, decor, luxury, in house food and cocktails are excellent. I would highly recommend the evening cake selection - I had the chocolate cake which was outstanding and normally I don't like chocolate cake. This was exquisite and rich. The breakfast is also something to look forward to each morning. The business centre has 4 PCs with internet (free) and a printer at hand. Wi-fi in rooms has to be paid for but is very good. The pool, spa and gym are all very well set up. I think we enjoyed our stay here especially because we received 5 star service in a hotel that is actually relatively small compared to the usual international chains - 7 floors only, starting at the 28th. The high attention to detail as a result of that, is certainly noticeable.","London, United Kingdom",97,5.0

It is a very stylish hotel, the rooms are large and stylishly appointed and the bathroom was huge, the stand alone bath was fabulous.

I had a drink in the bar which has breathtaking views over Tokyo Bay and breakfast in the executive lounge. The exec lounge is set up like a domestic kitchen and lounge room which I think might be to make guests feel at home but I am not sure that it really works. The food was excellent though. The staff has trouble keeping up with clearing plates and taking extra coffee orders etc. and given it was not that busy while I was at breakfast, this was a bit disappointing. The hotel is a short taxi ride from Tokyo Station or a short walk from Shimbashi Station. I would not bother changing at Shimbashi to the monorail line to go one stop to Shiodome Station which is next to the hotel. By the time you walk through the monorail station, but a ticket, wait for the train etc, you could have walked to the hotel from Shimbashi.Overall it is one of the most stylish, comfortable hotels I have stayed at.",Melbourne,26,5.0

I was very impressed with the hotel from the moment we arrived. We were graciously greeted, I can't say enough of the Japanese people and how wonderful the culture is. The service was outstanding and they will go out of their way to go above and beyond. The lobby is on the 28th floor with expansive windows and an incredible breathtaking view of Tokyo. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite on the executive floor overlooking Tokyo Bay. The suite was extremely large and included a small kitchen area where we had our own Nespresso machine (We loved this extra touch), dining table, living room, office area (worked great since my husband was on business) and of coarse the bedroom and spacious bathroom. THe room was well appointed as one would expect of a luxury hotel. We had floor to ceiling windows in every room overlooking the bay. It was incredible and certainly a home away from home. We took advantage of the Executive floor lounge every morning for breakfast. They had omelets made to order with a variety of American and Japanese foods. It is a wonderful room with with added service of it's own concierge, which was helpful for me daily. The executive concierge service assisted me in planning out my day. I joined my husband who was on business but I got to be a tourist. There were several sport celebrities during the time we were there and we saw Andy Murray every morning in the Ex. Lounge having his breakfast before his tennis match. We also saw Formula One Driver Lewis Hamilton. That was pretty exciting. I thought the location of the hotel was perfectly situated near the action but not in the middle of it all. I walked to the Ginza area (shopping district) almost daily - about 10 minute walk. Also I took advantage of the subway (great and easy way to get around Tokyo, very clean and safe - not like NYC) which is right next to the hotel (Shiodome Station). I thought the location could not be anymore perfect. We utilized the gym daily and took advantage of the spa as well. We dined in the Chinese Restaurant and the Gordon Ramsey French Restaurant. Both were excellent and had great service as well. The lobby bar is also another wonderful area to enjoy with live music and incredible views while having a cocktail. All in all our stay was remarkable and I will definately return. I highly recommend this hotel in Tokyo.",Hawaii,56,5.0

Unfortunately the water closet and shower are too small, and the water from the shower always leaks into the room and onto the very slippery floor.

The jacuzzi, steam, and sauna rooms are also very nice to enjoy. Ate breakfast buffet everyday and food quality and service were very high. View is also amazing from the dining room.

What I was most happy about was that because I had to take a late evening flight out of Tokyo, the hotel offered to store my fish roe from Tshikiji fish market in their freezer and allowed me to use the 29th floor spa to freshen up even after I had checked out.

Hilton diamond members blowing out points to stay a week in Tokyo. 37th Floor Executive level, complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea (that we never made), light evening snacks and cocktails in the executive lounge, and full use of the Pool/Spa area. My wife had stayed here previously for work and we returned for our recently completed vacation. Any concern about the location from some reviews were completely erased upon our arrival. The hotel is directly above the Shiodome Subway Oedo line and is located a ten minute walk from the Shimbashi railway station that with a JR Pass or without gives you easy access to a large amount of the city. Across the street is the beautiful Hamarikyu Gardens that is the stopping point for a half an hour water taxi to Asakusa, the Tsukiji Fish Market is a ten minute walk for the freshest Sushi breakfast you will ever experience and Ginza area is maybe fifteen minutes walk at most. I suppose it all depends on your comfort level with using the most incredible transportation system imaginable. It was quite easy to figure out and easier if you spend a little money and rent a portable Wi-fi device from the airport. It cost us about $15 per day and allowed us unlimited wireless that we used for Google Maps on our Iphones whenever we were feeling a little lost. Our room and its city view was beautiful with a very large bedroom, bathroom with walk in shower and large tub and electronically controlled everything. The best part of our experience was the service. Everyone that works at this hotel went out of their way to be incredibly nice and helpful from the people who worked at the Front Desk when we arrived in shorts and t-shirts with my large back pack and assorted travel bags. Were we slightly under dressed compared to the mostly business clientele......yes. Did anyone treat us any differently.....nope. Yes, this was before they knew we were diamond members. It actually started with the valet gentleman in first floor lobby. The people who worked in every department treated us the same regardless of our dress, either casual for a day out exploring or dressed up for a night out. A little surprised to read the reviews about dress code but we did not use the main restaurants while we were there except for the executive lounge and did so every morning and a few evenings in various attire from shorts, to jeans to dress clothes. The people that we have to thank the most for this experience are the two women that helped us at the concierge desk during our week stay from August 14th-21st. I really wished that I had taken the time to write down their names to send a properly titled thank you but we hope that the management will be able to figure out who was working during that week. From restaurant and bar recommendations, reservations and directions throughout Tokyo, water taxi schedules, and recommending catching the Bus back to the airport instead of the Narita express when we were loaded up with additional bags headed home. They were exceptional. The Pièce de résistance was taking care of our dinner reservations for our two day trip to Kyoto at Ryotei Kikunoi. We cannot wait until our travels take us back to Tokyo so we can once again enjoy this hotel.",Chicago,4,5.0

We felt pretty unwelcome from the start, being told of a 'dress code' in the lunch restaurant-we had just arrived from a long journey and all suitable garments were in our luggage. I was happy to accept that at lunchtime (we were allowed to eat in a dark booth) but had a REAL problem at breakfast on being advised that I should not wear my 'Fitflops'. A dress code at BREAKFAST? Our booking had clearly been as leisure tourists, not business-people. If this really is the atmosphere Conrad wish to instill, then their literature/website etc should make it clear. On 2 or 3 occasions, despite the lobby bar being empty, we were asked to move to other seats as those we had chosen were 'reserved' (and we were waiting only as our rooms were not ready for occupancy!)There is a charge (equivalent of £25) to use the hotel pool - I have never before, as a guest, been charged to use hotel facilities.The whole experience was, in short, pretty unpleasant and most unwelcoming, so much so that we declined after day 1 to eat or drink at the Hotel and took our patronage elsewhere, where we felt more appreciated!

We booked a bay view club room with access to club lounge. Check in was easy, and we were shown to our rooms. My husband had stayed before on business a couple of times, and had recommended we stay here with our son on our way back from Hawaii. The overall feel of the hotel is minimal and modern, and from the downstairs lobby you have to travel to the 28th floor for reception.The dark corridors took some getting used to, but with low lighting it felt quite tranquil. I really felt this was more suited to Business travelers. Our room on the 37th floor felt spacious and had a large bathroom, however the sliding doors on the bathroom didn't lock, so privacy not always guaranteed with a 5 year old! The club lounge was just along the corridor, offering breakfast (not a great selection), soft drinks and tea/coffee during the day, afternoon tea and snacks, and a drinks hour from 6-8 with snacks from the various restaurants in the hotel. Drinks were unlimited, and they had a good selection of wines, beers, and spirits we enjoyed this facility nightly and children were welcome, which is great compared to some other hotels club lounges. The staff were great as well. We had breakfast options, club lounge, in our room or in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant, Cerise. On our first morning we chose Cerise, and much to my astonishment I was refused entry due to the fact I had smart rubber flip flops on and was advised re spaghetti straps not being allowed either, even though there were ladies with sandals and hot pants on in the restaurant! I was flabbergasted but went back to the room to change. I later challenged this policy later in the day as nothing was advertised on the website of the hotel and was advised this wasn't the case, and the wonderful Maitre d of the restaurant, pulled out all the stops to apologise to me personally, and us a family. He really needs to be applauded for his efforts and I would say he is worth his weight in gold to the hotel, and hopefully he will pull his team into shape in the restaurant! I also need to add I had the worst eggs benedict ever at this restaurant, it had been placed under a grill and the sauce had hardened to a crust! We did mention this, as well as a hair in my potatoes! Obviously the restaurant has a dress code for lunch/dinner, but I fully expected this and would adhere accordingly. Also, the hotel does have a swimming pool, which was another reason we chose the hotel, but unfortunately you have to pay for the use of this and worked out rather expensive for a quick dip! This is not stated on the website and really should be. Also we tried to have an afternoon snack and drink in the bar twenty-eight, but was told we could have a table for 20 minutes in the non smoking area, as they were booked with afternoon tea clients who weren't guests! Very poor. We left at this point. Overall the staff are polite and hotel is in a great location and we have said we would use it again, just wish the staff knew the hotel policies and could be more accommodating for its guests.","Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",40,4.0

The hotel is in a modern high-rise office building complex, not by any means a historic area, but very accessible by pedestrian concourse from Shiodome & Shimbashi train stations, and only a 10 minute walk to Tsukiji fish market. Rooms are large, great views and lots of cool gadgets, beautifully decorated and comfortable with fantastic bathrooms. Didn't use the hotel restaurants or bars, but all are very stylish with great views. Staff is attentive and thorough but unobtrusive. Only downside for me was the smell of cigarette smoke from the lobby bar every time you enter the 28th floor lobby/registration area. I know cigarette smoking restrictions are not yet common in Japan, but the hotel should get ahead of the times and ban smoking from common areas completely. In-room wifi expensive, but worked well.

My friend is staying at the Peninsula and has the whole Ginza district right outside her door, as well as the imperial palace. This hotel is just in some office district.Also, the Internet access, as mentioned by others, is expensive. What bothered me more, however, was that, in order to access it, I had to call the front desk, talk about the charges, then wait for someone to run up a card, which I then had to scratch off. There were three different cards and the (broken English) explanation didn't explain which to use. Eventually, the third one worked. Come on, people, this is 2012!

Our offices are not that close so it doesn't make a lot of sense to stay here normally but this was just one night before I flew out of Haneda so I thought I'd treat myself. Well located directly above the Shiodome station and close to many major areas including the monorail to Disney Land, it makes good sense to stay here if you can.The Hotel:First impressions were impressive. You are greeted on a ground floor level before being whisked (your bags in an opposite direction I might add) up to the 28th floor reception area (quite a few high end hotels in Tokyo are located on 'top' of business buildings) which was vast, dark/marble with loads of floor to ceiling windows taking in the spectacular waterfront views. Check-in was typical Japanese, quick and courteous and I was off to my 35th floor King room.The Room & Bathroom:As mentioned I was staying in a King Bay View room which turned out to be on the 35th floor (of 37). Being a Diamond HH member got me access to the Club/Executive Lounge and a host of benefits such as internet, gym access etc. The room itself was very luxurious and again had huge windows overlooking the bay. A beautiful big bathroom with freestanding tub, separate toilet, and rain shower areas finished off by twin sinks and again more dark marble. The bed, tv, and sitting area (a great window-length sofa) were all of the highest standard typical of the Conrad chain. The bed was incredibly comfortable and I had a fantastic sleep after at the tail end of an exhausting work trip.Food/Restaurant:I took advantage of the 37th floor executive lounge to have some nibbles and cocktails the night I arrived. The lounge was quite small (compared to the lounges in other hotels including the Conrad in Singapore which is huge in comparison) but well laid out and with great service. Not too many food offerings but more then enough for something 'pre dinner'. I had some simple room service for dinner which was very nice and served promptly (and actually not prohibitively expensive!) Again, for breakfast I went up to the lounge which served a fairly comprehensive breafast buffet complete with 'made to order' omelets.Gym/Pool/Spa:I was able to get a very quick workout in before heading to the airport and the whole fitness/spa area is very very nice. Staff escort you everywhere and lockers etc are plentiful. The gym was very complete with all required weights, cardio, and even a 'floor area' which had classes! The cardio machines look down on the indoor pool which is pretty cool overlooking Tokyo 29 floors up!Overall: In summary this hotel certainly lives up to not only its high ranking at Trip Advisor but also as part of the Conrad brand. It is slick, polished, modern and very well fitted out. If you can afford this or have a good corporate rate, this could easily be your hotel of choice for Tokyo.Pros: Above subway, modern, comfortable, great facilities, service, HH partner.Cons: Lounge is small/too many children (most lounges don't allow children)","Vancouver, Canada",85,5.0

I travel to Tokyo eight times a year. So, I have a lot of experience with Tokyo hotels.The Conrad was very nice, new, sleek and clean. The room was very large. I had both a harbor view and a city view as I was in Kyoto in between Tokyo visits. Both were nice, the harbor is more interesting if you can get that. Service was excellent with no issues. That needs to be the case for a hotel in this price range and they did a good job service wise. The bathrooms are large and attractive with a big tub and separate shower- just super. The room décor is all first class, just very nice. Not a single criticism.The restaurant has a nice breakfast buffet with a hot choice prepared first and then a huge range of choices from the buffet. Typical of a nice hotel in Asia and pleasant. While I tend to overeat at these buffets it is a nice way to get a good solid meal if you are working and might miss lunch.The only issue I would have the hotel was some of the pricing, others have commented on it here. My breakfast, as mentioned above, was included in the first two nights as part of a package, that's nice. On the last morning I was hungry and needed breakfast but as the reservation had been last minute booked on a different website, no breakfast. So, I went down and paid for breakfast separately - 4,000 yen. That's about $50 folks. Frankly while I know that breakfast will be expensive in a place like this $50 a person seems excessively expensive to me. Other hotels in Japan change about 2,500 for the morning buffet. That seems like enough.Also, a personal issue I have with hotels are various internet charges. 1,500 yen is the cost of the internet for one device ($18 or so) 2,000 yen for two. Really? Do, you need to nick me an extra $6.25 because I want to use two devices? I paid for the internet, these rooms are $500 a night. How about letting it go as a single room charge for any devices I use? If you need to charge at all.Also, I agree with those who complained about the pool charge. 2,500 yen ($32) for a swim? I mean come on. While I see that the manager commented here elsewhere that it is common to charge in Asia for the pool, I think that instead of hiding behind that excuse, standing above that practice and providing the pool with a $500 room would be preferred. This morning I leave for the airport, I would have liked to go for a swim before the trip. But, I thought “gee I will only be in that pool for about 20 mins for $32”. Of course I can afford $32. That’s not the point, it’s the principle of getting nicked like that.So, really nice hotel. I think that management should reconsider the add ons though. Clean out these various charges and watch the pricing. Just because the client is generally affluent doesn’t mean that he doesn’t notice getting nicked. If they eliminated this stuff, the customer will be pleasantly surprised at the terrific amenities included in a top notch hotel.","Tampa, Florida",46,4.0

Great points The hotel's lobby, interiors and rooms are extremely chic and modern - biggest plus point of the hotel would be its large rooms with amazing views of the harbour and park. The bathroom with bathtub, separate shower area and double sinks was of a great size too, with my favourite features being the heated toilet bowl, beautiful bathtub and automated bamboo blinds. Housekeeping was extremely efficient, responding to our requests within 10 minutes. As with the Japanese, service was polite and gracious. Concierge was helpful with detailed walking maps, F&B and activity recommendations. Hotel is well connected to several subway options, including the monorail and JR lines. If you don't mind, Ginza can be reached on foot in 10 minutes, connected seamlessly by overhead bridges all the way - which was a good walking exericse for me, personally. Finally, there are several affordable F&B japanese establishments on the second floor, to the right of the hotel lobby - which is popular with the office crowd. Not so great pointsI'm surprised I didn't see this come up often, that there were only four english cable channels (CNN, BBC, 2 movie channels that weren't HBO or Starmovies) on TV! Most international 5-star hotels would have several more entertainment options for TV, as well as dedicated German, French, Chinese channels. Did not try any F&B within the hotel, so no comments there. Due to the location of the hotel, that seemed to be within a corporate/ business district - I felt that the hotel and its surroundings seemed a little cold and lacked personality. Especially on weekend nights, it can be extremely quiet. There aren't any fantastic eating places within a stone's throw, but we managed with taking the (albeit confusing) subway everywhere. Taxis are crazy expensive in Tokyo. Twice - I was disappointed with concierge's recomendations -- we were asking for a great ramen place, that was preferably local and provided another restaurant as a benchmark. After much trouble, we found ourselves in Ronponggi, in a lacklustre vending machine ramen shop that was empty, had tough instant noodles as ramen and was a total disappointment. Another time, I was asking for restaurants in Ginza, and the concierge was trying to hardsell an upmarket Japanese restaurant that I was clearly not keen on, having asked for affordable options. He even had a restaurant brochure and still stuck by his recommendation, albeit politely, but still, my objectives weren't achieved. ExtrasFor the foodies - try these two restaurants not too far from the Conrad. Midori Zushi near Ginza, 15 to 20 minutes by foot. Extremely awesome sushi restaurant that was packed to the gills with locals, affordable too at USD65 for two people, with two rounds of sake. ;-) Restaurant Voie Lactee - fine dining in Minato, 10 minute cab ride from Conrad. Amazing, degustation Jap/French cuisine, from 10,000 yen/ USD125 per person for their set menus. Cosy, stylish restaurant tucked in a private estate's garden.","Singapore, Singapore",37,4.0

Shiodome is a little out of the way and we ended up spending a lot of time on the subway. It's super convenient for the legendary Tsukiji fish market and we went there three times during our stay!

Rooms are large, considering we are in Tokyo, with great views on either side of the building. Two chaises are by the windows, good working table and a very modern bathroom with a window wall looking into the bedroom. Bathtub is great and the WC is all you would expect in Japan: heated seat and cleaning jets. I love the pajamas that are provided clean and folded every night. Excecutive lounge is also very nice (not as many food selections or over-the-top service as the Conrad in HK, but very very good anyway). Breakfast at the Lounge is great, with good selections. Happy hour is kind of short but with enough treats if you want to make it a light dinner. Concierge at the Excecutive Floor is good, and they sent us one day to an excursion to Kamakura, 50 km from Tokyo that was perfectly planned and made for a very nice day. We had a medical emergency while in Tokyo and staff did everything possible to find us a hospital, and when that became an impossible task they located an English speaking doctor that came to our room on a Saturday night. Pool is at the 29th floor with great views and jacuzzi/sauna are very nice indeed. Restaurants downstairs are very good and like most upscale places in Tokyo they are very, very expensive (US$10 x 160 ml Coke as an example).Everybody was very attentive and polite, although English proficiency is spotty. We stayed with two children and in our six days at this hotel they were not able to figure out we needed four towels instead of two. We just kept calling every night for the extra towels. If they keep attention to these little details, this could be the top hotel anywhere.","Highland, Maryland",122,5.0

The hotel starts from the 28th Floor of the Shiodome building. We stayed in two attached rooms which they prepared well in advance before our arrival. It is an impressive and chic hotel. The rooms were large for Tokyo standards and the room design was great. The location is good. It is very near the Shiodome metro station and a short walk away from the Shinbashi metro and JR Station, which is bigger and has better connectivity. The hotel is a short walk away from the Hama-Rikyu Sunken Gardens, and for some expensive shopping, Ginza is a 10 minute walk away. There are ample restaurants around the hotel, attached to it and next to it in the nearby buildings. The hotel itself has 3 restaurants, but it may strain your wallet! The breakfast was good and well presented. The concierge are good, but I must say that I expected more from them in this luxury hotel. I felt it lacked a personal touch. They charge for use of thr pool and WiFi, which I feel is unacceptable in todays hotels. They are very rigid about check out times. My bottom line is that if you are on a holiday, maybe hotels in Roppongi area may be better. In my opinion, they did not go that extra that you expect from similar luxury hotels, especially when you are staying with your family for 5 nites. Having said that, the restaurant staff at the Cerise restaurant were superb! If you are here on a busy business trip, this is a good choice.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",59,4.0

I've stayed at many hotels around the world, and this is certainly one of the nicer ones - but I've never heard of a hotel charging a guest for the use of their pool. A call to the front desk didn't resolve anything - other than it would be free if I was a HIlton Honors Gold Card holder. This has certainly left a very sour taste in my entire trip - after touring Japan for 10 days, all I had wanted was to have a simple dip in the pool.

I can honestly say this was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had, and cannot say enough about the property. The Conrad ticks all of the boxes that a five star property should have, and then some. The hotel's design is absolutely stunning. It has a very sublime modern elegance about it. The rooms and bathrooms are exquisite, beds extraordinarily comfortable and all modern technologies well conceived, intuitive and easy to use. Most importantly it is drop dead quiet. There is absolutely no street noise and I slept as well as I ever have in a hotel. Even the air conditioning is quiet. As nice as all of this is, the service really puts the Conrad over the top. I have simply never encountered such personalized, warm, attentive hotel personnel anywhere. To say the staff goes the extra yard to please guests would be an understatement. One of the concierges, Miki, went out of her way to help me find a specific item I was interested in purchasing. Miki engaged in diligent online research, gave me perfect directions to the store (which was not in Central Tokyo) and as a result I saved about $500 versus a comparable item in a Ginza department store. The bell captain then helped me store and wrap it properly for my trip home, saving me even ore money in shipping expense. I simply cannot thank them enough, and of course as is typical in Japan they simply tell you they are just doing their job (with no gratuity expected). Absolutely unthinkable in America. In fact most hotels should consider sending their staff to the Conrad for training - they could learn a thing or two about service.

It's a 10-15 minute walk from the Shinbashi station. - Expensive. I have gold status, so it was different for me but.... The charges for Internet, fitness, pool, extra bed, breakfast, restaurants are in my opinion are too high.

The lobby bar has a terrific view but as you'd expect for such a view and at such a top end hotel, prices are not cheap. The restaurants are good, but I fnd them over priced especially considering the location and what else is available in a 10-15 minute walk. The Gordon Ramsey place is the worst value and the Japanese and Chinese are better choices.The location is great. You are a 15 minute walk from Ginza or Tsukiji fish market.

The hotel is really fabulous. The location is excellent, within walking distance to Shimbashi Station and the Ginza shopping district. The rooms are very spacious and clean with modern and well-appointed bathrooms. The staff is courteous and extremely helpful. I can't say enough of good things about the place. However, there are a few details that could be improved upon, in my opinion. The bar area is lovely with AMAZING views, but the ""bar menu"" could be improved upon. As a constant business traveler, sometimes I arrive late from the office and need a quick snack. The other restaurants in the hotel are very expensive and the bar menu is limited. An enhancement to that would be a good addition. Lastly, something that annoys me and prevents me from giving the Conrad a five star rating...the extra charges for things such as using the swimming pool and using the internet access. If I'm paying upwards of US$400-500 a night for a hotel I expect free internet, at least in the lobby. Instead I was charged Y1500 for one device for 24 hours. C'mon! The same for using the pool. Why have a lovely pool at a lovely hotel and not allow patrons to use it free of charge? Either make this a luxury hotel with all the amenities or not.

I had been to an event in the bar here before, but this was my first stay. Dropped off my bag early in the day, and didn't return to check in until quite late in the evening - but this was no problem: staff were very polite, efficient, and my bag had already been taken up to my room for me.First, the very minor bad points: On a cold night, the approach to the hotel is a bit stark with lots of concrete and a not-so-obvious entrance. There is also some roadwork construction nearby that has been going on a while, though I didn't notice any noise at all from this, nor any real inconvenience - it does mean it's hard to cross one of the roads at street level, but there are elevated walkways, and the train station immediately adjacent so there isn't all that much need to be walking around anyway.The hotel is dark, modern and fashionable inside its public spaces. I stayed in a room facing Tokyo Bay, and my first impression on entering the room was ""wow! It's huge, and gorgeous!"" Easily the biggest western-style hotel room I have stayed in in Tokyo, and I've stayed in a lot.Absolutely faultless presentation of the room - no marks or stains anywhere, nice use of materials with plenty of timber, subtly Japanese patterned headboards and carpet, very large and glamorous bathroom, etc.I spent some time reclined on the window lounge admiring the lights around Tokyo Bay, the Rainbow Bridge etc and generally enjoying the quiet outlook. There was an ice bucket prepared, along with welcome chocolates. Another nice touch was the little Conrad teddy bears on each bed. I had a very nice long bath, and after raising the electric blinds in the glass wall between bathroom and bedroom, could soak while enjoying the Tokyo night view (along with bubbles and a rubber duck!)I had an excellent sleep - very comfortable bed, and great electric blinds and block-out shutters that kept the room perfectly dark and silent and allowed me a good sleep-in.The exec lounge breakfast was reasonable but not exceptional - a good variety of food, eggs made-to-order, although omelette looked a little lifeless for some reason. Attentive service, albeit from non-Japanese staff. A minor oddity is the exec lounge is facing the city rather than the bay, which means it has a relatively quite boring outlook. That seems an odd choice - but did allow me to appreciate the view from my room even more.Checkout staff were also extremely efficient, polite and helpful including filling in the courier form to send on my luggage to my next destination (100 kilometres or so away, and it arrived the next day all for about ¥1,200 - a terrific service I highly recommend and use every time in Japan now to save carrying luggage around on trains, etc).I expected the location to be a little inconvenient but was pleasantly surprised by how accessible it is. Right on a subway station, plus right on the Yurikamome to get to Odaiba or back to Shinbashi for JR line connections (or just walk back there in 10 minutes). It's also very close to the Ginza, Tsukiji fish markets and plenty of other Tokyo highlights.The room rate at the Conrad is expensive and there are certainly plenty of cheaper options in Tokyo. I think the rack rate for the room I was in is somewhere around ¥60,000. But for a special occasion or if you can afford it and appreciate a truly excellent hotel room, it's hard to go past the Conrad. I certain hope to have an excuse to come back again soon, and will splurge to stay here rather than a lesser hotel.","Odawara, Japan",138,5.0

First/foremost, this is a beautifully designed hotel, w/ a jaw dropping lobby on the 28th floor of a building. The Asian contemporary design is terrific, and the rooms are quite roomy for Japan. Service is definitely 5-stars, from the front desk, to the restaurant staff, housekeeping, gym, etc. If you are not doing business in the Minato or finance district, it is probably worth staying somewhere else as this is not ideally located to some of the more noteworthy parts of Tokyo. However, it is perfectly located if you are in town for business in this neighborhood, and you will not find a better business hotel.Besides the whopping prices ($500/night, $65 breakfast, $20/day/internet) by even Tokyo standards, my biggest gripe that forced me to only give it 4-stars is the gym/pool. Exercise is always important for me and while the gym (which is quite small) was free, they charge $35 just to use their lap pool. I know some hotels do this, but I'm always appalled when a hotel charges for a basic service that should be incorporated into the price you are paying for the hotel. It left a bad taste in my mouth that they would nickel and dime you for something like this when I am spending $500/night on a room, plus countless other amounts of money on food.Lastly, the Executive Lounge is on the city view side, which is surprising given the beautiful bay views on the other side of the hotel. I'm surprised why they chose to have the Executive Lounge on the far inferior side of the building. Most people staying on the Executive Floor are Diamond or Gold Hilton Honors members, and most lounges at other international Hilton chain hotels offer the best part of the hotel.So overall, it is a very nice business hotel w/ terrific staff service, but really hope they consider the perception it may have when trying to squeeze every last penny out of their guests.",elysium246,52,4.0

On the city view side, much of the view is blocked by neighboring buildings, but there are still impressive vistas to each side.The service was uniformly friendly and helpful. In particular, one concierge (Mr. Abe) tailored dining recommendations to our needs, and found us several great restaurants, including a place where we had the best sushi of our well-traveled lives. We would never have found it without his help, as it was on the sixth floor of a building on a side street of the Ginza, with only a small street sign in Japanese.

After a short wait we were escorted to a stylish, spacious room with a wonderful bathroom. We had Diamond access to the Executive Lounge which we used frequently. The views from the Lounge were great and the food and drink offerings were enjoyable and innovative. We'd seen the sights of Tokyo on previous trips so we spent the afternoon at the Hama-rikyu Garden. We loved it. I was a cold, sunny day and the free ""communicator"" device told us the whole history of the area. It was a perfect way to keep us interested and awake.

Hence you never really feel they over perform there.Maybe that's not fair to say as the stay experience is excellent - still I miss the little extra sometimes.Location is fine if you want to explore Ginza or see the fish market in the morning.

I was expecting they can do more to show some sorry, but just sorry and upgrade, nothing else.second morning i found in lobby breakfast place, many things including fried egg need addtional change, which was a suprise to me. and i checked the staff before i choose the lobby but not e floor, she told me ""both are same, lobby has even more food"", but when i finished, i found e floor has more free food, i was so confused and felt i was cheated again.third small thing is i found my room had a tooth stick on the ground, which was a little disgusting and risky if i step on it. i think it should be easy to be found by cleaning people since the stick is white and the ground is brown.other than this two unhappy episodes, the hotel is not bad, good room and good view, nice decoration and nice service. and for people taking public transportation to hotel, make sure you go Shidome station instead of Shimbashi, it takes 25 mins walk from Shimbasi to hotel.i would say it is a good hotel, but i hope it can treat its customer more sincerely and honestly",Hong Kong,2,3.0

When I saw Yumi, my favorite employee in the Exec Lounge, I wanted to hug her, but wasn't sure if it would be appropriate. No fear. She came right up to me and gave me a huge hug.That evening, the hotel housekeeping manager came looking for us and asked what he could do for us. I asked for an entire set of the Conrad bears and he promptly delivered them. Mr. McInnes, the Assistant Executive Manager, surprised us with a complimentary upgrade to an Executive Bay View Suite. I didn't want to go to bed that night as I stood mesmerized by the scene from our window. At check-out, Abe, the head concierge, came running toward us with a luggage cart. He escorted us downstairs and apologized for not being able to walk us to the train station.I can't think of a better place to spend Thanksgiving Day.

The rooms are great : spacious, great bathroom, confortable bed and all comfort you would expect in a high end hotel room.One irritating detail : to log on to the internet, you need a security code and a password. This cannot be done automatically like in most of the hotels. No, you have to call a number and then a Japanese is spelling every single character of your 8 characters security code and access code. And this for free internet !!! It is like you need to call a number to have hot water in your bathroom and that a Japanese who speaks some english tries to spell for you the access codes. Took me 20 minutes on the phone in order to ""get it right"". I remember that this was the case 10 years ago though in 2011 ???

Nice exec lounge, great room, friendly peopleAnother strange practice I want to mention is breakfast buffet on the lobby floor. I wanted some eggs and order some eggs. When you pay 3500 Yen for breakfast, you would expect that at least a scrambled egg is included ! Not at Conrad. They charge you an insane amount for every single egg you eat !!! On top of the buffet price. No doubt the most expensive breakfast I ever had....Anyway, overall very positive.

The view from the famous fish market and the beautiful historic garden just a few steps from the hotel.The other view was that the floor of the lounge was not very interesting..I loved the silence of the hotel, but it is one of the characteristics of Japan. By the way, if you want some music, they have a great bar with the same view from our room: amazing. The waiters are very polite. Ask the wasabi apetizer, but beware the price of drinks, like all the extras of the hotel..The room is spacious and very comfortable, with some electric phenomenal blinds. They offer good tea every day, with a small coffee maker..For dinner in - the 3 restaurantes - the Japanese dress well at the hotel. Be elegant as well, they appreciate.But if you prefer something simpler has several restaurants in the metro station just below the hotel and a small shopping..It's all too perfect, but consistent with the price.

The entrance is understated, at the bottom of an office tower. The lobby, on an elevated floor, exudes sophistication. The elevators and corridors are eerily quiet. The rooms are very large; the feeling of space is further reinforced by the sober and classy decoration, the bathrooms' glass partition and the high ceilings. The rooms facing Tokyo Bay enjoy unobstructed views, as does the lobby. The equipment of the rooms and bathrooms, modern and complete, participates in the general impression of luxury and superlative comfort of the hotel.

The Conrad certainly did not disappoint in displaying the distinct hospitality that is engrained in Japanese culture. The entrance of the building in which the Conrad resides does not greet you with the lobby; rather you must enter the building and make your way to the 28th(?) floor, where it all begins. The staff are very courteous, and there was never a long line, even as I stayed during the weekend. As a HHonors Diamond member, I was treated to all the upgrades available, including access to the executive floor. I stayed on the absolute highest floor, which granted me an amazing and seven view of Tokyo. The room itself did not disappoint either, with forward-looking conveniences that assure me I'm in one of the most advanced cities in the world. From the motorized curtains and easily accessible light controls, every detail of this large (for Japan) room was not overlooked. I always keep a hotel key of every hotel I've stayed at, and even the hotel key has a nice design on it!! As far as location, you are located just a short train ride, or even walk if you're up to it, from the Ginza shopping district. The Shiodome Station will grant you access to Tokyo's uber-sophisticated subway network, which I used liberally as I visited many of the wards during my 3 day stay.

At rack rate the hotel might be expensive but for what we paid it was an amazing value.Right from check in we knew we have made the decision. At check in were advised we had been upgraded to a room with a view of Tokyo bay since we were on honeymoon. We arrived at the hotel 4 hours before normal check in time and whilst we were waiting in the lobby for our room to become available we saw Lewis Hamilton (F1 driver) in the lobby getting assistance from hotel staff for his day's sightseeing - if it is good enough for Lewis it is good enough for us!The room we were allocated was fabulous. Beautiful bedroom, spacious living area, roomy closet, 2 bathrooms, 3 televisions - it was very luxurious. The view of Tokyo Bay was also tremendous. The hotel is in fantastic decorative order. Breakfast in Gordon Ramsay's brassiere was fabulous. The choice was great and once again considering how much we had paid it was great value for money. We didn't eat at any of the other restaurants but they were very tempting. The only very slight negatives about our stay are the following. First of all, the hotel bar. The bar is great and has a tremendous view, but coming from the UK where the smoking ban is in place we just didn't like the fact that the bar was a bit smoky at times. Additionally, we were disappointed that we could not enjoy the amazing pool without incurring an extra charge.Overall, I would so highly recommend the Conrad Tokyo.

Hotel is a true five-star place. Review based on a two night stay in October’11 (background of spending 80+ nights per year in different hotels around the globe)Location:Route from the nearest railway station (Shinbashi) wasn’t quite easy to discover, don’t know if there’s a better alternative but at least this one worked: using tunnels go towards Shiodome station and then follow the route to Exit 9 which leads almost directly to the hotel. We didn’t notice any Conrad signs until almost at the hotel. There are a number of shops & restaurants in the neighborhood, located in the railway/subway station and underground mall. Less than 10min walk away you can find Ginza, so also shopaholics should feel quite comfy here even though the hotel is not located right in the city centre. Hamarikyu Gardens (almost) next to the hotel is a nice place to visit. You can also catch a boat at the park going e.g. to Asakusa to see Tokyo from a different angle. And the famous Tsukiji fish market is within walking distance. Room:Received a room in the top (37th floor) with city views looking into the bunch of skyscrapers right next by. Room was large and airy with a very high ceiling, the roof was probably closer to 5m from the floor. Room had a very stylish simple, impressive décor (as in other parts of the hotel), great bathroom with separate sections for shower & toilet seat. Nice electrically controlled drapes/blinds, also including the glass wall between the room and bathroom. Apart from little noise from the railway close by the room was very quiet. Etc: Good executive lounge in 37th floor, you could just about make a meal out of offering there during the “happy hour” between 1800 and 2000 if you so wished. Also the breakfast was rather extensive, including a cook making an omelet etc.Overall there was very professional staff, knowledgeable people with eager to please. Everybody also spoke excellent English. Hotel really looks and feels like it’s been built only a couple of months ago, very fresh looking with no signs of usage anywhere.

My stay at the Conrad Tokyo was with Hilton HHonors points, and I have HH Diamond status. My overall impression of the Conrad Tokyo was positive. It is a beautiful hotel, with elegant, tranquil public areas and the modern style that characterizes Conrad properties. I booked a standard room – the basic option for HH award stays – and stayed in a city view room. It was a well designed and very attractive room, with a large bathroom (separate tub, shower, double sink vanity) with a “window” looking into the rest of the room but with blinds if privacy was desired. The Executive Lounge, to which I had access given my HH status, was very nice as well and provided food for breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening appetizers and drinks. I had breakfast and evening appetizers in the lounge, and found the offerings to be pretty good. The fitness center was nice and fairly well equipped with weight machines and cardio equipment, although I believe it was lacking one or two of the basic weight machines I use for upper body (the details about the three fitness centers at the three hotels are blurring a little at this point, but I know for sure that the Conrad Singapore was the only one that had the six weight machines that are part of my regular workout at home). The location of the hotel was good, near Ginza, right at a Tokyo metro/subway station (Shiodome), and a short walk to a JR train station (Shimbashi). Overall, service was good (I primarily interacted with staff in the Executive lounge who greeted/seated me, and they were helpful about answering questions about sightseeing directions). I am a little hesitant to point out slight negatives about the hotel, because they seem really petty, but I think that a hotel at the level (five star with $500 USD + room rates normally) of the Conrad should provide excellent amenities and service. One disappointment was the towels. I had three “bath” towels in my room, and assumed they all were the same. The towel I chose the first morning was rough, not plush, and very small (i.e., the type of towel I would expect at a low end hotel). The second day, I selected the towel that was hanging from the rack rather than folded on top of it, and this one was larger (more of a bath sheet size), but still not the quality I would expect at the Conrad. In addition, the hotel seemed to skimp on replacing bathroom amenities, and they only did turndown service one of the two nights of my stay. Finally, a couple of points that might be of interest to others with HH status:- Breakfast: For HH Diamond members, breakfast was provided in the Executive lounge only. While it certainly went above and beyond the basic expectation of a “continental” breakfast, it did not offer the range of choices available at the Hilton Osaka and Conrad Singapore, where HH Diamond members could have breakfast in the executive lounge or the restaurant, and the latter had extensive buffets.- Upgrades: This was the only hotel of the three I stayed in Japan and Singapore where I was not upgraded to a room on the Executive floor. I’m not complaining since the complimentary upgrade is an option based on availability, but I figured this might be useful information to others.Please feel free to send me a PM if there are any questions.",Maryland,118,4.0

You arrive at ground level to a beautiful minimalist lobby shared with an office building. After passng through automatic carved wood doors, a host or hostess directs you to the hotel elevators. 28 floors later you enter a double story lobby with awesome views over the city and bay. That floor includes a number of bars, lounges and restaurants and a separate elevator lobby for elevators to the upper level rooms.You exit the second elevator to what have to be the coolest hotel corridors I've encountered. Easily 400 feet long, the walls and ceiling are completely covered in dark wood panelling, room doors are recessed between softly backlit panels. Really quite well done.You enter your room and the smooth modern aesthetic continues. The walls are all dark wood, furniture is well designed and well integrated, The built in room width bench at the window was one of the more useful pieces of hotel furniture I've seen. In typical Conrad fashion, the bathroom was over the top. There's the full glass wall between the room and bathroom (with an electric privacy blind if you need it). The free standing soaking tub is great. The shower, with a ceiling mounted rain shower 10 feet up, was the best I've ever used. And yes, there's one of those hi-tech Japanese toilets too!Service was perfect as well (almost). We arrived late evening after a long flight from New Zealand and were not in the best of moods. My reservation was screwed up (only for one when in fact I was travelling with my daughter, not sure why it was wrong) and the front desk clerk was making a big deal out of it, proposing to charge some crazy sum for the second breakfast, etc. I tried to ask if we could defer this to the morning but she kept bringing it up and I was becoming a bit agitated. Finally, we were escorted to our room by a very keen gentleman, he sensed the problem (again, I was a bit agitated, not because of the proposed charge, but becasue I just wanted to deal with in the morning after some rest) and seemed to be working behind the scenes to clear it up. When the check in clerk called our room (a few minutes after we got there) to continue to tell me about the breakfast charge (at this point I was getting very agitated, I mean come on, okay, I will pay whatever, can't you just leave me alone until I get washed up and rest for a bit, I asked multiple times to just deal with it in the morning). Seeing that the clerk wouldn't stop, I requested to be upgraded ot the executive floor which inlcude a light breakfast buffet in the executive lounge (and paid the upgrade charge) so she could stop pestering me about the breakfast charge. FYI, my rate was a bed and breakfast rate, pre-paid for three nights, and though a good value by Tokyo standards, wasn't some Priceline special. My plans always inlcuded my daughter, the reservation was made on Hilton.com, I have no idea why it only showed one guest, but I know I wasn't trying to get something for nothing, it was just a mistake.Anyway, the same gentleman escorted us to our new room and presented me with vouchers for both of us to have breakfast everyday (though ironically we only used them one day). Although the check in clerk was less than great, this guy did what I expect at this kind of hotel, read the situation and quitely made it right.Once we got in and rested the rest of the stay was perfect. Location is really good, wlaking disctance to several subway stops and the Ginza area. Concierge restaurant recommendations were spot one and appreciated. Subway and taxi advice was perfect.So folks, take what you want from our less than perfect check in experience, but it all got much better, and we will stay here again the next time we're in Tokyo,","Washington, DC",51,5.0

The bathroom was also amazing. We loved it so much, we spent most of our night just hanging out in the room. Our only gripe was that you have to pay extra for everything! We tried to use the pool, there was a charge. We tried to use the wifi, there was a charge. This is a real shame as we paid around 3 times more for this room than we did for rooms in other Tokyo Hotels, which provided all of the above complimentary. I felt it was taking advantage, as the typical clientele of a hotel clearly have $$$, so wouldn't have a problem paying, but for the price of a room here (about $400 per night), you should be free to use the facilities as you please.

While the Conrad hotel is a little out of the way, it's a short walk to the train or a taxi ride to many nearby tourist attractions. My 18-month-old loved the Hamarikyu Gardens across the road from the hotel. There's a ferry that leaves from inside the gardens that takes you under all of the bridges to Asakusa, where you can visit Tokyo's famous Sensoji temple.The Imperial Palace and Gardens are a short taxi ride away and from there you can walk to the National Museum of Modern Art, which has a decent permanent collection and usually hosts pretty good exhibits.If you're an early bird, walk to the Tsukiji Fish market between 4 and 5 am and watch the morning's fish trade. The fish market is about 10 mins walk from the hotel.The Ginza shopping district is also just 10 mins walk from the hotel, so if you're into shopping, it's a great location.Most of the food at the Conrad is ridiculously overpriced but there are cheaper options in the Shiodome area, just a few minutes walk away. The other thing is that children under two years of age are not allowed to use the hotel pool. So if you've got young kids, they won't be allowed in the pool.The beds are very hard (Asian-style) but they do have a pillow menu - so you can choose a neck-supporting tempur pillow to make your sleep time a bit less jarring.The staff are friendly and helpful - the concierge printed maps for us and wrote directions for the taxi drivers in Japanese.Travelling from Narita airport, take the Narita Express (NEX) to Tokyo station and get a cab from there (it's only 10 mins in a cab). Tell the cab driver ""Conrad Hotel, Shiodome (shio-do-meh)"" and you can't go wrong. There's a bus that goes between a couple of hotels in the area and the airport, but the leaving times may not suit your schedule and traffic is often disastrous in Tokyo.

The concierge service was outstanding - they assitsted us throughout our trip, indeed even before our trip commenced.Ms. Miki Saito deserves special mention for her consistent assistance and patience. However, all staff here deserve accolades for the way they treat their guests. Miki and her colleagues were very helpful in arranging a tour guide for us. I recommend that you do what we did and take a day trip with your guide to Kamakura, the seat of the samurai - where it all started. The Conrad is an elegant modern facility with many lovely restaurants, we ate at China Blue (arranged by Ms. Saito for us). The bar is a really neat spot to sit at night and have a cocktail. The gym is well equiped and very comfortable. All in all, you can't go wrong staying here. We were saddened to hear the tragedy that befell the Japanese people and wrote to Ms. Saito to offer of thoughts and prayers. She was as polite as ever and told us that althought the building shook quite drastically (as it is no doubt designed to do) that all were unharmed and there was only minimal damage. She then expressed her gratitude for my note and said that she and the staff look forward to serving us again. If you go, you will be impressed and you will be taken care of.","Toronto, Canada",1290,5.0

Unfortunately, the return stay we were traveling the night of the 8.9 earthquake. The staff was amazing and comforting. Everyone there extremely and honestly concerned for the welfare of all the guests. Which in a large hotel I found amazing. The night of our return there was another large earthquake, out of Nagano in the scale of 7.2, it struck at around 2:00am , The hotel simply ""rolled"" although the lobby of the High rise Hotel is on the 28th Floor and our room was on the 36th floor, we were safe and sound and the staff calmed the nerves of all of the extremely concerned guests.This alone made our stay so comforting under the circumstances and I would highly recommend this finer Tokyo Conrad Hilton as one of the most elegant and prepared and Hospitable of Japanese Staff.","Glendale, California",10,5.0

If people think the service is good at the Conrad during the best of times, service is even better during the worse of times.My husband and I were in Ginza during the quake and walked back to the hotel shortly thereafter when we found that the hotel had shut down the elevators as a precaution. (For those unfamiliar with the hotel, the reception is on the 28th floor and the gym/spa/pool is on the 29th floor. Rooms are on the 30-37 floors.) There is a bell captain desk on the main floor where someone will direct you to the elevator that takes you up to the 28th floor check-in area.As we waited in the main floor lobby, more and more people returned to the hotel. Soon the staff brought chairs for us. Then the staff brought coffee, and finally the staff brought blankets because it was chilly in the lobby. When the blankets ran out, one staff member took off her own coat and offered it to a guest.The staff working at the desk were constantly busy fielding questions. After over two hours when no other guest was at the desk, I approached and asked if someone could email my son to let him know that we were safe. A staff member did so immediately. Throughout the long wait, everyone remained calm and patient - primarily because the Conrad staff were so soothing and reassuring. When we were finally able to get on the elevators, everyone did so orderly. A staff member would signal to a few guests and invite them to follow him. Then he would signal the next group.We spent three nights at the Conrad before deciding to abort our trip and return home. During our stay, the service was impeccable. Some staff couldn't go home because the subways/trains were not working, and so they stayed at the hotel. Since other staff couldn't come to the hotel, the staff on site worked overtime and did double/triple shifts. One lady in the Executive Lounge told me that she worked 30 hours straight. When I complimented her on her patience and helpfulness, she said she was only doing her job and that her main concern was for the guests to have a good experience at the Conrad.We spent the entire day after the earthquake at the hotel. My husband didn't want to leave the hotel in case the elevators were shut down again, but that didn't happen. We made the most of that day by having breakfast in the Exec Lounge (wonderful spread), by eating lunch at the hotel's Gordon Ramsay restaurant, and by enjoying the pool/spa. We also spent quite a bit of time in the Exec Lounge in the evening eating delicious hors d'oeuvres and drinking sparkling wine. Life was never so decadent. The only thing that the hotel did differently during this disaster was to suspend turndown service, which did not adversely impact the guests. At check-out, the Executive Assistant Manager came to say goodbye and we reassured him that we had an excellent stay. We also told him that we will be back soon to finish the trip that ended too soon.","Coralville, Iowa",275,5.0

Guest check-in was efficient and welcoming. Because husband is Hilton Diamond, we were upgraded to what the hotel refers to as a 'baby suite.' It was huge, and afforded us a view of Tokyo Bay.

Just behind the hotel is a lovely, historic garden leading to the water bus and a ride under the bridges spanning the Sumida River, up toward the Senso-ji Temple and Kappabashi.

Unlike bigger, busier hotels, it was nice walking through the lobby of the hotel which was very calm and taking lifts which were very quick. I am usually very fussy about water pressure in hotels but the Conrad had a rain shower as well as a hand shower with strong pressure. It was great. The shower tiles were noticeably tired and old and not sparkling, but everything else was in good order. It took a while working out how to use the iron which is cordless and had all instructions and button labels in Japanese.However, I was most impressed by the service we received from the hotel receptionist. When we checked in, I asked her whether she could ring BIC Camera for me to find out if a newly-released Canon lens was available (I asked because I could not speak in Japanese). The lens, as I feared, was not available and I thanked her and went to my room. Later, I got a phone call from the receptionist to tell me where I could get the lens as she tried ringing a few more stores and had tracked a camera store close to where we were going that day. She gave me a map and precise instructions on how to get there and she had reserved the lens for me at the store. The hotel receptionist was also very helpful in booking the airport limousine for us and going to the trouble of finding out which terminal we had to go to.

Which directs to the large-scale difficulty, the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant: The food is really attractive good. However beware because, the services is very, very slow.The waiting employees try to proceed courteous, but actually need attentiveness. When we had midday meal there, we organized their suggested techniques, but our completed plates were left on the table for over 10 minutes, dessert took 30 minutes to reach, and another 20 minutes for coffee. This is improper in a engaged town like Tokyo where visitors would like to relish the air, but not spend the entire after noon there. (We had to hold up an significant designation afterward.) But, the genuine murdered was that throughout our midday meal, the waiting employees were exceedingly courteous and punctual to their OWN hotel employees - as we observed a supervisor of the Hotel who was dining some ally, reach subsequent, obtain better service and complete consuming much previous than we did!I realize that the waiting employees would like to embark the good edge of their overseer, but this should not occur at the total cost of other visitors getting hold ups in their service.I address that improper and this actually antagonize us.

It's now hands-down my favorite hotel in Tokyo, after having stayed at the Peninsula several times, along with the Park Hyatt, Four Seasons Chinzan-so, Grand Hyatt and the Imperial. The location is surprisingly convenient, only a few minutes walk (all under cover, with escalators) from the JR lines and Ginza- & Oedo-line subways, and very easy to get to from both Narita & Haneda Airports. There are many decent and inexpensive restaurants of all types nearby. The rooms aren't as over-the-top as the Peninsula, but they're very comfortable. It's worth the extra money for an Ocean-view room - the view is stunning from that side of the hotel, but the City view is pretty dull.The best part about the hotel, though, is the service. From the moment we arrived - with the youngest of us in tears from the long journey - the staff outdid themselves with kindness and thoughtfulness. One of the staff brought our crying one a Conrad teddy bear to soothe her during the check-in process, and a nice crib and baby bath - complete with a baby amenity kit including baby shampoo and lotion - arrived soon after we got to our room. Service in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant for breakfast was also outstanding, with multiple requests for very strong coffee (again necessitated by the youngest of our group) always were met with a gracious smile.

Plenty of room for 2 adults and 3 teenage children. Enjoyed the location as it was close enough to walk Shimbashi Station which connected you everywhere else. (Note the closer Shiodome Station is nearly useless except to go out to Odaiba for entertainment.)Did want to note that we had to pay an extra 5,000 yen a night for a rollaway bed for the fifth person. Not bad considering many places wouldn't even take a family of five. However, I also opted for the Executive Floor upgrade as it included free breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails for 5,000 yen a night. Only after paying this did they inform me that it would only be good for two of us -- that the children would need to pay 2,500 yen each for breakfast! (That's about $30 US dollars each!) If I had known that, I would have never upgraded. When I called the front desk to ask to allow the kids in for free or at a reduced rate, or then to have my money back, they simply said ""no."" That was quite frustrating. My husband and I did leave the kids in the room to eat our expensive breakfast which was quite good (mostly Western style buffet). There wasn't much else available nearby for breakfast except a bakery in the mall area below the hotel.

We always choose the non-executive suite option with breakfast in the main restaurant because the suites have always been phenomenal when they are available and the ""continental"" breakfast is excellent with a ton of options (american/british, japanese, and chinese options) and a very reasonable buy up to the hot entrees. The rooms are modern and clean-lined, spacious, equiped with great electronics, and have fantastic bathrooms (yes with the great Japanese toilets with all the gadgets).The one area that I give a little lower score to the hotel is on location. Its not directly in any of the evening hot spots in Tokyo - although only a 10 minute walk to Ginza, a 3-5 minute walk to the nearest subway station (Shiodome), and a 7-10 minute walk to the nearest train station (Shimbashi). At the same time for easy, clean, close and reasonable food when we are dead tired at the end of day of walking / sightseeing we just walk 3-5 minutes to the buildings / mall areas along the subway/train stations.Also really enjoy the good gym/fitness center, pool, and spa. And beyond all of this - the service is fantastic even for Japan (and that is saying a lot given the extremely customer/service friendly nature and focus of Japan).

We thought we needed a short break after having to look after a new born and stress we had. It was the best and most relaxing stay ever, and could not ask for more!We normally stayed in 5 star hotel as I am always particular about cleanliness and service. The hotel itself look very classy and the interior design of the hotel makes people feel really relax and warm.The actual room itself was huge considering Tokyo is a very expensive city , we stayed on a high floor and the view was magnificent looking over the garden and water as well. We were provided with baby cot and baby towels, blankets and bath toy as well… not to mention the bed-linen were super soft which I never doubt.Bathroom, big and spacious, super clean , again I never get disappointed with Conrad.Travelling with a baby is hard especially having a difficult one. The curtains in the room can block out the sun completely. My baby slept through the night every night, he woke up everyday around 8am or after we woke up which was a bonus, I truly believe it was highly due to the room was dark enough and quiet enough to give him pleasant sleep, which helped us a lot especially on holidays.The service was superb on top of the natural Japanese culture, going to places was easy as the hotel was located in Shiodome there’s station nearbyI highly recommend people who travel with a baby or young ones, sometimes it’s not bad to pick a hotel near business district in a busy city.

I decided to try it out for one night during my recent vacation to Tokyo. ArrivingThe arrival experience at Conrad Tokyo is one of the best I have encountered so far. I arrived by taxi and my luggage was taken care of and a hotel staff in suit escorted me in for check-in. The arrival hall entrance has a stunning contemporary look with a modern two piece artwork that grace the arrival hall. But that is not the lobby. There is a pathway that leads to the lift lobby that goes to the 28th floor where the main hotel lobby is. Along the way, soothing music and cozy but warm lighting. All so contemporary and so “Zen”. On arriving at the actual lobby, a vast expanse of space greeted me. The lobby is again cutting edge contemporary with a soaring ceiling and full height windows that showcase the Tokyo bay view. Certainly one of the most impressive I have seen. It looks even better at night. Check-in was quick as the staff already have my details on hand. Although I booked city view room, I requested for an upgrade to Bay View room which the staff obliged but I have to wait until 4PM since the room was still occupied at time of check-in. Not a problem since I can use the city view room first. Internet access is free for Hilton Honors Gold members. The RoomMy first room is the city view room which faced the Shidome area. It’s frankly not a very nice view as it just face the opposite office tower in close proximity. Afterwards, I changed to a Bay View room and the view is much better since it face the Tokyo bay. The Bay view room also feels bigger. However, both views disappoints in the evening. It wasn’t as impressive as those in Mandarin Oriental and Ritz Carlton which I think along with Park Hyatt boast the best views in Tokyo. After the stunning contemporary lobby, the room décor and design is comparably underwhelming. For a design driven hotel, the room design is decidedly conservative as it adopts the basic 3-phase design, ie room, working areas, bathroom. The bathroom is one of those open-concept bathroom although with privacy blinds. The only “innovative” feature will be the long sofa bed at the large windows and was made to have a verandah look. Room furniture and fittings are of high quality though. Room amenities are generally well hidden in neat boxes and in cabinets to give the room an uncluttered feel. The bed is on the hard side for me but linens are of good but not exactly top quality. There is a 37” plasma TV and DVD player. The room doesn’t have 220volts power supply so the housekeeping to bring me a transformer. The rather small round written desk is not really conducive for working. WiFi is available but getting a connection is cumbersome. You need to get a card from the frontdesk and have to key in WEP keys and a passcode. After the hassle of getting connected, the speed is good though. The bathroom is an ensuite with two basins, a standing bathtub, a shower cubicle with rainforest shower and a toilet cubicle. The shower cubicle has good water pressure. Toiletries are Acca Kappa which seems to be the standard in Conrad nowadays. The bathroom is not as lavish as the best I have seen but functional nevertheless. Common Areas and location.As mentioned earlier, the Conrad Tokyo has one of the best looking hotel lobby I have seen. The other areas around the hotel looks just as impressive. There is a nice pool on the 29th floor with nice view of Tokyo. There is also a spa and a small gym. There are four restaurants including a Japanese, a Chinese and a fine dinning Gordon Ramsey restaurant. I didn’t tried any of the restaurant because the price doesn’t look like good value to me. The hotel location is not ideal. It’s located inside an office tower in Shidome, which is a business district. There is basically nothing to explore around that area without walking a distance. Subway is connected by underground walkway but is quite a bit of walking distance to the nearest Shimbashi station. Fortunately, there are a few nice restaurants in an adjacent office building which serve great sushi and other Japanese food. Executive LoungeSince I booked an Executive Room, my room rate include club lounge access. ( It’s about Yen8000 extra from basic room rate ). The club lounge is small but doesn’t feel so because of it’s clever and efficient use of space. It’s a cozy and restful place. Non-alcoholic drinks are served all day and the lounge serve buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktail. Depending whether one can consume a lot of wine, the club lounge may or may not be a good value. Food portions except breakfast are all small, bite-size type, but they do serve a good selection of alcoholic drinks including free flowing champagne. Service The service at Conrad is not exactly speedy or efficient. After checked-in, I went out to have lunch and after I’m back an hour later, my luggage bag was still not delivered. I eventually picked it up from the front desk on the way back to my room. The Phone calls to the service centre goes unanswered several times. The staff at Executive Lounge will fetch drinks but seems to bulk at more complicated request. I was asking a lady staff at the lounge to follow up on my room change and perhaps it’s a language problem, she either didn’t understand me or forgotten about it. Generally, most service calls need a bit of waiting but otherwise it’s fine and most of the staff seems to be aware of the slow response and apologize profusely when it happened. ConclusionThe Conrad as a chain is not exactly high end luxury like the big names but it’s a reliable medium tier luxury brand. Across the chain, it’s generally consistent and most of time, a good value. The Conrad Tokyo has impressive common areas but the room is a bit underwhelming. I have a pleasant though not outstanding stay and will rate it 4/5.",JAKARTA,774,4.0

Service was pleasant and efficient. It was not over-the-top as in some Asian hotels, but that over-the-top sort of service that sometimes borders on obsequious bothers me anyway. I would rather have staff do what they are supposed to do and do it well, as at the Conrad, than kiss my butt. If you need overly fawning service you may wish to look elsewhere.The staff at the concierge desk were extremely helpful, even helping us find us a little hole-in-the-wall karaoke bar in the Shimbashi that became a highlight (if not THE highlight) of our visit to Tokyo. The people at that bar (all Japanese) were among the friendliest we have met anywhere in the world - and we would never have found this place without the help of the Conrad staff - and I imagine the concierge at the Conrad is seldom asked about karaoke bars in the Shimbashi so that made his work even more impressive.Much has been written on TA about the location. I thought it was excellent myself, in a business area within walking distance of the Ginza and Shimbashi but sort of a quiet oasis at night away from all the lights and noise. It is steps away from the Shiadome subway station and maybe a 10-15 minute underground or elevated walk to the JR station at Shimbashi, with plenty of retail and restaurants on the walk. Also, it is a fairly short and cheap (for Tokyo) cab ride from Tokyo station. The rooms were clean (of course) and very comfortable. We were on the executive level, and the included breakfast (pretty much exclusively Western selections) on that level was very good. One issue with the room was that the bathroom had a huge window that looked into the room (I assume to allow light from outside) - although wc was separate. I didn't like that, although my wife didn't mind. If you are a light sleeper as I am, you may find the array of electronic lights distracting - because with the automated blinds down the room is dark as a cave and any LED light will stand out, including those lighting up the bathroom, even with the bathroom shade down. I just tried to cover up what I could. Also, there isn't much to choose from on TV, except for the pay movies - they should have a few more of the common UK and American cable channels. Other than those small issues the room was excellent.We ate at the Chinese restaurant at the hotel for an anniversary dinner our last night in Tokyo and it was a great experience. Pricey, no doubt, but this is Tokyo. The food was very good, the space was beautiful and the view outstanding. Service was excellent. It was a nice splurge. The lobby bar had the same outstanding view. It may be 25 USD for a juice and a beer, but I suppose you get what you pay for.Of course this hotel is designed more with the business traveler in mind, and sometimes we felt a little out-of-place coming back and walking through the lobbies in shorts and sweating after a day of sightseeing in the heat, but we were not the only holiday-goers at the hotel. We may, however, have been the only ones who were hoofing it to the Shimbashi station every morning to use our JR rail passes.Overall a great experience - location, service, rooms and food all top-notch in my opinion.",Houston,34,5.0

Its service is merely business class, however.The hotel is located about 5 minutes walk on elevated walkways from the nearest JR station; there is also a subway station accessible without going outside, although it is somewhat hard to find the first time.Being in a newly developed area, there are mostly impressive brand new office buildings nearby, but very little street life. For tourists wishing to visit the Tsukiji fish market, it is only 10 minutes walk away.This hotel occupies the top floors of an office building, as usual for many newer Asian city hotels. The garden view rooms have a highly desirable view of not only the gardens, but of Tokyo Bay beyond them.All rooms boast top-notch construction, materials, decor, and attention to detail, such as highly effective triple-glazed panoramic windows, electric blinds, non-slip shower stall tiles, bonsai in entrance, cordless iron with a cute matching legless mini-ironing board, subtle Japanese theme on carpet carried onto the wall decoration, etc., easily a match for 50% expensive hotels. Nowhere is the any sign corners were cut or expense spared. The rooms are very spacious as well.I was slightly disappointed by the front desk, which made no mention of breakfast/lounge access even when entitled to them. The lounge was definitely not worthy of the rest of the hotel, with a paltry selection of cold mini-snacks during the day, worse than even a mid-priced Hilton in Europe. Bell staff was not proactive, but to their discharge they have a difficult task distinguishing hotel guests from the many locals using the Conrad as an upscale tea house or bar.",Athens,17,5.0

It was worth it as the rooms were enormous and happily accommodated the three of us. Not many Asian hotel rooms fit a roll away bed in and give you room to move. The Hilton in Sydney doesn't fit the bed in and walking space at all!The service was lovely. We only ate breakfast in the hotel, but went to local restaurants for dinner - partly due to price at the Conrad and partly for the sort of food our daugher would eat. Cerise (the Gordon Ramsey restaurant) was the only one with choices for children, and though our daugher likes chicken and rice, both were fancied up so much at the in-house Japanese and Chinese restaurants we knew she would not eat them. The local choices were quite good though - and plentiful - and cheap! A cappuccino at the Conrad was AUD$20. We headed out the door, turned right, and got a coffee at the local Starbucks for a portion of the price.The hotel is definitely for business travellers, but the staff were delightful to our very well behaved and well travelled daughter. Hiromi at Cerise at breakfast rushed after us to give Claire a hug goodbye on the day we left. And you have to like a hotel which will provide your child with rice and hash browns for breakfast on a special plate and in the volume she asked for. Very personal service of a high standard.We would go back, though the location was a bit isolated unless you caught the train. I might like to check out the Hyatt at Rappongi next time for a comparison. It was stinking hot and very humid when we were there - so next time we'll choose a cooler time of year.","Adelaide, Australia",82,5.0

I love its extremely modern deco, unbeatable view of the Tokyo bay (if you get a bay-view room), large-than-standard room footage and luxury bathroom.

Based on my comparison of Conrad with other five-star hotels in the area including Ritz and Hyatt, Conrad’s rooms are much more spacious and newer.

I have been travelling and staying on and off there for the last 3 years, at least two times a year of not more. I have to say that the overall quality is slowly drifting from great to good and now going to average. The rooms are still great, no doubt about that (they did not shrink over time!) but the overall athmosphere and experience is somewhat not as good. Service, that was before second to none, is getting more and more relaxed (in a bad way), quality of the rooms and welcoming experience is not the same (used to have fruits and chocolates, then chocolates, then ice cubes?!). Its those little ""je ne sais quoi"" that are slowly but certainly vanishing making a great experience become a common one. The best example for this is what happenned when I checked in: I always had a king size bed, but this time I was told there was no king size bed room available and that if I wanted one I could pay 9000JPY extr to get a suite (?), or I could stay the first night in a king size bedroom but would have to move in a queen size the following day... What kind of luxury service is that? No real effort was made to accomodate, I was simply turned down, period. Dont get me wrong, the hotel is still certainly one of the best in the area, rooms are nice and very ""zen"", view is outstanding and location is near to perfection but the value for money is not going the right direction, especially in an environment where competition is catching up and even in some cases getting better.

When we first arrived with all our luggage, we were greeted by several people who helped us with our luggage. The lobby area, reachable by their elevators, is immaculate and stylish. There's a bar right across from the front desk area with a fantastic view of the Tokyo Bay and an amazing Martini called the James Bond which I recommend (It's blue curacao, champagne... I forget the other ingredients, but it comes with strawberry slices on a toothpick, and it's probably the best Martini I've ever had)The rooms are modern and comfortable. Both times we stayed there, we didn't get a particularly fantastic view, but it was still a great view out over the cityscape. We had a room with two beds that were really comfortable, the rollaway was also comfortable as well considering. The room had a nice HDTV with a DVD player hooked up to it (The first time I stayed, I bought a CD and it played throughout the entire room including the bathroom). The bathroom is in a seperate type room, with a glass wall that has shutters that have controls by the bed. The shower is amazing; it's an overhead waterfall of pure relaxation.The location for the hotel is a bit of a downside. It's in Minato-Ku, and there's an underground walking area that will take you to the subway or the JR line, but compared another hotel I stayed at in Tokyo (Hilton Shinjuku), I would say that hotel has a better location. However, there's several stores close by the Conrad (A bookstore, and a string of restaurants in a building VERY close by) which are perfect for a winding down day where you don't want to travel too far.The only other complaint is kind of self inflicted, as the price can be crazy expensive. We stayed during winter and went to one of the restaurants (The Gorden Ramsey) and while we were expecting to spend a bit, it turned out to $250 a plate for the five course meal. Not that it wasn't good, but people that don't want to splurge should definitely avoid their restaurants. The staff there are all friendly, including their manager. The first time we stayed, he came out to greet us personally, though I don't think he remembered us the second time. Still, everybody was friendly, professional and gave us great directions to some places for Karaoke as well as food. (Recommend Jonathan's which is kind similar to Denny's but a bit better.)I didn't get a chance to use their gym, but I did use their pool which was... Just amazing. I don't even know how to describe it besides it's amazing. Look it up sometime, it's an overflow that just looks so scenic in all the pictures. There's helpful staff everywhere even for the pool area.Overall, this is definitely one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in my entire life.

There are two subway stops - Shiodome and Shimbashi - Shimbashi is extremely convenient to get to anywhere in Tokyo.

The view of Tokyo Bay and the Rainbow Bridge is mesmoriizing. The staff was fantastic, elegant and efficient in that particularly Japanese way. There is something less abrasive and a little less corporate feeling about the Conrad Hotels than say Ritz-Carltons or Four Seasons. Well, to be fair, I have only stayed at two of them now (Singapore and Tokyo) but both of these hotels seems a little less up in your face, less prentitous. There is a Gordon Ramsey restraunt that I did not get the chance to try but would like to. The gym was nice and had a pool.

Comprising the upper floors of a office tower in the Shiodome district of Tokyo, the hotel has modern furnishings and impeccable customer service.The rooms are bright, airy, and well-stocked. Rooms with a ""City View"" look at a standard tokyo commercial downtown. It's nothing special, and you're basically looking in peoples' offices. ""Bay View"" rooms have a decent view of the Tokyo Bay, as well as the public gardens area. My room came with full luxury finishes, including a beautiful standalone bath, a shower stall, the standard Japanese toilet, luxury bath products and toiletries, and the Conrad rubber duckie.The entire hotel has dark, wooden tones, clean lines, and open spaces. The restaurants look fairly decent -- I spent a couple of evenings in their lounge/bar that overlooks the bay, and often has live music.The spa and fitness facilities are awesome. The pool has a cost (unless you're HHonors Diamond), but with a beautiful view of the city, the 25-m pool is spectacular. But even if you don't go to the pool, the complimentary fitness facilities have wonderful saunas, whirlpools, and fitness equipment.Yes, the hotel is a short 5-10 minute walk from the Tsukiji Fish Market, but make sure that you get directions from the concierge beforehand -- it's a little tricky, and you have to walk past a couple of underpasses. For that same reason, I wouldn't take the Metro *to* the hotel for the first time -- the Shiodome commercial district could get confusing. I'd take an Airport Limo Bus directly to the Conrad, or a taxi from Tokyo Station, with a japanese map (you can print a map off the Conrad Tokyo website). That said, once you get your bearings, it's pretty straightforward to take the subway around Tokyo. Shimbashi station is even relatively closeby (~10 minutes), for the JR Yamanote Line. Note again that the hotel is in the commercial office district -- the neighbourhood gets pretty slow in the evening. This makes for a quiet area around the hotel, but also means that you should head to Ginza or Shinjuku if you're looking for nightlife or restaurants.All that said, I had an exceptional time at this hotel.

Rooms are very high tech and have electronically controlled blinds, drapes, and a bathroom shade that allows you to adjust the level light/privacy desired in the bathroom.Staff was very friendly throughout the entire stay, however we did have some trouble obtaining information about the Yasukuni Shrine after asking both the Executive lounge concierge and front desk.

Wonderful morning breakfast, cocktails, and evening cordials are served. Breakfast spread was incredible-smoked salmon, made to order eggs, fresh berries, muesli, fine cheeses, fresh juices, espresso beverages, etc.Fitness center had modern Technogym cardio equipment equipped with integrated TVs along with free weights and combination units.

We didn't go to the (small) gym but it looked nice and well equipped. We didn't try the Spa because of the price (around 200 euros for a basic massage...).Everywhere you go in this hotel, you feel at ease, in a high quality environment.The lounge is cosy with an interesting view (still we would have prefered a view on the Tokyo Bay.... May be this lounge is a little bit small for the number of customers... When the lounge is busy, you seat like in a French cafe in Paris, e.g. very close to one another. Compared with lounges you can enjoy in other 5 star hotels, there may be something to do there.The breakfast in the lounge is very good: high quality and large choice (fresh fruits are delicious, you can have Nespresso coffee, etc.). We didn't try the afternoon tea but we noticed that fruits were not available at that time (no apple, no...only small bananas).The evening snacks are also of a very good quality with a large choice of beverage, wine and alcool. Still, we think the evening service has slightly decreased since our last stay in 2008. We remember more choice at that time (there was at least a meal) and may be more like a ""small dinner"". Still, this time, we enjoyed some Japanese specialities there.The room was very nice and very well equipped (we were upgraded).There is a shuttle bus from the hotel to Narita airport.

As a city resort this hotel is top notch. The rooms are opulent. They are large and very bright. The bed is comfortable. The showroom bathrooms are grandiose and really are the main draw-card (just watch the toe-stub danger on the raised platform for the bath). Room service menu is diverse and the food is extremely fresh. Service is impeccable and every need is catered to without questioning. The lobby bar/lounge is worth checking out - try and get a seat by the fire on a cold evening. The views over the Hama Rikyu Gardens to the airport are quite unique and breathtaking.Overall highly recommended if you are looking for a city resort experience. However I would not stay at the Conrad when on business for the following 2 reasons: (1) the 'work desk' is impossible to use. A round table puts everything (PC, phone, notes and so on) out of reach by the nature of its shape. Combined with the awkward shape, a high table with a low seat is not the smartest matching for hotel room furniture. (2) The location isn't necessarily convenient for either taxi or subway users unless your activity zone is in the Tokyo station / Ginza area, or you have plenty of time on your hands and an unlimited taxi expense account.

Both times my stay was paid for by HHonors Points and both times I felt immensely privileged to stay in such a marvelous place. Can only amplify another reviewer's statement that I simply wanted to move in and live here. Last year I moved from the Park Hotel next door (highly recommended for the excellent price-quality ratio) and was stunned at the sheer size of the room after the customary tiny rooms that I had experienced in Japan.Had a bay view room in 2008 and city view this time round. Both rooms are equal in all respects with regard to layout, design, etc., but the bay room certainly has my preference for the stunning day and night views across Tokyo Bay, right to Odaiba.The very high JPY 2,500 daily charge for the swimming pool was waived due to HHonors membership, which we only discovered when my partner went to the pool (I would advise the hotel to inform guests of HHonors benefits when checking in). My partner had a swim at sunrise and shared the pool for a few minutes only with another guest and found the pool the most stunning ever, possibly only equalled by the pool at the JW Marriott in the Jin-Mao tower in Shanghai. Partner's comment: even if the daily rate was paid for the pool it would have been well worth it.Whereas the hotel stands head and shoulders above most of the other 5-star hotels I have stayed in before, some nice touches I noticed in 2008 seemed to have disappeared, added to which some small glitches appeared in what for the rest was excellent service:- no welcome fruit/snack upon arrival as was the case in 2008;- the staff member who escorted us to our room asked about 4 or 5 times whether we had further questions (we repeatedly answered no), until we realized he was clearly fishing for a tip - this left us very uncomfortable and highly confused as other staff members had consistently refused tips, once or twice citing the Japanese custom not to give tips;- the specially-for-Conrad Shiseido toiletries had been replaced by perfectly good quality but less nice Acca Kappa products;- the person receiving guests in the lounge made us feel very unwelcome and highly uncomfortable for not ordering a drink while enjoying the view of the bay for only a few seconds, even though we had indicated we only wanted a quick look in an area where drink orders are not compulsory (I checked this beforehand! there was not a single other person in the lounge and given our attire and arms full of shopping bags we clearly were on our way to our room); we did not sit down and had not intention to do so, instead only standing at the windows for no more than about 10 seconds;- was surprised to learn hotel is only 4 years old as both last year's and this year's rooms showed some serious wear and tear; numerous scuff marks, damage to furniture, many stains on woodwork, cracked tiles, etc.; this was more than compensated for by excellent design and very high quality furniture, e.g. Eames desk chair that is rarely seen and never in hotels.For every glitch I can possibly list a dozen good points, so on balance the Conrad rates tops in my book. One good example: in 2008 I left my luggage at the hotel while traveling to Kyoto for 4 days and found the hotel perfectly willing to store my bulky luggage free of charge for up to 3 weeks. As indicated already, the stay was free given that it was paid for by HHonors points, but I definitely will return as a paying guest, hopefully in the very near future as I am willing to pay seriously for such luxury and comfort.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands",64,5.0

We went with the lounge access and did not regret it. The executive lounge is the best lounge we have ever seen. The breakfast, happy hour, and after dinner deserts were all absolutely amazing.The location of the hotel is very convenient.

Other than the Shiodome station of the Yurikamome line (monorail to Odaiba) is within 5 mins. I got lost just by going to Cretta the building next door that took me 45mins to get backThe breakfast was great,with sufficent choices, you can only choose one from the hot dishes (e.g. egg, or pancakes) cook to order. some breakfast rate may even hv to charge you for additional for Egg Benedicts,which many posters commented. Mmm, I found it ok, not stunning.Dinner at Gordon Ramsay was a bit disappointing.The most disappointing is the concierge, it is unheard of concierge opens at 10am everyday, on a Sunday, 1030am, the conicerge desk is still unmanned and the concierge service can't match with their sister Tokyo Hilton. The concerige at Conrad is tardy and without initiative to walk that extra mile. The lounge on 28th floor can be busy at weekend, it is a nice place to chill out for a drink.If you can pocket more Yen for a stay or with a corporate rate, a great hotel.

Building is virtually right above the Oedo Line subway, so convenient to that line, and a short walk to many other lines at Shimbashi station. Shiodome area is very nice, modern, and new, though not really ""happening"". It is however, a short walk to Tsukiji for excellent quality and relatively cheap sushi, a leisurely stroll to Ginza or Yurakucho, and has a stop on the Yurikamonme, which will take you to Odaiba, for shopping or the big Oedo Monogatari onsen.Enter at the lower lobby on ground level and then need to take elevators to upper lobby on the 28th floor. Overall design is modern and contemporary. Service is excellent overall, though not all the staff speak English very well... so it helps if you can speak a little bit of Japanese. There are several restaurants, though all are a little bit expensive (dinner sets are around US$100+ or so per person, excluding alcohol), but that is par for nicer Japanese restaurants. The lobby lounge is a bit of a hotspot and popular meeting place.The pool, gym, and spa on the 29th floor is well equiped. Pool is probably about 25 meters long, with a nice view over the area. Spa/locker room includes sauna, steam room, as well as a few mini-whirlpool tubs (though not onsen).Rooms are very spacious. Bay view is much better and more open than city view, which is rather confined/enclosed by the neighboring buildings. The window spans the entire exterior wall, and there is a large full length sofa. Large LCD TV is of good quality, but very limited foreign programming. Aside from pay movies, there were only 2 foreign channels (both English language), BBC and CNN. They didn't even have CNBC. Bed is very comfortable, and there is a large round table (like a dinette table), but the chair is a bit too low, though good for lounging, but not good for sitting to do work. Furnishings overall are very contemporary classy and well maintained.The bathroom is also very large and clean with marble walls and floors, separate tub and shower stall. Toilet is typical Japanese style Toto brand with the fancy seat including all the functions. Double vessel-style sinks, but they are shallow, so water splashes everywhere. There is a slightly raised part of the floor near the tub, which is very annoying because I kept banging my toes into it, since you don't really notice that it is actually raised. Toiletries are decent, Acca Pacca brand, but towels are a litlte thin.My only complaint is with the internet service. I stayed for a week, but the 1st 2 days there were many problems with the internet connection. On the 2nd day, the internet did not work at all, and I informed the staff about this at midnight. They said they would send a technician up in 15 minutes. I waited 40 minutes, no one came... I called down, and they said they would be there soon, like another 10 minutes, but since it was late and I wanted to sleep, I told them to forget it for today. However, I was irked that I waited so long, and they did not call up or apologize for the long delay.","Beverly Hills, California",82,5.0

Example: After a long day of walking around tokyo, i liked to come back to the hotel, pour a glass of scotch (on ice) and sit in the tub. The first night i called and asked how to get ice and they said ""no ice machine, we'll bring some up for you"" and it came in about 3 minutes. The next night, i called again and it came up right away. After that, every night i got back to the room, they had already brought ice without me calling. I found that very impressive.The rooms are huge (for tokyo) and beautiful. Great views, As others have said, the bay view is stunning, the city view is just of buildings, but still not bad. The bar is very nice (they even charge a cover for non hotel guests on fri/sat) as theres an amazing view, but drinks are rather expensive. A beer is 1300 yen (approx 13 dollars). The cocktails are some of the best i've ever had, but about 2000 yen each. The location is both good and bad. The good is you can walk to the fish market in about 10 minutes and the JR yamanote line (which does a loop around tokyo) is only about a 10 minute walk (use the undeground walkway, it took me about 3 days to figure out thats the easy way to get there, not on the sky-sidewalk things that are outside). The bad is the immediate are is a lot of office buildings, a not a lot to do right outside the hotel.I spoke with some people who live in Tokyo and they all said that this is in the running for nicest hotel in Tokyo, along with Park Hyatt. I would agree. 5* all the way. It is quite expensive, however.

This was one of the best hotels we ever stayed at. Some points worth mentoning:1. Great location - 10-15 min walk to/from Ginza; 1,250 Yen cab ride to Tokyo station (Bullet train to Kyoto or other places) or Roppongi (night life and nice to walk around).2. Awesome rooms - Very spacious for any expensive city and especially for Tokyo. Try to book the garden/bay view room. We stayed in this and before this a city view which faced another sky scrapper accross the street and did not have much of a view (still a nice room but the bay view rooms have fantastic views);3. Executive lounge - If you are Gold or Diamon on Hilton, it is free (not sure if you can pay more and book a rate with access). Fantastic - Full American BF, Afternoon tea (3-5 PM), evening drinks (6 to 8 PM) with light fare and beverages from 6 AM to 10 PM. The best executive lounge i have been to.4. Concierge - Excellent recommendation and took care of dining reservations. Upon check-in provided us a package with reservations, brochure of each restaurant, map to each restaurant to be provided to taxi driver, several cards for hotel to be provided to taxi drivers to come back to the hotel (as it is not the best known hotel)5. China Blue restaurant - We had a dinner here. 2 Adults with beer was 20K yen. So worth it.....one of our best meals in Japan (food, quality, service, ambience etc.)6. In the previous review some one mentioned about the Conrad teddy - We had the same issue - I called to ask for more for my one year old. In the conversation, I was told they provide one per person (kept on the bed) when you check-in. They asked how many of us were there and how many were on the bed. They apologized that they hadn't kept enough and immediately sent more - my daughter really liked them.7. In general, we found the service to be very warm and fantastic.8. Pool - Beautiful pool for doing laps. They do have certain policies about not allowing kids under certain age (i think it was 5 Yrs) and times for kids older than that. This may seem unfair to those with kids but lot of the people staying here did not seem to be with kids and I am sure they appreciate the policy (the pool is long but narrow).9. The hotel can seem expensive but make sure you try to get a corporate rate and factor in the cost savings from free full BF and evening drinks as well as bottled water (if you get access to Executive lounge), great location (see above) etc. To us that easily saved US$100 at least each day and likely more.",San Jose,5,5.0

When I called the Star Service line for a doctor, a nurse whom was unable to speak English was despatched, 15 mins later. The nurse was incompetent. She proceeded to use a huge amount of 70 alcoholic (isopropyl alcohol; read TOXICOLOGY in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropyl_alcohol) near the mouth in which I reminded her not to get any in the mouth as it was not for consumption but for cleaning exterior wounds. She did not listen & ignored me, I had to manually stop her. Then she placed a plaster on my daughter's gashes but because it was not positioned correctly she tore it off and replasted it again. TWICE!! My daughter's wounds were torn opened & blood gushed out. She was screaming. An English speaking Japanese lady staff then came by. I thought initially she was to help translate but turned out she was more concerned with whether my daughter's blood had soiled the sheets or anything was dirtied, or soiled. Not really that bothered nor concered with my daugther's situation but just constantly on some sort of walkie talkie/mobile to someone else. I requested for an English speaking Paediatrician, without much thought she ""recommends"" me a hospital to which upon further probe by myself revealed itself to be some government type Japanese hospital!! So I requested again that if there is an English speaking hospital or doctor whom we can see. In a couldnt-care-less manner she then says to try Roppongi Clinic as ""we send everyone there & they can speak English""! Confused and worried sick, I asked if she could follow us there to which the retort was ""NO"". There was also no follow up on how my daughter was doing after the incident except for once when she came back later that day to give us more towels so ""you wont soiled the sheets with blood"".  INCIDENT 2A few days later when we requested from them for another Conrad teddy, the staff tells us to buy it from the Shop downstairs as they sell it and they had already given us on the first day. In fact, there was only 1 teddy they'd given us on the first day (we had to request for it, there was none on the bed) and my daughter had only wanted to get another one for play with the other teddy. It came across as insensitive & inflexible.INCIDENT 3Before our arrival we'd explained our daughter would like to use the pool perhaps once or twice during our trip, and after many discusssions & callbacks, they said okay but only on certain times as they'd like to preserve the serenity for their corporate guests. Frankly, a 2 yr old cant swim and at most was going to dip in pool, at best for 10-15 mins but they were still adament that outside those times were not possible as well as if some other guest came into the pool, we had to leave IMMEDIATELY. It was not like we werent paying guests. Why do we have to feel as if we must ""sneak around""? INCIDENT 4On the second day of our arrival, we'd gone to check the pool out. I had my daughter with me. The 2 girls that tended the entrance booth, in particular one of them, did not allow me to bring my daughter in. Despite my having said I was only taking a look & I was carrying her. After 5-8 mins of ""debate"", I decided to leave my little one at the entrance desk reluctuantly to have a quick peek at the pool ( I just wanted to see how deep it was and access suitability for swim ). Bearing in mind, I'd just given up & relented to the unreasonable request of not bringing my 2 yr old & leaving her with a stranger, I was brought NOT to the pool but the gym by one of the girls! I had not known that until she opened the door and told me, you can look at the pool from the gym! It was ridiculous as the view was slanted and I cant see the depth & pool properly from where I was. But I did notice there was NO ONE in the pool and only 1 other person working out in the gym. So why? Why was it such an impossibility to carry my daughter in with me as I have a quick look at the pool? Once again, I am unsure if it was a case of being a stickier to the rules, regardless or just pure couldnt-be-bothered attitude.INCIDENT 5On 2 of the days, just before we left in the morning, we called up the Star Service line for the room to be made up and when we did return late in the evening it was not done up yet. This was despite us having turned on the Make Up Room button in addition to ringing up the Star Service line as a reminder. This resulted in a lot of hassle and inconvenience of having to wait for the room to be made up and toilet/bathroom cleaned out as well as a change of towels, before I could put my daughter to bed.All in all, in our opinion, the service level has really been lacking and mostly disingenuous & insincere. A robot like attitude and blind stickler to the rules the staff do not come across as empowered individuals whom are dedicated to service at all. We have since written in to the Hilton group with regards to Incident 1 but to date (its been nearly 2 months) there has been no response nor revert. Conrad Tokyo seemed to be just hype and hardware.

I had the option to use the point stretcher rewards to extend my 4-night stay to 6 nights for free, but I thought 4 nights would be enough to cover Tokyo. Boy, was I wrong!We stayed in a regular Bay View room, and it was the nicest standard room I've stayed in, and I've stayed in a few hotels in my time since I travel 50% for work. The furnishings were very clean. and the bathroom had tons of space. I've stayed in business hotels in Japan, and this room was at least twice the regular hotel sizes.All the staff we encountered spoke English and were very friendly. We ate our complimentary breakfast at the Executive Lounge every morning, which was convenient, and was reasonable fare. Contrary to some reviews, I find the location of the Hotel to be very convenient. The Tokyo subway Oedo line is literally beneath the hotel, and the Ginza line is about 10 minutes away. These lines take you to Tokyo Tower, Shinjuku, Ropponggi, etc. The Yurikamome line to Odaiba is right next to the hotel. The adjoining office building has a nice selection of restaurants on the 2nd floor, so check it out if you want to grab a quick bite. Ginza is only about 10 minutes away via an elevated walkway.

Staff:Extremely helpful, and they know how to negotiate the space between being friendly without getting too personal. Concierge was useful and able to provide information on locales for sightseeing, use of the transit system, show tickets for kabuki theatre, etc. Often concierges these days are not very knowledgeable or helpful, and try and ""sell"" trips. This was a real concierge.Front desk people were corteous, helpful and businesslike. They helped us with transit info and when the concierge was not there, provided great assistance with train schedules to other cities. Well-spoken in English, and if they were not, they worked so hard to make sense of your question/request and help you out!Executive Lounge staff did such a wonderful job. It is very much worth the difference in cost to have access to the lounge-- one of the nicest one's I've seen anywhere in the world. And absolutely the best run. Rooms are nice, bathrooms even nicer. Very comfy and spacious. Several people comment the location is not great for a tourist. There is literally a train right next to building the hotel is in. I would assume most people staying at a hotel like the Conrad would also be able to figure out how to get from stop to stop and change lines on a train system. Personally, I feel the hustle and bustle of Tokyo is so calm and serene compared to a major western city. However if you find Japan a bit overwhelming, this might be an even more serene place to relax, yet with superior access to the bustle. Beautiful beautiful pool, very modern gym equipment, and superb changing room/sauna/jaccuzzi. The view from the pool to the surrounding buildings around the city is definitely a site to see.As for the restaurant food, I had room service the first nite I got in town. I was late getting in so the choices were a bit limited. However the choice made, although a simple hamburger, was great. And of course anyone that stays in hotels knows that hotel food is expensive, but let me tell you, the food at the Conrad is not priced too badly, and there are not hidden charges or add on charges. It was really not such a bad price for room service. The bar on the 28th floor had, once again, excellent staff who made excellent drinks. You will not find much better choices in any city when it comes to a total package in a hotel. This is a wise choice, especially if you are either a high level hilton honors person or someone willing to pay the bit extra to use the lounge.

We were lucky enough to use points for the stay and we were upgraded due to husband's platinum status so we had access to the Executive Lounge and free access to the pool. Normally, I think they charge about $25 pp to use the pool. The staff at the Executive Lounge were wonderful and the concierge superb. They serve breakfast with cooked-to-ordered eggs, congee, wonderful pastries, salads, etc... They also serve wonderful snacks from 4 or 5 and it is a great appetizer plate. My son absolutely loved it there. The wonderful little touches such as rubber duckie and small bears were a delight for a young child. The room was extremely spacious and absolutely spotless. The cleaning staff seem to know exactly when you leave your room and they come and clean right away. The bathroom was also very roomy with a separate shower and tub as well as the Japanese toilet with all the bells and whistles. In addition, the view from our room was gorgeous. The location of the hotel was great; it's like a 10-15 minutes walk to Tsujiki Fish Market. It's located on top of the Shidome station on the Toei line and a 5-10 minutes walk to Shimbashi Station on the JR line so it was easy access to other parts of Tokyo.

We arrived earlier than our check in time and went straight to the Exercutive Lounge where we were checked in without a hitch and offered refreshments while our room was being organised. The rooms: The room was very spacious with a great view of the Hamarikyu Garden and the Rainbow Bridge. Great big bath and shower area. There is a partition between the living area/guest toilet and the bedroom. It has everything you would expect from the Hilton/Conrad chain with excellent Sheheido toiletries.Food/Dining: We had daily breakfast, light afternoon tea and evening cocktails and canapes included in the Exercutive room rates which we had overlooking the skyscrapers of Tokyo. There was Japanese and Western selection for breakfast, pastries, fresh fruit and a good selection of wine, beer, liquor and champagne during evening cocktails.The pool and gym: The pool is quite small, so if you are looking for a great pool scene you will be dissapointed. The gym seemed well equipped however once again on the smaller side. This would suite the bussiness traveller who is looking for a quick workout and swim.Spa: We did not experience the Spa here but the menu is extensive but also quite pricey.The location: To me it seems the Conrad is located in more of a business district (near the Shiodome). It is about 20 min walk to Ginza shopping centre and about 15 min to Hamarikyu Garden. There is a subway station just outside the hotel which is very convenient and is only a few stops to Rappongi. Service: The housekeeping service was great, they were ever ready to come to clean your room and in the first day of our stay left us chocolates and a little ""Conrad Teddy"" key chain as souveniers. However - the service at the Exercutive Lounger was little disappointing, not what I would expect from the Hilton chain. I had to wait for some time before my drink order was taken during Breakfast while wait staff continued about their duties, avoiding eye contact. In the end, I just walked up to them and placed my order. Nothing too major just that I noticed this happen on more than one occasion even when it was not busy.The conceirge were very helpful with hailing a cab for us, providing maps of the subway, directions and information on the Narita Express. Tip: There are great restaurants/cafes/fastfood/convenience stores in the Shiodome area beneath the subway station and if you walk further towards the Ginza station you will find even more restaurants and little shops.This is an excellent hotel but I do believe it is better suited to a bussiness traveller rather than a tourist given the location.","Brisbane, Australia",4,3.0

Chose the hotel for its location near Ginza, and easy connections to Tokyo station via Shinbashi.The hotel is brand new, in a very new area called 'Shiodome', a forest of tower blocks around a subterranean shopping centre. You can walk from Shinbashi station directly to the hotel lobby, but you may need to ask the way a few times !The hotel reception is on 28th floor, our room was on 34th I think.Check-in was fine, they did not give us any 'upgrades' for my wife's gold card status, perhaps Hilton/Conrad policy for gold card holders has changed, as we also got nothing at the Tokyo Hilton.The room was gorgeous, very large for Tokyo, with a huge window, and enormous bathroom. Very modern decor, could not fault it. I loved playing with the electric curtains and blinds !We did not eat at the hotel, but had an extortionately priced drink in the lobby bar - lovely views but you certainly pay for 'em !As we only stayed one night, and went out with friends, we did not have a chance to sample all the hotel facilities, however I must say the room was one of the best I have ever stayed in, anywhere in the world.All in all, a great place, but I found it to be rather snooty in atmosphere.","Brighton and Hove, United Kingdom",186,5.0

The hotel provided a very nice crib with linens and extra towels. We took a taxi from Tokyo station and it probably took about 20 or 30 min due to traffic. We came straight down Ginza so the ride was very scenic.When we checked in, the reception people were very nice and the bellhop kindly took all of our items to our room. They didn't even comment given I had 2 kids+1 adult for a 2 adult room. The hotel room was quite large and the bed was comfortable. The king size bed was larger than a typical US king size bed. I was traveling with my mom, 3.5 yr old and 9 month old. There was plenty of room for me, my mom and daughter all in the bed. The baby slept in the crib though he didn't sleep well b/c of being over-tired or teething. The hotel room was so spacious, I was able to wheel his crib to the hall area by the door and bathroom to try to put him in an area where our movement wouldn't disturb him. The room was quiet. We didn't hear any noise from the hall or adjacent rooms. The bath was ok -- I prefer a larger bath -- but the shower was nicely equipped with one of those newer large showerheads so that the water mimics rainfall. We did receive a rubber ducky in our bath and two mini-stuffed Conrad teddy bears on the bed. The bath soaps and gels were nice. My daughter and I ate breakfast (Y2800 for me and free for my daughter Age 3) at the restaurant downstairs at Cerise. It was perfect for us -- the continental breakfast buffet was a mix of Japanese breakfast (soba, rice, egg), American cereals, pastries, toast, cheeses, cold cuts and fruits (i had a delicious persimmon). The coffee was very good, as well. We walked to Himarikyu park. It wasn't simply across the street but definitely walkable. The park was lovely and there was a large tea party the day we were there. We were able to walk to Tsukiji as well, but all activity there was over when we got there.","Houston, Texas",32,5.0

From the moment we walked into the lobby and the elevator quickly and quietly whisked us up to the 28th floor lobby, we knew we were in for a great stay.The check-in process was very efficient and a porter took us up to our room. It was a good thing he showed us all of the controls - from the drapes on the windows to the blinds on the bathroom. As soon as he left, the big grins we had on our faces finally emerged. We booked the hotel on points, so we felt exceedingly lucky!Our room had a view of the office buildings across the street, but it was still a great view. The nice bench sofa was a perfect place to sit and enjoy the view. The box of chocolate truffles on the table was also a nice touch.But the most impressive thing about the totally modern and luxurious room was the bathroom. The bathroom had a glass wall looking into the bedroom - it looked like a showroom window. Everything was spotlessly clean. The Shisheido bath amenities were wonderful. And the Conrad rubber duck was a cute touch. (Along with the little stuffed bears we received at turn down.)We were lucky to receive vouchers for the ""continental"" breakfast. My image of a tyical continental breakfast is bread or rolls, coffee/tea and juice. The Conrad Tokyo brings a whole new meaning to ""continental"" breakfast - the buffet included fresh baked pasteries, Brie de Meaux, prosciutto, smoked salmon, fresh fruits and vegetables, mini smoothies, muesli, Japanese style rice porridge, onsen eggs, soba, etc. For an additional 800 JPY, guests can add made to order egg dishes like eggs benedict or omlettes, etc. or a full English style breakfast.The hotel also offers free Internet access via a small business center. It was very useful for looking-up information. We had to ship a package within Japan and the concierge was very helpful.The Conrad Tokyo is conveniently located on the Oedo subway line (Shiodome station) and a very short walk to the JR Shinbashi station. The Shiodome office complex has a very handy convenience store where you can buy drinks, snacks, etc. Ginza is a 5-10 minute walk as is the Tsukiji market. Don't miss going to Tsukiji - wear shoes that you don't mind getting wet.My only wish is that we had more time at the Conrad Tokyo. Three nights went by far too quickly!

From the hotel, there are magnificent views out over Tokyo Bay. The hotel lies within easy walking distance of Shimbashi station, and so benefits from extensive public transport connections. The Ginza district lies around 15 minutes away by foot, and the Tsukiji fish market is around 10 minutes away. The hotel's beds are very firm, and were as a result perfect for me. The room sizes are very generous by Tokyo standards. The showers were excellent. Five stars and a bonus star for the cute bathtub duck offered as a free souvenir.So, what's not to like? The prices reflect the market positioning of the hotel (5 star), and, to my tastes, the hotel and its environs are somewhat sterile. The service is very good, but not up to the level of old standbys like the Okura and the Imperial. This is, I think, the result of a conscious decision to have a more Western approach to service levels (e.g., no kimono-clad elevator operators). The hotel's design is so similar to other hotels built in Tokyo over the past 15 years (e.g., the Four Seasons in Marunouchi) that we joked about possible confusion.

From the photos on the official hotel website, I expected it to be ultra modern, sterile, cold, etc. but it was very warm, cozy and comfortable. The photos that have already been uploaded to the site here are accurate. The layout of the room is great -- there is a place for everything so while the room at first glance may look bare -- upon closer inspection, you'll find all these inconspicuous little containers that keep everything clean, neat and out of sight! The location was also great. I was able to take the subway from right outisde the hotel and go by myself (and i don't speak or read a word of Japanese) to other parts of the city for sightseeing and shopping.

The room, though, took my breath away. It was huge, had a bay view, a couch across the entire window, and a large, gorgeous bathroom with free-standing tub from which one can enjoy the view.

Location: Easily accessible from Shiodome on the Oedo line, alternatively it is a short walk to Shimbashi station which opens up the Yamanote and a whole host of other lines. In terms of walking you are right across from Hamarikyu Gardens, less than five minutes from Tsukiji Fish Market and around a ten minute stroll to the heart of Ginza along some elevated walkways. The Shiodome area is very modern and clean, even by Tokyo standards and we thought it was a great place to be situated to do a range of activities.Ambience: Had a rather modern yet luxurious feel to the place. Lots of dark woods, high ceilings in the lobby area. See my pictures which describes it far better than I could! Room: As a Hilton HHonors Gold we were put in a Hamarikyu Garden view room which looked out towards the Rainbow Bridge. Room itself was a decent size with very comfortable bed and spacious bathroom with his and hers sinks. The Conrad trademark illuminated mirror, pedestal bathtub and window overlooking the bedroom. The room also had a comfortable bench type seat right across beside the window.Service: Excellent throughout, couldn't fault it. We arrived off an overnight flight and although we got to the hotel at 9am we were told to take a seat whilst a room was made up for us, it only took about ten minutes. Also were given vouchers for free breakfast each morning. We used the concierge quite a bit for recommendations and bookings for excursions to Fujisan and Hakone and they recommended cheaper ones versus more expensive which IMO is always a good sign of someone genuinely trying to help, versus skim some kind of commission. There is free wi-fi in the lobby but for some reason our laptop didn't want to connect to it. I asked one of the staff if they knew how to help and they couldn't get it to work so gave us free access to the paid wireless network which worked throughout the hotel. Most helpful. Staff in the restaurants were always very cheerful and helpful and at breakfast had remembered our names by sight on the third day.Facilities: We ate breakfast each morning in the hotel and it was a really good spread of hot and cold options. We'd been travelling for over a month staying in hotels and were a little sick of hotel breakfasts although this was quite refreshing. Unfortunately we didn't see any Japanese options though.Free internet workstations are available on the 28th floor if you just need to check something quickly without bringing your laptop downstairs.Summary: We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Conrad, compared to the Bangkok Conrad it felt like a true luxury experience.

We took the ""Airport Limousine"" from Narita, which is a very comfortable bus that goes directly to the Conrad (and a few other nearby hotels) for 3000 yen (appx $30). You are then directed inside a downstairs lobby which leads to an elevator to go to the real lobby on the 28th floor (above offices), with a great view of Tokyo Bay. After everyone bowing to me, I was directed to the check-in desk. As an HH Gold, I was ""upgraded"" to a beautiful room on the 31st floor overlooking the bay and park but denied lounge access. However my wife and I were given vouchers for breakfast in the restaurant--a nice buffet which they priced at 2800 yen to those who had to pay. The room was ultra modern and spacious with so many ""bells and whistles"" that it took some time to figure it all out. Large shower, a 37"" wide-screen TV, and upscale bathroom amenities. Two free computers in the unstaffed ""business center"" adjacent to the lobby. Service was terrific. However prices are high should you choose to have dinner or drink there. Great location--very close to Shiodome subway stop; connected to the Shiodome ultra-modern office complex which has many moderately priced restaurants (which we used) along with a Starbucks, convenience store, and other small shops.

The hotel is luxurious and was mostly very enjoyable, but note a few issues below.We had room 3234 (king bed) which had the city view of other large skyscarpers, and not much beyond. I think the odd-numbered rooms have the great views of the harbor and park below, which is the nicer view. With points, I didn't want to argue, but my husband is a silver platinum Hilton member, so we hoped for better. This status at least got us free use of the pool, where there is normally a surcharge (as with many business class-and-better hotels in Japan.) There was also a relatively small discount at the hotel's restaurants, small given the expense of a typical (but very good) dinner.First the good stuff: The room was very quiet, but all of them probably are at this height. The heat and AC controls worked quietly and well.The rooms are very spacious with good storage in the closet and drawers. Very comfortable beds and lots of pillows, and there is an additional pillow menu. Essentially, there was a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows with a wall-to-wall banquette that was great for relaxing. Spotless housekeeping and evening turn-down service. Good-size flat screen TV and wireless internet connection ($15 surcharge, which I always find annoying if htels charge these prices.) Modern, Asian-inspired decor in neutral tones. Complimentary in-room tea and press coffee service. There is also a table-top ironing board and iron, which was the only time I found this amenity in my 20-or-so days in Japan at business class hotels. Other amenities are what you expect at this level: complimentary water bottles, a small box of chocolates, etc.There are all kinds of technology in the room to close blinds and curtains, turn on nightlights in the bathroom, etc. However, the set-up for internet connection could be better as this required sitting at a round table, and the chair heights and wall connections are not the easiest.The bathroom was also very spacious, with separate walk-in shower and deep bathtub. A nice range of toiletries custom-blended by Sheseido for the hotel: shampoo, conditioner, and bath gel, although the moisturizer is a watery formula that is messy to try to apply (should be re-worked.) All the other bath amenities are also here for this class of hotel, i.e. toothbrush, razor, etc.Some irksome things: The bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a glass wall. While this makes the bathroom nice and light-filled during the day, the slatted blind that hides the bathroom does not block the bathroom light well. This meant that when I woke up earlier in the morning than my husband, I could not turn on the bathroom light without throwing a lot of light into the bedroom, and waking him up. (The blackout curtains on the outside windows work VERY well.) This meant that other than washing up by nightlight, I could not do much if I was going to be courteous to my husband.Also irksome and bizarre: the clock in the bedroom ticked very loudly. We moved it to the bathroom. Considering all the quiet, digital clocks I've seen in hotel rooms, WHY was this here? Did no one from management ever spend the night in this hotel room?I am also losing patience with the global trend toward heavy duvets where you have to really crank up the air-conditioning to be comfortable at night. I know the many reasons for this change, but we always ask for lighter blankets (which all the hotels have, but insist on putting the big fluffy things on first.) Since most in this style do not have additional single top sheets, it's the only way to survive without super-cooling the room to traditional Alpine termperatures.The free-access computers in the lobby are atrocious: the slowest I have experienced in a very long time (and remember: I had just traveled through Japan and stayed at hotels like the Nikko and Granvia, and their connections were excellent.) And again, there is that pesky internet connection charge in the room ($15 for 24 hours -- nominal, but stills feels like nickel-and-diming. The Nikko and Granvia in various locations have free in-room internet connections.)Even more bizarre: the concierges had to share these lounge computer printers with the guests -- they did not have their own available!! This meant that if they wanted to print something out for you, they had to wait for a computer to be free, and you were competing with them for computer time!!!The concierges were excellent, especially Daniel (I think) from Australia. The problem as that concierges were often not on duty, (or at the computer printer?) For example, the concierge did not come on duty until 10:30 on Sunday, and I often did not see anyone at the desk later in the evening. In a pinch, we relied on the check-in desk people, and they were helpful, but not of the same caliber of a good concierge. For example, when we had a question one night, we were given some information by the check-in staff when the concierge was not around. When we asked the same question of the concierge the next day, we got much better information, a brochure we had asked for (but the desk people could not find,) etc. At a Conrad, I expect real concierges who are more readily available.Also: ask specifically for the brochure from the Tokyo tourism board that should double-page information for each Tokyo neighborhood. Unlike the service I expect from other hotels, many of the staff only respond to specific questions, and operate on a need-to-know basis. Again, Daniel was the exception in trying to think about our larger travel needs.The restaurants and lounges in the hotel are quite expensive, but what can one expect when there is an on-site Gordon Ramsey restaurant, and the Chinese restaurant is Michelin rated? Drinks in the lounge are expensive, but they come with a spectacular view of the harbor that is also popular with the locals, so it is hard to compare this to grabbing a drink at a hole-in-the-wall. There is often a singer and accompaniest in the evening. However, this also makes it hard to sit anywhere in the evening that doesn't require the purchase of a drink, other than a bench by the check-in desk.We only dined at the Chinese restaurant, China Blue - expensive, but very good food, in a handsome room, and with ""the view."" The hotel sits in a complex of offices and a subway station, with another subway station nearby. We went to the various coffee shops in this complex for breakfast (Starbuck's, Vie the France, etc.) There are also a number of casual restaurants here that service the workforce in the office buidlings, even in the evening. There are also a variety of convenience stores, bookstores, Mister Minute shoe repair in teh subway station, etc.The underground subway complexes can be confusing, but we got the hang of how to guide to our destination by focusing on the name of the building complex near the Conrad. If you want to walk to the Ginza (hardly 10 minutes,) it is probably less confusing to use the above-ground walkway. Ask Daniel.We found the subway the easiest way to get around for most trips, especially during the day when traffic gets congested. The famous fish market is only one stop away on the subway line nearest the hotel, and other notable stops -- the Mitsukoshi department store, like Tokyo's Harrods, has its own station. The other nearby subway lines were handy for other reasons and sightseeing.Finally, the service throughout the hotel was generally quite good and efficient, and very courteous.So: this was overall an enjoyable stay, but it is worth checking other locations and hotels, given the price of this hotel and some of the things that could be improved.Sooner I or later I will also post hotel reviews for other parts of our trip -- mostly Nikko and Granvia hotels.",Wisconsin,522,4.0

The elevator going up to the check-in is almost silent and you barely notice you are moving. The decor of the Conrad Tokyo is thoughtful, tasteful, and modern. The room that we stayed in had a glass wall between the bathroom and the bedroom. There were blinds that could be moved with an electric switch on the wall to move them up and down or to open and close them. Since the hotel is on the top of the buiding, the views from the rooms and lobby showcase downtown Tokyo. There is a gym and spa on the 29th floor. One of the highlights is the millenium pool, which is a very long pool perfect for lap swimming. It is extremely luxurious to get that much space for swimming on the top floor of a downtown building in Tokyo. The pool is surrounded with tall glass windows, so you can enjoy the views while casually swimming/enjoying the water. While the traffic was chaotic and confusing to me, we managed to walk to the Tsujiki Fish Market from the hotel. It is about 10 minutes away and the hotel staff assisted us with our route. We also walked to the beautiful Hamarikyu gardens that are very close to the hotel. There is a building right next door to the Conrad Tokyo that has a small supermarket, a Starbucks, and a few other stores. It is located within the same circular driveway and the stores are in the basement. They are not advertised clearly and there are no signs indicating that they are there. When you check-in, they will have you sit and wait on a bench until somebody is ready for you. I was not accustomed to this process as a Westerner, but they are very polite.

The Conrad is a beautiful and spectacular modern hotel with all the right touches. I'm a Hilton Honors Diamond member so my perspective is already positively biased. The suite I stayed in would be loved by any condo-loving Manhattanite. It was huge. The bed was heavenly. The bathroom is a mini-complex unto itself. There are two large flatscreen TVs. The view southwards towards Tokyo Bay was pretty at night. The gym on the fitness floor was spacious enough.

The Conrad is the pinnacle of ""Western"" style hotels in Tokyo - clean, stylish with excellent service and reasonable prices (again, for Tokyo).The rooms are all excellent - clean, large and great bathrooms. I generally avoid the ""Executive floor"" simply because the rooms cost more but it doesn't actually offer anything additional except access to the Executive lounge (which is a good place for a small breakfast but is otherwise not very meaningful). Its worth paying a little extra for a room with a view of the Rainbow Bridge -- trust me, at night, the view is worth the money.For tourists - the location is not that great - Shimbashi is far from the major tourist centers like Shinjuku or Shibuya. However, the hotel is adjacent to the train station and not at all difficult to get to.The overall quality of this hotel is very comparable to the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo - however, this hotel is priced much more reasonably.As you would expect from any flagship hotel in Japan - all the staff here speak English.",Tokyo,29,5.0

Although our bags were a couple of minutes late in arriving at our room when we checked in, the bellman apologized profusely and refused a tip, saying that he did not deserve a tip! Concierge services were very helpful. My only complaint about the hotel is the price of food at the restaurants, particularly the Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Ramsey persists in charging high prices at his restaurants worldwide, but provides tiny portions - so you need to eat elsewhere after you are finished. There are other noted chefs that charge less and provide food just as good. Even for an expensive city like Tokyo, the restaurant prices should be about half of what the Conrad charges.",seattle,71,5.0

Further, if you are Hilton Honors Gold or Diamond member, you also can receive free breakfast vouchers, making a very good deal an even better deal. We stayed five nights at the Conrad Tokyo on Honors points, were upgraded to a garden / bay / ocean view room and given breakfast vouchers. This is a much better way to use Honors points than 20,000 a night for a suburban Hampton Inn!The hotel is fantastic. The service was impeccable. The 28th floor lobby is a bit overwhelming in terms of scale and the views over the bay to Odaiba and the Rainbow Bridge. The rooms are very spacious, and high tech. In fact, for the same points per night as the Hilton Tokyo, my read of the two hotels' web sites is that the Conrad rooms are 60% larger. The rooms feature floor to ceiling windows with electronically operated blinds and curtains. The bathroom is spacious as well, with a separate walk in shower and toilet stall. That way, you can keep the blind between the bathroom and room open and still have privacy. Of course, that blind opens electronically as well!The breakfast area is very well laid out - there is much more to it than you will see while walking from the lobby to the elevator bank. There is a very good breakfast buffet and hot breakfasts are 850 yen more than the buffet (the vouchers pay for the buffet value only).We were very pleased with the hotel service as well. They were helpful in making our return airport ""limousine"" bus reservations, in making dinner reservations and directing us to various stores in the surrounding area. About the only niggling complaints I would have about the hotel are two. First, there is a very nice reading light by the window sofa, but we could not figure out how to turn out other ""room"" lights and leave only that on - which would have been a great option when one of us could not sleep due to jet lag. The second is that to call AT&T USA Direct, I had to go through a hotel operator at a rate of 36 yen per minute. We probably could have bought a cheaper prepaid phone card on a Japanese network, but did not bother for the little use we had for making international calls. If you were traveling on business, this would be something to consider.The hotel is well situated. The Hama-rikyu gardens are across the street. The Tsukiji fish market would appear to be within walking distance (although we did not go there - at any rate it is one subway stop away on the Oedo line). The Ginza strip on Chuo Dori is about a 15 minute walk. The hotel is well situated for public transport as well. The Oedo line is outside the front door, down an escalator (with motion sensors and voice warnings to hold the hand rail!) and then about a 100 foot walk to the station entrance. The Yurikamome line to Odaiba is out the front door, up an escalator and immediately on your left. There are above ground and underground pedestrian walkways to the JR Shimbashi station, which also has subway stops on the Asakusa and Ginza lines. From the JR Shimbashi station, one can board the loop Yamanote line. Shimbashi is two stops south of Tokyo station, terminus for various Shinkansen (aka bullet train) lines. Oddly, while one can walk above ground and below ground, one cannot walk at ground level - there is no pedestrian crosswalk at the corner of the hotel! If you don't want to eat at the hotel, there are plenty of restaurants of all cuisine varieties and price ranges within walking distance, including several on the 41st and 42nd floors of the Shiodome City Center building, with excellent views. We particularly enjoyed the Vie de France in the basement of the Shiodome City Center building. There is a Seven Bank with an ATM that takes US ATM network cards on the 1st basement level of the Caretta Shiodome building as well. By the way, for a helpful map of the Shiodome area for your first day or two in the area, check the Caretta Shiodome web site for a downloadable pdf english map. However, the area is well signposted in both japanese and english. Overall - great hotel, great amenities, great service and a very convenient location.","Cypress, Texas",253,5.0

They ran out of single rooms with king beds, and upgraded me at no extra charge, to a suite. The suite was gorgeous, and possibly the most impressive room I've ever stayed at (short of the suite I stayed in the JW Marriott in Las Vegas). The rooms are decorated in a modern style, and if that is what you like, then this is the hotel for you!I had in-room dining for both dinner and breakfast. Because I was jetlagged, I called for breakfast at 5:30AM, a good 1 hour before their breakfast service began. They served me anyway, this is how good their service is!I left Tokyo the day I checked out, and flew to another city that night. When I landed, I realized I had left my glasses in my room at the Conrad. I called them, and was immediately taken care of. Within 3 days, my glasses showed up at home. In fact, they could have rush delivered it quicker but I told them it was OK to have it sent in 2-3 days, as I was wearing contact lenses and didn't need them for the rest of my trip.I am a Chinese woman and am always on the lookout for mistreatment whenever I travel to Asian locations well-known for their sexism.

It is an amazing hotel and I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Tokyo.My husband and I arrived from the UK after a 12 hour flight and having taken the courtesy bus from Narita airport into Tokyo arrived prompty at the hotel. On first impressions, the bus/taxi pull up area was not that impressive but having been greeted so warmly as we got off the bus, we were shown through to a great lower lobby and then into a lift that whisked us to the 28th floor where reception was. The immediate view from the huge, two storey, floor to ceiling windows across Tokyo Bay and the Rainbow bridge was breathtaking.We were seen immediately and the staff behind reception were first class. Our booking was all in order and we were taken straight to our room by a very friendly and helpful young man. Our bags had been taken from the bus and followed us closely to our rooms on a little trolley. We were shown all the gadgets in our fantastic room and left to relax. We stayed 2 nights at the hotel and the service throughout was second to none. We then stayed a further night at the end of our trip having toured around a little. The bar, restaurants and particularly the spa, where we enjoyed a couples massage, were just brilliant. Every little detail had been thought about and I loved the little Conrad bear that was left on our bed at turndown. The rooms are very sound proofed and you are guaranteed a good nights sleep free from noise even if you are close to the lifts like we were. My only negative was that the coffee was not piping hot at breakfast due to being served in cafetieres but something that was remedied very quickly by asking for fresh coffee - if that is my only gripe then they are doing something right!

Conrad charges their guests 1,500 yen per day for internet access and LAN cable can only be purchased from the mini bar.4.

Anyway this is a great place to stay and we’ll return there without doubts.","Moscow, Russia",118,5.0

Receptionists are professional and so is the lady concierge. The down size are, you have to pay (~17 euros per person) in order to get to the swimming pool. I think it is ridiculous and I have never seen that anywhere else in the world. So we did not use it, but just the small spa which is free.Also a having an executive room, we can have breakfast in the executive lounge located on the 37th floor. However after asking whether there would be Japanese breakfat in the lounge I was told no, the Japanese one is downstairs, but as having an executive room, you can not have your breakfast anywhere else then… in the lounge. Crazy… specially that the lounge is not that big and already at 7:00 AM there were many people and so you felt cramped like in a train.The only good time to use the lounge is around 18h00, when you can get free snacks and drinks.We had dinner on the New Yar’Eve at the China Blue restaurant. It was good though not so traditionally Chinese oriented, but rather sophisticated Chinese cuisine. We enjoyed it anyway. The amazing thing is we arrived at 20h30 ad the restaurant was half full and we were the lasts to arrive, as we figured out after. We thought it would be full for the celebration. The rooms are very nice, well decorated, bathroom is well equipped, I love the shower. The bad thing is the closet should not be opened like a door, but rather slides, because if one is getting something in there, you can pass to get in or out of the bathroom. Anyhow we would highly recommend this hotel to people and would stay there again during our next visit in Tokyo.","Lausanne, Switzerland",7,4.0

We stayed 5 nights on the executive floor and were very impressed with the facilities and the level of service. Our room was HUGE for Tokyo standards (it was bigger than some Tokyo apartments we were told) with high ceilings. The view outside our window was spectacular, especially at night. The tub in the bathroom is separated from the living space by a ceiling to floor window so you can watch television from the tub. There are a lot of perks that come with staying on the executive floor including complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour. The lounge is decorated in such a way that you feel like you're going back to your own house, very cozy and comfortable. Also complimentary is the use of their latest model pc, which you can use to check your mails or surf the Internet. The hotel is located in the newly developed Shiotome area, which reminded me a lot of Hong Kong or Frankfurt. There is one subway line that is a 2-minute walk from the hotel. But you want to take the JR line, the walk is more ilke 10 minutes, which can be a bit inconvenient if you don't like to walk. We will definitely stay here again should we return to Tokyo.","Brussels, Belgium",195,5.0

Except for the view, the rooms are exactly the same. The rooms are generally quite spacious and I really like the couch that runs the full length of the window. Everything about the room was very nice and modern and I've posted a few pics I took. The location was fine and you can walk directly from Shinbashi station but elevated walkway in about 5 min. A couple of other new hotels located right around the Conrad and also a number of new restaurants located in the new offices buildings offer sufficient dining choices.However I do have a few minor complaints. First is that there is no LAN cable provided in the room for free. The hotel expects you to pay JPY 2,000 for one available as part of the mini-bar setup. This really is silly I think as most hotels I've stayed at, both luxury like the MO Tokyo and basic business hotels in China, have always had a cable available in the room. To be fair they do offer wireless access but you have to buy an access card at the front desk in advance. For both LAN cable access and wireless access, a few of 1,500 JPY a day is charged. I think a lot of hotels in the US charge for internet access but again the MO Tokyo doesn't, a lot of business hotels in Tokyo don't charge, and even a lot of hotels I have stayed at in China don't charge. For a luxury hotel I think they are acting very, very cheap.Secondly, my rate included breakfast. During my first stay I wasn't given a coupon at the front desk so this caused some confusion in the restaurant the next morning. The second time I checked-in they again forgot the tickets and I had to ask for them. The second time also they were nice enough to inform me that I could also use the ticket for room service (which was not mentioned at all on the ticket itself). This is very generous but would have been nice if they mentioned this option on my first stay. Small issues but very basic for a hotel that is supposed to be one of the best in Tokyo.For me the hotel still gets a solid 4-star rating and if the price was right I would certainly stay there again. It is certainly one of the top hotels in Tokyo. But, based on my experience and my own personal tastes, I would definitely say the MO Tokyo is my favorite still, followd by the Park Hyatt and then the Conrad.","Minato, Japan",67,4.0

Overall, it was a great hotel -- new and very modern, beautiful, excellent location, with fantastic service, especially on the executive floor.First, the rooms. They are quite large and well-appointed. The ceilings are approx. 12 feet high and the rooms are very open, with floor to ceiling windows and a glass wall between bathroom and bedroom. This creates a feeling of openness and spaciousness. Furnishings are beautiful and high quality, and the technology such as large-screen TV and cordless phones are convenient.In my two stays, I had one room on the executive level, and one on the standard levels. Apart from slightly different color scheme, and that the executive level is on the top floor (floor 37, whereas others are on 30-36), there was *no difference* between the rooms. If you're thinking about the executive level to get a better or larger room, don't bother.However, the executive level was well worth it for me for other reasons: breakfast service, evening drinks, and fantastic concierge service literally next door. The food was quite good, including fresh fruit, pastries, and omelets cooked to order. I thought it was just as good as breakfast buffet in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant downstairs and was much more convenient.It was the executive level service that truly stood out. I got sick one day and my wife had to to travel around Tokyo by herself for the first time. The concierge gave her extensive directions and maps and made her feel very good about her outings -- which turned out to be completely successful. Not only were we warmly greeted each time we visited the lounge, I was even called by name the first time I appeared there! Very, very classy and professional service, which made us feel right at home.I had one room on the city side, and one on the ocean/view side. There were pros and cons of each. Pro of the ocean side was a great view of the water, park, modern buildings on Odaiba, etc. Con was early morning sun (facing east), less of a feeling of being in Tokyo (dense city not so apparent), and some noise from motorcycles in freeway tunnels at night. Pro of city side was more of a view of Tokyo, no traffic noise (a little bit of rumbling train noise instead), and no morning sun. Con was that most of the view was of three big buildings next door. Between them, I preferred the ocean view, while my wife preferred city.The fitness center was very nice and not busy. My wife used it several times and was very happy. With Hilton Gold membership (and maybe with an executive level room?) it was free. As for the Hilton Gold, the advantage was primarily to get into the fitness center. On our first stay (normal rooms) we were also upgraded to an ocean side room. On our second stay (executive level), there was no additional benefit from Gold membership apart from fitness center.As for location, others have commented, so I will merely add to that by encouraging people to use the public transportation, especially the subway system. The subways are not very difficult, once you realize one fact: the Toei lines (e.g., Toei Oedo, which goes to the Shiodome station at the hotel) and the Metro lines (e.g., Ginza line) are separate. You will need to either stay on one system, or buy a transfer ticket, or -- and this is what I highly recommend -- buy a 1000 yen ""1 day open ticket"" that is good on both systems. Once you have the open ticket, you can ride freely around both systems for less than the cost of a single cab ride. JR lines (commuter/light rail) are another matter. Once you feel comfortable with the subway (which has a lot of English posted), go ahead and try JR. Be warned, though, that you will need to get tickets for a specific fare (or adjust the fare at your arrival station), and most of the fare charts are only in Japanese. It's not difficult to figure out IF you have a map that shows both English and Japanese/kanji names. I recommend the Tokyo City Atlas for that. However, until you feel pretty comfortable with the more basic subway system, I'd recommend to skip JR for local travel.Back to the hotel -- what are the annoyances? First is that some of the design features demonstrate ""form over function""; they are beautiful but don't really work all that well. There were lots of such things: scalloped sinks that bounce water all over the counter; glass shower enclosure that leaked water through the seam; remote control drawer whose lid closed with difficulty and slammed shut loudly; toilet controls hidden down (for city-side room) on the left hand side where they were hard to reach; a *very* loudly ticking alarm clock that I hid in the closet; and so forth. Second is that the hotel was very, very quiet on the inside but picked up a modest but noticeable amount of external noise. I've mentioned that above: freeway noise on the ocean side, and train noise on the city side. To be fair, the noise was muted and minor -- not enough to keep us awake, but enough to notice. Ear plugs would no doubt eliminate it. We also had to hide the ticking alarm clock.Third annoyance was Internet access: they do not provide an Ethernet cable and the wireless was locked down. If you don't have an Ethernet cable, they charge 2000 yen to buy one! That's not a big deal, but it's silly and seems cheap on their part. Come on, this is a luxury hotel. Why do they charge for a LAN cable?! As for wireless, it was encrypted but they didn't provide the WEP key (and asking didn't help). They claim that a ""cookie"" will unlock it after using the LAN (and paying for the cable). As an IT person, that doesn't even make sense (cookies have nothing to do with WEP encryption), and I was never able to get WiFi to work. Conrad: give folks LAN cables! I've only ever had to pay for one at a cheesy, low-priced business hotel, never at any place with more than 2 stars (except here).In short, great hotel. I'd gladly stay there again, especially in the executive level. I wouldn't say it's my personal favorite in Tokyo (I have a small preference for the New Otani's remodeled rooms) but it's top-notch and happily recommended.","Seattle, WA",85,5.0

I stayed for 2 nights at the Conrad in Ginza, not knowing what to expect because I have not read any of the reviews here. I have been trying out the hotels in Hilton/Conrad range and this hotel is definitely right up there in their line up. Finding the hotel can be a bit of a struggle at first because some of the taxi drivers in Tokyo do not even know where it is located probably because it is a new boy on the block. But once you get used to the train system, you will find that it is very conveniently located next to Shiodome station and if you use the Uedo line you could get to the many shopping districts such as Roppongi and Shinjuku easily. The Tsukiji fish market is in fact within walking distance and as are the fabulous shops in Ginza.The lobby of the hotel is located on the 28th floor and what a grand lobby it is with a high ceiling and tasteful modern/zen interiors. From the tall windows of the hotel bar which is just in front of the reception area, you get a priceless view of Tokyo Bay. The staff will make you feel like a VIP with their attentive and proficient service. What others have described in this section about the rooms is entirely true. I stayed in a deluxe room but it is of such a generous size and tres plush! Modular designer sofas line the entire window side where you can relax and enjoy the breathtaking views. The king sized bed is so comfortable I slept in after breakfast (which they delivered to the room at no extra charge) and could not drag myself out of bed until 5 pm! And the toilet is tres chic. I loved that large circular mirror with very flattering light at its perimeter. It makes you look like you are ready for your close up. Try out the toiletries which are exclusively made by Shiseido for the Conrad Tokyo. After a shower your skin will feel smooth like a baby's bottom. You can't purchase any of these commercially but you can get them from the hotel shop at a phenominal cost of US$40. So if you are smart, ask for extras from housekeeping.I did not try out the 2 Gordon Ramsey's restaurants because I was more interested in trying out the Japanese cuisine. Dinner at the Japanese restaurant was exquisite but you will definitely need deep pockets. Just 2 small stumps of barbequed matsutake mushrooms would cost you about US$300.Try out the swimming pool and the sauna. The jacuzzi comes in individual tubs where you can treat yourself to a private refreshing hydro-massage. The design for the fitness centre where these are located is zen yet quite stunning in its beauty. It feels as though you are approaching some retreat. And even service at the fitness centre is exemplary and so polite. They will give you soft Conrad slippers to replace your footwear (as if you are at an Onsen). They thank you for using the facilities when you finish swimming and when you depart. I could use these facilities for free as I am a Gold Hilton Honors member, otherwise a fee is imposed for use of the facilites (which is apparently common practice in the hotels in Japan).I recommend this hotel highly. My only regret was to check out to switch hotels to Park Hyatt Shinjuku after staying 2 nights. The minute I checked into the Hyatt, I realised what I had missed. Even the Park Hyatt which costs 50% more than the Conrad (and with no breakfast!) is nothing but hype and fairly dissappointing. The Tokyo Conrad is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in, and I have tried so many luxury hotels in so many continents.",Singapore,105,5.0

This is a fantastic WORLD CLASS HOTEL and I can only assume that the people who stay here want to keep it a secret - sorry, but I’ve let the cat out of the bag!!! – don’t even consider anywhere else if you plan to go to Tokyo.The Hotel exudes class from the moment you arrive at the entrance and are whisked up the 28th floor foyer.The Hotel is in an excellent location in the Shiodome area and the Subway station is directly below the hotel. You can also walk to Ginza in about 10 minutes. On the other side of the hotel are the Hamarikyu Royal Gardens – here you can also get a water bus to Asakusa.I stayed in an Exec room which has all the class and sophistication you would expect from a 5* deluxe Hotel. Rain shower, inspirational views, outstanding service, excellent range of toiletries and a huge room by Japanese standards.The room also gave access to the Exec Lounge which served Breakfast, which included hot and cold options, Afternoon Tea and Canapes and Drinks in the evening. The choice of Canapes changed every night we were there and the range of drink covered everything from champagne to beer.We met people in the lounge who had been coming to Japan for 30 years and had stayed in all the top City hotels - Hyatt, Four Seasons and said that the Conrad is now the best hotel in Tokyo.The restaurant choices here are outstanding. Gordon Ramsay has 2 restaurants, the casual Cerise where we ate the evening we arrived and the more formal Ramsay by Gordon Ramsay. There is also a Chinese restaurant - China Blue – which had the most dramatic setting of any restaurant we ate in (including the overpriced Park Hyatt American Grill where every other table seemed to be celebrating a birthday with all the candle blowing and singing that ensued- we counted 7 when we ate there). Lastly there is a Japanese restaurant which we did not see.Dont let the fact that this Hotel has not featured in a movie sway your decision - it is one of the Great New Hotels of the world and somewhere that I was sad to leave.","scotland, uk",12,5.0

I am a frequenter of the Hilton brand and in fact I am a Gold Hilton Honor member. However, I have never stayed at a place quite like this. The hotel, which only opened last year, is beautiful to the finest detail. While the entrance is hard to find, once there you are warmly greeted by usually at least three bellmen inside the downstairs lobby. You then make a hard left to an elevator that takes you to the 28th floor where you are then greeted by at least two greeters who immediately all bow down and help you with your luggage. The front desk staff was all exceptional. They all knew English and are very personable. I emailed Mr. Lopez (Conrad Tokyo's general manager and yes I do know the name does not fit) about perks for Gold members before I arrived. Along with a detailed email reply he also came out to personally greet me to the hotel and also gave me him business card. He is a very nice man. I was also able to exchange all of my American dollars in to yen at the front desk for no fee. A bell woman showed us up to our 30th floor room. It was unbelievable. The pictures I included tell it all. Shortly after our arrival I was welcomed with fruits and cookies. We got new fruits and cookies everyday. When they cleaned the room in the daytime and with turndown we were given a bottle of complimentary water for everyone in the room. This helped a lot with sight seeing so we wouldn't have to be constantly buying bottled water.The pool was amazing. It was on the 29th floor and had amazing views. The pool always had an attendant who gave out towels, kickboards, and bottles of water. The fitness room only had about a dozen machines through they were all top of the line with large TV screens built in to all of them. The locker room had individual Jacuzzi's, a sauna, and a steam room. The downside is it costs $25 per person per day. Luckily if you are a VIP tier with Hilton Honors its free. However, even if wasn't, I would still go at least once. I was given coupons for a free breakfast for my stay however I am not sure if I was given this because of my Hilton Honors status. The breakfast was very western though this was what I wanted. It consisted of fruits, cereal, cold cuts, pastries, and juice. For an extra 600 yen (approx. $6) you could upgrade to a real breakfast dish like eggs, French toast or waffles. All of it was very high quality. The bar was very expensive. I just opted for the soda and it cost $9 with no refill. I can not comment on the restaurants as I did not eat at any of them. There were a lot of restaurants close by that were much cheaper. On a side note, I would highly recommend The New York Grill at the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku for one of your dinners. It’s on the 52 floor and it's the same place they filmed 'Lost in Translation'. Best dinner I ever had.The only negative to this hotel is that the room lacked outlets. There were was only two in the room. Also, on the 29th floor there is about a fifteen foot ledge. It obstructed our view quite a bit. Furthermore, the hotel is located in the financial district so a subway (which is located directly under the hotel) must be taken to tourist spots. Also, VIP tiers do not get executive lounge access. However, you do get an upgrade to either a bay view or city view executive floor. I did not get that upgrade because I was at a negotiated rate. In conclusion, I would recommend this hotel to everyone. Especially if you are cashing in HHonor points. At 40,000 points a night it’s a bargain.","Arroyo Grande, CA",82,5.0

As I am used to staying in 5 star hotel all over the world I ended up choosing the Conrad based on other reviews. My immedaite impression when we arrived was a little unsettling as you arrive in avery new area of Tokyo. The hotel is situated in the very top floors of a 36 floor building. However once you are taken directly to their lobby, all concerns disappear. I had booked the club floor, mainly for the benefit of the breakfast. The additional cost for the room was identical to two buffet breakfasts in the lobby restaurant and the club room is great. Free internet, a super club room breakfast (one of the best I've had anywhere), with an interesting view of the high rise buildings opposite. There is a concierge there who can assist with any requests as well. The service throughout the hotel was top shelf. The room was fabulous. I was worried about small rooms in Tokyo. Not this room. Very modern in its decor too. The bathroom had a real WOW factor. Trust me, you'll love it. And if you haven't expreienced a Japanese toilet, the first time you do will have you wanting one for home. Great location as far as getting around the city. Right next door is an office building with about 15 Japanese restaurants in it. Also a cafe. Connected to the hotel by subway walks are two stations that will connect you anywhere in Tokyo. You can walk to the Ginza from the hotel by above ground walkways. About 7-10 minutes.This is a great hotel, good location. Our room was of the office buildings, which I didn't mind. The other side views the harbour and a lovely park (more expensive). From the airport the shuttle actually goes to the hotel, although the last one goes at around 6.00pm. Check out the shuttle website for schedules. I dealt direct with the hotel and paid 35,000 yen for the club room. Not a cheap hotel, but worth it. We actually wnet and checked out the Park Hotel (No 1 on Trip advisor) which is next door. A nice lobby, couldnt see the rooms unfortunately, but not as cool factor as the Conrad.","Melbourne, Australia",67,5.0

I would advise, however, if you are planning to stay in the hotel you may want to consider the addition $75 or so for an executive level room. The executive lounge offers free breakfast (very good--smoked salmon, omelets, fruit), free non-alcoholic drinks all day, free snacks all day, free alcohol from 5-7pm, and free evening appetizers. We never had to eat breakfast or dinner which saved quite a bit of money.","Greenwich, Connecticut",149,5.0

It is brand new, and literally sparkles at every turn. The room was beautifully decorated, the bathroom impeccably clean and the bed extremely comfortable. Excellent soundproofing - no street noise nor any from neighboring rooms. Not one, but two, flat screen TVs in my suite (to which I was upgraded without asking after much apologizing by the front desk clerk about some error in my reservation), which was surprisingly spacious for any metropolitan hotel, let alone Tokyo. My only suggestion to the hotel would be to extend the restaurant hours considerably - it should really be open until 11pm and ideally should start serving breakfast at 5am for all the jet-lagged guests prowling their rooms in the wee hours. This hotel was just fantastic - well worth the money.",New York,6,5.0

This is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. If you can good a good rate or deal on this property, go for it now!!GOOD-This hotel is brand new (I believe opened in July 2005) and looks like it. Everything is in perfect condition and ultra modern. My garden view suite (1 of 63 in the hotel) was amazing. 2 50 inch plasma televisions, 2 DVD players, large shower, heated floor in the bathroom, heated modern Japanese toilets (2 of them), comfortable beds, a lazy chair, a separate living room, everything was very stylish and hip.-Impeccable service. When walking in, I was escorted to the check-in, escorted to my room, and every staff member that ever saw me during my stay always bowed and greeted me. While the Japanese are exceedingly polite and respectful, the staff here went the “extra mile.”-Very convenient location. This hotel is located in the Shiodome building, right above the Shiodome subway station, so you barely even have to leave the building to get on public transportation. It was also an easy 75 minute ride on the Airport Limo (Bus) directly to a drop-off at Conrad (3,000 Yen each person, one way – appx $28.00). Also, there are restaurants and a convenience store inside the building connected to the subway. We were able to get boxed lunches of Sushi, drinks, and snacks at very cheap prices. -Excellent HiltonHonors status recognition. As a diamond member, I was upgraded from a regular room to the regular suite, I had full access to the lounge (which has hot breakfast, computer with Internet, very helpful staff, and evening snacks and free cocktails), and we received welcome snacks every day in our room (range from cookies to fruits to nuts). Also, the Conrad bear and rubber duck in the room were given to us for free. 2 free bottles of water in the room every day as well (although the water is perfectly safe in Japan).-Great Views. This hotel doesn’t have a bad view and our room had nice big windows. Your room will either have a view of the gardens and Tokyo Bay or the wonderful city lights and skyscrapers. You can’t get a bad one.BAD-In a city that is already very expensive, this place is leading the way. We really wanted to eat a meal in the hotel, but the cheapest dinner we could find in the hotel restaurants was a fixed price meal of $115 per person. A coke runs about $8.00 and bottled water about $6.00. The good thing is that these prices force you to go and eat with the Japanese!!","Baltimore, Maryland",754,5.0

Very modern and comfortable with all the right touches and good location. Makes you feel like you are having 'fun' even if there for business. The one major thing is that if you want to use internet you either have to BUY a cable or call down for a wireless card and then scratch off some number and spend ages setting it up. If you don't need this then I recommend it 100%, oterhwise stay somewhere else.",HK,17,4.0

I know a number of people who have stayed in Tokyo and all say that this is the best. Room prices change as the hotel gets fuller but you can get it for around $350 a night and as the Yen weakens it will get cheaper. Stayed there twice, prefer the cheaper rooms with city view as not keen on sun bursting through window straight in my eyes which you get in the bay view rooms! Hotel is well positioned near the underground system. Airport bus takes about an hour from the hotel. Best tip is to get clear instructions in Japanese back to the hotel when you go out as not many taxi drivers have heard of the place. Best room I have stayed in anywhere in the world for a business hotel!","London, United Kingdom",506,5.0

I have a limited proficiency in Japanese, and it was a blessing to have fluent English-speaking staff that understood everything we said. Very professional and pleasant staff.* Rooms: These are the best rooms we've ever stayed in. The mahogany wood accents, glass, modern/Asian bed & seating, flatscreen TV, electronic controls for lighting & window blinds (including the bathroom glass wall divider to living area!) created a perfect blend of modern/sleek and comfort. Small touches here & there amounted to a lot that said they care about their guest: a single orchid floating in a water vase in the entry, bottled water, fresh kiwi with napkin/plate/knife, rubber ducky at the tub, cute tiny teddy bear at bed turn-down in the evening, great Shisheido toiletries, and of course the heated Toto toilet - I love it! I can't say enough about the room & its design - incredible city view, cool/comfy sofa along the view window, great bed, the bathroom shower/toilet/bath is luxurious and I love the window into the living area. It feels spacious and with just a touch of a button, you can close the blinds between the 2 areas. The view window blinds are automatic as well - there's a control console right at the bed for lights & window controls. The flatscreen TV was great too.*Location - convenient access to the subway by foot, but my favorite thing about the location is that its close to Hamarikyu Garden. If you're sightseeing, I recommend visiting Asakusa, taking the Sumida River cruise south to Hamarikyu Garden, strolling thru the garden then walking back to the hotel. It's a great way to see a different, more serene side of Tokyo.Cons: It's expensive.","Bend, OR",15,5.0

Consequently, some topics are presented without comment due to lack of expertise (e.g., whether this place is a good value). The Conrad just opened in July, so it is still getting the kinks worked out - hopefully. I spent 5 nights at this hotel, located in the Shinodome Tower, just 5 minutes from the Ginza district, Hamarikyu Gardens, fish market, and Tokyo Bay. It is a short (~$10) cab ride from the Tokyo Station. The rooms are very large for any hotel on any continent, with huge windows making up one wall. Very modern and sleek. The window wall has a long window seat, as it has cushions along the entire length - allowing guests to sit comfortably and gaze out. Quite a nice view - although the ""City"" view is inferior to the ""Garden"" view (the latter of which looks out on gardens and the bay). My five travel-mates also got the ""City"" view - so I am guessing that the ""Garden"" view cost extra. However, it is worth asking at the desk or when making reservations about getting the ""Garden"" view. The website photos only hint at the size and style of the rooms. Separate toilet and shower, each enclosed in frosted glass. The shower can be used either as a hand-held or rain shower (i.e., from the ceiling). A nice touch is a button on the shower lever that must be pressed (quite easily) in order to go above a certain temperature. This avoids scalding, which can easily happen when one is figuring out a new shower. The large main area of the bathroom also has a tub, complete with rubber ducky. Two plush bathrobes and sets of slippers are provided. The wall facing the bedroom is glass, and wooden shutters can be automatically raised/lowered to link/separate the two areas. Top-notch toiletries, with many additional sundries also provided (razor and cream, hair brush, toothbrush, emory board, etc.). Rooms have large flat-screen TVs and DVD/CD players. Light are controlled by buttons conveniently placed and easy to navigate. One button by the front door lights up certain areas of the room - or controls all lights. There is a button for ""maid serve"" and one for ""do not disturb"" - so you don't have to hang something on the doorknob. At the bedside are buttons for two sets of drapes/curtains - one is sheer and the other keeps out all light. Speaking of buttons, there is a single button for front desk/room service/housekeeping. I'm sure the Hilton folks (who own the hotel named for their founder) thought this was a simpler-is-better idea. However, there were times when my travel-mates could not get anyone to answer - and other times when it rang over 15 times. It could be that channeling so many different calls to one central number overloads it at times. It really isn't hard to press separate buttons for differenct services. One time I left a wake-up call using the automatic system, and I happened to be briefly out of the room the next morning when the call came. The hotel sent someone to check on me since I didn't answer the automated room-service call; that was a nice touch. The room had a decent-size, round work table with high-speed internet. However, it was good I brought my own ethernet cord, as none was provided. (I was told the hotel could supply them.) $15/day seemed reasonable, although one could argue it should be free given the price of the room. One of my colleagues had trouble with her internet service that took two calls too many to be resolved. Laundry service did a good job - but accidentally charged me for express service. When I mentioned the mistake, they checked and confirmed it was their error - and the charge was adjusted to regular rates. When I went to the fitness center/spa, they said the per-use charge was $25. (Note: I did not confirm this at the front desk.) I cannot say whether this is typical or not for high-end Tokyo hotels - but it did keep me from using it. The pool seemed like it was less than 25m in length. There were 2-4 pieces of each exercise equipment (stairmaster, treadmill; the usual stuff). The only meal I had at the hotel was a room service breakfast. The continental breakfast was very good, yet it arrived just outside of the 20-30-minute window indicated when I ordered. It should be noted that any meal in the hotel is very expensive (for example, $13 for a glass of orange juice). However, one thing I DO know is that Tokyo is one of the most expensive - maybe the most expensive - city on the planet to do business. And food at high-end hotels is very, very costly. There is a mini-mart and Starbucks (as well as a MailBoxes Etc.) just around the corner; although attached to the building, they cannot be accessed directly from the hotel, which starts on the 28th floor. Strangely, reservations were needed for the bar/lounge - even at times when it wasn't very crowded. I don't know how firm this policy is. The lounge had a lovely ""Garden"" view, and although drinks were pricey, made for a nice, relaxing setting. I was surprised that, at a business hotel largely frequented by foreigners, more of the staff didn't speak English - or speak it very well. I wouldn't gripe about this if this weren't a luxury business hotel catering to businesspeople. Too often one staffer would have to call over someone else to understand the request. This lack of communication negated advanced plans we'd made for travel to the airport, and effected our schedules at other times. Also, since the hotel was new, most cab drivers had trouble finding it - even with the Japanese maps/directions provided by the hotel. The only store in the hotel sold upscale fragrances, some jewelry, and cigars; that wasn't the best system given that you were 28 floors from access to other things. Our rate was just under $400 per night - which was less than usual for the Conrad, and quite in line (if not a little low) for luxury hotels in downtown Tokyo. In summary, I very much enjoyed my stay - but cannot comment on how the Conrad stacks up to similar hotels in downtown Tokyo. Removing small annoyances (that single button for disaparate services, charging for the pool/gym and internet access, somewhat better trained and English-speaking staff, at least one other store with basic stuff in the hotel, not needing reservations just to have a drink in the bar, better map/directions, ethernet provided, reliable internet, etc.) could make the Conrad one of the best places to stay.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",79,4.0
