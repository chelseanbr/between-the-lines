I'll start by saying that the pictures are not in any way, shape or form an accurate depiction of this place. Filthy bathrooms, tiny, dirty bedrooms with doors that don't close properly, as well as other guests that appear to be using the place as a half-way house would be much closer to the truth. While we did pay less than what other places in Manhattan are charging, the price that we were charged did not give us any indication that we would be staying in a dump. I was traveling with my two daughters, and because we arrived at 3 am, we stayed until 9 the same morning. We slept in our street clothes, with a table jammed against the door and prayed that in the event of a fire, we could find our way out of the maze that is the hallway. Please do yourself a favour, and stay elsewhere. Due to the lack of accommodations in Manhattan, we ended up going to New Jersey. We definitely paid quite a bit for Uber's and PATH, but the peace of mind was worth it; we also found it to be a nice break from the chaos of Manhattan. Having stayed in the city during previous trips, I assumed that the travel time would not be worth staying anywhere else. I was wrong, and my next trip will be booked in either Brooklyn or NJ.

Yes, it's a budget hotel with pretty basic accommodations but if you're visiting NYC for pleasure and just need a place to crash, this place fills that need. The Upper West Side location can't be beat either, with quick and easy access to the subway and bus lines.

When I arrived, they said they were sold out of rooms with private bathrooms (which is the room that I had a confirmed reservation for). They offered me a room with a shared bathroom or a refund with an attitude as if being sold out is a natural reason not to honor my existing confirmed reservation. There was no apology or reparation. I wrote to management, but received no reply. Unless you do not mind possibly spending a night on the street, do not book this hotel! The person at the reception told me they couldn't help me but that I was free to complain. Overall, the hotel is a dump. Other aspects are just as mismanaged as the reservation system. Rooms, furniture, and toilets are in disrepair (e.g., sign says don't put toilet paper in toilet or it will clog), sheets and floors are stained, the shower walls are yellow with residue that makes you think twice whether you really need a shower. The most astonishing aspect, however, is the staff's complete lack of acknowledgement of responsibility. ""We are sold out"" (of the room you already reserved) seemed like normal business to them.

Spend a little more for a better place. I have learn my lesson the hard way. (stubbornly learned)Keep in mind I travel to NYC roughly 6-8 times over the summer months and have given these people thousands of dollars in business. I book WAY in advance, usually in January.THE GOOD:First of all, its a great location, close to the subway, plenty of places to get food, Duane Reade around the corner. Its generally very quiet. I don't think I have ever had to wait for one of the shared a bathrooms.THE BAD:Most importantly..... YOU MAY NOT EVEN HAVE A ROOM WHEN YOU SHOW UP!!!The people who own and work at this place don't care about you, and are not helpful in any shape or form. Not helpful at all.2017: I usually book though hotels.com but for this particular trip I saw a lower price on Morningside Inns website. I go to check in and that's when the person at the desk informs me ""Oh you booked through the website, you shouldn't have done that, it doesn't work"" and ""Sorry we are full booked"" And pretty much, so what, don't let the door hit you on the way out. He didnt give a damn.You would have thought I would have learned my lesson.....2018: Labor Day weekend, after a long day I was exhausted. I go to check in at 9:30pm, this time I'm informed that the day before there was a flood on my floor, so I have no room. What?!?!? So why didn't anyone call me to tell me? Again the person at the desk really didn't seem to give a %#%. He did let me use his phone to call hotels.com since my cell phone was dying. Gee so nice of him. Luckily this time I booked through hotels.com and after hours and a lot of work they helped me get a hotel by 1am!!!!!!! This is NYC and Labor Day weekend of all times, not easy to find a room last minute (it cost me 5X as much money for this new hotel, but hotels.com reimbursed me back the extra cost, I cant tell you how relieved I was)Again, I should have learned my lesson......big time...but noooooo2019: This year I made it a point to call the day before to confirm my reservation. I called 2 weeks ago on a Friday for the following day, it was confirmed. I even asked if my other reservations were showing. Yup. Everything was fine. However when I got to my room it wasn't even cleaned. Good thing there was a spare available. (even though they claimed to be booked)Now my next trip comes. I called last Thursday I was told my reservation was confirmed an all set. Shortly after I get a call back and the girl tells me no, that my reservation had been CANCELED. And cant give me any reason why. On top of that, she had NO RECORD of my other 6 upcoming reservations!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?This year I have booked through agoda.com and they confirmed that my reservations were active and confirmed. They called Morningside Inn Several times and told me they couldn't reach any manager there and the people they did talk to at the desk were rude. (agodas words) They have tried to reach the hotel manager by phone and by e-mail, and as far as I know now (Monday Night) no one has responded to them.As I said I book well in advance to save money and to ensure I have a place to stay as NYC is such a busy place. They completely screwed me over and now its going to cost me much more money to re-book 6 more hotels for the rest of the summer.If you don't learn from my mistakes, well good luck to you. Perhaps you will get lucky and enjoy it. Or perhaps you will show up and have nowhere to stay. If you like the save money and are a gambler type..... go for it!!!",,5,1.0

You don't need me to tell you that this is one of the cheapest places in Manhattan, almost amazingly so because it's on the elegant upper west side just a few blocks from St John of God. You probably also don't need me to tell you that in the past it got some pretty terrible reviews, which are still coming back to haunt it, because things that people write in 2007 or 2008 seem to stay permanently and rise to the top of the google page when you type in the name of the hotel. We looked at those AFTER we had booked, and, of course, had second thoughts about the whole thing... who wouldn't? Maybe that's why it's still so cheap, because a lot of people might be turned off by a negative appraisal and not even notice that it was written eight or ten years ago. What you DO need me to tell you is this: we decided, with some misgivings, to go ahead with our booking, mainly because we couldn't find anything in the area remotely near the price Morningside was charging, so we turned up, hoping for the best but prepared for the worst. And what a surprise! The people who wrote those bad reviews back then might just as well have been writing about something on another planet. Our room was spotless, the facilities very good, and the staff just wonderful to us, In fact, on leaving I asked both of them their names so that I could mention them in this review. We were so thrilled with Nina and Tanya; I doubt if you'd find anyone in any hotel who appeared to be more interested in, and delighted by, their guests. They treated us like friends, not one-night tourists. Well, the bad reviews were from a decade ago, but here's the story in 2019: my daughter has decided she is going to New York in December on her honeymoon, and the first thing I said to her when she announced this is, ""You just HAVE to go to Morningside Inn, and I will write to Nine and let her know you're coming."" I don't think I have ever said that before about ANYWHERE. I guess if a few more NEW reviews get onto google they will start to put their prices up; so my advice is, simply, don't leave it too long if, like us, you like a bargain!",Sydney,7,5.0

After driving through the night and going all day around NYC we were looking forward to getting to our ""hotel"" to relax at 2pm check-in. As soon as we walked into the building we were greeting by questionable people milling about and or yelling, and the less than friendly receptionist. We handed over the room fee of $155 in cash along with a credit card to hold as a ""safety deposit"" and we were pointed to our room with the exact words ""just go through that door over there"", an unmarked door that led to a sketch narrow and short hallway. By this point when we even opened the room to the door we were not in any surprise to what we found. The radiator appeared to have been leaking for quite some time covering a majority of the carpeted floor, the room was FREEZING because the bathroom window was open and would not close due to being broken, stains all over the sheets, walls, floors you name it, a door that barely locked and no towels or cloths to be found anywhere. So not even being in this room for 30 minutes we went back to the main desk and politely asked if a refund was possible especially since we paid the fee in cash. The receptionist's response was ""it's not very likely but you can call the manager, he isn't here right now"". After debating what to do for quite some time we decided that we would walk away from the ridiculous fee of $155 that we paid for that dump and try to find something much more clean and safer.

From the outside it looks ok, but once inside its dark and dirty. Upon checking in the first think you notice is the reception lady clearly didn't want to be there and was miserable. We were given the keys for room 602, we had 2 cases and went to use the lift but found it full of cleaning supplies and cleaner made us wait while she went up to a higher floor. Eventually we squeezed us and our cases in as it was still full of cleaning trolley and other supplies. Once in the room the first thing we noticed was the bed was on an incline, it looked like the room hadn't been cleaned in weeks with thick dust on the skirting boards, windows sills, etc. Tried to plug in a charger and the wall socket fell forward exposing the mains wiring. We were about to go out for a quick look outside when we heard a noise and red hot water sprayed out from the ceiling near a large pipe covering our suitcases, luckily we hadn't unpacked yet so they were closed. Not that there was cupboard to put the clothes anyway.I went to reception to ask to change rooms and was complained at that it was after 4 and the cleaners and maintenance person had left for the day, we had just seen them a few minutes earlier. So we had better not have slept in the bed or made a mess because they were fully booked and someone else would have to sleep in the room. I couldn't beleive they were just going to put someone in there without fixing the hot water leak. The lady said some people don't care, which was exactly her attitude. Reluctantly I was given another room key and we transfered our cases. This room was slightly better than the first with a little less dirt and at least the bed wasn't on an incline and no leak. This room was still bad, with a massive gap down the side of the room door where you could view most of our room from the outside, it would have been even worse if they hadn't screwed on a bit of metal to try and close the gap slightly. There were holes in the blinds, towels while clean were dropping to bits. The electrical sockets in this room were also dangerously falling out of the wall. The shower had screws sticking through from presumably the next room. Talking of the shower, only 1 time was the shower hot and the wall was so thin you could hear next door having showers at 1am and 5am each night. While mentioning the thin walls our new woom 402 was next to a kitchen area with a microwave, which was in use right through out the night. Being woken up to the constant noise of the microwave ad pings when it finished, then the neighbours showers doesn't exactly make for a good nights sleep, which is all we tried to use the place for.We unplugged the fridge which we had no use for due to the noise it made.We often had problems opening the doors from the stairs/lift to the room corridors, I saw half a dozen others with the same problem and helped a couple of them open the doors. I dread to think what would happen if there was a fire.When we checked out we asked if we could leave our luggage and were just handed the key which is kept on the reception desk and left to put out luggage in the room in the basement. The place was very dirty, full of rubbish and other peoples luggage. We were extremely worried about leaving our luggage as we had read that others had things stolen, which isn't suprising when anyone is allowed in. When we returned 3 hours later we were told we know where the key is just help oursleves. Thankfully everything was still there.I have stayed in some really bad cheap places over the years, but this by far the worst. It was booked as part of a package holiday so wasn't chosen directly by me. Please do not book this place unless you are expecting extremely basic hostel accommodation and just need a roof over your head. Most of the building is hostel accommodation with shared bathrooms. The pictures of the rooms must have either been taken a long time ago or maybe somewhere there is a couple of not bad rooms hidden away.The only positives are it's location and WiFi.

The hotel is very noisy No this isn't from the outside! I was expecting some noise as it is a city centre hotel. No the noise came from other rooms, opening and closing doors. All the doors are slamming loudly. so you wake up everytime someone went to the bathroom or when other guests got back in their rooms.The hotel did provided towels and even got serviced every day. The bathroom wasn't always clean and tidy as it was a shared facility.

The room was comfortable and they had a mini bar and cable TV which is a bonus although I didn't watch it. The final stay there was a problem with the booking and I only got a room with one bed. They couldn't fix it on the day but next day they moved all the luggage to a deluxe room plus I got a refund of the difference back without any drama. Ive stayed at moringside inn in 2014 and my mum has stayed previously. They have improved the rooms and they are pristine and cleaned daily. Overall I'm happy to stay there again although NYC is becoming so expensive due to all the taxes that are tacked on. I had 5 additional taxes added to the final bill. I checked it out and it was correct. It appears NYC is bleeding tourists to pay for conference centres. I will think seriously as to whether I go back there anything soon.

If one is flying into LaGuardia (and I don't envy you if you are) simply take the M60-SBS bus all the way to the end of its line. The Broadway/106th stop is just around the corner. There are several good chain restaurants and even Tom's Diner (Monks Cafe) from Seinfeld is three blocks north.The Lobby and Staff:The reception is quite barebones. The hotel is in a pre-war building, and you have to know the address as the sign for the hotel is hidden behind a tree on the front steps. Some staff are more chipper than others. Check-in time is at 2pm, strictly enforced but there is secure luggage storage one floor down in the basement if needed. The Room:The rooms are older than they look on the website. Rather small too. Mine only afforded me a view of the alley and fire escape but there was a closet and a mini-fridge. What I was most surprised with was the upkeep. For being an older, barebones facility the cleaning service was impeccable. Most hotels anymore encourage reusing the towels but this trend has not made it to Morningside. They replaced them every day, like clockwork.The WiFi is included, they have around five or six routers going throughout the building but only one or two will work from your room and it can go in and out quite a bit.You have the option to either take your key with you or leave it with the front desk for safekeeping. The bed was not excellent, it was sagging in the middle and the pillows were quite flat. My room could get a bit stuffy, however there was a ceiling fan which made for better sleepingThe Toilets and Showers:Not numerous. There are two bathrooms per floor, one with a tub and shower and one with only a shower. You will receive small bar soap in your room. The bathroom upkeep could be a bit better as the drains ran a bit slow and were cleaner at some times than at others. The Atmosphere:This hotel seems to be popular with overseas school groups, so be aware of the possibilities of noise from adjoining rooms or floors. The doors also slam easily so this may wake you up early or during the night. You may have to wait a bit for the bathrooms during peak times, as there are only two per floor. I suppose one could always venture up or down one floor though. BreakfastThere is free breakfast in the morning from 8-11, but this was too late for me. I would suggest they do something to start it a bit earlier.Overall, convenient location and inexpensive for NYC.",Voiceunderground,32,4.0

Our rooms were very basic but clean and spacious enough (although that could be because we had 3 person rooms for 2 people). The beds aren't all that comfortable but they replaced our pillows with nice new squishy ones a couple of days in and that hugely improved the situation. The rooms have TVs in them with cable which is good.The shared bathrooms were pretty average, definitely recommend wearing thongs in the shower. Some friends said the hot water would run out at 'peak' periods but we never had an issue. The hotel has several free wifi signals, some of which seem to work better than others. It would mostly work well but occaisionally it was slow or difficult to get connected.Despite being quite far uptown, the location of the hotel is actually fairly good. It is just off Broadway (not the theatre part, obviously) which has a good selection of restaurants, fast food shops, a Starbucks and grocery stores. There is also a really good (maybe famous?) bagel shop very close by on Broadway which we got breakfast from a lot. There are a couple of Subway stations close by (the 1 or C trains) which allows you to get downtown (or wherever else you might want to go) easily. There are lots of laundromats nearby as well which was very convenient.For anyone wondering (like I was) we booked with Agoda and didn't have an issue with our booking.Overall we were satisfied with this hotel. If you're not fussy and mostly just want a decent place to sleep and shower, this hotel could definitely be for you.","Bedford, Australia",7,3.0

The next morning we returned to the reception desk and the matter has been resolved overnight. (The booking had been placed with a spelling mistake by the travel agents.)We were moved to another room on the 6th floor immediately. The rooms are very clean yet basic; personally I'd say it's ideal for a cheap city break as long as you're not expecting anything special. It had all we needed and did the job as we were out the whole day.

But you do expect the fixtures to be maintained and the place to meet a minimum standard. I'm sorry to say the Morningside Inn did not live up to even low expectations. The toilet was clogged when I arrived (late in the evening) and rather than call for maintenance and wait, I just used the plunger to fix it....but I really shouldn't have had to do that! The room should have been inspected and the problem caught before I arrived. Also, the toothbrush holder was falling off the wall, the faucets at the sink were loose, the blinds were broken, the carpet was ancient, worn, and dingy, and the radiator made the room too hot but there was no thermostat to turn it down. The ancient pipes made a banging noise, too.While I'm complaining (and really, I don't usually complain very much....just read my other reviews, which are mostly very positive!), I will add that there was no bedside lamp in this dark room. While there was room for a small nightstand and a lamp between the two beds in the room, there was just empty space -- and the nightstand with a lamp, and a lampshade still wrapped in plastic -- was on the opposite wall.Oh yes, and the wifi worked only sporadically. It kept going down to such low strength that it was unusable.On the plus side (since I always want to be fair to places like this), the inn is in a quiet but interesting Upper West Side neighborhood, 3 blocks from the 110th St subway, and if you don't spend much time in the room and you get it at a good price, it would be a good place to stay, IF some basic repairs, maintenance, and sprucing up could be done.

It was not fixed even after reporting. There was a bedside lamp with no bulb. The bathtub was small with no proper shower. The knob fell off the first time we turned it and had to take bath in cold water since it wouldn't fix properly. We somehow worked upon that but the water was either very hot or very cold.

Location. Very nice area on the upper west side of Manhattan. Lots of restaurants, pubs, coffee shops close by. We walked around late at night and didn't feel unsafe. 2. Close to public transit: bus stop is within a 2-minute walk and subway a 5-min walk. 3. Bedroom is clean, sheets and towels smell nice and the cable works well. Shower has great water pressure, bathroom was clean as well.4. There is a fully equipped kitchen for guests' use. So if you're on a budget, you can buy frozen food or whatever and cook there. Now for the bad things about... 1. Rude staff: I never had such a bad first impression of a hotel before. We got there and without even greeting us, the gentleman at the counter asked for our reservation number. We gave him. He said ""your room is not ready, come back in 15 minutes."" And that was that. My husband and I were looking at each other, baffled, not knowing how to handle such unfriendliness. We left, and came back 40 minutes later. Our room was ready, but the staff (a different person) was unfriendly and unhelpful once again. We only stayed there because it was a busy weekend in NYC (Pope visit and Global Citizen Festival) plus we'd driven around for 30 min trying to park... otherwise we would have left. 2. Noise!!!! If you enjoy sleeping past 8 am, find somewhere else to stay. You can hear people talking, laughing, ""having fun"" in the rooms surrounding yours; you can hear people's footsteps in the hallway and you can certainly hear the staff yelling at each other in Spanish! 3. Room was super small (the bathroom sink was right beside the bed, IN the bedroom) and furniture was outdated; no mirrors, no closet. 4. No parking (there is, however, a parking garage on the same street for $25/day or on the next street north for $20/day)5. No breakfast or room service (not a big deal to us, as there are SO many options just down the street, but if you're super tired and don't want to change from your pj's you're out of luck).","Toronto, Ontario, Canada",10,3.0

The hotel it's self done just the job for me but I don't think some people would be impressed. I wouldn't say there's anything majorly wrong with this place but the interior is a bit worn and old. My worn and old I just mean small things which most likely wouldn't bother people (including myself) like a lot of loses screws in door latches, ceiling fans, towel rails ect. If you touch something there's a good chance is going to move or seem like you're about to break something for good. The only other down I can put on this place which again is only a small one is that the toilet roll didn't seem to be changed on a regular basis, at times you'd have to walk from bathroom to bathroom looking for the one with paper left.Ok so that's the downs of this place, let's talk about the good parts. The staff were very helpful and friendly, always someone at the main desk no matter what time. Like I said earlier, not a bad location for your money and close to the subway which is only a 5 minute train journey to Times Square. The rooms are basic but they are clean and are all fitting with ceiling fans and air con with was great after coming back from a hot day outside. Really don't know what else to say about this place, it has no great features or a wow factor but at the same time only has minor flaws.

Had no problems with hot water (seen a few reviews where they had no hot water, but we never had this issue during our 2 week stay).Bedroom has air conditioning which was excellent, and a big fridge to store food in the room too. No kettle for making a hot drink, so I just bought tea from cafes instead.No hair dryer in the bedroom, luckily I brought my own. Also brought a few coat-hangers with me which was good because the wardrobe only had 3. Wifi was temperamental - some days wifi did not work, some days it worked perfectly fine. But everywhere in New York has free wifi so you won't be without. TV in room worked well. The towels were changed daily, bedsheets changed every few days - housekeeping made our room up every day. Rooms a bit shabby but clean overall. Reception staff were friendly enough - someone was always on the desk whenever we walked past reception.I did try and email hotel twice before arriving to confirm arrival time as I had made a mistake in my original booking. I also emailed to ask if they had hairdryers available - they didn't respond to any of my emails so maybe communication is a bit poor, so in the end I just bought my own hairdryer with me. Kitchen on every floor, but with no pots/pans is a bit useless - but we just ate out every day so didn't need to use it. We would stay again, it's cheap and in a great location in Manhattan, and worth the price you pay. Also there was no noise at all in the room. It's on a quiet street, couldn't hear a single noise whilst sleeping which was a nice surprise in NYC!",,35,4.0

Initially concerned as receptionist couldn't find our booking (made around 1 month ago through a 3rd party site) however booked us in (and as 2 friends travelling together gave us a twin room rather than the cheaper double that we had booked). Checked with reception the next morning and they had sorted everything out. Older building with narrow corridors but had a lift to 4th floor which was good. Clean linen and towels. Creaky beds but comfortable. Air-conditioning was good (but room also had fans). Shared bathrooms which rarely had to wait for. Bathrooms a little run down but hot showers and good water pressure. Surprisingly quiet. Very good location to 2 different subway lines into Lower Manhattan. Very close to both Hudson river park area and Central Park.

The place is a dump. I had a room with two lumpy beds (one double, one twin) with barely more than 18 inches between the beds. The furniture looked like it was picked up at a garage sale or from a NYC curb. The AC Window unit was the smallest I had ever seen - about 12 inches and only worked intermittently. Also intermittent WI-FI. Finnaly, and worst of all, there was NO HOT WATER for morning showers. I should have been suspicious about the water situation when I checked in. I stayed on the 3rd floor and decided to walk down the stairs - and I noticed a signn on the floor below me that said because of a problem with the boiler there would be no hot water until Noon on Friday. Well, since I checked in on Friday afternoon, I assumed the problem was fixed. When getting ready for bed that night, I only used cold water to wash at sink and brush my teeth. The next morning, when attempting to take a shower there was no hot water. I called the desk at 8:00 AM and the person said U.S., they knew about the problem and that they had a call in to the boiler company to fix the problem.

Moreover, there was no hot water and I called the staff to check , they came and checked but no action!! But still the last nail in the coffin was missing and that happened to me next day. I booked my room for 2 days and next morning , Patrick the manager told me that I have paid for only one room and I had to pay for another room or expedia who booked. He told me the other room I booked has already been checked out by someone , it was hilarious as that was on my wife name and we were together, moreover his attitude was too arrogant like rooms are for free.I completed my new York trip but this is the first time as I have such terrible experience where I have to waste my one day, thinking that I might end up paying twice.

The hotel was a considerable distance from all the main New York attractions, and any savings made in the cost of the room were swallowed up by the cost of transportation.The neighbourhood (a Mexican Spanish speaking neighbourhood) itself is quite interesting, but it was two or three days before we felt entirely comfortable to walk about and make the short trip to the nearest Subway station at Cathedral Parkway, on Broadway between W 109th and W 110th Streets. The hotel itself is on W 107th, a pleasant street, and is flanked on one side by a very impressive church and on the other by a building housing a project for unemployed people. The facade of the hotel is nice, with an inviting lobby. Unfortunately the rooms were something else...The upper floors are accessed by a small elevator, or by a winding marble staircase (not as impressive as it sounds!). We had a room with en-suite facilities, but there are many shared bathroom, toilet and cooking facilities on all floors. Our room was averaged-sized, with two comfortable double beds. The decor was quite shabby, especially the carpet, and the furniture looked as though it had been purchased from a second-hand store or a charity shop. Some handles were broken or missing, and the bedside cabinet had a wooden wedge placed underneath it to stop the drawer falling open of it's own accord. The bathroom was horrible, with a grimy-looking suite and mould around the edge of the bath and showerThere is a metal heating pipe running the height of the building at the front, and where it entered our room through the floorboards there was a small gap in the floor. It wasn't until our final night that we realised that this was where the mouse (or mice) had been getting into our room at night. A hole had been gnawed through my bag in the search for food! If I had known about the rodent problem before the last night, I would not have been comfortable staying there, despite being an animal lover!When we checked out the next morning, I of course mentioned the presence of our nocturnal visitor to the receptionist, but this was met with nothing more than a shrug of the shoulders and a tilt of the head. Generally though, the staff were friendly enough, but don't expect English to always be spoken as a first language. We accepted the offer to arrange our transportation back to the airport, but this turned out to be provided by what I assume to be a family or business associate who charged more than the set Yellow Cab rate. Overall, we will not be returning. The hotel is cheap, but that's exactly what you get. Too far uptown for the main sights of Manhattan, but if Mexican social culture is your thing, then this neighbourhood may be a way of living the ""real"" New York experience.","Cradley Heath, United Kingdom",47,2.0

I did not appreciate what it means to check out a hotel room at that time - I do now. I opened the door to the hallway and suddenly realized that I should have had some Febreeze. The sour smell of carpet which had been wet and not dry cleaned was apparent. I should have known something was amiss. But I simply poked my head into the room, saw two beds with clean white linen and said ""thank you"" for the attendant who checked me in. I did not stay very long because I was meeting some friends who happened to be in town from across the country.I returned later and turned on the room light on the wall. The light came on but so did the fan. I tried to turn off the light but keep on the fan. No such luck (initially anyway). I saw a remote control on the wall and decided to play with it. It turned off the light and the fan. I kept clicking until the light went off and the fan stayed on. Thinking I had achieved my objective, I laid in the bed and went to sleep. I woke up later that night and the fan was not longer on. I turned it on again and went back to sleep. I awoke an hour later and it was off again. Playing cat and mouse with the remote, I decided to let it be. I was tired. Around 3:55 am, I heard two people arguing. They were so loud I thought they were standing outside my door. I never heard the staff intercede.I woke up the next morning and decided to shower. I have never been inside a bathtub quite like the one in my room. It was about three feet long and two feet wide. I laughed out loud. It looked like a white bassinet glued to the ground. I then put my back against the wall and extended my leg. It touched the other wall. I am 5'7"". In addition to the micro bathtub, the bathroom had a commode. There were no towel racks and no mirror or sink. The sink was in the main room. To use it, I had to sit on the edge of the bed. The cabinet doors did not shut and they had no handles. As I stepped into the micro bathtub, I turned around and there it was. A window into the shower area. No curtain or covering lie between my naked body and the four windows from the adjacent building. I finished showering, stepped out to get my cellphone, and took two photos. I have added them to this review.Before I left that morning, an employee asked me to give her my dirty towels. I did so. As I left the room, I noticed that the door did not close properly. I had to lock the door from the inside. I had not seen a lock with a ""push button"" in more 35 years. I had been transported back to the 1960s. When I returned to my room, I noticed that two washcloths and two bath towels had been placed into my room. But otherwise, my room looked the same. The bed was unmade and it appeared that no one had been inside. I thought about what kind of ""housekeeping tip"" I would leave upon checkout. The outside temperature dipped to 47 degrees. I looked for some heat. I saw what appeared to be an accordion style heater along the far wall. It was half the size of a regular bed pillow. I then realized there was no air conditioner at all. The heater is controlled by management. I had no option but to sleep in the cold room. I pulled the blanket off the second bed. My feet were still cold. I had to put on a set of socks. Finally, a word on the wifi. It never worked. I laughed at my naivete. I think they owe me for staying at the place. There is absolutely no threat of me staying there again.

Receptionist gave us our keys, let us take our things up and check everything over before we had to come down and settle the balance. The bed bugs reviews made us take a couple of our own blankets, just ones to put down on the bed before we went sleep (airline ones will do) - but room was cleaned, bed was made and towels changed every day.Sheets did have stains on them so they look like they dont get washed a lot - but we had our own blankets so not too bothered - this was the only negative.Great location, Number 1 subway is at 103rd street (4 blocks South) or 110th Street (3 blocks North), only a 5 minute walk from the Hotel.

Or at least I hope so. I sent an email to the hotel but didnt receive any response regarding this matter. BAGS LOSTMy bags were lost during the trip to NYC and were delivered to the hotel. However nobody said that they had arrived and when questioning they said nothing has come. On the second last day I asked after having called to airport luggage department, the lady at the desk found the goods. They were behind the door she was sitting. At the very same corridor she has to go through to get his office? Actually I dont know did I lose something, but if I did it was maximum of 200 USD, since I am not completely sure how much money did I have in my luggage.LOCATIONHotel has good location and the rooms look clean but as stated before I got bedbugs and had to go Home depot to get the poison and spend 4 hours poisoning them. THE ROOMI got a two bed room and it was ok considering the price but the heating systems sound is like the sound of 1980's vacuum cleaner which would start hoovering once per hour. The thing gives steam all over the room and you dont want to have your hand touch that thing while sleeping. The beds were mediocre, a bit old and too soft for me.OTHER FACILITIESThe communal shower was clean at all times.THE STAFFCleaning personel was very nice and clerks at desk were nice as well. Personally I would take seriously bed bug issue as they are nasty creatures and ruin the hotel's reputation (and because of this I have to give only one point for cleanliness . For me that is big no no and thus cannot return ever to this hotel. And I got no response to email.WOULD I COME AGAINUnfortunately not. Had it not been bed bugs, then I would have said yes since I can sleep regardless of medium level noice and the location is nice as it it close to subway stations.

I had the budget single room, which had a full/dbl size bed, mini fridge, sink (with no mirror), small dresser, small closet, and TV (which didn't work). I paid like $80/night (total for three nights came to $270) and the room size was perfect for me since I traveled solo. I was right next to the bathroom in the hall, so that was a plus also. I didnt' have to walk down the hall or far from my room. I had two issues with this hotel. The first was that I booked this through www. agoda.com and when I went to confirm my reservation the day before my arrival, the hotel didn't have me in the system. Luckily, the front desk person (Wendy) was nice and she said that they have plenty of rooms and I would have one when I arrived the next day. So, I then called Agoda to see what the mix-up was. They, too, were nice about it and called the hotel while I waited on hold to make sure I was in their system. No one could tell me why I wasn't in the hotel system. I'm glad I called ahead of time! Jeez!My second issue was that when I got to the hotel (I stayed Thus thru Sunday) the TV didn't work. I didn't try to turn it on until Fri morning while I was getting ready for my day. It said something about a remote and there was not a remote in the room. So I stopped by the front desk on my way out and told the front desk person. She said that they were in the middle of converting from old to new cable boxes, so some rooms had cable and some didn't. Of course I had a room with no cable. She said she would talk to the manager (Patrick). I stopped back by Fri night and she said the manager said the TVs should be back on Sat. I said ok and asked when he would be in the office. She said from 8-4pm so I was going to try and catch him Sat. Sat morning about 9am I stop by the front desk and she said Patrick hadn't come in yet because he had to work overnight, but that he should be there by noon. Well I was on my way out for the day and was not gonna wait around for him. I was leaving the next day (Sunday) and at this point it was ridiculous playing cat and mouse. My point of trying to talk to Patrick was to get some kind of compensation for my stay. I understand that most people aren't even in their rooms half the time, but I'm one that likes the TV on when I am getting ready in the morning and watches it before I go to sleep at night. It would have simply been nice to know I had a room with no TV when I checked in that I had no working TV because to me that's false advertising.PROS: Only 3 blocks to subway, Great price for the location, right next to my bank/ATM, close to food/restaurantsCONS: Communication sucked (between Agoda and the hotel with my reservation, and the fact that no one told my I had a non-working TV). Too far from where I spent most of my time. I was primarily in lower Manhattan so it took 35-45min by subway ride.

As we walked in, we observed an angry guest throwing his keys at the desk clerk and yelling at him because there was no hot water. We asked about that. The man at the desk identified himself as Patrick, the manager, and told us that the hot water was being fixed ""as we speak"". So, we decided to check in anyway after looking at the room, which was small but clean and adequate for our needs. Patrick told us he was going to give us a discount because ""we seemed like nice ladies"" So, he took 10% or $30 off the rate and we checked in.We went out for the day, came back in the evening and there was still no hot water. We asked the desk clerk about it and she said they had called someone and they were gonna come and fix it. Hmmm... Patrick had said they were already there. What was THAT all about?In the morning, there was STILL no hot water! We were getting concerned because we had a black-tie event to attend that evening and really wanted to shower first!!We went downstairs and Patrick was at the desk. We told him that we were concerned because there was still no hot water. He abruptly said it was fixed. My friend, who used to own a hotel, told him that she felt that an additional adustment should be made on the rate for last night due to the lack of hot water. He started screaming at us and saying that he had already given us a discount and what did we want him to lose his job? He was very insistent that the water was fixed. But, we had just left the room and the water was cold when we left, so I decided to go back upstairs and check the water again and if it was hot then, we would have just let the whole thing go. Well, it was still stone cold. I went back downstairs only to discover that Patrick had kicked my friend out of the building, called the police and told me to leave as well. He said he felt threatened and in danger of bodily harm by us and we needed to get out. I was flabbergasted. Here is this big burly guy threatened by 2 middle-aged women??? So we waited outside to see if the police were really coming. And they did! They went inside and he told them that there had been a disturbance but the problem people had left. We found this out when the police came out and we asked them. We then told them we were ""the problem"". They looked at each other and chuckled. We told them the whole story. I was afraid that he would throw our belongings out in the street but the police assured us that it was safe to leave our things in the room, that the hotel staff would not touch them and we had a right to stay in the room because we had paid for it. They further went on to say that we had a right to have hot water and if our belongings were disturbed, we were to call 911 and they would help us. If we did not already have a full day planned, we had not already paid $300 non-refundable for the room and if there had been a vacancy in the City at Christmas-time, we would have gone elsewhere. But the police were very reassuring, so we took the chance and left for the day.We returned around 5pm. Our belongings were still in the room and untouched and, lo and behold, there was hot water!!!

We used the room to sleep, and agree with others that its nice that the subway is close.

A man told me over the phone that they were found, but didn't know how to arrange the delivery. I contacted the hotel manager as he suggested, and he seemed like he's going to take care of it, just asked me to email my address to him. They probably aren't anymore in the lost and found but in trash, and despite my call and two emails, I never got any response to them. Even a fact that it for some reason would not be possible to post them would've been fine, but nothing. Although its kinda my own fault to leave personal belongings behind, some kind of gesture towards the issue would've been helpful.

I stayed in a ""Budget Single"" room. There was NO 32"" Flat-Screen TV, NO Desk, NO Chair, No AM/FM Radio..And NO HEAT for 2-3 days! I stayed at the end of October 2013 and I needed heat!They provided me 2 towels a day, DAMP towels, not dry towels. When I asked them to bring me some dry towels, the towels they brought were also DAMP. The woman just said, 'sorry' and something about the machines that they have to use downstairs.Disgusting shared bathrooms. On my floor was 19 rooms, there were 2 shared bathrooms. One bathroom had a toilet that was clogged with ""you-no-what"" and the shower would not work. When I complained, they just LOCKED the door. The other bathroom was okay, but when I went to use it, there was water on the floor from the previous person using the bathroom. There was no floor mat or anything on the floor. Thus, I had to put one of my towels down to keep my feet wet. There was no place to hang my clothes and towels. The only 'hook' was on the back of the door which was broken off. Thus, the only place for me to place my clothes and towels was on the toilet seat....I could go on and on about this place.The ONLY GOOD thing about this place? It is about 3 blocks from the Subway.

This was no problem, he was told that they would hold their bags and to return after 2:00 to check in. He returned at 3:30 P.M. and tried to check in. I accompanied him to the hotel and this is what happened.We were told that their computers were down and that it would be anywhere from 4:40 P.M. to 7:00 P.M. before he could expect to get checked in. We asked if there might be a way to ask maid services which rooms might be ready as he was only going to be there overnight. We were told that this was not possible, and we were asked to sit in the lobby and wait until the maids shift ended at 7:00 P.M. if the computers did not come up. The reason for this was not really explained we were just told to wait or we could just get another room somewhere else. We tried to impart to the registration girl that we had hoped to get into the room at ""check in time"" (2:00 P.M.) and the fact that it was now 4:00 in the afternoon and he would be checking out by 8:00 A.M. the next morning. We were informed that they had 80 rooms and that she had no way of knowing which rooms were ready and therefore she could not let us into any room until either ""the computers come back up (or) the maids give them room list at 7:00 P.M.I have to say this is without a doubt, a very BAD CHOICE if you need to stay near Columbia University, do not choose this hotel.

She called the manager who i guess was feeling reeeeeally generous as she hung up and gave us keys to another larger room. the fact that it states you need to pay on arrival- and she said we can pay tomorrow- was i guess because she couldnt be bothered to do any work. the rooms were very basic- but not too bad i guess.. and the rest of the staff were fine- especially the lady working friday morning when we checked out.the only other issue was when we went to check out their card machine wasnt working- we tried 3 cards between us- they tried everything so i guess there was some fault.. the wifi wasnt great either- it didnt reach our room - which was only just behind reception- so we had to hover in the reception if we wanted to use it...,"London, United Kingdom",3,3.0

Patrick and he confirmed that everything is fine. We also informed him that we will be arriving around 10 p.m. due to our flight schedule.We arrived to the hotel at Friday night and the receptionist told us that they are overbooked and they have no available rooms. She also told us that they had a system failure and she has been dealing with this kind of situations the whole day. We asked her to call the manager on the phone and she did. We were standing 2 meters away from her and we could hear him shouting at her. When she hung up the phone, she started crying and told us that she will find another hotel for us for the night and in the morning the manager will refund the costs. Since it was rather late, it took her 2 hours to find available hotel and it was for 220$ per night. We agreed to go to that hotel and return in the morning, when they should have available room for us. She apologized once more and said that this happens all the time at this hotel. At the same time when this was happening, other guests arrived at the hotel and were in the same situation. They didn't want to go to another hotel because it was simply too expensive for them so they spent the night in the basement, sleeping on chairs.So, we slept at another hotel for 220$ and we payed a taxi to take us there and our total costs were 270$. We saved the bills and in the morning we were back at Morningside Inn. The manager, mr. Patrick was at the front desk and we told him about our problem last night and presented him the bills. His first line was: oh, it's You that made my employee cry last night! After that he said that it is against hotel policy to refund the money in cash and it is not possible to refund it to our credit card and that he will call Agoda to make the refund and then charge the hotel, but since it is Saturday, we should not expect anything before Monday. On Monday morning we came down to ask him if there were any news and he said that we do not have to worry, that he called Agoda, and he will take care of everything. We also made a complaint about a certain pipe in our room which was blowing off steam loudly and was dripping durring the night. He said he will fix it – he didn't.On Tuesday morning we asked him again if he received any written confirmation from Agoda and he said that we have to make the call and that we can use the phone in our room. In the evening when we wanted to make the call, we noticed that the phone was unplugged and there wasn't a phone socket in the room! We managed to make the call from the front desk and we got an answer from Agoda customer service that nobody reported this issue to them. We sent an e-mail explaining the problem, with bills in the attachment and got an answer that we should settle the issue with the hotel. The receptionist told us that the manager will be at the hotel on Friday.On Friday morning (this has been going on for a whole week) we told mr. Patrick that we contacted Agoda, that they told us they didn't receive any calls from him and that all we want is a written confirmation of what he told us before or to call Agoda right now. Mr. Patrick got up from his chair and got verbaly very agressive and rude! It wasn't possible to communicate with him because he was shouting and didn't want to hear anything we were saying! He said that it was not his fault that the hotel didn't have a room for us on the first night because Agoda never informed him about our reservation (mr. Patrick probably forgot that he confirmed our reservation by e-mail) and that it's our fault that we booked through Agoda!?? He called us liars, told us that we are bullying him for something that was not his problem! This argument was going on for 15 minutes and mr. Patrick could not calm down. At this point we started to worry about our safety at the hotel and the safety of our belongings. Since, our flight was on Saturday and this was our last day at the Morningside Inn, we were afraid that if we go back home, we will never get our money back. So we found our country's Consulate office and went there for advice. The Consul called mr. Patrick on the phone and asked for an explanation. Again mr. Patrick was rude in his communication and the Consul told him that he will advise us to report this to higher authorities. Few hours later we started receiving e-mails from Agoda that everything has been taken care of and that the money has been refunded to our credit card. When we came back to the hotel, mr. Patrick was at the front desk and told us that we are very rude people who are trying to dishonor him and his hotel and that he got all the paperwork from Agoda but now he just won't give it to us. We will never return to this hotel or recomend it to anyone, just because the way how the manager treats his guests (we were not the only ones with the problem there), he has serious issues, acts disrecpectful, speaks sarcastic and really doesn't do his job properly. We travel very often and we never had such bad experience. If You go through other reviews You'll see that this happens frequently.","Zagreb, Croatia",9,1.0

We were sent to another cheap motel on the other side of the city, far away from Morningside Inn's good location.

Of course, it was difficult and so I settled for this hostel as it's location is good and indeed one of the cheapest in NYC. Reservation was not as efficient as I hoped. I had to call numerous times as I found out that the room I booked was not actually reserved for me and offered to somebody else. Well, they sorted it out after several long distance calls, but I almost had to beg them to give me assurance that I'll have a room when I get there. I booked a standard single and it was even worse than my very low expectation. It was a really tiny room with a small window and furniture that looked like it was bought from a flea market or salvaged from a garage sale. It was a nightmare and I really didn't even want to sit on the bed. I felt so sorry for myself for traveling on a budget, I wanted to cry. The view from the window was depressing. The shared bathroom was soooo bad I stopped myself from drinking liquids to limit my use of the toilet. After 2 sleepless nights, i tried asking Patrick to transfer me to a deluxe room or anything better than what I had and luckily they found one for me. Patrick was helpful. The new room I got was wayyy better, with my own toilet and bath. Still not the best, but at that time it was a big relief for me. Room was still small but a lot bigger than the previous one. It was decent enough. Wifi is only available at the lobby. I had to sit on the stairs. On their website they say that they have a common room/lounge area at the basement where there's wifi. Yes, there's a lounge area that was pretty scary and empty, and of course, there's no wifi there.","Sydney, Australia",32,3.0

I booked a budget single room and my friends booked a budget double and I asked if we could have rooms on the same floor, which was fulfilled. We were given 2 rooms on the 4th floor. Upon arrival we were booked in & my friends had a double bed, drawers, wardrobe, sink, a fridge & a TV in their room. My room had a double bed, a chest of drawers and a mirror and not much else. I enquired about a TV as budget singles were described as having TV’s in all rooms. The lovely lady, Wendy, on reception said that there wasn’t much that she could do that evening but would see what she could do the following day. When I got back to my room in the afternoon of the following day I had a very large, & what looked like brand new, TV!As for the shared bathrooms, not once during my stay did I have a problem finding one. There are two on each floor & one of them was always free. They were very clean and seemed to be cleaned regularly. There is also a maid service and we were given fresh towels every day and the bed was made up (and sheets changed a couple of times during a 7 night stay). Although there was often a smell of disinfectant around the place, it was reassuring to know how much it was cleaned. Not one cockroach or bedbug in sight!I suffer with a bad back but found the bed to be very comfortable, despite some of the reviews that I had read previously. This may vary from room to room though.Even though we were on the 4th floor, there was a strong WiFi signal and we never had a problem with the WiFi. (Reception will give you the passwords for the various WiFi signals).The hotel/hostel is in a great area – so many bars and places to eat. We found some great bars and met some lovely locals. The area also feels very safe. The metro is nearby, just a few blocks away. It’s good to walk around the area a bit though to discover the many very good places to eat/drink.I would definitely recommend this place to friends and I would also stay there again. The only problem we found was the other guests who, most of the time, seemed insensitive and selfish and enjoyed slamming doors!

We checked with the hotel direct and were given a low price. We had noted the high regard in which Patrick was held and that influenced our decision to book. We received and returned a credit card confirmation that clearly gave the price and the correct dates. However, when we arrived the desk staff denied having a reservation for us but found a room for one night saying that Patrick would be there the following morning. When we spoke to him Patrick denied that we had been given the price for three nights and said we had to leave. He flatly refused to look at the document he had sent us or at our email correspondence. His ground for requiring us to leave (apart from being full) was that the price was far too low for three nights and we should have realised that. He became very aggressive (verbally but not physically) and I was getting so stressed by the way in which he was addressing me that I had to walk away. A quick check has just shown that for February next year the prices quoted are roughly what we were given for April this year. We have checked again since we arrived home and at no time was the rate referred to as a nightly rate. On every occasion we gave the same three days and these dates never changed. The amount we ended up having to pay for the one night was slightly more than half what we had been quoted for three nights. The hotel to which we moved was considerably more expensive but considerably better.

Having a basic room at that price was exactly what I wanted. If I can save money by not having a private bathroom, then I definitely want that, especially if I'm just traveling by myself. The shared bathrooms where kept clean anyways so that was nice. I had lots of storage space within the room for clothing or whatever. The thing that stood out most to me however was how kind the staff was to me. Everyone was so nice! I have been to other hostels where the staff wasn't as welcoming so this was great, it really means a lot to me when people are so kind. I accidently locked my key in my room and the woman at the front desk during the late night shift was very nice about helping me get back in. I was worried that I would be seen as a pain but she was so pleasant and helpful. Overall this is a great place if you are looking for a budget room, like I was.

I called them to inform the situation and they told me that there was no problem to arrive 2 days after.When I finally got there they told me that my reservation was cancelled and that they didn´t have any room available. After the shock I showed them the on-line reservation and only then they gave me a room that I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. It was smelly, tiny, with no bathroom, no tv. I was afraid to look under the blankets because it felt dirty.

The flat screen TV worked, the bathroom had fresh clean towels that appeared new, and the bed had a nice sheet and duvet--all clean.

Only reason I was in this inn was an error in booking my next accommodation was made and this place was given as an option.....they have been informed of the state of this inn.It is a lower cost place ($105.00 per night) - but I would not recommend it unless there are no other optionsavailable( WIFI is only available in the front reception area - other guests sitting on the stairs on their computers - poor WIFI signal from conversations with these people)OK - to begin - I had trouble finding the room within this Inn. After getting my luggaqe up to the 4th floor in the tiniest elevator I have ever been on I searched for 412 troughout the whole 4th floor. I had to go back to the lobby and was informed that I should have turned right and go through the door at the end of the hall - but make sure I closed the door behind me as my room was 4 inches behind this hallway door into a dark hallway. Written in felt pen on the door was the number 412 in what looked more like a storage cupboard. There was a dresser, a small mattress wrapped in plastic and it had a yellowed fitted sheet on it and a folded flat sheet ...that's all. No towels, no blanket, no bed spread, there was pieces of garbage on the floor as there was no garbage pail. I put my luggage in room, locked the door and went back to the lobby and the receptionist came back up with me and was surprised at the condition of the room as well. -Said that it must not have been cleaned?? She went off - but was not able to find me a blanket, she brought 4 extra flat sheets and a single towel, and face cloth. ( No offer to make up the bed) Now the bathroom.... It also took a while to find it - (yet another trip to the lobby) - Found it was locked, so never did see the one closest to the room. (keep in mind this is all happening after midnight) Found one at the other end of the Inn and it was not clean. Shower/tub was full of body hair! Toilet not flushed!! No toilet paper?? ( Found out next morning that they supply TP in the guest room...but as I did not have even towels so it was understandable that I would not have TP either) Upon return to room I saw a small four legged, long tailed creature dash down the hall - Put on a jogging suite and socks, put up the hood and lay on the bed waiting for morning. Did not sleep well at all, noise from rain, other rooms and it and was very glad to depart to a wonderful B&B uptown. ( FYI - I own a B&B/Inn in B.C.

I made a confirmed reservation on line with a deposit through my credit card for a new night stay at the Inn. I arrived at 10:30 pm with my 10 year old daughter and my immunosuppressed disabled sister-in-law (we were in town to see her daughter). We were told there had been a mistake and they had no rooms. We were told this happens frequently. A young woman spent an inordinate amount of time trying to deal with us but told us she had no authority to help us in anyway except to call another hotel. We had to go stay at a hotel with which more than twice as expensive and very far away. By the time we arrived it was 12:30 pm. The next day I called to try to speak to the manager starting at 8:00 am. One number on their card listed as “switch board” did not work at all. The other number was never answered and so I left a series of messages saying we assumed we would have a place to stay for the second night but could not travel all the way back up town as we only had one day in NYC and we wanted to sight-see, not spend hours dealing with the hotel and for the manager to please call back. When we made it back up at 5 pm there was a new young woman with no authority telling us she had no room for us. She could not reach the manager and claimed we had not called but then played one of the messages I had left that said “Hi, I am calling again…” She told us the manager was not allowed to call us back as it was an “out of town” number. She could not reach the manager. Another 1 and ½ hours later (lots of time when you have ONE day in NYC), we took the subway to another much less desirable neighborhood for a more expensive hotel. Upon arriving home I called the manager (Patrick) who was unbelievably rude, never apologized, only offered to refund the deposit and claimed again I could have never left a message for him. He finally hung up on me. This situation seems especially wrong as they surely would have kept a full night’s fee had I not shown up. Is there no recourse?Thank you for your time.","Northampton, Massachusetts",0,1.0

Firstly they gave me a key to a room where somebody was sleeping and had all their belongings. After that error they ""upgraded"" me to a new room and assured me that nobody would have access to my room key. The upgrade wasn't exactly special; and it probably meant that the person who booked that room got downgraded. The beds are almost unsafe; they have springs poking into your body and make a noise whenever you move. Impossible to sleep. I was woken on the second morning to the sound of my room heater blowing steam from a small piston that could not be turned off. I thought it was going to blow up. My room heated up so much that I had to go outside and I feared for my belongings. It happened to all the heaters in the hotel and everyone went to reception, only to be told that she didn't know what to do and that the manager wasn't answering his phone. The whole place smells of bleach, the staff didn't speak English when they were trying to assign me a room and I felt very uncomfortable, like I was an inconvenience to them, when it was their error for giving me an occupied room.

No reply to email sent to the web site so just before leaving tried the other email on the Hotel site and received a confirmation notice. Just as well because when we arrived from the airport with printed out reservation in hand we were told that we were not on their system and the Hotel was full. It wasn't until I provided proof with the 'confirmation' email from the Hotel that they took us seriously. The receptionist was very nice and tried to sort it out by ringing the Manager but he did not respond and then the lady for the evening shift appeared. We ended up being given someone else's booking for the first night at a lesser standard than we had reserved and were told that we would have to move in the morning and the Manager would sort it out. So back we went the following morning at 0800 and met the Manager (who was very nice also) who told us we could leave our rooms in another room which would be ours after it was cleaned on our return. We returned late that night to find our bags had been moved to a smaller room but at least it had an ensuite. The bed was so uncomfortable as you could feel the wires & springs through the covers. In the end they never charged us so we only paid the deposit for the 2 night stay.

It was very hot and there was no AC but no complaints here, since it was advertised that budget rooms do not have AC.

You are 3 blocks away from the 110th street subway station which is serviced by the red line that can get you downtown, but be advised that it is not an express line and it stops in every single station there is, so if you need to get to Times Square, for example, you will have 9 stops along the way.The most frustrating thing was that the total due on arrival as per the booking information was not in fact the final total due. Oh yes, there were taxes! Would it kill anyone to put an extra line in the final due computation that states the tax amount??!! For two nights it was an additional 35 dollars worth of taxes and fees. The invoice had some 5 separate lines with different taxes adding towards the final amount due. We have stayed in a couple of other budget places but have seen such practice for the first time. We compared prices with other establishments before booking and it would have helped a lot in making a better decission, should the tax be included in the advertised price.The bed had a mattress with springs that were hurting the back, plus the bed was so noisy that you couldn't make a slight move in it without waking up the other person. I am almost sure that the neighbours could hear it too, as I deffinitely could hear them.The sheets looked crisp and washed but were still stained. This was desgusting. Is it that much of a cost to buy new linens from time to time? The room was extremely small (under 2 feet of space on each side of the bed), but I guess that is something you can expect in Manhattan.

It is only 3 blocks north or south of the subway entrance being 110th on Broadway or 103rd on Broadway which puts you on the red line.

The room was neat & tidy with two double beds, fridge, R/C A/C, shower in the bath,flat screen TV, ceiling fan hand basin & bar heater. Small items of repair that the room needs are: tiles coming up in floor of bathroom, security chain on the door needs to be replaced, door lock & latch on entrance door to the room need to be replaced as while they where function able, the door did not close entirely. There is a communal Kitchen with a microwave & stove on each floor except the lower & there are stairs & elevator to go up & down on. In the basement there is the laundry which the washing machine worked ok but the dryer was U/S in the four days we where there. Also in the basement there is a common room where the internet works the best, which is also free. There is a vending machine for coke & the likes as well as chips. If you need other coin op Laundromats there is one on 107th & Amsterdam where the dryers are great & one on 107th & Broadway where the machines are very clean but not as hot. There is a market on 107th & Broadway which is excellent for getting food to eat in your room & with the microwave you can heat up food at a later date. I had paid for breakfast but when I booked in the receptionist said they no longer do breakfasts LL no real problem as you can get breakfast anywhere in NYC but the convenience would have been great. TV at reception was a bit noisy one night but when asked for them to turn it down a bit it was no problem.

Very limited lodging options in this neck of the woods, but I fully recommend it to get a true local experience. No sign out front in this quiet (again, relative), residential street. As others have noted, a safe area, but don't be careless. Clean and basic, felt like a dormitory almost. Myself and two buddies got a standard triple room with one full and one single bed. Tight quarters for 3 grown men, but it wasn't awful. Reasonable closet space, dresser, fridge, small tv hanging from the ceiling. Fresh towels and soap daily, beds made up. Did not have a private bath, but rarely had to wait to use the one on our floor. Kitchen wasn't really stocked with anything, but if you were staying a while and got your own stuff, it would really help. We just got some snacks from the West Side Market, a quintessentially New York local grocer. Grab the house special at the Hungarian Coffee Shop around the corner to start your day off right. Bedding is basic, but adequate. I can't imagine how some of these bed divas would have survived in earlier eras. The three of us thought they were fine. No noise issues. Easy access to the 1 train, which can get you just about anywhere. Unless you have physical limitations or deep pockets, don't bother with cabs. The system is easy to learn, cheap, reliable, quick, and provides great people-watching.Internet was only available in the little sitting area next to the front desk, but free and clear. I emailed the property with some questions a few days before going and never got a response. They may have been offended that I used the term 'hostel.' My bad. I think there was one other negative, but I forget what it was. I work in a 5-star joint, so I had to seriously adjust my expectations, but what I found was a great value in a great spot in NYC. With the same budget, it's where I'd stay again.Tip: don't ignore the local sites. The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is breathtaking, as is Riverside Church.

It is an easy ride from downtown on the subway and a $2.50 bus ride on the M60 from La Gaurdia. If you buy a seven day metro pass as you leave the airport at a cigarette stand, you can use it for the M60. On the street corner of the Morningside Inn is a lovely floral shop which had beautiful Christmas decorations in the window. Next door to it is a very well organized grocery store with delicious fruit on the street. Plus, there is a bagel shop, Absolute Bagels, next to it. There were also restaurants in the neighborhood. Patrick at the office printed us out directions to use the metro system for anywhere that we asked him to do so. There was also a metro system map which we picked up at the office window.

It may not be in the middle of Times Square but is accessible to wherever you might want to go easily by the subway. The metro system is a couple of very short blocks from the hotel, and as you walk home there are three grocery stores in addition to a bakery. The grocery store on the corner was the one we used and had everything you would need down to a can opener. The hotel is in a very safe, quiet residential neighborhood. We never heard any noises inside or outside the hotel during any night of our stay. There were even signs that if you honk your horn you can be fined. Coming from the Sesame Street era, I felt Big Bird was going to step out at any moment as I looked down the street.In addition, we appreciated everyone who worked at the inn. They worked tirelessly to make our stay as pleasurable as possible. The cleaning staff was always busy, and the office staff was always available and very pleasant.. I might mention that Bobby was extra nice and Patrick, the manager, could not have been nicer or more helpful, in addition to his constant smiling face. It was as though we had always known him. He certainly is to be commended.If you want a safe place to stay that doesn't cost an arm and a leg so that you can afford to go to Broadway shows and do other expensive activities, The Morningside Inn is for you and your family.

I do consider myself to have high standards when it comes to hotels, restaurants etc but for somewhere like New York all you need is a base! You literally need somewhere to sleep and get ready in the mornings and this place caters for that perfectly. On my first stay me and my friend had a twin room with a shared bathroom, which, looking back I would probably not do again, however we had no issues getting in to use the bathroom and the room was adequate. Ok, so not all the furniture matches and there was a loud water pipe in the room but it didnt keep us awake, so going back to my original point-it was exactly what we needed. I dont see the point in wasting valuable spending money on accommadation in a place like new York! The second stay there were three of us and we stayed in the apartment suite on the ground floor at the end of the corridor. This consisted of a double bedroom, bathroom with bath and shower, living area with a bed settee and a kitchen area with fridge, freezer, sink and table. We also had a tv in the room and loved watching the American talk shows when were getting ready! Again, it wasnt exactly something out of the pages of an interior design magazine, however it was exactly what we needed.  The location was great too, not too close to cramped midtown and not too far out that is was ever an issue to get about. The subway goes everywhere you need! Although the area is quite quiet, we never felt threatened at all.All in all both of my stays at the Morningside Inn were perfectly accectable for my needs.

The metro station is a 3 minute walk and you can reach midtown Manhattan in 15 minutes for the 2$ cost of a metro ticket. They have a range of rooms - the cheaper ones are what you pay for: very basic, a little dark with a very small shared bathroom. But there were clean, the beds were comfortable enough and they were pretty spacious (as opposed to some other hostels in NYC where you can't even open a suitcase in your room). The second night we staid in their best room, which was very nice and cozy and had all the amenities: en-suite bathroom, airco, small fridge.The staff was friendly and the owner personally apologized to us for the mess up with the booking, even though it was not their fault. Overall, I would definitively recommend this place over some much pricier and crappier places in midtown.","Cape Town, South Africa",5,4.0

We were moved to a lesser room for our final night, which lacked an air conditioner, a private bath, or even a nightstand with lamp by the bed.

We needn't have worried. We arrived a day later than usual (due to Air India no longer using JFK) and late at night. Patrick meet us on arrival and told us that our original room had been let as the travel company hadn't informed him of new arrival date. He was very pleasant and helpful, putting us in an ensuite room (we'd originally booked a budget room with shared bath) telling us to get some sleep and relax and that the room situation would be sorted out the next morning. As it turned out we were allowed to remain in the room and no extra charge which was perfect. Okay, the Morningside isn't the poshest hotel in NY but it was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. The beds were comfortable and the room warm. We did experience a slight problem with hot water (which occasionally did not run more than warm in the early evening) but it was fine for showering. The Morningside is in an excellent location (great for subways and buses). The street was very pretty and extremely quiet at night. Pharmacies and delis, etc are very close at hand.

We ended up paying $100 for each room. They made us check out the next morning so they could put us in one room, but then again made us check out and check back in the 3rd day.

There were no rooms available, except for 2 rooms that were recently fumigated for an infestation of ants. We asked to view the rooms and decided the first room smelt too strongly of chemicals, but the second was tolerable. At the same time a couple from Philly was also being offered one of these 2 rooms as their confirmed reservation simply ""didn't exist"" in the Inn's system. Unfortunately for them we took the better of the two bad rooms, which cost us about $83, whereas the other room was offered to us at $50. I mentioned this to the couple who asked the manager if they could get the worse room for $50. The manager Pat flipped out and asked me why I did that and threatened to give my $83 back and kick us out of the Inn. He also said that he was trying to do us a favor and I was basically ungrateful.

I was verbally abused by the manager, Patrick, who is a bully and a terrible hotel manager. When I spoke to him he became angry very quickly and at one stage he rose to his feet and threatened me. I suspect that he either has mental problems or is just very screwed up. Nobody has ever spoken to me that, never mind a hotel manager who is supposed to be serving you. This all happened on Christmas morning which almost ruined my Christmas day and my experience of New York. At the time I wondered whether I had made some cultural faux pas, but after reading other reviews I realise now that he was looking for an excuse to get into a fight and abuse somebody so that he could feel superior. I am actually quite concerned for anybody who stays here that they may be physically attacked if they say the wrong thing.The hotel itself was nothing special and not worth the extra money we paid. Our first room had wet carpet, smelt bad, and the heater hissed so loud we couldn't hear the television. Furthermore, we had paid extra for the 'superior' room (our Christmas treat) but this was clearly not the best room in the house as we soon discovered.The manager agreed to give us another room the next night, but made us feel like he was doing us a favour every time we spoke to him. We also had problems with the internet, however when I tried to speak to the manager he became extremely angry and insolent.I would highly recommend you steer clear of this hotel and I am surprised that this manager is still working here after my own experience and reading all these reports of people being abused.

The hotel in itself is not bad for the price, the rooms are ok and it’s not too far from central Manhattan. The night staff are nice and friendly. However, I had problems with the daily manager:The first incident happened when I was overcharged by $ 1,013 for my rent, two months before it was due – which is a big deal on a student budget. At first I thought it was a mistake, and when I pointed it out I was told the money would be refunded soon. However, after two weeks it still hadn’t been refunded. When I raised the issue again, the manager flipped completely. He said he had never told me it would be refunded and that it was money that was owed to the hotel. I tried to keep the conversation calm, but he quickly got completely furious and stood up and literally screamed in my face in front of other guests. I have never experienced anything like it, and was forced to just walk away even though I was obviously charged too much, too soon. The second incident happened when I tried to have my boyfriend stay overnight as my guest. The morning after the manager again got very angry and nasty because I was apparently not allowed to have overnight guests. Which is ok in itself, but the manner in which he was acting was very hostile. He said he would have my friend thrown in jail for trespassing even though I had clearly stated that he was my visitor. Ever since these incidents the manager had a very angry attitude, gave me hateful looks and made the whole atmosphere pretty uncomfortable. I don’t know if this aggressiveness was caused by me pointing out that I was charged too much and too soon, or the fact that I’m gay, or a combination of both. Either way it put a definite damper on my experience of New York City. I did hear him having loud arguments with guests on other occasions also, due to missing reservations and overcharging. For short stays, Morningside is ok as long as you don’t have a disagreement with the manager. For longer stays I would recommend looking somewhere else, or alternatively paying in cash (you don’t get a contract.) When I left I was promised I would be refunded for 5 extra nights I had been wrongfully charged for. I still haven't been, though.","London, United Kingdom",4,2.0

After acting like he did us a big favor, he gave us Room #604. What we found were several deficiencies of very basic amenities, from no batteries in the smoke detector to a chain lock that we could simply pull right off the wall to thin, dirty towels. This is in addition to no hot water in the shower and a heating system that turned on once every 12 hours (we slept in our jackets). Mismatched paint on the walls and bird feces inside the windowsill just added to the ambiance within the room.To top off our stay, Patrick again became inexplicably irate after we calmly asked him on our way out the door for the name of the property owner. He then proceeded to follow us out the front door to our waiting cab and physically assaulted me. When the police arrived, 2 eyewitnesses came forward to corroborate the fact that Patrick had smashed my face into the car door. I later required medical attention.

It was clean, quiet the staff was efficient and friendly and the manager is an absolute gem of a person.There was a phone and fridge in each room and a kitchen, fitted with a stove, microwave and cupboards on each floor. The common bathroom was shared by four rooms but that was ok as i never had to wait. The room had window AC which was a bit loud but bearable and the window in the room couldn't open. The location is excellent as it's within walking distance to restaurants, a supermarket, pharmacy, banks, fruit & veg markets, the subway and even a very good jazz bar. There's also some small theatres close by where you can watch live theatre.I would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend it for the budget conscious traveller looking for good, clean affordable accommodation close to all the major attractions but in a nice quiet area.

I'm 35, she's 29. We are budgeted travellers who just need a clean and quiet place to sleep. After the mixed reviews, we decided to go with the inn based on the budget and location to the subway. We stayed in morningside inn on oct 9th to the 12th. Arrving with an open mind and preparing for the worse, the ""notorious"" front office was noticibly plain but clean. The young girl working there was nonchalant, but quick to check me in. I paid cash to prevent any future discrepancies. (Although, be mindful that the young girl do not have access to the cashier after office hours, so pls bring exact change! )So far so good. Now the room... I booked a double room with shared showers. The room is really plain but clean. A bed which was made up everyday, a fan with a hanging light, a window which worked. No aircon or heater, but it was autum now, so fresh air suited us fine. I was pleasantly surpised when i found out that there was a sink, a fridge and a phone in the room.The common shower is shared between 2 to 3 rooms each. Wasn't an issue. Most guests there usually have different agendas so no need to wait at all.The location and neighbourhood was quite good. Supermarkets are 3 to 5mins mins away. Eateries are nearby too. Both Absolut Bagels on 107th and Tom's Restaurant (112th), made famous by Seinfeld, are good for breakfast. Subway to downtown is only 5 mins away.One thing I noticed was the inexperienced front office. Other than the big man himself who is present only in the morning, the rest of the young staff seemed clueless about the hotel. I was given 3 keys to my room, and the young girl couldn't tell me what the other 2 keys were for. Another girl couldnt' tell me the rates of making a local call in the room.That didn't bother me too much since my criteria was more cleanliess and location.

I was also required to pay the ""upgrade"" to the superior room. But it was Morningside's mistake. In conclusion, this is a clean place and reasonably cheap, but it's not a polished hotel in the tradition of hospitality. For instance, if a hotel makes a mistake regarding your reservation, they never make the customer pay the difference in price. But Morningside isn't run by professionals. It's run by one friendly man and his inexperienced staff. The renovation continues and the work is sloppy at best.

I stayed last October for a week and am not sure I'd stay again. I'm a single woman, middle-aged, fairly well traveled. Don't need luxury, just a clean room & a little service when required.I had the room on the first floor at the front, right on the street. It's a huge room by NYC standards but a bit grungy. The window air conditioner had substantial gaps between the expander panels and the window frame so I asked immediately if something could be done about it. Turns out I had to ask twice a day for the first three days I was there. As a single traveler, this seemed a safety issue even though the staff somewhat dismissed my concerns that it wouldn't be possible for someone to get in thru the window because it was too far from the sidewalk. That may be, but I don't like taking chances or paying to do so.The bed was comfortable & looked new but the sheets weren't changed even once during my week's stay. I""m not even sure if the cleaning staff made it in my room becuase there was a wrapper from a previous occupant that was never removed from the floor. (I left it there as a little test.) The last day I requested that the desk staff call a cab to take me to the airport. I had just enough money for the cab & some airport food but they instead called a car service that cost me quite a bit more. I had barely enough to cover the ride & ended up with almost no tip for the poor driver. I won't make that mistake again. So for a clean cheap room in NYC, it was OK but really nothing more. Oh and I'm really glad I had my earplugs with me -- the springs on the doors are really tight & the other guests always seemed to let the doors slam as loudly as possible at all hours of the night.Lastly, I find it really interesting that whenever a very negative review appears for this hotel, the management's response is inevitably to insult and blame the customer.

Disliked the quality of cleaning during our stay and the late check inn (4 pm) and early check out (11 am), even if you mail you arrive in the afternoon (we did at 3.30 pm after traveling 14 hours and with a six hours time difference) there was nothing to do about it : wait till 4 pm !!Also strange : pay all 8 nights before you even are allowed to check the room.

Patrick was very accommodating making the arrangements and confirming them once again about a week before we travelled.We had an issue w/ one of the rooms the first night and had to deal with it b/c the inn was sold out for that night. However, the next morning arrangements for two rooms were taken care of for us by 9:00 am. We moved our luggage etc to the ready room and left for the day. Upon returning in early evening they had made even better arrangments for us AND had our luggage etc. moved for us!Once again, I'll say that this is an old buiding with narrow stairwell, tiny elevator and smallish rooms, but the rooms were clean, ours included air conditioning and private bathroom. We came to tour the city not buy real estate so everyone in our group was satisfied with the rooms, bathrooms, availabilty of towels (bring your own washcloth, they don't have them) and cable (an upgrade from my last stay). We basically were only in the rooms to sleep, so any frownies were insignificant to us since we did not have to spend any great length of time in the rooms.

The Morningside Inn is a part hostel/part hotel. I requested the Double Deluxe Room and it was really nice for what we paid for it, very affordable. Our room was behind the office right as you enter the building, which was odd, but the room had two double comfortable beds and a fairly spacious bathroom. The window air conditioner works great and kept the room very cool at all times. Also has two dressers and a closet for clothes, plus a mounted tv in the corner of the room. The only problem I had was that the shower water was luke warm at BEST and the shower leaked very slowly onto the carpet right in front of the bathroom.I never saw anything in the hotel besides the entryway, front desk, and our room. This hotel is a bit north of the heart of NYC (it is located on 107th and Broadway), but that doesn't matter at all. The subway at 103rd and Broadway is easily accessible and can take you anywhere!

I could complain about other things - the hotel's dinginess, smelliness, etc., but I was prepared for that going in, despite the pretty pictures on their website. It just looks like they generally don't care and are cynically trying to squeeze every last dime out of that place that they can, because they're dealing (mostly) with a clientele that has few options at the hotel's price point.

I ordered tickets off ebay and they were delivered and held by the fornt desk and given to me without even asking (I had forgotten!!)Rooms were clean and warm (it was five degrees at the time in NYC!!!

I stayed at Morningside Inn for about a week during October. The hotel did provide most of what it promised -- helpful staff who would call taxis for you and help you with directions for getting around the city, in particular -- a fridge and microwave in the room (without any utensils to back that up, though) and a laundromat nearby.  I was disappointed mostly by the very uncomfortable bed, the poor quality sheets, the thin, tired pillow, and the single white towel (that was not replaced all week). To be fair, housemaids did find me another pillow and an extra cotton blanket with much ado following my request, but I ended up buying a blow-up pillow from the MoMA to supplement what was being offered.Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all was that I was in the US, the capital of worldwide television and advertising production, and there wasn't a TV in my room (or a joint TV room anywhere in the building) that I could switch on to get the news or some music. These are MUST have requirements when travelling alone. I went to the Radio Shack in the end and bought a portable, battery-operated radio to relieve the silence and compensate for the view of the brick wall outside (which I DID expect to find in NYC!). The internet was out of order for most of the week I was there. By the way, it was an antique anyway -- one of those coin-operated machines that you stand up and operate -- I hadn't seen such a machine anywhere in Australia for at least 10 years (yet the staff seemed to have all the latest equipment on their desk, including pay TV access). Upon checking out of the hotel, I suggested they may like to consider upgrading some of the technology, and at least providing it for single guests, rather than just stating it was available on their website. Sure, there are a couple of internet cafes nearby, but they would be better off promoting that Starbucks has wi-fi access worldwide so bring your own notebook! In the end, I bought a small notebook at a computer store, carried it round the world, and used wi-fi free at almost every destination (with the power adapters to suit each country that the computer salesman threw in). Overall, at least the Morningside Inn was a cheap place to shower and sleep, with staff that offered friendly advice for getting around the place, and if that's all you're looking for in New York and don't expect much more then the hotel is reasonably good value.One final suggestion for the management: a chair or two in the foyer wouldn't go astray so guests could wait inside while keeping an eye out for taxis, instead of having to stand outside on the sidewalk.",Sydney,23,2.0

I booked a three bed room with private bathroom.

When I checked in the receptionist was very pleasant as were all the reception staff. The room was clean with crisp bedding and clean white towels on arrival. For me, that was all I required as my intention was to see NYC and not spend hours in my room. There were plenty of towels and these were changed daily and the beds made up. I was very surprised how quiet the hotel was also, I was situated on the ground floor. Unfortunately the Internet facility was out of order on the day I needed to check in my return flight to London online however the staff informed me that there was an internet cafe on Broadway which is literally only a few steps away.

I handed over the print-out of my booking to the manager and the error was quickly fixed to our satisfaction. We stayed on the first floor. (I believe room 107?) Our room reminded me of the dormmaster's room back at college that was like a mini-apartment. It was a large place with a separate bedroom where there was a big TV and my mom slept on a very comfortable bed. I stayed in what I thought would have been a living room that had a futon. Sleeping on the futon was as best as a futon gets--you have to position yourself so you avoid the wooden bars that are underneath the cushion. I still can't complain for the price.The bathroom was very decent. The tub was extremely slippery and that'd be our only issue if we had one.The kitchen area was nice too, though we only used the fridge to store water & cold snacks.We kept the shades closed since there wasn't any desirable view from any window. We did wonder about the door and what looked to be a start of a dent as if at some point someone tried to pry the door open.Overall, we'd definitely stay here again as we were very pleased with the stay.

The kitchen was always dirty and the stove and microwave had layers of grime on it and they had no plans on fixing it. The bathroom ceiling dripped throughout my stay and the drain in the shower did not even have a mesh plate so if you drop your soap forget about it. The website is very misleading. There is no data port in any room, no internet service is available. The internet terminal downstairs was never functional.

What can I say???????? Never again. I visited New York with a friend in November and was really looking forward to it as I'd never been before. We booked a really cheap break which (including return flights from London) was £278. I assumed we had a really good deal talking to other friends who had been previously been and paid £400+ for the 3 nights at other hotels. If I has known what I did now, I would have gladly paid the extra money to stay somewhere decent. The place was an absolutely dump!!!!!!! When we arrived the man on the reception said he was giving us one of the ""good rooms"" but the room we were in was anything but. Firstly I wasn't happy with the security of the place, the door of our hotel room was extremly loose and I was sure it would have come open with a kick which did worry me slightly as we were 2 girls travelling alone. The room itself was dark, dingy and the window looked straight out onto a brick wall and wasn't even the size of a double room. Two small single beds were squeezed into this room along with a fridge and a chest of drawers so there wasn't enough room to swing a cat in there. The bedding did appear to be clean though, which is the only positive thing I can say about the place. To my horror though I found at least 2 small centipeady/beettle type creatures running around in the room!!!!!! And don't get me started on the bathrooms!!!!! Apparently they were cleaned everyday, but they were vile, digusting places. My personal hygeine is very important but even contemplated not using the bathroom for the 3 nights we were there as I didn't want to get in the shower or use the toilet. Also the toilet paper ran out on the 1st night and wasn't replaced in the bathroom throughout the rest of out stay and when we mentioned it at reception they said they did replace it, but it must have been taken by other guests. They did give us our own roll though........ Again insects seemed to have taken up residency in the bathroom (and I'm not talking about the other guests). To put a finer point on it........

On closer inspection, there were stains and crumbs all over the sheets. We went to the front desk, but the man there was ""just filling in"" and had no access keys to get clean sheets. He picked the lock on the linen cabinet, but ther was nothing in there. Also, he would not call the manager in front of us, saying only that he would give him a message from us. We were out of place to stay that night. He told us to come in to speak with the morning staff lady and she would ""work it out.""The next morning, we spoke with her, and she told us she would also not call the manager and that she had ""just left a message."" We told her that our bank would not accept the charges for the room, and then she got really rude. Finally she told us to come back at 8pm or call. When we finally did talk to the manager he was nice and said he would refund our money (still pending). Apparently, the staff put us in one of their extended residential stay rooms instead of the hotel section, and those dirty sheets had been there for 2 weeks.The outcome was okay, but no hotel that simply says ""either sleep in a room with dirty sheets or you are out of luck"" and forces you to wait two days before finally pinning down the manager is not a very well run hotel.

It was gross, They misled you in the pictures to think it was a nice hotel. The staff was rude and did'nt care about the guests needs. I would recommend that nobody go to this hotel, even the outside is dirty.","Hopedale, Massachusetts",8,1.0
