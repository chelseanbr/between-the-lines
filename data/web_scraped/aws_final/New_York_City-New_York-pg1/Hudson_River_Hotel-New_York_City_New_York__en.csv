Hot air was coming through vent even After the heater was turned off. There was not even a bottle of water in the room and when i tried to get water from a vending machine for the price of $3.00, it ate all the money. The in room phone kept giving busy signal every time I tried to call to the concierge or to hotel services. When i finally went downstairs and complained, they smiled nicely and promised to send somebody to fix the problems. I ask how they’re going to fix the issue of the stale smoke smell. So they basically blew me off. I did not get a different room, the sink was very fixed, but the room continued to smell, the bed continues to squeaked every motion. I was in New York for one night to see my daughter who I haven’t seen for two months. It was a very busy day for us and it was the only night we’re going to spend together I did not want to turn it into the night of complaints at the staff.

All the reasonably priced hotels were an expensive and time-wasting Uber ride away. What to do? The cheapest of the hotels close by was The Hudson River Hotel. It’s not a pretty sight when you arrive. You get to the lobby going down a few steps. There is a small elevator but it didn’t work the entire week we were there. A sign by the reception desk (there is no lobby to speak of) warns that the lobby restroom is closed due to “plumbing problem”. The elevator is tiny and has several taped signs warning people not to jump or hold the doors. I was terrified of what I might found. And yet, my room (also my partner’s room on a separate floor) was a wonderful surprise. Large and quiet, especially by New York standards. Very clean. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Fast WiFi. Nice toiletries. A desk to work at. I slept great every night. The front desk employees were really nice. My only issue was that, as befits an old building, there were few electric outlets and I had to move the night table when to have my phone next to me in bed. And it was an easy walk to the Hudson Yards. I recommend for people on a budget who need to be in this neighborhood. ","Seattle, Washington",20,4.0

The room was spacious enough and the staff were courteous professional and friendly. The first thing I check when I check in is the shower/bath and I wasn't disappointed. The hotel provides a breakfast snack which is what I need before my sight seeing starts at around 07:30 because I will have a breakfast much later in the day.

We had never been to NYC and we tried to plan our stay in a place near good eating and easy walking to subway and famous locations. Location-wise, it was located in Hell's Kitchen and not a bad location. My chief complaint was that the outside of the hotel and the pictures of the rooms that you see do not match what is reality. The outside of the hotel looks like a dump! To the left of the hotel entrance there is a huge dumpster in front of a questionable building (we didn't know what it was but it was nasty looking). After we had settled in, we left the hotel to eat and 30 feet outside the hotel a giant rat scurried in front of us into the dumpy building next door. You have to carry or drag your suitcases down about 8 steps to get into the hotel lobby entrance. The whole hotel is old and tired looking. It needs serious updating. There is one small elevator for 15 floors. Our room was approximately 10 x 10. There was a desk for one of our suitcases, a place to put another suitcase, but my suitcase had to be on the floor the whole time. There were 2 queen beds that were against the walls on both sides with approximately 12 inches between each bed. The ""comforter"" or ""bedspread"" consisted of a flat sheet, a blanket and another flat sheet on top of that. The carpet in the halls outside our room was threadbare. Our room WAS clean and our bathroom was clean. They did come in every day and make the beds and bring clean towels although not enough for 3 women. We had to call down every night and ask for more--which they did provide. The main disappointment was that when I originally booked this through booking.com, they made the deal for 4 nights and they locked it in so I had no option to cancel. I tried to cancel my reservation less than 24 hours later and the manager, Vladimir, would not allow it. There was still 10 weeks before check in and he still would not allow me to cancel my reservation. I do not think that is very reasonable.

All the things that I will be mentioning are things which should have been provided for within the Quality Inn parameters.1. The entrance to the hotel is located down a bunch of steps. There is a small lift to the right approaching the entrance but it was broken. This was broken for the two days that I was there. In addition, there were a bunch of bags sitting in this lift. This, of course, makes it difficult for those who cannot carry their bags up and down the steps as well as for those who are handicapped. 2. I was aware that no microwave or refrigerator are provided in the room, however, I have been to Quality Inns where this has been offered for a small fee. This was not offered here. When I asked the receptionist if I could use the hotel’s microwave to warm up some food that I brought for dinner later in the evening I was told “no.” I left and went to see a show. When I returned there was another receptionist at the desk and asked him if I could use the microwave and once again was told “no.” I travel quite a bit and have never been told “no” when I requested this. There have even been times when receptionists have let me use microwaves that were right behind their desks. I wound up eating a nonheated dinner. I thought the aim is keep the guest happy!3. The hotel has 15 floors. There is only ONE ice machine and ONE vending machine for the entire hotel and it is on the first floor. I was on the 15th floor. The elevator is not exactly the fastest one I have ever used (and I can accept this), however, having to get down to the first floor to get a small bucket of ice while confronting 15 floors of guests was excruciating and took forever! They need to put an ice machine at the very least on every third floor or at the very very least or the seventh or eighth floor to make it a little easier for all the guests.4. The TV remote was not operating correctly. Less than half the functions worked. I called the desk about this problem and I was willing to make it down the 15 floors and get another one. I was told someone would come up to my room to check this out. The very nice maintenance man confirmed my problem and brought another remote. That one did not work either. I was also told that there were no more remotes and that my problem will be noted.5. Be aware that there is a $2 safe charge automatically placed on your bill. Make sure you tell the receptionist to remove this charge when you register if you do not intend on using the safe.6. There was only one plug available in the room (other than in the bathroom). This plug was located in back of the desk behind the safe. It was a four outlet plug but only two of the outlets were accessible after many contortions in trying to reach it. The reason for this was that one needs to move the desk chair away in order to crawl underneath the desk to access the plug. The chair is situated approximately six inches from the bed and it was almost impossible to get the chair out of the way in order to creep underneath the desk to get to the plug. In addition, I needed to unplug something else in order to use the plug.7. Weekday breakfast is until 9:30. On Saturday and Sunday it ends at 10:30. I was there on a Saturday. I came down around 9:15, went to the coffee machine and pressed the decaf button. Nothing came out. I was told to use the decanter next to the coffee machine. Nothing came out of there either. When I told the attendant about this he told me they ran out of decaf. How can a hotel that should be experienced as to the quantities of coffee they use run out of decaf coffee over an hour before the breakfast closes? A few minutes later the receptionist came over to me and offered to send someone out to get me some decaf. I asked how long this might take as I was eating my warm breakfast. He told me about 15 or 20 minutes. Obviously, by the time I would have gotten my coffee my food would be cold and I did have to check out in order to catch a bus on time.I frequently stay at Choice hotels.

Yes, the neighbourhood is run down, but come off any of the major avenues and the areas have rubbish bags outside. There is a needle exchange programme next to the hotel, but it is only at certain times of day and we never ever saw anyone obviously using it. There is construction next door, in fact it was right outside our window, but it did not disturb our sleep once. Again, so much of NY has construction going on, it is difficult to escape it.The hotel is ideally located. It is 10 minutes walk to the Javits centre, and also the highline. Also, 10 minutes to Madison Square Gardens/Penn Station and the subway, and around 15 minutes to Times Square. Excellent positioning for the money paid. You can get nearer hotels, but not for this price. There are corner shops nearby, as well as plenty of restaurants.Hotel RoomsThe rooms are small. However, we managed to stay for the 5 nights with 2 older teenagers - we just mainly lived out of our cases. Not ideal, but perfectly manageable. I could have booked 2 rooms, but being on a budget meant keeping the price down. The rooms had 2 double beds, a very small wardrobe (big enough for 1 person really), aircon (ours was fine and not obtrusive), a desk and chair, a safe, an ice bucket and coffee facilities. The bathroom was well stocked with towels and had a hair dryer. They were clean. We did not use the TV. Other than being small, the rooms were fine. Again, you get what you pay for, and it was no different to any other bargain hotel in NY. The bonus is good wifi in the room.Hotel Facilities Bits, especially the corridors, look a bit run down and the lift is a little rickety. However, having seen a group of unsupervised children run and bounce up and down in it I am not surprised. The downstairs has a few stairs down off the Main Street due to the lift not working, and the air con is great downstairs! There is 24 hour tea and coffee which we appreciated. The breakfast which is included is perfectly adequate. Juice, tea and coffee; toast; fruit; waffles you make yourself with a machine; bread; pastries; cereal; yoghurt a and spreads. We were quite happy with all of that! The problem is the breakfast area is very small so many guests took their food up to their bedrooms.The staff were helpful and friendly. We did not encounter any problems with our stay at all.To summarise; if you want a cheap well located and well resourced hotel and don't mind being a little cramped, I would really recommend here.","Kent, United Kingdom",95,4.0

If you are, you MIGHT just be OK with this place. First, upon arrival you will see a very grungy looking neighborhood with garbage piled on the street. The hotel itself is literally next door to the needle exchange program. Not a major issue for me but may be a tad concerning for those arriving and seeing people congregate outside next to the hotel. So, when arriving also be prepared to carry your own luggage a flight of steps from street to the hotel entrance. No elevator from street level to the basement hotel lobby. No ""bell-hops"" to assist you either. The lobby is VERY small and so will be your rooms. A room with a King bed leaves just a little room to walk around, a room with two double beds has about 2 feet between the beds. That is all the room you have. Upon arrival, our room had no working toilet. Interesting since I had read other reviews stating toilets did not work. The desk clerk asked ""do you know anything about fixing toilets"" when I asked about getting it fixed. She explained she was working all alone and had no-one to fix it. When I said I was hoping not to be the one to fix things, she added ""the manager does not stay on top of things like this"". She did kindly switch rooms for the night but that caused major headaches the next day since they insisted I had to move to yet another room for my second day's stay. Having to pack and move , all by their posted check-out times was a hassle especially they could not predict what time my third room would be available. That dramatically impacted what i could do in NYC that morning. The rooms themselves, while incredible small, are clean and beds are comfortable. Room one had a couple of mosquitoes flying around and room 3 a couple of flies. The hallways of the hotel are quite shabby looking. There is ONLY one elevator, it is very small. The breakfast area seats about 14 people, almost always full in the morning. For two days they had no decaffeinated coffee , ""we have sold out"". Very bizarre, I suspect no management staff on top of ensuring supplies. When sorting out my room problems, there was another customer with same exact issue. There was also someone complaining their air conditioner did not work. The nearby parking lot costs about $30 per day with a hotel validated ticket. Do lose the ticket, the parking lot attendant seemed to take pride in impolitely telling me I would have to pay full price if i did not find my ticket. Luckily I did. The parking lot is dimly lit and poorly maintained. Desk and Housekeeping staff are very polite but seem left on their own by a dubious Management. The location , in my opinion, is not as good a other reviews suggest. There is nothing of interest around. Just a run down section of W 36th, lots of construction. You can be in interesting sections like Times Square or Broadway in about 20 minutes walk. Walking around felt generally safe once once over the initial shock of a grungy street and weird looking hotel. This hotel should be classified as just a little step up from backpackers level. The rate is fairly good but I would suggest spending $60 more a night and getting a better class of place, at least one with more than one staff on duty... , an entrance and lobby that looks like a proper hotel, and rooms where you can hardly move. Oh, one final thing... the TVs in the room are nice but receive only one channel .. Time Warner News. There is an iron in each room and a coffee maker. The closets are TINY.

Everyone we interacted with was polite: front desk, cleaning ladies, maintenance guy, gentleman who oversees breakfast, etc. They give you a helpful map of Manhattan including subway stops. You can walk to Times Square, Herald Square, Bryant Park, even Central Park. 9th street offers MUCH food. There is a little grocery right on the corner here where we bought drinks and snacks. Parking is right at the corner. $25 for a normal sized car. There was a convention going on and the lot looked full.

For this visit, I felt that the rooms are small and quite claustrophobic and since I am sensitive to abrupt changes in heat and cold, the decades old cooling and heating system got me sick with a terrible headache and the front desk did not carry any Tylenol or Advil!! The climate control system had been turned off prior to my arrival, and so the sudden change in temperature after my turning down the heat, played havoc with my health. But, rooms are clean and no complaints about the quality of the room. It is just unfortunate that New York is so expensive, so all things being equal, this hotel does offer great value to a single traveler. Not so sure about families, and I would think that even two would be a crowd. However, I must say that I have stayed at the W and room sizes are typical for New York. The W just had a better climate control system, but oh well, you can't have everything and pay a decent price for a hotel room. Night time can be tricky since the neighborhood turns seedy and there appears to be a homeless shelter or soup kitchen next door. But street people aka the hapless homeless are quite respectful and do not bother, so it is a matter of personal perception. A great dining spot - Friedman's is almost next door and seems oddly out of place since it is quite fine dining in a seemingly run down neighborhood. No wonder, they call themselves a lunch place although they are open at night with a good crowd. Daytime is normal New York, but not as crowded as say, Times Square, although it is good to know that Times Square is nearby. I would absolutely not recommend this for families. For a $100 or so more, there are definitely better, upscale choices in New York. I paid $ 260 plus tax per night that turns out to be a good weekday rate and with taxes, it will run around $300. The second night was a weekend rate at $206 plus taxes, which is a good value. Thursday night is a weekend night, BTW.Friendly staff, friendly management. I was greeted very well and professionally by Lisa at the small front desk and all staff are well dressed either in suits or business casual. Staff is also nice and friendly. I only wish they carried more sundries such as painkiller medication such as OTC Tylenol or Advil, I was delayed due to a nagging headache that would have been cured with a capsule or two. There is a gas station nearby that carries a lot of food and supplies such as Advil, but i was hesitant to walk there at 2am in the morning!

They said they would have someone come up and take a look. The guy who come up confirmed that it was still running. Got back to the room Friday, and the toilet was still running. Told the front desk. Said they would have someone look at it.Long story short, Monday when I left, the toilet was still running. I would turn the valve off each night so the noise did not keep me awake, the maid would turn it back on so the toilet would run all day.2. Someone had reprogrammed the power button on the TV remote to change the input on the TV rather than turn it on or off, so I used the button on the TV. Didn’t tell the front desk because I wanted them to concentrate on the toilet.3. A couple of nights bunch of loud women came back to their rooms adjoining mine around 3AM. I was there for work, so it bugged me when they woke me up. They went back and forth between their rooms for about an hour before going to sleep, laughing and yelling at each other.The man at the breakfast room was polite and helpful, keeping the area tidy and the food and supplies well stocked. More than just rolls and toast. Sausage, waffles, eggs and fresh fruit.All and all, this will be where I stay in New York next time I have to go there for work. Easy to get to from Penn Station, and a block and a half from the convention center. Just hope the toilet is fixed by then!","Burbank, California",0,4.0

My first room had a bad smell, but they very quickly and efficiently (and apologetically) switched me to another room. That was smelled funny too, but not as bad, so I just stayed. I expect small rooms for NYC so that was fine....actually the room (I had 2 double beds) was not as small as some NYC lux hotels I have stayed in.

We were really debating whether to stay in NYC at all because most hotels are terrible while charging an arm and a leg for the location. But I'm so glad that my husband found this place!! We got a great rate for the location in Hell's Kitchen and it was a perfect spot for everything we wanted to do. The beds were super comfy - nice fluffy pillows and mattresses. The bathroom was clean with lots of towels and soap stocked up and the shower worked great. They even had a nice bathtub so the baby could take a bath. The AC worked great too, one of the beds was blocking the air intake but we just moved it over a few inches. Would have loved a fridge but we made do using the ice bucket. Our room was even quieter than our apartment back home. Parking was $25 per day (more for SUVs) at a next-door lot and it was very convenient. But I especially want to comment about the staff at the hotel. I remembered all their names - Lisa, Nicole, Roberto and Ashish. They were all extremely friendly and professional and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable! We checked in and out with Lisa at the front desk - we didn't make a reservation, just walked in, and she offered us a room with a non-functional TV so we could check in at 10:30 instead of 3 (a HUGE plus with a baby let me tell ya!) and still gave us a discounted rate for the TV. We all slept great that night and my daughter loved the free breakfast in the morning and so did we - plenty of options including a waffle maker! They offered to hold our bags after checking out while we spent more time in the city. Unfortunately when picked them up we forgot 2 bags that we had left in their office separate from our luggage, an easy mistake - we all forgot about them, my husband and I and the staff. I am not too upset about it because Ashish the manager handled it professionally by taking responsibility and shipping our things back to us.

The pros are that the rooms, albeit very small, are very clean and the bathrooms aren't too bad. The cons outweigh the pros though. First off, the hotel is in a very sketchy neighborhood and the smell outside of the hotel can get very disgusting. There is only one entrance and one tiny elevator which takes forever to get you to and from your room. One of the most annoying parts to me was that there wasn't any water or ice or cups on any of the floors. If you need any of that stuff, you have to go all the way down to the lobby to get that (yes, even a small glass of water). Also, there were multiple days when the water machine just wouldn't work. I don't know if they unplugged it or what but no water was available for the guests. They had this small water cooler near the front desk and one day, we were leaving our room at 11am and we didn't see the water cooler. We asked someone at the front desk and they said the person bringing the water was running late or some excuse like that so we couldn't fill up our water bottle. Really? It's 11am and hot as hell and you can't even afford to give your guests water? And the guy at the front desk didn't think it was too big a deal when I got upset that there was no water. Out of the 8 days that I was there, I only had breakfast once and the breakfast wasn't really breakfast. You are better off grabbing a grilled cheese sandwich down the street at one of the cafes. They also charged me hidden fees. They charged me $27 for some odd reason which the lady at the front desk told me would be reimbursed but that hasn't happened yet. They also charged me $14 for using the safe in the room. Nowhere did it say about being charged a daily fee for using it- not at the front desk, not on the paper that tells you how to set your code for the safe. And they also charged me like $2.50 on the last day and I have no clue what it's for but am not going to bother fighting with them.So at the end of the day, the room is small but comfortable enough. But I don't think I would stay here in the future. It's not like the room was super cheap or anything. After all the taxes and fees, I ended up paying about $170 per night. I think I would rather pay an extra $30-$50 per night and get a better hotel.",,0,2.0

It's really quite amazing the different problems we ran into over the course of the week.First - when we arrived, we clogged the toilet. We were able to get a plunger from maintenance and we had to plunge it overtime we went to the bathroom. There were 5 of us - so that is a LOT of plunging. The next morning, I mentioned that the toilet continued to be a problem and the nice maintenance man came and snaked the toilet. This worked - but produced a huge mess in the bathroom. The maintenance guy cleaned it up as much as possible - but - it needed sanitizing considering what had been spilled onto the floor and into the tub. That didn't happen until much later in the day - so - no baths for us that morning before we went out for the day.Later, the elevator quit working. So, we gained a bathroom and lost an elevator. That was fixed within the day.Our keys stopped working anytime we left the hotel. Eventually we started stopping at the front desk to get our key re-keyed before we even went up to the room.I think the funniest incident was the laundry. I filled the plastic laundry bag with laundry to be washed (not dry cleaned) and my husband dropped it off at the front desk. Two days later - the laundry had not returned. I stopped at the front desk and the attendant that day said they don't do laundry. Eventually, she discovered that someone did take our laundry - but she didn't know where they took it. Later, she was able to direct us to a laundromat a block away. My husband went to pick it up only to discover they had delivered it to the hotel the day before. This was a $124 dollar dry cleaning of t-shirts and underwear! I would not have sent the laundry out if I knew they were going to do more than wash and fold.The last two days of our trip we only had hot water at night. We generally liked to take showers in the morning - so - this was an issue because the amenity just wasn't available when we wanted to use it.Finally, they called a car service for us for the airport. We were told it would be $70. When we get to the airport, the driver said it was $85.Again - the staff was very nice and they did comp us a night plus $50 for all of our troubles. The breakfast is good enough - but - it is super crowded the entire time. They do have employees that help keep people moving along. This location is close to everything - but the subway - so you will end up doing a lot of walking. The rooms are very tiny, but I hear that is indicative of all NYC. The closest is not a full closet - you could not hang a dress and have it hang all the way down. There is an ironing board, but you would not have room to open it up.",Orange County,20,3.0

This year was different since it was my son’s first trip to the big city. Our overall experience was good because of the excellent customer service and the subway station was two blocks away. Room are pretty small, cleanness was 4 out of 5. The breakfast was make your own waffles, English muffins and bread. Your choice of eggs, sausage, cereal, yogurt, hard boil eggs, and fruits. Hot coffee and juice. The first two days we took advantage of the breakfast but 3rd and 4th day we decided to have breakfast at a local deli. Note, that having breakfast at a New York deli will run you up $42.00 for full breakfast for three people. To be honest we only went to the hotel to sleep.

We did not like two things about this hotel: one that the window could not be opened and second that every time someone flashed the toilet, we could hear it which made sleeping a bit challenging. Basically we had to sleep with a pillow on top of our head. The noise of the city could NOT be heard much, so that was good. Breakfast was also OK, typical American stuff.

An added bonus was that free coffee & tea was available all day which was great after a long day of sightseeing. The staff really make the place. From the people on the front desk to the man who stocks breakfast supplies, all are customer focused, friendly and approachable.

I'm not entirely convinced that they were real eggs. -The rooms? They are TINY. The tiniest I have ever been in, not good if you are traveling with a lot of luggage OR bulky/big luggage. The pillows were also very tiny, maybe a tad bigger than a traveling pillow, definitely not your standard sized pillow.-At 6AM, there were really, really loud bangs and we couldn't find a source for the noise (no construction and no one directly next to us) Overall, the pros outweigh the cons. This hotel is perfect if you're attending a convention at the Javits. But be warned, if you are going with large suitcases (or many!) you WILL NOT have enough space for it, especially if you're staying with 3-4 people.

(Something we did not find at even the very pricey Millennium on 44th at $429 a night). While it was difficult to be there with 40 kids ""fighting"" for space in the rooms, the place was virtually spotless! Not a speck of dust, grime, or mold anywhere. Because I was a chaperone and had to visit a few rooms to check on kids on different floors, I used the stairs a lot. (The elevator was slow.) But the stairwells were immaculate, something you never see anywhere. Also, don't know how they did it in such a limited space, but the breakfast space and breakfast were outstanding. Full hot breakfast with lots of choices and a staff that were so polite, courteous, professional, smiling, friendly and helpful, I absolutely could not believe it. Each time we entered the hotel, the front desk personnel greeted us with a big smile and asked us how were we doing, did we enjoy ourselves, what could they do for us...I do travel to NYC quite often for shows, etc., and next time I will most certainly be forsaking the larger, more expensive hotels to stay at this Quality Inn.

It seemed a lot less expensive than it should have been (and was cheaper in comparison to hotels just a few blocks away), because it is located 10-15 minutes max walking from Times Square, Penn Station, and Grand Central Terminal as well as the ever-popular High Line. The room size was on the small side, but it was efficient enough for two people and the smaller room sizes shouldn't matter to you anyways if you are really just going to sleep there and be out and about in the city the rest of the time. Plus, our king size bed was extremely comfortable. Breakfast was the same every day, but contained a pretty good variety of hot and cold/continental selections. I can't comment on housekeeping as we refused it with the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign, but they did come to our door once while we were there. My only complaints are that there is only one elevator and we were on the 7th floor, so sometimes we waited a good five minutes for it to come down. Also, we woke up very early one morning to an extremely loud, obnoxious noise above our room...we determined it was probably a heater. We called the front desk about it and I'm not sure what they did if anything, but the sound disappeared within minutes of the call. I would consider this hotel a ""hidden gem"" in a quiet (but definitely not secluded) area of Midtown. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone because of its ideal location and value prices, and I will definitely be staying here again.","New York City, New York",1,4.0

Often hotels offer breakfasts that include primarily bread products leaving you with a heavy feeling of carb-overload, but this Quality Inn breakfast included a nice variety of fresh fruit, boiled eggs, as well as breads, waffles, cereals and sausages. The breakfast would be even better if the yogurt available was not so high in sugars and food coloring - a more natural product would be much better and healthier.","Halifax, Canada",0,4.0

The block may seem a bit sketchy to those who don't know NYC, but it's actually fine.

All of the hotels we have stayed in in the past were booked, but I have always had good luck with the Choice hotel chain, and this one was available. Some of the reviews made me nervous, but there were enough positives that I thought I'd take a chance. I'm glad we did. While the location is nowhere near where we needed to be, access to two subway lines that would get us to our destination were a short walk away. The front desk clerk drew the path we should take on a complimentary map, just one of the many helpful, kind acts she performed for us. We needed three rooms, and while we were unable to get them together, she explained we could move rooms the next night to make that happen. We decided not to do that.Clearly the hotel has undergone a recent modernization with tasteful decorating. When we pulled up to check in, I looked at the desolate neighborhood and the blandness of the outside of the building, but a few steps down, and we were inside the modern, but small lobby with friendly employees everywhere. (Shout out to Jose who was so nice to my students that they wanted to take a picture with him!) The elevator is slow, but there are only 15 floors, so it's not that terrible to wait. The floors only have four rooms, which means you do hear people opening and closing doors and conversations in the hall, but everyone on my floor was respectful and didn't make unnecessary noise. Of course, the rooms are small, but this is New York, so I wasn't surprised as I have stayed in many New York hotel rooms where I turn around and meet myself turning halfway. The difference here, we were paying $100 less than some of the other hotels. My room, like the rest of the hotel, was nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable, the room clean, and the bathroom modern. I had a desk space, a luggage carrier, and a narrow wardrobe to hang clothes. I liked the fact the alarm clock was simple instead of the crazy high-tech ones I can't figure out. My view was of the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.Now, about the neighborhood. Not charming. However, cross over to 9th and you're on your way to charm. We found restaurants around the area and lamented we didn't have time to try more as we were only there for three days. We also didn't get to any blocks in the other direction, which I would have loved to explore.Breakfast is set up in a separate room, and yes, the eating area is small, but the hotel thoughtfully puts out trays and containers so you can return to your room if you'd like. Breakfast is standard: eggs (hot and hard-boiled) yogurt, breads, waffles, sausages and cereal. Juice and coffee is also available. The employee who worked breakfast was friendly and always asked if anyone needed help.The front desk was on the ball. One of my students left a bag on a shuttle we used to get to the hotel, and it took two days to get it dropped off after repeated promises of its imminent arrival. The evening clerk who checked us in told the next front desk clerk to be on the look-out for it, so when I began explaining to the new person what to look out for, he pleasantly replied he already knew about the bag and was watching for it.The only issue with the room was in one of the students' rooms. Apparently the shower made a shuddering noise when it turned on, which they thought was strange, and then they found it funny. This was the room on the 5th floor, but certainly nothing to complain about. Sometimes that happens with plumbing.We never met any housekeepers, but I know they showed up, because every day was room was neatly made up, and toiletries replaced. We would definitely stay here again. The price is right, the staff is friendly and helpful, it's close to transportation, and it's clean and quiet. You can walk up 9th to Times Square easily, as well as Madison Square Garden and Penn Station.

We wanted to be close to both the theater and Penn station so we wouldn't have to worry about taxis or the subway. The Quality Inn met all our criteria, and we had an excellent experience. This hotel is located just a few blocks from Penn Station, and just a few more blocks from Times Square. You could easily walk right from your room to major areas of New York like the Empire State Building, Broadway, Times Square, and plenty of shopping and nightlife. The exact location is just a bit off the beaten trail in an area that looks pretty rundown, but there are no dark alleys you need to walk down to get here, only major roads, and we felt safe walking to and from this location even at night.The room was tiny, but that is to be expected from a city hotel, especially one at this price point. The room and bed were clean, comfortable, and warm. The rooms here have private bathrooms, which is actually difficult to find in a budget hotel in the city.The staff was very attentive and friendly. We were checked in quickly, and about 15 minutes after arriving we got a call asking us if everything was to our satisfaction or if there was anything else we needed.

As mentioned in the title, the hotel was basic but acceptable. We arrived in early February right in the middle of all the snow and cold weather. As soon as we arrived, I was a little put off by the entrance. Trash was piled in front of the hotel and the sidewalks were covered with ice. Of course, the hotel staff and management don't control mother nature, but I was a little surprised that no one seemed to make any effort to keep the area in front of the hotel clear of snow and ice.We stayed several nights and overall the hotel had what we needed. The room was small, but with only two of us, it was fine. The bed was comfortable and the room and bathroom were clean. The hotel's saving grace in my opinion was the breakfast. NYC is expensive, so being able to save a few dollars each day on breakfast was nice. Wifi was also a plus and had no issues.The hotel seemed to fall short in the area of service. The staff -with the exception of a friendly houseman who helped with our bags - seemed rather indifferent. Perhaps, the stormy weather had them feeling blue. But again, they were 'adequate'. When we asked them a question they would give us an answer, but that was about all. They were not the kind of staff that goes above and beyond or even gives out smiles often.Speaking of service, on the day of our departure, I asked the front desk if they could get us a taxi (we had a lot of bags and the sidewalk outside was still covered with snow and ice). I was told by the front desk that wasn't possible in NYC. The only suggestion we were offered was to just go outside (with all of our luggage) and flag one down (and of course the way the hotel sits on 36th, empty taxi's might take a few minutes to catch. After about 10 minutes of no luck, my fiancé ended up having to leave me in front of the hotel and walk to the corner to catch a cab and get the cabby to turn down 36th. What's more, at our next hotel (not Quality Inn), the doorman was more than happy to get us a cab any time we needed one, and it didn't seem like we were bothering him to do it.The hotel was close enough to Time Square although there are not a lot of eatery options in the immediate block.Again the savings were great but we did leave wishing the overall experience had been a little better.",,2,3.0

However, the biggest storm of the year ruined our reservations and we had to pick an inexpensive hotel to keep costs down for another weekend. So, we chose Quality Inn. The reviews were pretty good so we decided to go ahead and keep our reservation and stop looking at other places. Well, that ended up being a big mistake.So, after arriving in the lobby, we were barely greeted by the person working at the front desk. He provided us our room keys and we were on our way. Well, since we had a busy day planned, we wanted to use the bathroom before we headed out. The bathroom was a mess. There was a big crack in the sink. The shower wall was so outdated. I pulled up the toilet seat cover to find someone had used it and didn't flush the toilet. So, we're thinking that the cleaning staff didn't do a good job. But, it ended up being that the toilet was broken; it couldn't flush. So, back downstairs we head to ask for another room with a working toilet. We're given keys to another room on a different floor. We noticed there's a ""Do not disturb"" tag on the door and wonder if we should still go in. We go ahead anyway to open the door and find that it was actually occupied. Fuming at this time, we go back downstairs again to get another room. The person working at the front desk doesn't apologize for the mix-up but he he does give us an upgraded room at no charge. Well, that's the least he could do. So, we finally get settled and decide to quickly clean the bathroom with wipes that we brought with us just to be on the safe side. Other issues we had to deal with: -had to unclog our own toilet with a plunger found in the stairwell-no working phone in room (ripped cord). Informed front desk but they did nothing. Ended up having to use phone in hallway.- People trying to use their key cards to access our room throughout the night.The only highlights of this stay were the excellent Internet connection and the daily breakfast.

I read the mixed reviews of other travelers and decided to take a chance considering the good reviews outweighed the bad reviews that the hotel had received. I had excellent customer service during my stay from Precious at the front desk and Jose in guest services. When I arrived at the hotel before 9 am on the day of my check in so I could check my bags for the day Precious said that they had a room available already and I could take my bags up to my room if I wanted to. I have heard of an early check in but before 9 am is unheard of to me. I'm sure this doesn't happen all of the time and it may have helped that I was checking in on a Monday but I still appreciated the opportunity.The bed was comfortable and even though the king size bed took up most of the room it's really all that I needed during my stay in addition to the bathroom. The breakfast was prepared each morning and the staff was very good about keeping the breakfast foods fresh for each of their guests. The hotel is conveniently located just 2 blocks from the Jacob Javits Convention Center where my trade show was. It was nice to not have to worry about taking public transportation to the Convention Center because the public transportation in the area of the Jacob Javits Center is not too close.I have stayed at other NY hotels and I have experienced some issues.

After a mix up in the reservation we were given the option of sleeping 3 adult women in a king bed or moving to a room with double beds at this hotel. Being three adult women and the hotel not offering a roll a way bed option at all we had our reservation moved. Upon arrival to the hotel the front desk informed us that the in room wifi may or may not be working as there was reportedly an ""outage"" at a nearby Time Warner tower. The room we were given had two double beds, both pushed against the wall, with a space no larger than a foot in between. The pillows provided were tiny and the pillowcases had to be tucked under in order to make it look like they fit. Not only were we able to not connect to the wifi but our cable wasn't working either. After calling the support number for Time Warner provided on the information card in the room we were informed that that was a isolated incident pertaining to this hotel and not a tower outage like we were previously informed by the staff. It took 4 hours for the cable to come back on but every 60-90 seconds the screen would go black for about 20 seconds. Needless to say watching anything was impossible. We stayed in room 200, which was directly to the left of the elevator and also above the hotel entrance. The fluorescent lighting above the entranceway was extremely bright and the sheer beige drapery did nothing to keep out the light. Our room stayed as bright throughout the night as it did at dusk, which made falling asleep to impossible. The walls were thinner than paper and the conversations of other guests in surrounding rooms were crystal clear. We were initially grateful for the staff across the street for so graciously helping us find a room that sleeps three but shortly found that feeling fleeting.

Every time there was a problem (ice machine not working, no tissues in the room, etc) the staff replied with ""we'll have to go get it from our sister hotel across the street."" Why couldn't THIS hotel have its own supply? I'm puzzled at the many examples of management neglect, especially because I paid a 'discounted' rate of almost double what i have been paying at midtown boutique hotels. The only redeeming quality was the wonderful staff. Each one was cheerful, helpful, and seemed to truly care - but it also seemed like often their ability to help was limited by not having adequate resources to address customer questions and problems. Upon entering our room, we encountered a strange smell. It wasn't until attempting to shower the next morning when we realized there was a large patch of mold on the ceiling of the bathroom. We asked to change rooms, and that was done seamlessly, while we were out for the day. However, upon coming back from a long day and taking a shower in our new room, we suddenly noticed we had no hair dryer! Apparently there were no extra hair dryers, so a staff member escorted us to a different room on a different floor to dry our hair, but (of course) we couldn't move to that room because the AC was not working there, and they couldn't move the hair dryer because there was no mechanic at that time (mechanic? it looked like only a few screws, but hey, i'll give them the benefit of the doubt.) The next morning we skipped washing hair because of the hassle, but it was an uncomfortable day, and we looked forward to washing hair in the evening when the promised hair dryer was supposed to arrive. But alas, no, no hair dryer arrived. Eventually after several phone calls, the magic 'sister hotel' supplied one, and at least THAT issue was resolved.Other problems: ice machine not working (in summer? and no freezer on premises, so each request required a staff member to get ice across the street?), elevator super slow (and had a long outage, after which the repair made it a bit faster), steps to get in the front (there was a lift but it was locked, so not easily usable - how do you tell them you need it if you can't get down the steps to ask?), TV remote didn't work (they didn't know what to do about that), missing tissues in the room (they got later in the day from the 'sister hotel'), and the breakfast seemed to go on the cheap side (some of the items just didn't seem high quality, but the staff did the best they could with what they were given.)Would be really nice if the management and/or owner gave this neglected property some TLC so at least the really nice staff had what they needed to do their jobs. Until then, I'm staying somewhere else.","Freehold, New Jersey",7,2.0

This was our first trip to the city. When we arrived at the hotel, Stephanie greeted us. She was so friendly and made us feel totally at home! We were checked in immediately. We were given the choice of rooms - we chose the top floor. The room was small - with a king size bed. It was very clean and looked very nice. We had a view of the city - not great.....but could see the river etc. Stephanie provided us with a map of the city and gave us directions to many different places. Omar also worked on the front desk. He was very helpful as well. Every time we returned to the hotel we were welcomed back and asked how our day had been and what we had done. All of the staff was very interested in what we had done. They were all very proud of their city and where they worked. Omar helped us book tickets for Broadway shows and printed off the information we needed. Marie and Denise from the housekeeping staff were also very helpful and friendly as well. The free breakfast they had was amazing. It included mini omelets, sausage, fresh waffles (you could put the batter in the waffle maker and wait for it to finish), toast, bagels, English muffins, muffins, yogurt, orange juice, apple juice, cranberry juice, instant oatmeal, coffee (both regular and decaf), and tea. Coffee and tea was available 24 hours a day. Our room was cleaned every day and was spotless. There was plenty of hot water and water pressure. There was air conditioning and free wifi. It is very conveniently located, about a 15 minute walk to Times Square. It is away from all the ""hub bub"" of the city.

We found the Quality Inn and figured it would be perfect because of the location and brand name. I called a couple days before arriving just to confirm and make sure they had our reservation. When we showed up to check in we had to wait over an hour just to get to the front desk (there was only one person checking people in and he was taking a large group which caused everyone else waiting to check in to have to wait). When he finally did finish his first words were ""I have bad news."" They had overbooked the hotel and didn't have a room for us. He said he would check around with some of the other hotels to see if they could put us up for a night and then we could come back the next night and we would have a room (a huge inconvenience for my family as we were traveling with 4 kids under 11. Try walking around with them with all their luggage to go to and from another hotel. It was a pain). Then we had to wait for him to call around until he checked everyone else in because he was the only one. So we ended up waiting another 30 to 45 minutes. After about 2 hours of stopping in to check in we finally were in a room about 4 blocks from our original hotel. We then had to check out of that hotel and carry all our luggage back to the original hotel the next day to check in to the hotel we should have been in. Another nuisance was the lack of a working ice machine the entire time we were there. When we went to check in the first day we heard another customer complain about the ice machine and the clerk apologized and told the customer it was being fixed. We left 5 days later and it was still broken. We brought a bunch of waters and drinks so we wouldn't have to pay outrageous prices in the city but couldn't keep them cool all week long. My only other complaint was that the rooms were so small that they had one of the two beds pushed up right against the air conditioner so that side of the bed was super cold but the rest of the room didn't get much of the A/C. They should have planned better when designing the room to make the A/C more efficient. On a positive note the location was great. It was only a 10 minute walk to Times Square and a 5 minute walk to the subway. There is lots of great food right around the hotel and parking was only a 100 feet or so from the hotel. Breakfast was included every morning and saved some of that expense. We didn't mind the small room because we really only slept in the room at night and spent the majority of our time in the city. I just wish the check-in would have been easier for our family. I don't know that I would stay their again which is a shame because the location was great. I think I would spend a little more money to stay at a better hotel.","Strongsville, Ohio, United States",1,2.0

The hotel was ideally located for us as we were here to visit New York: short walk to Penn Station and the subway lines up and down town, also close to Times Square and the 5th avenue (less than 10 min walk).As for the hotel room itself, it was just perfect for our needs. Decent size room (keep in mind: it's NYC), king size bed, spotless linens, nice bathroom with everything working fine, a big flat screen tv (not that we watched it a lot) and A/C was working fine too - of course it is noisy, but hey, we'd rather sleep with a little noise than not sleep well because it's too hot! We appreciated the safe in the room where we were able to store all our precious stuff (including our laptop) while we were out. Peace of mind is priceless. Plus they have free WiFi in the room, which was a great advantage to surf the net for the best restaurant or attraction and keep our family and friends updated on our adventures. But most of all, the best memory we'll keep from our stay was the quality of the service we received. I regret I didn't take the time to remember your names, but here is a big THANK YOU to all of you, staff at the front desk, the gentleman preparing breakfast, the lady cleaning our room.

I drove for about 7 hours and arrived at the hotel at about 6:30 pm, and the front desk personnel, Ms, Lisa Foster could not find my reservation in her computer system. I showed her my email confirmation from Choicehotels.com. She called Choicehotels.com and it turned out my reservation was in their system but someone has forgotten to enter the reservation into Quality Inn's system. Unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked. Choicehotels told Lisa there was nothing they could do, Lisa was upset with them and asked to speak with a supervisor. Ms. Foster took the initiative to resolve the matter for me, while waiting to speak with the right personnel and being passed around several times to different people, she was at the same time attending to other customers' needs, and calling her sister properties to see of they have any rooms available. I could not believe how efficient she was multitasking. She ensured me that she would find me a room, and it was not all right for Choicehotels to not take any responsibilities especially it was late in the evening and I was traveling with little kids. She asked that Choicehotels to find me a room as all her sister properties in Manhattan were fully booked, and refund my money that was already charged to my credit card account. Choicehotels would not do anything and she again asked to speak with someone else. She got disconnected and called back and spoke with another Choicehotels personnel and again she had to repeat what had happened. Finally, she got a claim number for me to make a claim and at the same time she went online and searched for other hotels and found one hotel (other brand hotel) in downtown that was available and booked it for me. I cannot thank her enough for spending about 45 minutes or more talking to Choicehotels. While Quality Inn is lucky enough to have a great and competent staff who would go above and beyond for someone she just met, especially she could have said to me it wasn't her fault and it was Choicehotels' and I needed to deal with them myself, it is unfortunate that Choicehotels' staff members were incompetent and inconsiderate, and did not bother to apologize and did nothing to remedy the situation. As it was late and my kids were hungry, Ms Foster told me to just leave my car in the front of the hotel and Maria, the housekeeper would watch my car (as the spot was for temporary parking) while my kids and I go eat. Maria was so kind enough to come out of the hotel with me and showed me several places where we could go grab a bite. At one point Ms. Foster even offer me to park my car at the hotel's garage (since I booked Free Parking package) if I stay near the area and could not find parking. This is the time when you can encounter true human beings who are compassionate. Unfortunately, I can't comment on the rooms, but judging from the hard work and helpfulness of the staff, I am sure the rooms are clean and comfortable. The reception area is small but cozy with a sitting area nearby, it is clean and the hotel appearance looks clean as well.","Rochester, New York",14,4.0

Another disappointment was that the second night we were at the hotel, the toilet overflowed after my husband flushed it. The overflow was so bad that it basically flooded the bathroom. A very helpful staff member had to come in to vacuum out the excess water, but even the carpet near the bathroom felt soaked. We requested a different room, and were promptly sent to an identical room two floors up. While this was an inconvenience, we were at least thankful that the staff handling the incident responded to our problem right away, and then moved us to another room upon request. The second room was actually a bit better, since one of the lamps in the first room kept flickering on and off. Also, the first room had an unsightly patch on the ceiling that was discolored and looked like there was some sort of damage (I'm not sure exactly, but it looked really bad). As for the beds at this hotel - the beds were clean, but the pillows were not very firm and my husband had a hard time with that. The comforters on the bed had some pilling, but were otherwise clean and standard for a budget hotel. The location of this hotel was a short walk to Penn Station and all the surrounding attractions. However, it is also very near some trafficky areas that are close to the exits/entrances to the tunnels that lead out of New York, so the area feels less residential and more industrial once you go further west. Overall, we had a nice stay at this hotel and would recommend it for a traveller who wants a place to sleep and shower, and who is looking for an affordable, no-frills stay in New York.","New York City, New York",0,3.0

We arrived pretty late and got checked in by William, who was extremely helpful and gave us a few ideas of where we could get something to eat after a 15 hour long train journey. (On that I'd recommend the Starlight diner just down the road!). William was a great first impression for this hotel.The room was fine but scruffy marks on the walls, there were a few hairs in the bathroom but we were too tired to care. The next morning our toilet was blocked (on the verge of overflowing) so we went down to reception to report it. In addition to this, the safe wasn't working either (and complicated to set with no directions). The unfriendly girl on reception said she'd send someone to fix it so we headed off but when we got back that evening it was still blocked. They had someone come up and unblock it. The following morning, same again, loo blocked, safe still not working either. Got the same handy man up who unblocked the loo, but he couldn't work out how to fix the safe so got the hotel manager up to do it. They had to get a different desk from another room with a safe attached to it. After an hour or so we were leaving the hotel and the handy man made a comment to us on our way out the door to 'maybe remember him in our will'. There was no way I was giving him a tip for 'fixing' something in our room that didn't work in the first place but he was obviously unimpressed.That evening, loo blocked again. Husband made a complaint about it this time and the girl on reception took $50 off our bill. I should mention that the hotel is having work done and they told us that all plumbing problems were down to broken pumps etc. Other guests complained of the shower water being filthy but ours was ok.The following morning as we were about to leave the for the day, a different hotel manager was having an argument with one of the painters in the lobby about who was going to pay them for the work they were doing. He told him that he didn't give a [--] but that it wasn't his concern and then walked over towards us saying at the top of his voice 'you [--] piece of [--]'. Nice...We were able to leave our luggage there until we were leaving NY that evening which was good but a different receptionist was waiting for her tip for literally opening the luggage door for us. We're really generous tippers but come on...we had to carry them up the half tiled steep steps by ourselves.We went for breakfast one morning but there was nothing much left only orange juice and chocolate mini doughnuts. Breakfast is pretty early mid week (6.30am - 9.30am). The TV in the room appeared to have a good few channels but after flicking through them, they were mostly pay per view movies (about 5 channels showing the same thing).Location wise, the hotel is between 9th & 10 ave, or between 9th & Dyer so it's a bit far west of the main areas of Manhattan. The area felt pretty safe but I wouldn't wander about here by myself late at night. There's some good places to eat on 8th & 9th ave.I think I'd spend the extra few $$ to stay in a more centrally located hotel in future.

I booked this and hoped for the best.We checked in at 3p and immediately got to our room. The lobby has free coffee/tea/oatmeal 24/7. Our room and bathroom were SO CLEAN. The room itself even had room on each side of the king size bed unlike a lot of hotel rooms in NYC where it looks like the bed takes up all the space. We had a flat screen tv, a mini-coffee maker, a tall dresser to hang our clothes up in (on wooden hangers), and night stands with drawers on each side of the bed (with working lamps and a Bible!) The room also had a safe ($2 per day inevitable charge for it), an iron, and an ironing board. Our view was total-NY: skyscrapers. The bathroom has shampoo, lotion, and 2 bars of soap; no conditioner. If you forget anything like a toothbrush or razor, just let the hotel staff know and they'll provide you with whatever you need. The bathroom was clean, tub and toilet were scrubbed to perfection. The hotel boasts a complimentary continental breakfast that includes: 2 different flavored waffles, cereal, eggs, sausages, yogurts, an assortment of donuts/muffins, and juices. There is also FREE WIFI so bring your laptop if necessary. If you're staying Saturday into Sunday, there is free on the street parking, ONLY ON THE COMFORT INN SIDE AFTER 10PM starting Saturday. READ THE SIGN CAREFULLY. There are other streets to park on nearby, just read the signs. Check out time is noon; most hotels I know want you out by 11 latest.

Unless you are traveling with a group of friends, or if you don’t mind staying in hostels and/or having shared bathrooms, a good chunk of your travel budget will be spent in your accommodations.For the price I paid, $110 per night, the Comfort Inn Convention Center was a great bargain that allowed me to have additional funds to enjoy some of the city’s superb restaurants and a couple of Broadway shows. Room:Similarly, to all the other NYC hotels I have stayed in the past, the room is small. This is common and to be expected. If a large room is one of your requirements, you might want to try staying in Brooklyn or Long Island City. However, you must also take the subway fare into consideration if you decide to stay outside of Manhattan. The room was appropriate and comfortable. It was cleaned every day, and due to the location of the hotel, it was quiet at night. I believe this is the first time I have stayed in a Manhattan hotel in which I could not hear the traffic below. The hotel provides free wifi in the room, which was useful for making reservations and getting directions. Breakfast:This hotel offers a complimentary breakfast. It is not a huge buffet, but again, I thought it was appropriate for a budget hotel. There were juices, yogurt, whole fruit (banana, apples, and oranges), boiled eggs, bread, English muffin, batter for making waffles, coffee, instant oatmeal, cooked sausage, and some sort of frittata. Of the three nights I stayed there, the breakfast area was only overly crowded in one of the days – the space is tiny, but again it was not a surprise to us. For this reason, we just grabbed some bananas and yogurt and went on our merry way. Location:For folks who are not familiar with NYC, the location may look a little scary and out of the way, but it was only about two blocks from the nearest metro entrance at 8th and 35st. The hotel location is also an easy walk to Times Square and the Theater District. We even walked all the way to 62th street to catch a movie at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas. The hotel is also within walking distance to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and several of the interstate bus stops (Bolt, Megabus, etc…).Returning to the hotel at night was not a problem, but as in any large city, you need to be alert and aware of your surroundings. Overall, I think this is a good hotel if you want to stay in Manhattan, have your own bathroom and you are budget conscious and street savvy. If you need luxury accommodations, large rooms, and to be in the middle of Times Square, you should prepare your pockets and look somewhere else. I certainly plan to stay in this hotel again: It is a clean and quiet place to rest your head in the city that never sleeps.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",39,4.0

Not only did they try to move me to another location 2 miles away (very far from where I had to be), but they stuck me in a smoking room when I finally got my room back (when I specifically booked non-smoking, as proven by the receipt I presented to them). I have horrible allergies to smoke, and the room was truly disgusting with the stink of old cigarettes. Ashes were even left in the ashtray from the previous tenant. I couldn't sleep, and when I told them that it was a real health condition, they were unconcerned. It took a call from my company's CEO before they put an 'air purifier' into my room, which was a little, LOUD blocky fan from 1970 - which shut off every hour, prompting me to get out of bed frequently to turn it back on, for whatever minimal way it was saving my lungs. The window in the room didn't open, either - I would have settled for a window I could open.When the toilet backed up within 10 minutes of checking in, they told me to go out and find a plunger in the hallway. I had to climb over a pile of garbage and vacuum cleaners in the 5th floor landing to finally secure a plunger.The blanket on my bed was badly stained. Needless to say, it was a miserable, disgusting experience.By night 2, I was moved up to the 14th floor, which was MUCH better maintained, had a fancy widescreen TV, no horrible stench, a working toilet, and clean sheets.

We found this a great way to get around.We found the staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and gave us help with everything, from how to use a phone card (which cost $10 and lasted for a long time when phoning the UK), to which train to get on the Metro.

I have been to new york many times before and love being near macys and within 5 minute walk to the empire state building. It also only took about 20 minutes to get to times square. The reception staff were great ordered us a takeaway one night and booked our taxi for our return to JFK. They were really helpful with information on getting to woodbury common which i highly recommend for bargain shopping. The rooms were nothing fancy but you dont want that from a city hotel if you are out and about alot like i am. It was clean and tidy. We didnt hear any noise at night time from the outside streets so i would suggest anyone staying here to request a high floor room. The hotel does have 2 lifts. We booked a room with 2 beds in which were really comfortable with loads of pillows. Bathroom was clean and spacious. Thats all you need really. The breakfast was a good start to the day. They had fruit juices, water and tea and coffee included and a good choice of breads, bagels, croissants, donuts and waffles. the lobby had free tea and coffee all day.

The baseboards in our room had 3 inches of dust and dirt. The bedspread had cigarette burns.

The hotel looks shabby inside and out but the public areas are actually very clean. The king size bed in our room was very comfortable and again the room and bathroom were very clean. The serve yourself breakfast offers a good choice and as much as you want to eat, and similarly the free hot drinks machine available for guests at all times is a welcome facility. Amici 26 on the corner of 36th and 8th is a real find - hot and cold buffet food, homely soups and all sorts of snacks and pastries that you can eat in or take back to the hotel 5 minutes walk away.The less good - the feel of the hotel is more like a hostel. You get used to it quickly but it is a utility experience. The room heater (not working initially but quickly fixed by the maintenance man) pushes out tepid air rather noisily. Similarly the hot water for the bath and shower was too cool for my liking on max although the sink was fine.The location is not bad - a bit distant from the main drag particularly in pouring rain but subways and buses are close by if needed. The bad - definitely the room size, which was tiny by any city's standards. There was nowhere to put our two fairly large cases (we had been travelling in the US previously) and to use the in-room coffee machine provided we would have had to move the wardrobe to get to the power point. We didn't bother and just got drinks from the lobby.

The location is spartan in terms of action or entertainment which is perfect for me but might not be what you'd be looking for if you are with kids you want to dazzle.

A few years earlier in town I stayed at a nice room at the Plaza before it started going condo and I definately know about more fully featured places. And without reservation I tell you I had more fun (and saved more) this trip staying at the Comfort Inn on 36th.

Despite complaints from some here I found the place to be an excellent value and an above average all around hotel. The hotel is located between 9th and 10th on 36th street, and I understood complaints about the hotel being located on a pair of dead blocks - 36th between 10th and 8th don't have businesses or stuff on them, just a highway, parking lot, etc. But on 10th and 8th there are businesses so its not like the area is ominous (I'm a single woman who lives in a city), especially during the day it's industrial but not far from shops. I never ended up walking this stretch at night alone, which might have been a wee bit spooky, but this is NYC, the probability you'll take a cab back after a night out is high and that's mostly what I did. At least the location of the place ensures it is quiet, which my room was, on the 14th floor. The room clean and pleasant but tight - like all hotels I've stayed in in NYC - with about 2' of room around a big king bed. The coffeemaker in the room was much appreciated (no place to plug in but the bathroom, but I didn't care) as was free continental breakfast on the ground floor every morning. Hotel staff were very helpful, when asking for directions to a friend's house in Brooklyn one of the staff went so far as to print us out a map of how to get from the train to their place - super nice! I paid $162 for my stay and I'd definitely do it again.

Still, it was large enough to squeeze an air mattress on the floor to sleep on.As for the location, it was a mere 10-minute walk to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, or our Broadway theaters. By the end of our visit, our feet were hurting, so we took taxis back from our Broadway shows. They cost us $5-$7 (for all 3 of us). By the way, taxi drivers in NYC are nuts! Fasten your seat belts! The neighborhood was a bit gloomy at night, but we were never threatened. I wouldn't recommend an unaccompanied woman walking here at night.

I was last in NY in June 2004 and stayed at the New Yorker - which I gave an overall rating of 3 blobs based on position and value. We wanted a similar location and just a place to sleep, shower and shave at a budget price, (leaving more to spend, spend, spend) hence the Comfort Inn, however it was only when I called to confirm our reservations that I found I hadn't booked the 42 W. 35th St location but the one at 442 W. 36th Street. This was my mistake and is the Ugly part. The geographical location isn't too bad - it's the physical location that might put people off. BE SURE WHICH COMFORT INN YOU BOOK.The Bad is that the hotel itself has no street level frontage - you have to go down several steps although there is a lift for wheelchair access. You enter a reception lobby you couldn't swing a cat in which leads into an area of about 6 tables and chairs for the self-service buffet breakfast. We were there on St Patrick's Day and a lot of Irish celebrating the day were staying in the hotel - highlighting the problem of 'get in early if you want a table'. Some reviewers have knocked the choice for breakfast but if you want a quick fuel-up before tackling the sights and shopping, the choices are fine - cakes, bagels, toast, cereals, fruit, fruit juices and hot beverages. We saved a lot of time not having to look for somewhere to eat breakfast and coming back to the hotel late at night, instant hot drinks were very welcome. This was Good. Also Good was the room - twin beds, very clean, linens and towels changed every day - smallish but I've stayed in similar for twice the price. The hotel is too small to have a concierge and depending who's on duty, the staff don't know much about what's going on but they tried hard to help and meant well.Overall, when you take into account the cost, (the £/$ exchange rate makes everything look cheap), the good outweighs the bad, hence an overall 4 blobs. Would I stay here again? I'd probably try the 35th St one first, followed by the one on West 46th Street but if couldn't get in (I tried once I discovered my mistake but there were no vacancies), then if I was on a budget, I'd give the Comfort Inn on 36th another go - it's really only where it's located that's the problem.","Essex, England",72,4.0

The staff at the hotel were the excellent, offering great suggestions on things to do and places to eat. (Try the 24 hour diner a couple blocks from the hotel 9th & 34th I think). Having a small breakfast of cereal, bread, donuts, bagels, fruit, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and juice topped off the stay. It was enough to get the body going for running around New York.

There were about 2-3 blocks you might not want to walk alone late at night---but we encountered no one scary---thing is we encountered no one period. I am a budget minded person who wants to get the most for the best price and I researched on the internet approx 20 hours. Paid $152.10 + tax per night for two people. Had a double bed and a single bed. Had booked two other hotels and then read bad reviews, so canceled each time. I would stay at this Comfort Inn again. Rooms were small but clean. Didn't like that the bottom sheet was not fitted, as it didn't stay in place. In the morning had a nice free continental breakfast with instant or dry cereal, donuts, bagels, coffee, milk, juice, tea. The juice, coffee, and tea were available all the ! time.It was about a 6 block walk to the main area that leads to Times Square. #1 thing to do if this is your first trip there---pay to ride the double decker tourist bus. Was $49.00 for 48 hours.....that's the best deal one. People are standing on the sidewalk areas by the bus stops selling tickets. You get to ride for 48 hours and hear the tourist guide tell you about the buildings and areas. We rode it from beginning to end the first day, then the 2nd & 3rd day, rode it and got off and on at a couple of locations. At night there are street vendors who appear on corners. You can get some good deals----found a couple of vendors selling nice purses for $5.00. Most of the purse vendors selling the ""Prada"" and ""Gucci"" fake purses charge at least $25.00 per purse.Lots of places to eat from Subways to expensive. Every block has lots of deli's.Tons of people up all hours of the night.Our first trip there and I enjoyed it very much. There are two locations, if your are willing to stand in line for hours, to get half price Broadway tickets. Would recommend if you really want to see a Broadway play to get your ticket for full price ahead of time.

I have to agree with most of the other reviews that I read here on trip advisor and say that yes, this is a very nice and clean and comfortable hotel. For the money that we paid it was great value- we paid $116us per night plus taxes. We were pleasantly surprised to find a nice little hotel- very small and quiet but quite comfortable. The rooms are not large of course nor did we expect them to be for a New York City budget hotel, but we did find that they were quite nice-very clean and nicely decorated. The bathroom is a good, generous size and also very clean. The location is actually very good, as it is a 5 minute walk to the major areas and attractions-like Macy's-the Empire State Bldg and Times Square, Penn Station etc are not far from here. The hotel is situated on 36th and 10th avenue in a slightly seedy looking side street ,which is okay when you are walking back to the hotel in the day time but at night you may want to do what we did which was to walk along 34th (which always has people and stores and lights) until you get to 9th avenue, turn go along 9th to 36th and down 36th to 10th and the hotel is right there.The breakfast (7-10am) that is included with the price of your room is good- they offer tea, coffee, juice, mini muffins, donuts, bagels, toast/w/jam and cereal. The tea and coffee and juice is available all day long. When we got back to the hotel from shopping and sightseeing it was nice to grab a cup of something to take back to our room. All in all, I would have to say that I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are like most middle class travellers and are travelling on a budget and want good value for your money.

The only flaw was the paint around the showerhead was chipping, and the shower nozzle was hard to figure out.We had a room on the 14th floor, and while we heard no noise from neighbors, (the hotel was fully booked that weekend) there was plenty of elevator noise since our room #1400 was flush against the elevator. If you don’t want to hear the hydraulics of the elevator going up & down all night, don’t accept a room that ends in “00.” Rooms that end in either 03 or 04 would be preferrable as they are further down the hallway.The complimentary breakfast was typical & convenient (cereal, fruit, OJ, mini-muffins, bagels, etc.) with complimentary USA Todays which were available at the front desk. Overall, very good hotel for the money & location - would definitely stay there again.","Rockville, Maryland",95,4.0

We found that the hotel was on a side street with a flop house mission next door and not much open if you are walking on 36th from 5th or 6th avenues. The rooms are small but if it's a clean bed and clean bathroom you need then this is your spot. The continental breakfast included in the price is reasonable enouph to fill you up until midday. All in all - good price, clean room, free breakfast.","Toronto, Ontario",1,3.0

We wanted a clean, comfortable hotel in a convenient location that didn't cost the earth. We got just that and more! Rooms were spotless, and roomier than we expected for NYC, breakfast was more than adequate to set you up for a day pounding the streets and staff were helpful and pleasant. Alex on front desk was a star in helping us plan our itinerary, and we had many an appertif in Brendans bar before hitting the road. Location could not be beaten. Excellent all round, great value for money, would definately recommend and would return without a doubt, (and we're not easy to please!)","Yorkshire, United Kingdom",3,4.0

However, I cannot adequately express how wonderful all of the hotel clerks and staff were. Rooms are small but have great ammenities for their size. Prices absolutely fantastic. What was missing in elaborate decor was certainly made up for by the treatment we received. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and will go back. Can't say enough good about it!!!!","Brigham City, Utah",15,5.0

Despited the worn condition of the lobby, the room, though small, was newly renovated with very comfortable beds. The bathroom was large by NYC standards and you could actually move around without bumping into yourself. The room was very soundproof. The elevators were a bit slow and small for anyone who is claustrophobic. The location is close to both the metro and bus transportation which we used exclusively. Those who have business in the fashion district will find it convenient and those who are shopping at Macy's will be just a block away. Madison Square Garden is close as well. The staff was very helpful in responding to questions about getting around the city. A drawback is there aren't many restaurants within a few blocks. The continental breakfast is basic with cereal, muffins juice and coffee. I would stay here again as it is an excellent value.","Madison, WI",0,4.0

The rooms are quite clean and comfortable and are spacious enough where you can easily move around (and several of the rooms are handicap accessible). What makes the Comfort Inn stand out from other NYC hotels in the same price range is the amenities. Each room has an iron/ironing board, blow dryer and coffee maker. A complimentary continental breakfast is served every morning and you can get free juice, coffee and tea 24 hours a day. If you need to chek e-mail, free internet access is available in the lobby and you can grab a free copy of USA Today from the front desk. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and are happy to help you with your sightseeing plans. If you want a room with a phenomenal view of midtown Manhattan, be sure to get a room ending with the numbers ""01"" or ""02"" on floors 12 and up. The best hotel bargain in NYC, but let's keep it our little secret.",,87,4.0

Exactly what I was looking for. I had trouble finding reviews on it before I booked it, but I booked anyway, due to the price (this is a VERY inexpensive NYC hotel), hoping I would be pleasantly surprised - and I totally was. It is in a great location (especially if you come in via bus to Port Authority, we walked there in less then 5 minutes). It is also less then a 5 minute walk from all the action on 34th st (and subway access). Check-in & check-out took all of 60 seconds each, the front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Admittedly, our room was tiny, but in NYC you shouldn't be in your room except to sleep & shower! There is just TOO much to do! The room was very clean and the bathroom was of a nice size (had a large tub & hairdryer). The air conditioner worked great. Also, there was a free breakfast every morning of donuts, muffins, coffee & juice. The hotel was not too crowded and wasn't in a noisy area. I will definitely stay here the next time I travel to NYC.","Smithsburg, Maryland",15,4.0
