When I posted this on Marriott.com I received an email asking me to contact the hotel. I did but the person who emailed was no longer employed and whoever answered had zero interest in why I'd called. Upon checking my review on Marriott I see that Mia Fowler responded claiming no harm was done because we ate in the lounge. My review noted this wasn't true, we paid to eat out. She also claimed to have put 5,000 points in my Marriott account for our inconvenience but it's coming up on two months and nothing has credited.Advice to property, when you mess up and email a customer asking them to call in, don't blow them off when they do. More advice. When you promised a token amount of points to make up for a larger loss, at least follow through.Not a bad hotel but sloppy management.","Portland, OR, USA",19,3.0

However, given its location (Manhattan) and the fact that I've had my share of stays at incredibly subpar properties in the area, I'd consider the Sheraton to be a decent place to stay, especially when considering the price.Rooms are spacious enough, breakfast is decent enough, it's reasonably clean (although it could stand to use a refurb in the near future) and has fast WiFi. The right kind of business hotel that does the job and doesn't break the bank. This is my third stay there, and won't hesitate to return should I have meetings nearby.","San Jose, California",148,3.0

The rooms are very small and for me at least, good for 1 person to relax in comfortably. Most of the time I've gotten rooms facing east or south which means very little to any view but recently I (somehow) got a west facing room which faces towards the Hudson River (although you need to have a higher floor to get the true view). Rooms have been renovated in the last few years with the typical Sheraton standards----clean and comfortable and they usually stock the bathroom with all the amenities you might need.Staff has also gotten better----in the past they were a bit gruff but now are much friendlier and helpful. If you want/get Club access, the Club has terrific views including an outdoor terrace (which is open to anyone staying on the Club floor). The Club is smaller than most and can get very crowded if there are more than 15 people in there. The location is central to SoHo and downtown/FiDi (about a 15 minute easy walk). If coming from JFK, the E train stops right around the block at Canal Street making it easy to get to or depart from. Lots of terrific bars and restaurants in the immediate area and while there are many pricier ones, do look around on the internet as there are many reasonably priced (and fun) places here too.","Los Angeles, California",7,4.0

For being in NYC, this hotel is actually a great deal.The hotel itself is out of the hustle and bustle of Times Square (where I ended up anyway due to a broadway show). It was an easy subway ride from our hotel to Times Square. If you are traveling by subway keep in mind it’s $2.75 per person per ride. The subway stop is Canal St but it’s a few blocks walk to the hotel. It’s easy to miss it if you aren’t looking for it, look for the large post office on the southeast corner. We got to the hotel around 5PM and during our walk we were harassed by the typical Canal St dealers selling their knock offs. If you aren’t interested, keep your eyes down and keep walking. We got a standard room for under $100/night which was an amazing price for NYC. Being Marriott Elite we were hoping for an upgrade but on a Saturday night there were none available. Hoping for the best but preparing for the worst, we made our way up to our room and was pleasantly surprised. Room 1620 was the typical small size but had a gorgeous view of the city. The room could use an upgrade but it met our needs just fine. The room looked right out to the NYC skyline, seeing Hudson Yards, the Empire State Building and everything in between. During the day it was nice but at night you can’t capture how pretty it is. The bed was comfortable enough and we both had a decent nights sleep. We got 2 free bottles of water in the room along with a larger bottle for purchase for $4. If you have lounge access, just go and grab a few bottles from there if you need. The only time the room was too small was when my wife was sitting at the desk and I needed to get to the chair on the other side of the room. I couldn’t squeeze through so I had to roll over the bed to get there.Being elite, we get access to the lounge on the 21st floor. This was also small but nicer than other lounges we’ve been in. They have the same gorgeous views of the sunset but just a bit better because of the additional height. They have a nice happy hour every day from 5-7PM. They offer free wine or beer plus some snacks like cheese, hummus, veggies w/ dip and chips and salsa. We heard there was food there and thought we’d be able to eat dinner there but that wasn’t really the case. There was a good amount of food but I wouldn’t plan a dinner around this. We did enjoy about 7 glasses of wine amongst the 2 of us so I can’t say anything bad about the lounge. The noise wasn’t too bad from the outside. Not sure if it was the fact that we were on the 16th floor or that there wasn’t too much car traffic in this area but I didn’t hear anything throughout the night. Overall this was a pleasant stay and hotel and I would stay here again versus being right in the heart of the city.","Stamford, Connecticut",3,4.0

For us the hotel was perfectly situated. We could walk to the World Trade Center sight, thete's a great deli and coffee shop next door. There are 2 different subway stops, one right around the corner and the other maybe 2 blocks away. There is also a great little Italian restaurant around the corner recommended to us by the concierge.The concierge was amazing. So funny and full of life. He was like watching a show with everyone. The room was nice but it seems the windows aren't double glazed because I have stayed in lots of big cities and this room was by far the noisiest. You heard every noise outside. The room itself was large but weirdly configured. To get into the teeny tiny dark closet you had to move the nightstand to open the door. I needed my flashlight to see inside. In order to see the TV from the bed you needed to lay on your left side as it is directly next to the side of the bed. Our room had a very comfy chair and sofa. There was also a large kitchen table and 4 chairs...weird. I think the whole room needs to be redesigned.The executive lounge was small and very hot with a limited breakfast selection. Not what is expected in an executive lounge. However in the warmer months, this lounge also has a huge outdoor area with amazing views. Again a redesign is needed and a refurb as the furniture is all dirty and stained. Nice touch in the evening is free unlimited booze.The staff are all exemplary. From the minute I arrived everyone was wonderful. Housekeepers, front desk staff, executive lounge staff and especially the concierge.As a lifetime Titanium member I have stayed in lots of Marriott properties. For me it served ir's purpose for a 4 night stay but I don't know that I would want to stay longer. That being said, I am planning on returning January 2021.","Naples, Florida",250,3.0

We stayed for one night this past weekend and had the following issues: 1) 20th Floor room was incredibly noisy from both the street (which is understandable, it's NYC) but also from the elevator, which generated a loud banging noise all night. This hotel is poorly maintained, has thin walls and is long overdue for renovation. Do not stay here if you need to sleep. 2) The Sheraton ""Lounge"" is a gross exaggeration of what you're getting. The Sunday breakfast ends at 9am, the earliest I've ever seen for a weekend breakfast, and food/beverage options the rest of the day are minimal. Not worth the upgrade. 3) Service at the front desk can best be described as apathetic. There seems to be no incentive or desire to do anything but the bare minimum.

This is a great hotel. Staff are professional and friendly. We always got a lovely greeting when leaving or entering the hotel. The location is just brilliant. We used the subway for the week and it seemed that every train stopped on Canal Street where the hotel is based. Yes turning right out of the hotel means you do come across some street sellers which may seem intimidating at first but they are not. Once you say no they move onto the next person. Turning left and then left again puts you into a really lovely area with great restaurants and the best pizza slice I have ever had. Room was very clean and much larger than we expected for New York. No real noise issue but then again we were tired from exploring all day. One block up and you are in Soho and would pay much more per night. Easy to walk to One WTC.

We usually stay in Mid Town and then fall into the trap of never leaving the Times Square area. We got outside our comfort zone a bit and hung around Chinatown, Little Italy and the Village. The hotel is an area that might scare off some people. It's a little sketchy on the edge of Chinatown, but it's the ""charm"" I love about the city. The hotel itself is great. Modern with a huge bar area on the first floor. The young man who checked us in, Sal, was super cool and very professional. We did not utilize the gym on such a short stay, but did check out the lounge on the 21st floor. 24 hour access to water, pop and snacks is always appreciated. There is also an outdoor patio up there, which offered a fantastic view of the city to the North. We stayed in a King on the 11th floor. Typical small NYC room, but quite cozy. Good AC, fantastic shower and comfortable bed for all activities! Clean and modern. Not much more to ask for.We also received a nice email from the assistant manager, Mai, when we returned home.

Here’s why: - first major downfall, no contact details for the hotel can be found at all! No email address across, Expedia, trip advisor, Sheraton website, Facebook page. Nothing! No way to confirm your room prior to arriving!!! Something that needs to be addressed! -Check in process was ok, nothing special with staff, didn’t really go above and beyond however was quick. Didn’t touch on wifi so we had to check that it was complementary. - room wasn’t serviced until really late in the day or early morning so be sure to use your do not disturb sign if you would like to sleep in. - Rooms are not quite, noise from hallway and outside sirens/ traffic is normal. This only bothered us a few nights with loud people in the hallway, however the rest of the time was ok. We were on level 10. - Rooms are not smoking however we did smell weed within the hallway etc.- Towels and linen are clean and crisp. However there is no doona per se it’s sheets on top of the bed. - Room is small, hard to have two cases with luggage out. You get that most places in NY so this is average. - We requested a fridge on the third night we were here to be told they had none available, after requesting again in person they were able to send one up. Rooms should come accompanied with a fridge, wouldn’t have been a problem if staying one night however for two weeks it was nice to have a cold drink or milk available for a tea or coffee in the morning. If your staying a while I’d request one prior to arriving. - Pillows were very flat! It did say on the website they had a pillow menu available however it wasn’t on the in room guide. We didn’t eat in the restaurant, only had a drink at the bar. Was good value during happy hour. It’s not advertised however Friday and saturdays have free drinks and nibbles for members in the 27th floor lounge. This was a nice touch, along with festive drinks and hot chocolates in the afternoons in the lobby. The location is central to those using the subway and if you don’t mind walking to locations like china town, Wall Street, little Italy etc. 99c pizza and delis are a short walk too! Overall it was ok. I wouldn’t stay here again however I wasn’t overly impressed nor disappointed.","Perth, Australia",36,3.0

The rooms were clean, but there is a lot of road noise. The location is very close to China town and a stones throw from Tribeca. My issues revolve around the hotel using a very dangerous taxi company to take us to JFK. He was extremely dangerous, weaving in and out of traffic on the Freeway and we had at leat 4 near misses. I had to yell at him to stop at least three times. He also had an iPad in the front seat and I do not think it is ieagl to watch programmes on it and still drive, To add insult to injury he over charged us by $13 despite it being an agreed fare with the hotel. I emailed Marriott customer services at least 3 times and never had a response. I eventually rang the hotel (at international call rates) and complained to Sal (the hotel manager). He assured me that they would take that particular taxi driver off their books and refund the $13 via the travel agent. My issue is that the hotel should throughly vet the drivers before and not put their guests lives at risk. Ina addition, I have never received my $13 refund, despite t at least 4 emails to BOTH Sal and Mia. I have also rang the hotel and every time I get to reception and ask for Mia and Sal I am always cut off. When everything is ok, the hotel will communicate with you. When they need to learn from experience, they seem to not bother or care about their guests. I have stayed at a number of hotels in Manhattan and I have to say the customer service in relation to this incident has been atrocious. I am sure I will get a stock response, asking me to reach out to the hotel. What is the point when they cut you off the phone or never replay to emails!","Bristol, United Kingdom",37,1.0

Inside is a little better but rather old fashioned.- Our room looked tired and not well maintained. The phone didn't work, light bulb was hanging from the socket, etc.- Our window ""view"" was a brick wall. We asked to change but we were told curtly that this was the only room available... As we had booked 11 months previously, I would have hoped for something better and also a more helpful response from reception staff.- Some reception staff (not all) were generally quite rude and unhelpful. For example, I asked about the Club Lounge when we checked in and we were told it was available only for Club members. After a couple nights, I learned from a different staff member that this was untrue and anyone can pay $30 for access.While the price does help to counterbalance some of the negatives, it wasn't the stay I had hoped for.","Oxford, United Kingdom",61,3.0

Check-in time was 3pm but we were coming off a cruise so arrived early at 11.30ish. We knew the room wouldn't be ready but wanted to leave our bags to walk round the city so we did this and were told our room would be ready, as expected, at 3pm. We walked miles and ended up getting back, totally exhausted, at 4.30pm. Plenty of time to have a quick nap and get changed in time for our restaurant booking at 6.45pm. But our room wasn't ready. We were told to wait another hour and that we could wait in the club lounge. They made this seem like a special treat even though it was included with our booking anyway. So we waited until 5.30pm and called back down. Still not ready!! They said it would be at least another hour which meant we'd have to go to our restaurant booking as we were, sweaty and under dressed. I also have a slipped disc in my back and it was hurting so much that I really needed to just lie down. We went for the meal and returned for us to finally be allowed in our room at 9.30ish. We collapsed onto our beds and I logged in to the WiFi (included with our room)... or tried to. There was no WiFi signal. I stepped outside the door to the room and tried again and sure enough it worked. Our room was seemingly the only place with no reception! Over the next two days I wasted hours of my holiday on the phone to their tech support who seemed to subscribe to The IT Crowd method of turning everything on and off again, and with the hotel's own engineer, but to no avail. This was massively inconvenient as we needed to make plans and call family members, especially as I had my 30th birthday while we were there.

I had to be in NYC for a quick morning meeting and I like to stay in walking distance to events I am speaking at and the Sheraton Tribeca was the perfect location. It is a great business hotel, easy in and out, great staff and the manager wrote me a couple of times to make sure everything was the way I wanted it. Great front desk staff and I had room service twice both times fast and food good. I flew SFO-EWR because this hotel is literally a couple of blocks from where the Holland Tunnel starts and ends. The issue, it was 9/11 and while I arrived around 8 PM I had goosebumps the entire time I was a mile or less from Ground Zero and the lights that night were over powering. I was in SF on 9/11 but the emotions I felt 18 years later being near that hallowed ground were as if it happened all over again, very, very emotional for me and I have to say the hotel staff was prepared and I was not the only person having these feelings. Very high marks at every level of this hotel on a most emotional night and also thank you to the manager who wrote me to make sure things were OK not many people would do that so again highest marks from me.","San Francisco, California",58,5.0

While the room was small with little space to move around, the patio was very large with seating for 4. I think the patio was bigger than the room. It was nice to have a private outdoor space just to myself to relax after a day of activities. Just wish there was a table on the patio.  The room consisted of a standard bathroom with shower, king bed, wardrobe for storage, safe, desk with chair, and TV. The room was a bit dated and could use a refresh, however, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was adequate with excellent water pressure in the shower. One issue we discovered is that the thermostats are off by about 10 degrees, we set the a/c to 63 get the room cool. I noticed in the concierge lounge the thermostat was set at 60 and the lounge was comfortable. The concierge lounge is accessible 24/7 with access to a rooftop patio that faces uptown. In the evening, a bar was setup on the rooftop. In the morning, we had breakfast which consisted of eggs, sausage, potatoes, toast, yogurt and pastries. It was a bit crowed in the morning, with folks waiting for seats. We ate around 8 am. The hotel is conveniently located near multiple subway lines. Several restaurants within walking distance.

Our first time at this location because we wanted to explore this part of NYC instead. Location is excellent with lots of shopping and restaurants all within walking distance. However the hotel is really average. The King bed was too soft and lack support and the covers literally comprised of 3 sheets. We requested to change our room to 2 Queen beds instead the following day with the hope of a better supporting smaller bed. Also the pillows are totally soft and flat when you lay on them. When I called to request for a harder pillow , I was told their pillows are all the same. So needless to say, we did not sleep well at all for the 2 nights that we spent at the hotel.

The location is great, the hotel and service was a major let down. We had two significant issues during our four night/five day stay. The first issue was our room AC did not work. Our room was a good 10-15 degrees warmer than the hallway. The first night we were tired from our travels and slept ok. The second night we both woke up in full sweats as room kept getting warmer, We visited the front desk the next morning and we were told it would be fixed or we would be moved to another room. Later that day when we came back to the hotel and it was not fixed. A new front desk person then told us she had no record of our morning report and that she had no other room for us. She sent up maintenance and he played with it and then said not to open the curtains the rest of our stay. We hardly slept the next two nights, we made an effort to not stay in the room at all during the day. It was miserable, I made two reports to the front desk and never heard back until I filled out a random survey after the stay and then they said here is 6,000 points for not sleeping. The second issue was the club lounge. They could not handle the crowd and made no adjustments, Two of the four mornings they ran out of hot breakfast an hour before closing. They were consistently out of bottle water and soft drinks. The entire experience in this hotel was poor. With so many Bonvoy options in NYC we recommend you skip this one.","Herndon, Virginia",16,1.0

Amazing view of the Empire State Building and city. I have to give the staff a heads up. Our room was not ready when we arrived but Sal Angioletti the front office supervisor let me look at some of the rooms that were and as soon as I saw our room I knew we had scored a great room. He took so much time out of his busy day to make me happy and I could see he did that for all the guests he helped - it was wonderful to be made to feel at home in a hotel we were about to spend the next ten days. I cannot say enough about how helpful the staff were (especially Sal) they helped in so many ways and everyone was so pleasant. My only complaint is that the Buffett in the lounge was pretty limited as was the Buffett in the restaurant however the staff in the lounge worked hard to keep it stocked and keep a busy lounge flowing smoothly. I have been a Marriott member a long time and most of the lounges supply more options for hor’dourves and breakfast. The other issue was the fire alarm went off at 9:00 am and there wasn’t an announcement made quickly so people were confused as to what to do and the elevators were shut down (as they should be) but still not working at 11:00 long after it was determined there was no emergency (which was the only time I regretted being on the 20th floor.) I would say the Buffett is a small issue and it’s not often an alarm goes off so neither would stop me from staying here again!,,0,5.0

From the moment we checked in it was all positive. My wife had emailed them previously and told them this was in effect our honeymoon combined with our wedding anniversary as we had been unable to take a honeymoon when we got married. We were very kindly upgraded to a higher floor with club access and a fantastic view out over the city to the Empire State Building. How awesome is that for a first visit to New York!Check in staff were lovely and welcoming and very helpful. Our room was great. Not huge but certainly big enough for our needs and was clean and tidy. Only thing I’d say was missing was a fridge. Especially as the weeks we were there the temperature was between 28 and 34 degrees. But other than that we could not fault the room at all. As part of our upgrade we had breakfast included in the lounge on the 21st floor. What a wee gem this place was. Breakfast was great with a pretty good selection of food and drinks and to top it off aRooftop terrace with fantastic views of the city and the Empire State Building. This lounge and terrace also has a happy hour every night between 5 and 7 with drinks and snacks and a bar out of the terrace on a Friday and Saturday night. Nothing nicer than a cold drink sitting out on the rooftop on a nice warm summer night with views of New York City all lit upThe Location Of The Hotel on Canalstreet was perfect too. Close to a host of Subway stations for the various lines on the subway made travelling anywhere easy. Also situated just outside Chinatown, Little Italy and Soho making allOf these places accessible with just a short walkEvelyn from housekeeping was fantastic. Very friendly and helpful she kept our room spotless and kept us well well supplied with water and the usual toiletries and towels etc. A real credit to the SheratonCheckout was easy and again the staff were helpful. We had to check out at 12 but our flight was not until11 that evening. They stored our luggage for us in a secure room and this was no issue for them.

The doorman arranged a car to collect us from the hotel and took us straight to terminal 4 at JFK airport taking all the stress of getting there with out cases out of our handsDownsides to the Sheraton?

The lobby is pretty straight forward and doesn't have much for entertainment.My only concern was my bags were stored in a door near the main entrance.

The price was pretty high, but we ate and drank enough for it to even out. The most awesome thing about the roof top wasn't the free drink and snacks, but the amazing view of Manhattan. People pay good money for that kind of view, and there we were, having free drinks and enjoying said view. I suspect the club level rooms are bigger than the rooms in the rest of the hotel. This was very nice as it allowed us to spend some time in the room when we needed rest. We had a great time at the hotel because we had club level rooms, but the rest of the hotel was unimpressive. The reception lounge was cold and uninviting and there weren't really that many comfortable places to hang out on the first floor.

Which was great if you're as sensitive to noise as I am. (This is NYC people - pack some ear-plugs! Or download a white-noise app.) The bathroom had the GREAT addition of a magnification mirror on the side wall. The toiletries were ample & of decent quality. The water pressure & temp remained at a consistent level throughout my morning showers. There was a full-length mirror just outside the bathroom. In addition to the chair at the work-desk, there was a very comfy lounging chair with ottoman in my room, (such a great touch!). Every single Sheraton employee who I had dealings with, or even a short encounter with, was terrific. (This was a bit of a shock to me...) The Club Level breakfast offerings were ok, (though the scrambled eggs weren't very good, unless I used a lot of ketchup!). I really liked their addition of sauteed onions along with the sausage. There were three options of cold cereals and an ample variety of breads, muffins, and pastries, etc.. Also, plenty of coffee, water, juices, and even soda. For the evening offerings, there were basic noshes - crackers & tortilla chips, one kind of cheese cubes, and then one kind of luncheon-meat (rolled up). Also a pasta salad. They served several wines & beers. (Also, they had a cash-bar in the Club room, if you wanted to have hard liquor as well.) I'm not much of a drinker; so I mostly just enjoyed the breakfasts and then the viewing deck for the Club Level upgrade. The Sheraton Tribeca is VERY well situated with short walks between four (4!) subway lines that I used every single day of my stay - such a great location for public transit. I can think of two areas for improvement - the lighting in the bathroom was on the dim-side. And, the in-room coffee maker was a bit of a spitter....

When we first checked in the counter staff were disinterested and unhelpful. They were barely responsive to any enquiries we had. Halfway during our stay the hot water went out, which granted, happens in older buildings in winter. However, it took two days to fix and we were never notified if it was fixed. We called repeatedly to tell them that the water was not fixed and we got a curt reply of: ""oh you have to run it for awhile"" and after informing them that we had done it for a few minutes they said it had not been fixed. This would have been fine if it happened once but we tried several times over the course of two days and each time we mentioned it we were given the exact same reply. On checking out we were told that there were no extra charges to be paid, again in a disinterested and curt manner, but then received a charge the next day on our credit card and trying to find out what the charge was about was like pulling teeth.

When I entered the room, the elevator sound was really loud. I called downstairs to see if I could change rooms. After a sigh and being put on hold, I was told to come downstairs to get another key. Wow, first time in a long time that has happened; normally someone would bring a key and help you move! And they weren’t that busy!

I am a Marriott Bonvoy member do they upgraded my room to include Lounge access (complimentary breakfast, snacks, coffee, waters and soft drinks). The room I stayed in on the 15th floor had a decent rooftop view looking east. Decent sized room (for NYC) with a queen bed, desk (with desk chair) and restroom. Bed was comfortable and you are able to open the window a few inches which is nice. The heat/air worked great. I left the fan on high to drown out some of the hallway noise. I will say that my room was near the bank of elevators so I did hear lots of loud conversations while others waited for access to them. The windows did a good job keeping outside noise out as you could hear a tremendous difference when you opened them.Lots of shopping in nearby Soho too - just a couple minutes walk away.Several subway lines were within a block or two that would get you to most places in a short time. I flew into LGA and it was about 55 minutes from getting in the MTA system. The lounge breakfast was simple with eggs, sausage, pastries, breads, yogurts and juices. It was a great treat if you are trying to save a few dollars on a meal to get your day started. Happy Hour - this was a very nice treat that I didn’t expect. During my stay (Saturday-Tuesday) from 5-7 each evening there was a FREE Happy our in the Club Lounge in the 21st floor. A few wine options, a few beer options and light snacks. I had a few beers each night (prior to going out for dinner) and simply tipped the gentleman that served us. Other places I ate charged $7-$10 for beer so this was a crazy good deal. It was busy each night with little room to sit. There is a rooftop area with additional seats and nice views but the temperatures were a bit chilly during my visit to linger outside.You should consider upgrading to Club access if a free happy hour, free breakfast and drinks excite you. I think if you have two in your group that could easily add a significant value to the room at the Sheraton Tribeca.Checkout was noon and the desk was happy to store luggage if you wanted to explore and come back later to retrieve the luggage.","Linwood, North Carolina",13,5.0

Unfortunately these are the only positive things I can say about this establishment. Upon checking in, I was not greeted and had to ask to check in. The lady had some serious attitude despite my reservation being incorrect on Sheraton's behalf (I had called to make this reservation). Two rooms were booked when I specifically asked for one room to be booked. This same disturbed lady made it seem like it was my fault for this mistake and said they will have to late cancel this room for a fee, but since I have ""status"" they waived the fee. No apologies were made. Unacceptable. I ordered a bottle of champagne for the room and when it was delivered it was room temperature. I asked the delivery lady if I could have a chilled bottle and she said she would ""check"". She did end up delivering a chilled bottle, however I had a hard time paying the already included 20% gratuity when there was no attention to detail. The morning of checkout I had a knock at the door and it was someone ""just checking to see if our room was still occupied"" at 10:00 am. Checkout is 12. After already being irritated at my stay, I again asked the front desk to check out. The lady just looked at me waiting for me to speak. There was no greeting, she did not acknowledge my request, but just looked at me like I was bothering her. So I just rattled off all of my info because I didn't know what she needed. These all might seem like small complaints, however for this Hotel to be considered a Marriott property, is unacceptable. Being a lifetime Gold member I have definitely had enough stays to be able to compare.

From the moment we checked in it was apparent that this SPG hotel was substandard. Adjoining rooms were not available even though I booked these 2 rooms months in advance. Excuses were many and I was never given an option other than we had rooms ‘near’ each other. (I did ask for a suite that could accommodate 4 adults but was told they were all booked) My reservation confirmation clearly said extra towels and feather pillows. When we saw these requests were not provided, we called the front desk only to be told ""no you did not request that"" even though it is clearly on my reservation! Additional supplies were delivered but short 1 pillow and we were told the extra pillow would be up soon - never saw it in 7 days!! After that day we were never provided extra towels either. The elevator hallway at the lobby level is very dark and has illegal light level. We told the front desk and we were told that this is Marriott standard. It was under 10% and one of my guests is an architect who knows the regs! It was increased for a few days but lowered again later in the week. Elevators require a key to access floors and we noticed that many people had issues with their key cards allowing them floor access – we had the same issue intermittently over the 7 days. In one room (1907) we had various disappointments - one day no toilet paper another no Kleenex another no bath mat. We had a plastic drinking cup on the floor for 4 days - we left it there to see if the cleaners ever really looked. The hair on the bathroom floor (which was ours due to hair washing and drying) was never swept up. Beds were always poorly made with linens lumpy looking and bed skirts caught up in the sheets. Breakfast in the lobby on Saturday 9 Feb was cold because the Sterno pots were not lit. The waiter ,when told, quickly took off to find a way to light them and came to us to say they must have just gone out. I had already taken a picture and surprise there were no Sterno pots!This is a big health issue - needless to say we ate bread products and stayed away from the ""hot"" foods. The website says it has airport shuttle - well that is not true however the front desk will call a cab or limo service. I said I could do that myself. Our second room 1906 was extremely small and suffered similar issues. I am an SPG Platinum Premier Elite with Ambassador member. I obviously travel a lot. And have many SPG nights in the cities where their hotels align with my needs. I travel globally. I can say without reservation that this hotel (which is a franchise to Ascott Reit) is very poorly run and the staff under trained. Sheraton and now Marriott are allowing this franchise to diminish their brand. All a hotel can offer, after a bed to sleep in, is SERVICE. Not everything can be perfect all the time however staff can respond to issues in a way that underscores that quality and service are job ONE. This hotel is just OK - nothing special, just an older and dated facility with staff that are not engaged or excited about working there. The club floor food is very poor (try the Hyatt Grand Central for a good Club Level experience) The staff we met over 7 days did not even try to enhance our stay. My Ambassador did try to connect with me by phone 2 times but I choose not to call back because this was a problem too big to be fixed by one call from Corporate. So bottom line is I will not be back to this location and I will return to the Hyatt Grand Central as my NYC hotel. SOHO was great and a nice change from Midtown but like hotel rooms in NYC there are also many cabs in NYC. Next time I will pay for cabs to SOHO and stay in a hotel that will offer superior service to their valued members.","Kingston, Ontario",1,1.0

I did not book an advanced purchase rate so I was puzzled as to why my card had been authorized when I wasn't scheduled to arrive until the next day. I called the hotel and spoke to someone named ""Sal"" who reported that no matter what rate you book, it is the hotel's policy to authorize 1 night stay prior to arrival. This is mentioned no where on their website nor in my confirmation email. He was very rude and kept repeating that this is their policy when I informed him it was not okay as this was not mentioned to me at all nor on their site / confirnation. I later learned this was a lie. I asked to speak with a manager and he said he was the manger. I also later learned he had lied again. He was not helpful at all and told me to take up my issue with corporate. I called Marriott and the lady said this policy is incorrect and no where did she see this policy nor was it in my conformation. She escalated this to her manager as she wanted an investigation into this ""made up"" policy and apologized for the unacceptable charge / error. We didn't even know what the total amount unauthorized was for because there is no invoice or confirmation stating the random amount he charged my card. The next day upon check in, my card was charged AGAIN for the 1 night but this time the amount matched what was on my confirmation!!!! I was only paying for 1 night but because my card was charged twice, I spent over 900 for a mediocre hotel room. If my card had not been authorized without my consent the day before, I would not have had double charges on my credit card. They are completely unprofessionally and it's a scam. The quality of the hotel is equivalent to a 2 star hotel , not 4 star and for the headache of scamming your credit card, it's best to stay elsewhere.

Area out front is rough & trashy, though inside super elegant and nice. It’s a bigger hotel for the area though standard rooms are typical NYC & tiny with abt a foot between walls/bed/counter- no drawers. Staff is super nice. I had room preferences on my account t and booking request to not be near the elevators that apparently didn’t transfer as when I checked in I was a foot off the elevators. Went down and asked for that to be fixed and specifically requested “the quietest room you can give me” - - moved away from elevators promptly- yay! seemed great where they put me but in the morning there was a shrill screeching sound every 45 seconds from abt 5:45 am to 11 am when I left for the day. So maybe water-Pipe related?? Unbelievably loud! Room cleaning was weird as a cup of water with coffee ground was left out and 1/2 toiletries weren’t refilled.

We booked a twin room on the club level which comes with privileges (breakfast & happy hour). There were too many people booked in club rooms and the actual refreshment/breakfast room does not cater for the amount of people. We only had breakfast on the first 2 days then couldn’t be bothered waiting for a seat or for the food to be refilled preferring to eat out. If a basic room with no breakfast was available at a cheaper price it would have been more worth it. Happy hour in the afternoon was the biggest disappointment with a couple of bowls of corn chips some dips and carrot sticks. Having these privileges at other hotels I’ve stayed at, this was pretty embarrassing we only attended once.I would stay in the area again but probably not here.Room was a little outdated but quite spacious by NY Standards.The location was great.

We were there very early due to our flight and our rooms weren’t ready. We have 3 Rooms Total in our Traveling Group. One Presidential Suite, one Superior Room and one standard room. Due to my Platinum status, the 2 Rooms were upgrades to Club Level Rooms with Club Lounge Access. The Presidential Suite already comes with Lounge Access. The front desk was able to supply us with temporary key access to the Club Lounge to hang out before our rooms are ready.We have the Presidential Suite which was very basic in furnishings, would not call it Luxurious by any means. The master bed room have the smallest hanging closet in a hotel that I ever been to!The Club Lounge is located on the 21th floor, it have a open air rooftop balcony area with fabulous view of the NYC skyline.Happy Hours is 5:30pm - 7:30pm, Complimentary Snacks and Wine & Beer. Complimentary alcoholic beverages is becoming a rarity in the USA Hotel Club Lounges , Most of them will charge for the Alcoholic beverage. Unlike the Club Lounges in Asia will always have Complimentary Alcoholic Beverage and an extensive spread of delicious food.Overall. The Rooms are just average Sheraton products.The Staff are very nice, especially the Bellhop staff Jorge- he was extremely friendly , cheerful and helpful. ","Tampa, Florida",60,4.0

The front desk clerk lied 3 days in a row saying they were checking out. And every night they were still there rattling doors with their shouting. This hotel lacks very basic amenities such as understanding do not disturb signs, having a mail drop, being able to answer any questions about the area (Information about tours of the city? Their suggestion was to wander around the Port Authority Bus Station.). If you ask for no housekeeping, rest assured they will call you every day anyway and refuse to give you the star points.

The staff at front desk was quite helpful. Housekeeping did an OK job with the room, and I did leave a tip. Despite that, the little extra touches, such as realizing you have one tissue left in the box, went unnoticed. The shower was a challenge. Either too hot or too cool, hard to get the flow temp just right. I was not thrilled with the club level lounge for breakfast. It was crowded, not always a place to sit immediately, and the staff seemed a little overwhelmed keeping up with demand. The roof top terrace was super nice, except it was raining the whole time I was there, so didn't get to use it. Perhaps that is why the interior was so crowded.

The trip may have been a disaster but Sal and his team totally gave us a most enjoyable experience and took all the stress off.Our initial flight was delayed by storms so we arrived at the Sheraton a day late and somewhat grumpy. Upon checking in we found a most unfortunate situation in our room. Upon bringing this up at the from desk Sal was more than understanding and did everything to make it right, although he had no available rooms to move us to he did have one free for a few hours which he graciously allowed us to get cleaned up in , even though it meant more housekeeping for his facility, the next day he made sure to promptly move us , even offering to help move the bags. He left a personal message before leaving his shift to ensure we were happy and looked after. The cheerfully faces and genuine warm welcomes from all members of the staff as we came and went throughout the weekend made us completely forget our bungled journey from in getting there. We were even given complimentary drinks for our anniversary. The hotel has fantastic location, great rooftop patio but it's the staff that will bring us back!!!",,1,5.0

One large tip: ALWAYS spend the extra money to stay on the business floor. Why? Because you get access to the rooftop that not only has incredible panoramic views of NYC but also offers a quiet respite after a long day. There are unlimited snacks, water, coffees, teas and sodas available to you there throughout the day and night - and a breakfast spread in the morning. This is also with NO additional cost. The best part though is the rooftop happy hour that offers wine, beer and cheese for several hours as the sun sets. After spending $20 for a drink most places - especially in Tribeca or the neighboring Soho - you will be delighted to enjoy a few beverages with this particular view for “free” ... and nice wines at that. Deon - who has been there for nine years - is phenomenal during the Happy Hour. The rooms are pleasant but pretty standard. The staff is very kind and quite attentive in my experience. I have thoroughly enjoyed that I have always been given the same room each time I’ve stayed - I’m not sure if that’s coincidental but it feels very comfortable every time I arrive. Finally I highly recommend 5 Boroughs pizza across the street if you are looking for a cheap but delicious snack. This neighborhood offers endless possibilities. Enjoy!","Arlington, Virginia",3,5.0

Overall, I found it ok but below what I expect from a SPG/Marriott hotel at that price point, and apart from the lounge access I didn’t feel like my platinum status was recognized. The service was a sloppy, and employees were doing the bare minimum while making you feel like they were doing you a huge favor when they were just doing their job. For instance in 2 of the 3 checkin occurrences, there was no shower gel in the room when we entered the room. I also asked for them to bring and prepare the bedding on the couch for the one night that I had planned to sleep in my parents’ room, but I had to ask 3 different times for them to only bring the bedding to the room and not even prepare the bed. There were a couple more instances where service was lacking but let’s move on to other annoyances: elevators take forever in that hotel (it can take more than 5 minutes to get to the lobby or the lounge), and it just feels a bit old in general. The rooms are small but that’s ok, I’ve never had a huge room in a New York hotel. The breakfast is also disappointing, very few options and the ingredients don’t seem to be of the highest quality. On a more positive side, the location is very convenient to visit the city, and right by a metro station. The happy hour from 5:30 to 7:30 for platinum members is nice and the terrace is great when the weather is good enough. ","Ludlow, Vermont",3,2.0

Within 2 blocks is access to every major subway line with Greenwich Village and the Theater District just short rides away. Over the last decade or so, we’ve stayed around Manhattan, but no hotel has been able to compete with this location. Theater is the primary reason we visit, but we HATE Time Square and adjacent (convention) hotels are way too busy. Within blocks is world-class shopping and less touristy restaurants. Green Village and Washington Square Park are an easy walk up West Broadway which is right outside the front doors. This hotel is a great value with room prices that are very competitive for NYC. The staff is very friendly and accommodating including housekeeping which left us notes every day. This is not a convention hotel. The rooms are typical NYC rooms, which is to say smallish, but very clean and adequate. There is no concierge but the desk staff work hard to meet that role. On our recent visit, my husband was celebrating his birthday. He loves chocolate cake so I contacted the hotel in hopes of securing a small chocolate cake. They could not accommodate this request but they sent someone to a nearby bakery for a large slice of chocolate cake (at no cost to us) that was waiting for us in the room with a very nice note.

Last week was a high occupancy week in NYC between this and Pride events. My travel plans came together at the last minute, and I missed out on advanced booking discounts. This hotel was one of the few that had rooms in my date range under 400.00 a night. In a panic, I booked and was eligible for the AAA discount, so my room was 312.00 before taxes, discounted from 380.00. Checkin was a disaster. The CSR, let's call her ""Twinkle"" with the platinum wig, seemed angry from the start and rushed through my checkin. When I asked to verify the rate and the perks offered by the AAA booking that I made over the phone a couple days before, she rudely retorted that no such deal was in the system, and that my room was 379.00 before taxes, and there was no city view, no access to the lounge level with breakfast and cocktails. I showed her my confirmed reservation email, and she said there was absolutely nothing she could do, and that was just how it was going to be. I then asked for her manager, and she angrily stormed off and found her supervisor who took over the checkin process. Well Twinkle kept interjecting while the supervisor attempted to locate the reservation that showed my deal. I eventually complained about her attitude to her supervisor. Neither seemed pleased that I went there. Well miraculously, a room with the specifications promised to me appeared on the system...but I was made to feel this was a grand favor being granted to me, and something was mumbled about a failure of their system to have synced with the central reservation system, or some such excuse.This hotel is old and dated, but the room was immaculately clean. The breakfast and cocktail hour buffet in the 21st floor lounge was excellent, and redeemed my stay. I had dinner in the lobby restaurant the first night as it was very late. Terribly overpriced for a micro slice of frozen salmon with veggies. I paid 70.00 for that meal and one glass of red wine. Cafeteria quality for fine dining prices.I cut my four night stay in half, and moved to another hotel (Dream/ Chelsea/ See my review) which was incomparable at a rate of 389.00.

This is the case of the Sheraton Tribeca at Canal St. it’s small and simple and very basic. However, they have a great view up on the 21st floor lounge which serves 24 hour Coffee and Soft Drinks.

I had the pleasure of meeting the most curteous, inviting, charming host by the name of DEON from the club lounge on the 21st floor. I rarely find myself writing reviews. When one receives such superior service as I did I feel it’s only fair for all of New York and the world for that matter know about this hidden gem. Located on the rooftop with a panoramic view of Manhattan you can be sure to be in aw. Meeting Deon and having the luxury of being a guest in his club floor was my best club level floor experience yet! I must have been to over 50 different club lounges in my years and this one has exceeded my expectations. Bravo to Management for recognizing value in such a wonderful man like Deon. After all my years of travel to New York I have finally found my home when I’m here and it’s definitely thanks to the hospitality I received by this gentlemen.

The front desk staff could tell we were in a rush and got us checked in and on our way in record time all while being courteous and friendly. It was incredibly hot for our weekend stay and every time we came back to the hotel, the front desk had water bottles available for us. When we checked out, we asked for a cab to Newark Airport and they got us a private car in less than 5 minutes for a flat rate fee. It may have been a bit more expensive than a cab, but the driver got us to the airport in a half hour during rush hour.We booked a Superior King room and were put in a room right next to the elevator. I was concerned about noise but we only heard other guests one morning and it was after 8am. The Superior room was spacious with a comfortable seating area and room to move around, which is hard to find in Manhattan. The rate was below other hotels in the area that would have offered a room half the size.Location was great - easy to get to JFK and EWR, as well as being walking distance to the Village, Soho, Tribeca, and Little Italy. There is a subway stop around the corner, too, which made it easy to get to Williamsburg and Midtown.It's not as stylish as other hotels in Soho might have been, but between service, location, and price, this was an all around great stay.","San Francisco, California",8,4.0

Check in staff and bell man are nice. However, when it comes to the room assignment and members recognition, its a disaster. After checking in, I found the key card holder was for Gold member, so I wondered if there was any misunderstanding as I should be a platinum and should be entitled for an upgrade to best available room (I know, subject to availability). Hence I verified with Front Office. The lady who assisted me was just arrogant and unhelpful. She didnt even ask my surname and just said: There is no upgrade available. For me, its totally fine. However her attitude was so unwelcoming. She added: there is no membership on profile in 1 second. Oh come on, there were 2 registered guests! Obviously she just checked the profile of the one who was not a member. So I stated my surname and asked her to check again, she finally confirmed that I am a platinum. This is really awful. At night, I found my room is very noisy due to the mechanical sound of the lift nearby. I should have quiet room preference on file! I called to guest service and the lady just: There is not any other room available tonight within 1 second. The lady must be very familiar with their room situation. Alright, but, how come I can still find different room type available to reserve in official website? So now I am typing this review in the noisy sleepless room.This is all already addressed to the hotel and i am glad there is a front desk supervisor return email to say they would like to follow up. However, it is disappointing that i still not receive any reply from them. It has already been three weeks. How awful the service it is here!","New York City, New York",61,1.0

He always had a positive attitude and sometimes the room was overflowing with guests. He was always moving either cleaning, serving or preparing. My only concern is that since I've been coming here a few years, I have noticed the quality in some areas decreasing. Specifically, the food available in the club lounge. Breakfast used to include eggs, bacon, etc. but now it is strictly stale pastries and fresh coffee not even available at 7 when they open. In the evening they used to serve beer. Now it is just wine. I was given a coupon to try the breakfast buffet. They also open at 7. I was there at 7:15 one morning and the eggs were already extremely dry and sausages burnt.

We explored around Soho some nights and found some great restaurants and also walked down to China Town one night. - During our stay, we experienced a mix of services from the staff.

At 8 pm I call and ask about the fridge and am told they don't have one and may or may not have one tomorrow. I asked to at least get a bigger ice bucket and was told I can only have the one in my room. So now my hard pumped milk is slowly spoiling as it doesnt fit in the tiny bucket any more.

Our room was small but extremely clean and very quiet. There was a coffee pot, iron and safe in the room. Not one complaint about this place. The elevators were always available and the bar had a great atmosphere and it was the perfect spot to start the evening.

It's off-season (January) and the price was great! The location is right on Canal St on the west side, near the Holland Tunnel so there is a lot of traffic and outside noise. The interior is clean, comfortable, and bigger than a lot of other comparable downtown hotels. Close to subways, restaurants, shopping, and other points of interest.I thought they had an on-site garage but I was told to pull up outside for the valet. However, the cars were stacked 3 deep and double parked into the middle and right driving lanes so it was impossible to pull over! I circled the block a few times, then gave up and found a nearby garage. The woman (Alexis) at the front desk was super nice. She had great positive energy, gave us two comped drinks, and a buffet ticket for breakfast. We had a room on the 10th floor with a view north, of midtown and the Empire State Building. Lovely! We requested a room away from the elevators and they were able to accommodate us. The room was a good size for a downtown NYC hotel room! We even had a chair to relax, a desk area, and an armoire. The bathroom was nice as well, with a shower, no tub. Be aware that you are staying on Canal St, and you can hear traffic/honking/sirens/people all night. But it's not a big deal if you travel with ear plugs/white noise apps.It looks like there is access to a Planet Fitness next door as well! Sadly, I did not have time to go, but it is available.

However, my SPG status was not recognized nor was I offered an upgrade (the hotel was not full). The rooms are standard NYC rooms, small but comfortable. The hotel is clean as would be expected at a Sheraton. Before heading out for then evening, we wanted to enjoy some cocktails at the hotel bar. Enjoyment was not possible. The bartender was rude, barely seemed to care we were there and seemed annoyed every time we ordered a drink. The tab was extremely expensive ($25 for a double vodka and soda), which I can understand due the location, but I would expect the service to match price. The next morning comes around and I was woken by slamming doors and chatter, which went on for hours. Again, as expected in NYC, noise does occur; this was excessive. It turns out the problem is twofold, 1. My neighbors were coming and going all morning, and 2. The room attendant staff is loud and my room was positioned next to service elevator and entrance.While cleaning rooms, the attendants come in and out of a room, allowing the door to slam each time and not propping the door open. I called down to the front desk requesting to move. The agent on the line was rude, did not apologize, offered no compassion or compensation, telling me I was already on the quiet side of the hotel. When I requested to move anyways, the agent sounded exasperated and put me hold. I was given a new room, however I would have to go to the front desk to get the keys. My new room was similar to the previous, as expected, except it includes old towels with holes and frays. Also unfortunate was that the noise and slamming doors of the room attendants was not better. Overall, the hotel is fine. But the service, lack of attention to detail and treatment of customers is borderline terrible. I get the impression that management does not care or is not present.About the reviewer:36 year old single male, well-travelled American.

Some cool shopping spots are about 10-15 min away on foot and other places we wanted to see like the Brooklyn Bridge were about 20 minutes. The property was decent -- quiet, clean and not overwhelming. Staff was attentive, friendly, courteous and knowledgeable about the area. A few spots nearby to get food, beverages, quick meals, etc... Fitness space was small (3 treadmills which were full) but pretty standard for a property of this size.Elevators were a bit slow and not every staircase allowed you to exit on the first floor so it took a few minutes regardless.

I would describe the Sheraton Tribeca as a mid-range hotel, with average-size rooms and amenities. It is perfect if you are looking for an economical place to stay, that is modern, clean, and has friendly staff.Check-in: At the front desk Kaylene (I'm pretty sure that was her name!) greeted us and helped us get checked-in. Although we were early, and our room wasn't ready yet, Kaylene made sure we had access to the Club Lounge so that we could go ahead and have breakfast. Fantastic! We checked our bags with the bellman, ate, and went out for several hours to explore the neighborhood. We returned later to pick up our luggage and headed up to our room on the 19th floor with a fantastic view. Club Lounge: On our first night we also made it back in time for the nightly Hors d'ouevres in the club lounge. Now, I realize that Hors d'oeuvres is a fancy french word, but you shouldn't really expect fancy, French (or otherwise fancy) food; again, this is a mid-range, economical hotel. What you will find are a good selection of cheeses, crackers, chips, dips, fruit and, most importantly, wine! Perfect for us, and we actually had ""dinner"" at the club lounge several evenings during our stay. And I want to add that Deon, who staffs the club lounge in the evening, provided excellent service. He's very friendly and helpful, and can get you what you need if something isn't available that should be.The lounge space is actually very small, and does get crowded. But it is attached to a fantastic rooftop area that is pretty cool to visit (weather permitting). The lounge is open 24/7, and always has water, pop, and milk stocked. Snacks may or may not be available depending on what time of day it is.Room: Our room seemed normal-sized to me. We had a decent view (not sure which direction) and the beds were comfortable and clean. We did discover two issues with the room once we were a few days into our stay. First, the tub drain was very slow, which meant that water backed up during a shower. It got to the point that we would turn it off to let the water drain out before continuing with our shower. Second, the dehumidifier fan in the bathroom was not working. So the room often ended up being super-humid and hot after several people showered. And the shower curtain was not completely drying and had a smell to it as a result. We had to keep the air conditioning blowing to solve the problem. So, you might want to check your shower/bathroom fan before settling in. We'd been there for a few days already so we just tried to make it work.Neighborhood. It's Tribeca folks. Not Times Square. Not Central Park West. Not kiddieland. If you need something to do the best tip is to research the neighborhood before you go and plan out your activities accordingly. To me, it really wasn't a ""walk outside your hotel and find all these amazing things to do"" kind of area. And if you end up walking the few blocks down the street towards Chinatown, yes, you will absolutely run into some sketchy characters (and maybe get a contact high). But, that could happen anywhere in NYC, or probably your 'hood too. If you're into artsy stuff, there's lots of independent artist spaces, pop-up shops, boutique clothing/furniture spaces a few blocks over. If you want to do serious shopping, there's a great mall at One World Trade Center that is partly underground and partly above ground where the designer stores are located. There are two playgrounds that are fairly close but we only had time to visit the one at Pier 21. My kids had a great time there and even jumped into a pick-up basketball game. There were sit-down restaurants but we didn't go to any. We did visit the Black Burger (a tiny burger joint), which was just aiight, and Billy's Bakery for some cupcakes and brownies, which were good.Staff: I've already mentioned Kaylene and Deon. There were a few bellmen and another front desk person who were great as well. Was everyone perfect? No. Was the cleaning lady a little cranky? Yes. But I cut her some slack because I had to bother her for like 17,000 towels after one of my kids got sick and I understand that she probably wasn't expecting to use all the towels on her cart in my one room. :) Overall, people were friendly and happy to help us get the things we needed.Whew! In sum, have realistic expectations for the price you're paying and the neighborhood you're staying in, and you will enjoy this hotel. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.","New York City, New York",3,4.0

What a Gem for New York. I can’t say enough about the staff. They were top notch and above everyone else in the area. We checked in at around three in the afternoon and was greeted by a polite young man. Sorry I forgot his name. When we got to our room, it was definitely a wow factor. The view that we had was so spectacular that my two kids were all smiles. Never mind the wife. She was just taking it all in and loving every minute of it. We were on the 22nd floor at The Presidential Suite so we got to use The Club Lounge on the 21st floor. The drinks and snack in the club lounge was decent. The free appetizers at night was a nice touch. Now to the area that we were in. It was the best hotel for what we needed to do. SHOPPING!!!!! SoHo is just around the corner from this beautiful hotel. So my new word that my two boys taught me is HypeBeast. What is it you might ask? Well it means whatever kids or pop culture wears for there style. You follow suit to what there wearing too. So there are plenty of stores around there for that type of clothing. But it comes with the price tag. $$$$$$$$$$$$$ the stores that are around there is BBC, Palace, Stadium Goods, Off White, Nike Lab, Supreme and KITH. And we went to all of them and spent a lot of $$$$$$$$$$ doing so! We will be back to this hotel in the early future. Thanks for a very memorable time in New York!!!!! P.S.

We didn't realize under a day or two in that if we walked in the other direction, we would be in a much nicer neighborhood - live and learn.I will say that we upgraded to the club level and that was a tremendous waste of money. We went up for appetizers every night and there was basically just crumbs. Same with breakfast - a could of sad bagels and bruised fruit. They didn't even have waters laying out for us to take - we had to ask for them and then they were the tiny, child sized bottled water. It certainly was the most poorly stocked club level I've ever stayed on.The room was nice sized and the bed was super comfy.

We stayed on the club level and had access to the club lounge which offered sodas, snacks, coffee and tea 24 hours a day. From 7 am until 10 am they offered continental breakfast, and from 5:30 pm until 7:30 pm they offered hors d'oeuvres and wine, all of which were very tasty!

We chose the Sheraton based on location, price and reviews. The hotel is easy to get to from Newark using either uber or the subway system. We took uber from airport and regretted it...Traffic is horrible and the drivers are scary. The subway and train was easy on the way back to Newark and took about 35min. There are 2 subway entrances on the back side of the hotel. It was nice so you don't have to wheel luggage to far.We walked to Chinatown, Little Italy and the 911 memorial. We took the subway up to central park and times square bc it would have been to far of a walk both ways.Hotel staff is amazing! Super helpful with directions etc. The 21st floor is a great view and the breakfast and coffee in am was nice. There are several coffee/bfast places within a block of hotel as well.We had a king bed on 10th floor and was happy. The room was a nice size and super clean. Bed was comfortable and the noise was tolerable at night. Mostly the honking and traffic was during day which didn't matter to us. There is a bar/restaurant in the lobby.

Every positive review previously written was right on point. The staff provided excellent service the bed was comfortable and location was perfect. This is definitely out of the hustle and bustle of Manhattan yet the Subway is easily accessible and a quick ride to Time Square or the water front. We were checked in by Janilse who was professional and knowledgeable. The front desk staff for the duration of our stay were friendly and ready to assist. We did not introduce ourselves to each one personally but that didn't matter since it felt like weve known them forever. In the evening Sal always had a pleasant smile and answered any questions and assisted with any room concerns or food options. This hotel is conveniently located in the Tribeca area and our room was well appointed (BEST BED EVER the Sheraton bed was AMAZING) and faced Canal street. I highly recommend upgrading to the Club Lounge where you have beautiful views, sunrises and sunsets and another FANTASTIC STAFF member of the Sheraton DEON performed his duties exceptionally. In the evening he serves delicious snacks and various wines plus sodas and water. The Club Lounge also serves a continental breakfast and is available 24 hours a day with snacks, sodas water fruit etc. and did I mention the VIEW ...Fabulous! We head out on October 23rd for a cruise and Carlos our bellman helped us to arrange transportation to Bayonne NJ. (This was a welcome service since 5 years ago we left our hotel via taxi to Bayonne and the taxi driver got lost. Big Bucks for that trip.) We chose this location since its close to the Holland Tunnel and it is closer to Bayonne. If you want a great room and exceptional service book the Sheraton Tribeca.","La Mesa, California",41,5.0

The lounge has complimentary breakfast in the morning with bagels, pastries, hot oatmeal, juice, coffee, tea.

And the sky view was amazing in the morning and night. Everyone was very professional and friendly. The location is perfect to walk to Chinatown, Little Italy, Tribeca and Soho.

When we got upstairs to room 1809, we discovered it was directly across from the elevator (which is counter to what my SPG profile says) and it was hot and stuffy in the room. We called guest services who advised us to turn down the temperature and place the unit on auto fan. We did this, but it was still warm when we left 30 minutes later.We arrived back at he hotel around 11:15 pm to discover our room was still hot and stuffy. We requested a room change. We were given room 1706, which was also warm, and significantly smaller than our previous room. However, by 11:30 pm, we just wanted to go to bed. By the time I turned in after midnight, the room had cooled a bit, but the air was blowing directly on my neck in the bed. I was bone tired so I sucked it up, pulled the covers up to my chin, and went to bed. Unfortunately, my neck was still when I woke up thanks to the Ir blowing on me.Our stay wasn't great. In fact, I won't stay at this property again due to the two room issues we had. ","Lancaster, Pennsylvania",40,2.0

I've called for a Wake Up Call and had the phone ring for an extended period of time without being answered.The restaurant is old-school Italian at night, with nice food on the high-priced side. The breakfast buffet is uninspired and not worth the price.

We arrived around 10:30pm to 11:00 pm.We were tired from driving for over three hours to get there. Our plan was to crab a quick bit, go to bed and have an early start the next day. I have a habit of checking the sheets before I jump in. I found hair and stain on the sheet (see pictures). This is suppose to be clean sheets. Look at how crinkled they were. Looks like someone rolled in it for at least a few days. It was disgusting!!!! They didn't even try to hide it. It was just there... very obvious. Personally, I think there should be a law against hotels renting out dirty rooms !!! Someone needs to pay. Right now there is no recourse. We paid for the club floor (higher floor), the manager said he would move us to the second floor without refunding the difference. At this point, we did not feel comfortable anymore. What if they move us to another dirty room? We decided to book a different hotel - we ended up at NoMo SoHo. It was more expensive but more out scene and a much better location. We were refunded but what we went through was a major inconvenience especially for that time of night. This hotel needs to overhaul their housekeeping team. People need to be fired on the spot for pulling a stunt like this. I feel they are giving the guests a big middle finger. BTW... The phone was dusty too. As for my fellow travelers, be vigilant!!!

I found the hotel was clean and tidy on entry. Jamie on check in was the first person to greet us and she was really lovely and had us smiling even though we where tired from our travels. She managed to check us in really quickly without any problems. I spoke with Sal a little after check in regarding a delivery I was expecting and he did a great job helping me with that and the subsequent follow up that was required, after the delivery firm made an error. It would have been nice if that had made it to the room however it was all a little thrown out by the delivery error. The RoomThe room was a good size for NYC and the view was amazing from the room. The only issue was the toilet flush tended to be a little intermittent, and on a few occasions I had to fix this myself, I'm sure had I raised the issue it would have been sorted. However for me it's quicker to get stuck in and sort it out. Victor was looking after our room each day and he did a great Job I can't thank him enough. He always took the time to say hi to us and crack a joke as we passed him, a really nice guy and he was always working really hard whenever we saw him. Club LoungeThe club lounge was tired and didn't have a toilet on the same floor we found this a little odd. You had to go back to your room if you needed the loo. The outside club veranda had the best views you could want in NYC easily on a par with the Empire state and Rocker fella, however it was in need of a tidy up and a few $ spending on it as it was tired and dated, I expected more from a big NYC hotel in this area. The evening snacks where very basic. Little things like bringing cushions in when it looked like rain was going to come down, background music and modern lighting would have been good. Possibly a wind-out canopy and power wash the floor. All small relatively low cost things that really would make a difference.The club staff did a great job at breakfast and of an evening. Deon and Alexia (I think her name was) really went out their way to keep the lounge tidy and well stocked in the evening even when really busy. Both really lovely people and put a lot of effort in to checking in with us to make sure we had everything and give us advice on the city. On a few occasions people seemed to be using the club lounge to hold personal gatherings for friends or associates that where not staying in the hotel, that was a bit off putting as we paid for that privilege, and the bar should have been used for that type of gathering especially when busy. LocationOverall a great hotel and location sitting on the edge of China town and Little Italy. This offers fantastic transport links and access to subway lines within a block or two. E line subway takes you uptown to time square within 15 mins and down town to the trade centre within a few stops. Loads of places to eat and drink around the hotel all within a walking distance. We stayed just off Time Square last time and would never do it again after staying in the Sheraton Tribeca 100% better quality and the staff actually acted like they care. RecommendationTry dining, we stopped in one evening and decided to eat down stairs. The restaurant was quiet and the service was really good from both the guys. The food was spot on, the rib eye steak was cooked to perfection and even me being a fussy eater enjoyed it. It was quite big as well. The Lamb dish was also very good. And the cost was the same as local bars only issue the meals could have come with a few more sides. 100% recommended.Bad PointsThe lack of beer in the bar on arrival. We got told a few different things and only two beers ended up on draught by the end of our week. The club lounge had no beer at all after our fifth day of being told no beer we got given a few beer vouchers. This meant going down to the bar and carrying the beer back up to the 21st floor. I was really disappointed with this and the solution provided by the hotel on the whole. Although the staff did their very best it was just not acceptable for a full week, I ended up drinking wine however it was not that nice. I'm sure management must have been aware of the issue and see no reason a few crates could not have picked up from the store. This was the most disappointing thing for me during our stay.","Preston, United Kingdom",41,4.0

After a long travel and work day, I checked in at the Sheraton Tribeca around 6pm. I arrived in my room and was immediately taken back by the smell which was equivalent to my high school locker room after football practice on a hot summer day. I proceeded to put my stuff down and lay down on the bed where I got a quick 5-minute nap as sirens woke me up. As I turned over and pulled some of the sheets off I noticed a women’s hair pin in the bed and immediately threw it on the ground. As I was up at this point and disgusted by the conditions I proceeded to use the bathroom where I immediately noticed that the shower was dirty and there were rodent feces all around baseboards (picture attached). As I really had enough and didn’t feel comfortable in the room I called the front desk and had the following interaction with Christina: Q: Hi I’ve noticed that my room is not clean and I’m wondering if you could move me to a different room?A: We are all booked tonight. You can wait until tomorrow and then we can transfer you. Q: No that is ok. Would it be possible to have housekeeping come up and clean up some of these problem areas? A: No housekeeping has left for the day. You can wait until tomorrow to have it cleaned up. Q: I feel extremely uncomfortable in this room, could you please transfer me to another SPG hotel?A: No, we don’t transfer people. Q: I’m sorry, are you sure that you cannot transfer me to another hotel? I don’t feel comfortable and I’m not much to work with here. A: You can go ahead and book your own hotel if you do not want to stay here. We do not transfer people. At this point, I was in complete disbelief at the lack of customer service skills displayed by management and staff at the Sheraton Tribeca. I proceeded to call SPG Corporate where after explaining my situation they offered hotels with astronomically high prices even for New York City. SPG Corporate offered little choice and I had to stay in a hotel that was not in my desired area.

Our stay Friday night was very nice. Our room was small (as all NYC hotel rooms tend to be), but the bed was super comfy and the bathroom was a decent size. We checked our bags at the front desk Saturday morning and set off to run errands/explore the city. We decided on a whim to stay Saturday night, as well, but didn't have a reservation. The manager at the Sheraton Tribeca was able to match a special price that they were running on a discount website, which we were super appreciative of!

If my son was an older teen this might have been a reasonable option but in a strange city on one of New York's busiest and most chaotic streets, he did not feel happy about sleeping alone. Consequently we had to have those heavy adjoining fire doors constantly propped open by a chair and we never felt properly relaxed and of course we couldn't unpack. These rooms were not great, being right outside the lift. The next day we did some early sightseeing so that we could come back in the early afternoon to claim our new room. However, when we came back we were told that we were welcome to keep the extra room at no extra charge as there would not be a twin room available that day either. I really couldn't believe their casual attitude about all of this and how they didn't seem to appreciate how inconvenienced we felt about it. At my insistence I got complimentary access to their 'club' area which was a lounge on the top floor which was a very pleasant and stylish lounge with a 24/7 supply of drinks and snacks and spectacular views of New York from the terrace. However, only the next day did I finally get a twin room and what a sorry sight it was. It actually had a badly cracked basin in the bathroom, and when leaning over the sink to brush my teeth I had a close-up view of just how filthy the overflow hole was. One of the towels also had black staining on it - like mascara although it had been laundered so it really should have been de-commissioned. The desk chair had a revolting stain on it - nothing that upholstery cleaner wouldn't shift - but it just seemed typical of the lack of care or attention to detail. The beds were very comfortable so no complaints there. However, I was surprised and disappointed in a four star hotel that there was not even a little fridge anywhere to keep our drinks and fresh milk. There would have been space for this if a couple of shelves were taken out of their poor quality and unattractive brown furniture. So I wouldn't recommend this place - the staff did not treat us well and there are better hotels out there for the price.","Oxford, United Kingdom",41,2.0

Now, the hotel itself--if the staff hadn't been very nice and the beds hadn't been very comfortable, I would have given it only 1 star! The rooms are very small and very cheaply appointed--for example, the headboard I think was supposed to look like leather but it was a very bad fake and was plastic as was the wall paper. The bathrooms are also too small with no space to put your toiletries. The closet was tiny and looked like the closets they have in a college dorm! One more thing--we usually had to wait at least 5 minutes for the lift as there were 3 lifts but 1 was out of order, which apparently is the case all the time.

I was not offered a new mold-free room.Dont waste your money on the breakfast. The breakfast is small and expensive. They do have scrambled eggs (though rubbery) and awesome bacon, and great waffle-machine, but if you want a bagel for breakfast (or something healthy) they are dry (didn't feel fresh, though they probably were) and sweet and with nothing but peanutbutter, jam and philadelphia (cream cheese) to put on it (no cheese, ham, salami etc.).. This could of course be a normal US/NYC breakfast, but as a European I would recomend you go out of the hotel for breakfast where you can find something more healthy.To conclude: okey hotel, perhaps I'll stay here again, but if you ever stayed at a Sheraton hotel before - don't expect the same experience.

I really wish that I could remember their names but I am much better with faces then name tags! They all have made a definite impression on us though! Will the Front Desk Manager is a wonderful asset to not only this hotel but to the Sheraton Corporation! The Conceiarge Level is wonderful! They really put out a nice spread for appetites of all kinds. The view from the top patio is phenomenal! We look foreword to spending much time up there this summer with our family!! The rooms are nice! You can never go wrong with a think Sheraton bed. The rooms are nicely updated and have many extra touches to make use of all of the space in a New York size room :) Which exist at any hotel you go to in any big city! What I feel is an added bonus is that there is a fine dining restaurant located inside the hotel. There is also a wonderful deli (24 hour) located right next door. There is a Pizza Parlor on the corner about a half a block away. At this property you are walking distance to the underground subway, Canal St & Little Italy. You really can’t go wrong with this property. I hope that you felt my review to be helpful to you. We really look foreword to coming back in the very near future!","Chicago, Illinois",0,5.0

Stayed in NYC numerous times and in my view this area of SOHO, Tribeca, West Village is by far the most pleasant for visitors who are staying a few days. The hotel is clean, professionally run and friendly from the moment you arrive until the time you depart. It is certainly a hotel you are pleased you chose - specific mention to Sai and his bellboy colleague who provided an exceptional level of profesisonal service and a smile at all times of the day.The room is not spacious but where is in NY. It is modern, clean and has a superb shower (and hairdryer according to my wife!). Only minor issue was the limited storage space. When I return to NY for business or leisure, this is the venue I will opt for without hesitation.","London, United Kingdom",15,5.0

My Platinum status gave me more benefits at this hotel. The hotel was also very thoughtful about which type of room I might prefer. The Club Lounge was small but it has a fabulous and spacious patio on the 21st floor.My room was large (uncommon in NYC) and I used the fitness center every morning. I am in NYC frequently for work and had been trending on staying in a different hotel each time. After this stay it is highly likely that I will try to book here for all future stays in NYC because I had a very special room that I will not divulge here since there aren't many of them. I also could have walked to/from all of my meetings in Lower Manhattan had it not been raining.The hotel is super close to the 1, A, C, E, and the 6 subway lines all along Canal so it is very easy to transfer underground from Penn Station. The location also is easy to get to via the Brooklyn or Manhattan Bridges if coming into LGA or JFK airports via Queens/Brooklyn.I spend on average half of every year in hotels for work and I very highly recommend this hotel.

My office is just a couple of blocks north of the hotel so the location is perfect for me. It's also just a few minutes from the Canal stations for the blue, yellow, and green lines. The rooms are pretty standard for NYC - nothing to write home about but certainly comfortable enough for a week long stay. The staff are friendly and remember you throughout your trip. I am a Starwood member so I usually opt for the high floors on the club levels. This is great as it includes afternoon happy hour in the clubroom as well as free breakfasts. The bfasts are above average for hotels in my opinion - just enough to get you through to lunch. The only downside of this hotel is its right on Canal St so definitely opt for a room facing away from canal.

It was all great until we tried to place an order for room service breakfast the next morning. We followed the directions on the card that was given to us and hung it on our door for them to take. We requested a delivery between 10:15-10:30am. Woke up the next morning and no breakfast. Checked the door and the card was taken, so they must have received the order. We called to inquire about what happened and to cancel the breakfast since we had made plans that we needed to get to. Spoke to a gentleman who said he would get back to me about what happened and we never heard back from him. So that was very disappointing. While we were getting ready to leave for the day, housekeeping came by our room. We simply told them we were leaving shortly and to come back in a half hour and they said no problem. On our way out, we even spoke with the front desk and told them housekeeping stopped by and we want to be sure our room gets cleaned and she said she would notify them now. So, we came back well after five hours to our room not cleaned. We went down to the front desk and the man told us they were ""backed up and he'll check on it for us"" he also thought we had our DND sign on the door, but we never used it. Nothing ever happened, there was no follow through, so we gave up and had to request a whole set of things for the room (towels, soaps, shampoo, toilet paper, coffee, etc) and the woman rushed me off the phone so quickly and forgot half of the items we requested. Everything about this trip and hotel would have been wonderful had those few things not happened.

For example: I walked back into the hotel after a meeting on a hot summer day and was met by the front office lady calling my name to give me two bottles of complimentary water. Now, thats recognition, and service. I bought some things that I needed to package for shipping and within minutes I had scissors, boxes and tape in my room. Impressive.

Easy access to hotel from NYC subway system (A-C-E lines around the corner on the same block). Comfortable room - fresh soft goods. Excellent sweet sleeper bed and pillows. A little bit of road noise (Canal Street is a busy thoroughfare) and hallway noise, but nothing that a pair of earplugs couldn't block out. Will add this to our future NYC hotel options.","Falls Church, Virginia",30,5.0

And given the price point I don't have unreasonable expectations. Yes the hotel is outdated and can get crowded at times but that comes with the territory. But during my stay the room was absolutely filthy and some of the towels were torn and stained. I don't expect a large or fancy room (this is not the W) but don't expect it to be dirty. In addition the wifi did not work and never rectified. Ended up having to use international roaming to send work emails that could not wait. Housekeeping did not provide turndown service one day after I called to make sure it would be done in the morning. When I called the manager with these issues he said he would email me with a detailed reply and offer points as compensation. Neither happened. I also had an important package being delivered to me which the hotel said they never received. then later said the person did not give them my last name so they couldn't locate me.

We did not use their valet parking - it would have cost us $150 to valet our SUV for 48 hours. We parked it on our own close by & it was $125 for 48 hours. When we arrived 90 minutes before check in time we were told our room was clean but it hadn't been released by housekeeping. No problem - we checked our bags and went out & explored. The room was small as most NYC hotel rooms are. It was clean. The previous occupant left a suit hanging in the wardrobe. We gave the suit to the maid in the hallway and she didn't seem to know what to do with it. The first problem encountered was the shower stall. In order to reach the shower knobs, you have to get into the shower & the first cold blast of water lands right on you. Then you have to back up & stand against the back wall while it warms up so only your feet are exposed to the cold water until warm water comes out. The next problem were the bed pillows - they were all super soft and feathery & didn't support your head or neck at all. My husband went without a pillow - I took the throw pillow off the chair and wrapped in it a towel & used that. Throughout the night we discovered these rooms have zero sound proofing. We were by the elevator & heard every person (most of them loud since it was after midnight) who was coming back for the night. Some decided they needed to use the ice maker after midnight which was also across from our room & very loud. The next day we went out from 8:30-10:00am & 11:00am-2:30pm. Housekeeping did not clean our room during this time. I took two clean towels off the cart in the hallway so we could shower for the wedding. We took a nap to make up for the bad night's sleep the night before & then got ready. As we were leaving at 5:30pm we went to the front desk and told them that our room was not cleaned by housekeeping today and we would like it to be serviced now. The man at the front desk did not seem to care so it wasn't a surprise when we got back at midnight & it was still dirty. My husband called down for clean towels for the morning & they did bring them up right away. At 5am I was awoken by 3 people who decided to sit on the floor near the ice maker and have a conversation at full volume. Finally after 20 minutes - I opened the door and asked them to please take their conversation elsewhere. I was more than happy to leave this hotel on Sunday morning. I've been to other Starwood properties in Manhattan that were great so we will not be going back to this one. On Monday morning I got an updated folio for our stay. They added a $4 water charge to the bill. The Evian water was $4 and we did not touch it. The Dasani was complimentary & we did drink that.

The hotel is in very good condition and is very well maintained. Despite being a high traffic property it is still not showing wear and tear in my experience. I use this hotel for both business and personal stays in NY. There are multiple subways that are very close so it's easy to get anywhere. The location is awesome if you like a more neighborhood feel, lots of shopping and dining nearby. I much prefer being down here to midtown which feels very generic and touristy compared to SoHo/Tribeca.My experience with the staff has always been terrific, particularly the front desk. In particular Sal is awesome and remembers me by name. You have to care quite a bit to pull that off, especially when it might be a couple months since I've been in and this is a busy hotel. Also, Katie on the Guest Relations team has been very proactive and helpful in reaching out to get feedback and help with any questions and requests. Again, she obviously cares quite a bit. I feel bad I don't remember all the names of the other great folks, it's not because they don't offer great service as well.SPG recognition is the best I've experienced in NYC as well. I've been to just about every property in midtown (all brands) and this hotel is consistently the best with upgrades and amenities.Finally, I usually find this hotel to be very reasonably priced compared to the other SPG properties in town. Some tips:1. The club lounge is awesome. Good service, food selection, extra snacks during the day and one of the best views in the whole city and an amazing roof deck. If there weather is nice you don't even need to go out, hang out and have drinks on the roof deck.2. Peppolino for Italian right around the corner is terrific. 3. Nancy Whiskey is a great dive bar with good burgers right around the corner4. The gym is decent but there is also a Planet Fitness connected5. Canal St is very busy, sometimes it's easier to have your Uber/Lyft/Car meet you across the street or around the corner6. Like many NYC hotels, the rooms can be small. If you are with others, spring for the larger rooms, the difference is worth itThis will continue to be my go to spot in NYC when the price is right!","chicago, il",35,5.0

At the Sheraton Tribeca, the problems were not small, forcing us to scramble the day after we arrived to secure alternate accommodations. What was wrong? Her is a BRIEF list of a few selected issues that made our continued stay impossible:Except for the bed, the comfort of the accommodations, as a whole, was unacceptable -- 1. The deadbolt did not work on the door to our room when we arrived, and to the room to which we were moved on Day 2; 2. The gym was immediately below our $300+/day room, and the treadmill noise -- thumpa, thumpa, thumpa, thumpa -- woke me at 7:00 am and continued non-stop for an hour before I finally gave up after only 3 1/2 hours of sleep); 3. NO SHELF/DRAWER SPACE IN THE ENTIRE ROOM, SO WE WERE FORCED TO LIVE OUT OF OUR SUITCASES FOR 2 DAYS BEFORE WE MOVED OUT; 4. terrible night staff attitude and service (day staff much better and accommodating); 5. view of pipes and brick wall outside both of the rooms to which we were assigned, AND THESE WERE SUPPOSEDLY THE BEST ROOMS IN THE ENTIRE HOTEL!!!; 6.

The Sheraton TriBeCa is on Canal, nestled in between takeaway shops and closed shops. The subway connections are good and it's a short walk to Soho and Downtown but on an evening there are questionable characters lurking outside and the atmosphere can be uncomfortable. I didn't have a great arrival or start to my stay here, problems with the room rate I booked, a dirty room and argumentative manager. Eventually all was resolved, I was given a different room, given the correct room rate and promised points for my troubles; the female manager didn't get why I was frustrated and didn't come back to me to follow up. The problem with this property is that it's dated, never particularly feels fully clean and the club lounge and lobby bar are always incredibly crowded; it makes relaxing anywhere but your room difficult. There is a Starbucks concession in the lobby which is an added bonus. The rooms here do need updating and the furnishings do need replacing. The rate here is not cheap compared to other hotels in the area and hence the value for money is questionable. The TV's are terrible but the wifi is good. The service, in general, was good. Reception team were friendly and the bell boy and concierge was also welcoming and helpful. The night manager was good; he tried to resolve the issues I'd faced on arrival. Room service was always good and quick.I think more attention needs to be paid to housekeeping here and with ensuring SPG benefits are delivered consistently. This could be a great hotel instead of a good hotel if standards were improved. I am still waiting a response from the hotel as to why my rate changed before my arrival and why I was downgraded.

Eventually a man does pick up and I say, 'where have you been?'. 'Right here', he replies. So I tell him about the calls, and he claims no-one rang through. BUT I RANG THROUGH! So frustrating.

You usually have to choose between location and cost, and getting both is pretty rare. NYC has a good number of hip boutique hotels that spawl across Tribeca and Soho, but these usually come upwards of £300 per night. If you are like me, it's great to stay in cool and hip hotel, but a great location and price that isn't going cripple me is more important.The Sheraton Tribeca is located on Canal Street, a busy road linking the Holland Tunnel and Manhattan bridge and splits the Tribeca and Lower Manhattan neighbourhoods. At first glance you feel like the hotel is sandwiched between two busy lanes of traffic, which it is, however you are also positioned within 15 minutes walk from some of the nicest places to eat and drink in Manhattan. A Metro stop is around the corner so you can reach the heights of Central Park and Times Square easily, however if you want to sightsee around either of these locations then I wouldn't stay here and instead opt for somewhere further north.Walking out of the door of the hotel to the north is the delights of Soho and Greenwich, with the Meat Packing district about 30 minutes walk. Bleekers Street, famous for eateries and live music is 15 minutes away. 15 minutes to the east is Little Italy and Chinatown, and 15 minutes to the south is the WTC.Inside the hotel the rooms are of average size, a little dated, but clean and comfy enough. The sound proofing isn't great as the doors don't really keep the noise out, however the beds are very comfortable which makes sleeping after a long day of walking the streets nice and easy. All in all if you are looking for a good location then The Sheraton Tribeca ticks the boxes especially if you are a foodie and live music junky. Don't expect boutique decor and long velvet curtains or you will be disappointed.Transfers to JFK are 1.15hr and Newark approx 1hr.",,3,3.0

The hotel is a good location if you want to be down here. The gym is OK as long as there are only 2 or 3 people in it. The free breakfast is probably OK if you get there the minute they open, otherwise it is really picked over and sort of gross by 10:00 am. The housekeeping is what really made me drop it to 3 stars. I stayed 5 nights and I had to finally ask for them to vacuum my room and clean my desk and my sink. Plus the housekeepers bang the doors of whatever room they are cleaning 10 or 15 times. I do not understand why they can't stick a towel in the door but instead they let it slam shut each time they go out to their cart. It woke us up early every morning and then in the late afternoon when I would try to rest before going out to dinner, bang bang bang all over again. So, housekeeping is not good,not very clean, but the rest of the people at the hotel are really nice. If I had to work down here again, I would maybe have to stay here just for the location.","Kona, Hawaii",75,3.0

No room is large in NYC and you're not spending time in your room, so it was ok with us. - Location if you're looking for the Midtown sites (Times Square, Central Park, etc.).

She said that there is nothing else they can do unless the cleaner found it and give it to them. So I said the cleaner stole it then? She says most likely it was.

The walls were scuffed, the carpet old and there were no luggage racks. I did not complain that night and decided it was one night and to just deal with it.

After showering with poor drainage in the tub and standing in ankle deep water, I called guest services. I asked for a manager to please come to my room as I did not feel the room was Club Level room quality and hopefully not even what I thought Sheraton standards were for a regular room. I stated I would like a manager to see the room and I wanted to point out the issues. I really felt management would take one look at the rust and ironing board and be appalled.

When the guests arrived, they were very badly welcomed and it was impossible to find their name in the system. One of the guest had to wait 2 hours before getting his room until the receptionist could finally find a solution - and you have to understand that the person has just travelled 12 hours all the way from Europe. This is not acceptable. This is probably due to a miscommunication between booking.com and Sheraton TriBeCa but there is no way that the guest has to be treated like that. But it's not the only problem we faced. Upon clients departure, the hotel has not provided the receipts of the guests stay (everything has been prepaid but no proof of payment has been sent to me) AND on the top of that, an extra amount has been withdrawn from our company's credit card without any justification. When we received the credit card invoice, I have tried during basically A MONTH to reach them to obtain documentations. After 3 weeks, we finally received the receipts of the stays. It was last August; and until now we still haven't received the documentation related to the abusive withdrawal and no refund. Although its location is good, this hotel is average for a 4* hotel.

However, contrary to the previous review, to me the selling point (redeeming quality) of the hotel is the roof terrace. The views are pretty good, particularly on a clear night looking at the lights of the empire state building.The location is pretty good, if you like the SoHo/ Tribeca area. (This was our first time in the area and we really liked it, as it is a bit bohemian / grungey.) The rooms are small and tired, even by NY standards. Personally, I would have expected more of a Club room. (It is literally impossible to swing a cat by its tail. Lord knows what the non-club rooms must have looked like.)Housekeeping was pretty bad.

Room was big for nyc having king bed, pull out sofa bed and a small round table with chairs. Check in was a bit slow with front desk staff being awfully perky.  We called housekeeping to make up the sofa bed and basically he came in pulled it out and said there u go in a condescending manner...if that's all I wanted gosh I think we could have managed that...I then had to explain that my daughter has extremely bad allergies and I wanted the bed made with new laundered sheets. He tried to convince me the sheets are changed automatically after every stay though he could not guarantee that it was done.. I highly doubt this is standard practice as the sheets looked dingy and stale. After explaining the reason a few more times, he reluctantly went out and got new sheets and grudgingly made the bed though he would not get us new pillows or blanket. Having club access was definitely a plus in our stay. The breakfast was basic (eggs, sausage, some fruit, juices, baked goods, coffee, tea etc). The outdoor terrace was a great place to hang out and enjoy views of the city.

Location is good, near several subway lines. Room sizes are on the small side, but that’s only to be expected in NYC, and facilities (in-room coffee maker etc) are well thought out. The top floor Club Lounge has fantastic views over lower Manhattan and the two rivers.Nevertheless, without doubt this was the worst Starwood stay (indeed, probably the worst stay anywhere) that I have experienced in over thirty years of travelling.The organisation and delivery of housekeeping services is this hotel’s greatest problem.On two of the four days we were there, housekeeping passed us by and phone calls to Guest Services (on both occasions!) resulted in accusations of the Do Not Disturb sign being left on the door- it wasn’t: there was a strong sense that Guest Services pushed back and blamed the guest for any issue that was brought to their attention. Servicing eventually happened, though we never managed to get any Shower Gel left in the room, or Non-Decaf coffee bags for the coffee maker, either. Add to this a bathtub that needed an engineer in order to drain, and air conditioning only part-functioning throughout the first night and you’ll get a sense of some of our frustrations. The magnetic-stripe room keys are clearly past their best; both of ours needed recoding on practically a daily basis - and yes, of course we weren't keeping them near phones or clasps.The greatest single error, though, resulted from only half of our laundry order being returned. Eventually the hotel accepted responsibility for this, but only after blatantly accusing one of us of telling lies. When “Perhaps you’re mistaken and you never gave it in” was rebutted with the promise one of us had taken a photo of the order form, duly dated that morning, the - very rude and abrupt - Guest Services handler stressed “We have checked the cameras and can see the floorman delivering all your laundry to your room, so you must be wrong and it’s in there!” Those were her exact words. Only after the point was made that, if she could indeed see two pairs of clean gents’ trousers going IN the room, she would certainly see them going OUT as well, did she backtrack and say- actually- she couldn’t tell what the laundry was after all.Staff on the front desk, meanwhile, were always understanding and accommodating, doing their best to solve all issues. We left without half our clothing but with a complimentary car to the airport and promises that our missing garments will be sent on to us as soon as they turn up. Time will tell… we’ll keep you informed of any developments, though we’re not holding our breath.So, if you’re looking for a well located hotel; you’re not too bothered about other services; and you value the Club Lounge view and can afford it or are certain to be given it then certainly consider the Sheraton TriBeCa. If not we suggest you can find much better elsewhere. ","London, United Kingdom",1,2.0

A bunch of great restaurants (really good Italian one around the corner), and quick access to the train (got me to my BK Dumbo office in 16 min).I was seriously speechless at the quality of customer service before, during, and after. And this, coming from someone who has literally traveled the world (Asia and all over Europe, Caribbean, French Polynesia, etc), and stayed at multiple five-star resorts... I'll tell you this: the customer service here was as good (in some case better) than some of the 5-star resorts at which I have stayed. This is my new fave in NYC, so much so that I almost didn't want to share this new secret! ;)","Los Angeles, California",10,5.0

It was pre-booked through corporate for a conference and prior to flying in I tried to get it switched to no avail. My gut was right. Upon checking in the first room we went into still had candy/cookie wrappers and crumbs left in it on the nightstand from the prior guests. We moved a room down the hall that was ""clean"" and the sink stopper wouldn't open. So at about 3pm we called down and requested an engineer to fix it. Went to the gym and came back at about 7pm to find it untouched. Called down again to let them know no one came and got ready and went out to dinner. Came home at about 11pm to find it was still not fixed. Called again and they said they would send someone in the morning. Mind you this whole time we weren't able to wash our hands or brush teeth etc. in our room because the sink wouldn't drain at all!! Luckily we were able to shower and use our gyms bathrooms that evening... Finally the next morning at 7am we call the *FOURTH* time to get someone to fix the sink. They said ""they would *try* to find the engineer"". What does that mean??! Engineer rolls in at 745am and doesn't have it fixed by 8:10am. Asked him to step out so I could shower before my meeting and he said he would be back at 830am. He uses our room towels to semi dry the floor leaving brown water and gunk everywhere. 9:15am and still not back so we left for the morning. Literally have to call a fifth time on day two for them to get it fixed and cleaned. On top of all this obvious stuff, the room was dated and dark. Small as can be expected in NYC, but also filthy. (See photos of a human toenail clipping under a night stand and random unidentifiable objects and dust under and around the bed/night stand. No excuse under the sun for this. Will never return.

I'm a small Asian girl so you can imagine the space really isn't big at all.The property itself needs work, it definitely feels dated and old. One main gripe I had about the hotel was the lifts which had a system that would end up making guests wait way too long just for the lift to arrive.We had club access and went just once. breakfast was very very very basic (you have to make your own waffles) and the club lounge looks like a staff canteen.This hotel is okay for a very short trip and if you're out and about many hours in the day.

If you are a one night stay businessman then fine, if you're a holidaymaker, go elsewhere.The receptionists are very nice and polite. As are other staff we encountered.The room was very small even though we booked a ""delux"" (HA!!!) king. The room was terrible. The carpet was brown and covered in dark stains. The bedding was old, had holes in and the pillows were disgusting. Even the curtain was stained!! We'd slept really well in our hotel off Times Square and this was a real come down, we didn't sleep properly at all and it spoiled the end of our holiday.The bathroom was ridiculously small, and was smaller than just the shower we'd had in the hotel off times square. No space whatsoever. It was dirty and old fashioned. The sink plug didn't work. There was no bath plug. The towels were old, ripped, all different and stained.The desk chair seat wasn't attached to the chair. The tv was a joke, we had no signal on about 50% of the channels so couldn't watch anything. Our room overlooked Canal Street, which seemed to be the busiest street in NYC, 24/7. There was a traffic jam the first day we arrived and cars honked none stop until gone 3am. It doesn't matter how high up the hotel you are, you'll hear it.Housekeeping were a joke. They took towels away but didn't replace them. Didn't bother coming in some days. Never replaced anything we'd used in the room, just made the bed. I had to ask at reception for some new towels and some toilet paper!!!!When other guests on our floor had room service, they left their dirty plates outside their rooms. And there they stayed for 24hours. Even after I mentioned it to reception, they didn't get moved. The day after it was more plates, glasses and pizza boxes.

I will list the problems below.1) I asked a travel agency to book my hotel, as I am used to do. When I got here, the receptionist told me that I would not be able to get my points in SPG( Fidelity card) because I have not booked thru the SPG website. It is a surprise to me- and not a good one- because I am paying in the same way and the other times the same travel agency booked the hotel to me and I have received my points as usual. 2) I will have to leave one night before. It means I have planned to leave on Sunday, but I will have to leave tomorrow ( Saturday). Expedia, who booked the hotel, said Sheraton will charge the Saturday night fee anyway. It is an absurd, because I haven't canceled my reservation! I just need to leave one day before. 3) concierge: I was trying to get info about plays/ theaters in the city. I could not find anyone at the Concierge. I left a note and asked to leave the information in my room. Didn't have a feedback. Then, I finally met someone there and asked to check the cheapest price to watch Aladdin. She called me a couple of hours later and said it was 299 dollars. I decided then to go to the theater after work to check it. I got a ticket for 80 dollars and it was in intermediary place, because the cheapest price was 50 dollars!! I think it is really complicated since it is a touristic city and the hotel should offer a better service and support to the client. Again: I am really disappointed!4) yesterday I arrived from work after a long day and there were no hot water in the shower!!! How can a 4 stars hotel have this kind of problem and don't offer any feedback to the client? I called at the reception and the girl told me it was a problem and they didn't have idea at what time they would fix it!! I am sorry, but I am sick ( strong cold!) and needed to have a cold shower in a hotel 4 stars? You have to agree with me that it is terrible! And the girl said I would be compensate for this problem.

It was a bit hard to find at first using our Google directions as we went passed the hotel (scaffolding in the front). Just went around a few blocks and pulled up in front while we checked in. Used valet parking and the guys were great. Even better? The front desk especially Sal. I am used to NYC being filled with rude, brisk people and everyone at the Sheraton was the complete opposite. We are platinum and we were thanked for our business and loyalty to Starwood. Booked two rooms and received club access. There was a slight snafu with one of the rooms not having two beds so Sal gave us a certificate good for two drinks at the bar (""where the hard stuff is that the Club Lounge doesn't serve""). Rooms were small but that is very typical of New York. Since we were there only one night, it was fine. I did notice that my husband's and my bathroom door was different than the one my son and his friend occupied. I did hear a some noise all night long from Canal Street though we were on a high floor so I put the ear plugs in. The club lounge patio was large and offered a lot of seating and great views. Of course, during the peak happy hour time, one woman was stretched out on a sofa using it as her personal tanning bed. Most people had a drink and then left. Did I mention that the food as well as beer, wine and soft drinks, bottled water etc. were complimentary.Location was great to get to an event in Times Square via the subway. We also walked easily down to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. We also had great pizza by the slice just outside the Sheraton to the left on the corner across the street. Cheap and quick. The club lounge host recommended. Also, immediately to the left out the front door is a little grocery/market/convenience store that sells beer, some wine and sandwiches etc. Cheaper prices than the convenient stores closer to the subway.Honestly, this was such a great stay, I wish we could have been there longer than one night.

The two other Sheratons we had stayed at were tired and distinctly average; this one was a different proposition. Who would have thought a New York hotel would have friendlier service than ones on the South or the mid-West? Well, this one did. The major advantage for us, being Platinum members and therefore having access, was the SPG lounge n the 21st floor. The roof terrace was brilliant, with clear views of the Empire State Building and the Hudson River. The young lady who ran the lounge was very good, very professional, and dealt well with some fairly difficult customers - this included people lighting cigarettes on the terrace. Perhaps the hotel should put up some ""No Smoking: signs to avoid guests eating food being choked by smoke.Overall I would recommend this place.

Let's start with the good. The location is excellent. Tribeca is a nice neighborhood and you are essentially on the border of wonderful Soho and very near the West Village. So location wise, this place is really great. It's a given that NYC hotels are really expensive especially with respect to value. My room was the cheapest I could book on their site and it was roomy enough for one person. Might have been a little tight with two people but would have been manageable. Just not a lot of space around the bed for walking around the room. My shower was very modern and nice and the bathroom was just fine. I also felt the front desk women I dealt with were very sweet and accommodating. I did not check out the gym as I was going to get a lot of fitness in during my trip via walking the streets of the city.The first floor offers things like a mini cafe, an Italian restaurant, and a full bar. I also seemed to notice a business center for internet, etc. Okay, so that's all well and good. Let's talk about the things I did not like First off, what is up with bathroom door having a rather large split down the middle of it when closed? Who thought this was a good idea. Essentially, if you really wanted to, you could look into an occupied bathroom if someone was in it and had the door closed. Really weird and gross. I've attached a photo in my review so you can see what I mean. Also, the flushing mechanism on the toilet is annoying and confusing. One, it's not a handle. You need to reach directly behind you and push a button. Second, the button is essentially two buttons in one that can be pressed individually or both at the same time. I can assume what is supposed to be pushed for when but again, how about a simple handle on the side of the toilet? Perhaps the idea here is that they won't break off as easily? Regardless I find it puzzling and it's in a bad location on the toilet. (I've attached a photo to show you what I mean.)The immediate interior is also no good at this hotel. As soon as you walk in you see a huge pillar that essentially takes up prime real estate at the check in desk. There simply isn't too much space in the immediate front area of this hotel because of this damn pillar. I imagine this hotel is a mess during long lines for checkout in the morning, etc. You should consider the Hilton Garden Inn. Roughly the same price as this hotel and very close by. I would probably stay there next time just to compare. Hilton Garden Inn has a nicer restaurant in the hotel which you can tell just from the photos online. Overall, yes, I recommend this hotel. Great location, friendly staff, solid price. But I wouldn't call it anything more than solid. P.S. The pillows were way too soft and not comfy. Would have appreciated something firmer.","Los Angeles, California",2,3.0

While the room was pretty basic, the concierge lounge for Starwood guests had a wonderful view and pretty decent food & drink. We got a very cheerful and enthusiastic reception all staff we encountered were the opposite of the NYC stereotype. The bar and restaurants, while we didn't try them, looked very nice.

To our dismay, when return our Bloomingdales bag with my mom's dress and shoes for my brother's wedding was MISSING! Gone. Vanished from our room! We went to speak to the manager, Colin, immediately. He reviewed the video and entry to our room. He confirmed that over the day housekeeping had been in 3 times. THREE. Using 2 different keys. Two of these times were while we were at dinner. He reviewed the surveillance video and only saw them leaving with bags of towels and sheets... as if they couldn't have hid it inside. He bought himself time by saying he would chat with the maid the following day (at this point it was 1:30AM and we have a flight to catch the next day). We waited around all morning for him to confront the mail... hadn't heard anything... we eventually touched base with Colin when he said he would **maybe** file an insurance claim if we had the receipts. We gathered our information and went back to chat. At that time, he came off as insulting and patronizing. Basically said ""sorry you can't prove it"" and dismissed our claim. He said he would file a claim with the insurance- but we got the feeling nothing was going to come from this. He completely knew we had to catch a flight back to Canada and took complete advantage that we were powerless and didn't have time to file a police report. End of the day, we have no confirmation of any insurance claim being filed by Colin, a half apology and hours wasted trying to convince this man of our story.

I would recommend asking about the upgrade option as the room we had was on the 19th floor with good views over the river and Canal Street and also high enough to not be bothered by street/traffic noise. The evening snacks included various dips, cold cuts, cheeses and biscuits but, best of all, wine & beer!!! Breakfast was a selection of breads (mainly different types of bagels), cereals, sausages, scrambled eggs, juices, tea/coffee. Soft drinks and tea/coffee are available 24hrs (for club level).The room was a good size and clean with decent facilities. Club level includes free WiFi access which was pretty good too.Hotel location is great - Chinatown & Little Italy are nearby, a 15 minute walk to Greenwich Avenue for some more bars & restaurants. A 10-15 minute walk to WTC. Canal Street subway is a couple of minutes' walk away to go uptown for shopping.

One of the best city views on their patio outside. You can enjoy your food or drinks outside. In the morning they have cereal, oatmeal, eggs, sausage, waffles, bagels, fruit, yogurt and toast.

Asked for the room to be changed which was done almost immediately. Now what were the chances of me find a bathroom with tiny strands of hair in a corner of the loo again? Slim I guess, but I saw them close to the door of the shower area. Ignored it as we were after a long journey. Before going out later that evening (5pm), we realised that the locker in the cupboard was not working. Told the person at the reception, said we'll send someone but nothing had been done when we got back past 10pm.The sleep quality that night was extremely poor, which went through all three nights. It was a big king size bed, but it really sagged. As my partner is heavier than me, I was basically sleeping at an incline! This really ruined my stay at the hotel as one wants to feel rested to explore a new city.As we were really tired the first night, we put the do no disturb sign outside our room - didn't want room service knocking at 10am. However, we did end up leaving our room by 11:30 am for the day when we removed the sign. The house keeping was visible across the corridor as they are in any hotel at the time. We also reminded the reception about our locker still not working.We come back around 8:30pm after a long day to realise that our room has still not been done and neither has the locker / safe been fixed. Go to reception and tell them and after we told them what time we left and removed the sign this guy says (and this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard and the man saying it jolly well knew he's talking trash!) ""the problem is you removed the sign too late, but which time house keeping has already done a round to check which rooms need cleaning and which don't. If you need cleaning your room, the sign should be removed between 8am and 9am in the morning"". That's ridiculous because it negates the purpose of a sign, if you really have to put an alarm to put that sign back on!! He followed to say the staff leaves by six so no one can do anything now, but agreed to send someone for fresh towels and to make the bed. Absolutely unpleasant experience. The next day we reminded them again about the locker / safe which was finally done by the time we went back that evening.Overall that interaction with the staff was not nice, the room cleanliness levels were average, not something to expect from a Sheraton and worst of all was the sinking bed which really left me begging for a good night's sleep.Would not recommend.",,5,3.0

Rooms are a bit small - but that's the norm in NYC. That's not what makes you want to stay here.I travel here for work frequently. Despite being a decidedly tourist hotel, I stay at this Sheraton for many little things, and for two major reasons. One - the hotel gym is one that 'locals belong to' - meaning, it's no afterthought, converted hotel room. There are several treadmills, bikes, cross trainers, in addition to a full weight room and one set aside for 'floor work' (stretching etc) that's a bit out of the way. Two - Muhammed in the Concierge Lounge on weekdays consistently has a cheerful smile. Not just for me - I've just 'celebrated' my 51st stay - but for everyone I see him interact with.

Highlights:*I couldn't have asked for a better experience with the staff. Sal checked me in and was able to accommodate my requests. I told him how disappointed I was with my last hotel where I spent 5 nights with family, and he immediately went to work seeing what he could do to make my experience here better. The other staff members were also extremely pleasant to deal with. There was always a friendly, warm smile and helpful attitude whenever I walked up to the front desk.*The location is conveniently located to at least 3 major subway lines. Minor downside is my comfort walking in the neighborhood alone at night, so I made it a point to return by taxi in the evenings.*The rooftop has a great view. With lounge access, you get 24/7 snacks and drinks, and the happy hour is substantial. HH had not only wine and beer, but a nice spread of appetizers. I didn't get the bartender's name, but he did a great job and kept the place running smoothly.*My room on the 18th floor was quiet -- especially appreciated after my previous noisy hotel. It was very clean but small. I had a corner room with a queen bed, and it would have been tight with two people, with not much room for storage. It would have been fine for a couple of nights for two. It was perfect for just me. I also appreciated having an a/c that worked. The room overall was very comfortable.*I didn't spend much time in Chinatown, but walked over to the LES Tenement Museum and Russ & Daughters Cafe.

There was enough space for an armchair, and the room actually felt spacious for one person, maybe even two for a short stay. The bathroom was especially large for NYC, with lots of counter space and little bits of storage. I wish the lighting were brighter in the bathroom, but it's a minor complaint. My room came with club lounge access, so I had breakfast in the lounge, which was a hot mess. It was way overcrowded on a Sunday morning at 10AM. There were 2 staff members who did all they could to manage the overflow of people, and I appreciated that. The crowd Sunday morning was a weird mix of tourists and frequent SPG guests - I wished for a little bit more peace and quiet. The breakfast itself was decent. There were scrambled eggs and sausages for hot items (though in tiny containers that were quickly emptied). The best items were the pastries. I didn't think I would like the croissants and apple tartlets, but I ended up having two of each!I still have an issue with the front desk. I had to wait both for checking in and out.

If you are driving in, book online a parking space in one of the close by garages. You will save a lot.As far as the hotel goes, our room was tiny! We often stay in N.Y.C. and know that rooms are small. This room did not have space to open one carry on bag! After rolling a bag on the side walk, the last thing we needed was to open it on the bed or the chair. We were on the 3rd floor, facing Canal street- the noise was awful! Sirens and cars during the day, trucks and sirens throughout the night. We were told the hotel was fully booked for the weekend, so no change. The lever on the toilet was broken, and the outlet on the bathroom wall was loose. Poor night sleep as the mattress was sagging. We were unable to change the room on the following day. When we returned at 10:00 PM, the room was not cleaned. The bed was unmade, the bathroom had the dirty towels on the floor. The girl at the front desk apologized profusely, and changed our room (yes, all of a sudden there was a clean room) and offered a free breakfast- does not make up for the inconvenience as far as we were concerned.. BTW, the second room was slightly bigger, facing a quieter street, and mattress was not sagging. This was the worst Sheraton we ever stayed in. Next time, we'll go back to the Sheraton in Brooklyn.",Maryland,34,2.0

Such as is the case here, where I arrived at 6:45 AM and they accommodated me with a room (after I had emailed them of course). They got me on an upper floor so it was relatively quiet so I could get a nap in. The room size is enough for one person (knowing how small rooms in NYC are) so that's good. However, the reason I didn't go to four stars is a couple things: the sink was leaking a bit, and the housekeeping was not complete -- dirty glasses left behind and not replaced, only replaced one towel vs. three that I started with for some reason. Just seemed like a rushed job. Next, room service -- while the food tasted good, the delivery was a little messy: left out a water bottle I ordered and didn't take it off the bill, and when calling, the person taking the call didn't understand simple requests and required someone else to get on the phone to complete the order.","Seattle, Washington",29,3.0

From my early check in on Friday to an easy check out on Sunday, every staff member I met was exceptionally friendly, warm, welcoming and most of all pro active and efficient. The warmth was surprising for a big chain like this.I met Tina and Nicholas upon arrival and they were both generous with the smiles and did everything possible to ensure our stay would be a comfortable, enjoyable one. Though our room was not ready that early, they assured us it would be a high floor, room with a view when we came back a little later. The concierge guys were helpful and very nice as well. Rhonda completed our check in later with her infectious, bright energy. The club lounge access was a huge plus and the view looking north towards the Empire State Building is lovely. Would probably be a great deck to enjoy in warmer weather. It did get a little crowded quickly around breakfast and cocktail hours. But did not detract from the experience or view.Our room while small, was towards the back of the building and was quiet and clean with a supercomfy bed. Wifi worked a treat. The hotel's close proximity to a huge number of terrific cafes, restaurants in Tribeca and Soho is a plus. And Chinatown dim sum is also a short walk away. Subway access everywhere else was easy. Would stay again - the staff are easily some of the hotel's best assets.",new york,18,4.0

When I checked out on 25th Feb morning, I very clearly gave 2 comments to the front desk.1. I spotted cobweb directly above my work desk, next to the TV - Very visible from anywhere in the room. Wonder what sort of cleaning do they do ????2. My bed linen was ""TORN"" and since I had opted for their ""green..."" plan, I ended up using the same linen for week's stayThe person on the front desk was very apologetic. He said that he will take care of these and he said they will respond to me within 24 hrs about the corrective actions they take..Well, Its almost a week since I checked out.. I haven't received any message from Sheraton explaining anything.. (Not that I care much about their ""corrective action"" email) But cobwebs and torn linens are not expected from a chain like Sheraton. In case anyone doesn't believe me....let me know.

Well, in researching hotels for a long weekend trip, I came across a good price deal for the Sheraton Tribeca - around $110 a night which is very good for New York. I had never seen the hotel and was concerned that it might be one of those small-roomed deals with a view of the neighboring air shaft. But imagine my surprise – and pleasure - when I found that the Sheraton sported a bright, nicely done lobby, a fairly large room (certainly by NYC standards) that was spotless, beautifully decorated, had all the amenities you could want and (while this might not be the same for all their rooms) a large window with an expansive view of Canal Street. We were on our usual gallery/museum jaunt and the location of the Sheraton with two subway lines within three blocks and two more within four blocks, served us very well. Then too, I had not visited the 9-11 Memorial which is about 10 or 11 blocks to the south (we walked it) and took this opportunity to do so. Restaurants around the hotel are plentiful and varied from small, hole-in-the-wall places to some of New York's finest dining experiences. Could not ask for better. The Sheraton’s staff were absolutely first rate, if a bit overly-enthusiastic. I don’t need to be greeted every time I cross the lobby but that’s what the staff did. They were efficient, very helpful and knowledgeable about Tribeca and seemed genuinely pleased to help us. In all the times I've visited NYC over the years, I don't think I've come across a friendlier crew. I cannot recommend the Sheraton Tribeca more highly. Every aspect of the hotel was near perfect. (Slow elevator was the only minor irritant but this seems to be standard for every NYC hotel.) If you get an opportunity give them a try. You won’t regret it.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",124,5.0

It was a fantastic stay - everything was seamless and check-in was a breeze. Great rate, too! The check-in lady was very nice and knowledgeable and gave us a two bed room even though I'd booked a king in error. The Wifi was free. Beds very comfy. Air conditioning worked great. Tip: Go up to the 22nd floor and look out the north windows for a great view of the Empire State Building and uptown. Make sure to do it both during the day and at night.We did eat at Antica, the Italian restaurant in the hotel. After a long week we were too tired to go out, and this was a fine choice. Arrived at the restaurant and it was completely empty, but open... and we had to wait a few minutes for anyone to show up and come give us a table (which inevitably ended up being ""sit anywhere""). Great service, and we didn't want for anything. The gratuity was automatically applied for anyone staying in the hotel, which was unusual but fine, it was what we would've tipped anyway. Highly recommend this hotel!I would not recommend using their car service to get to LGA - it was more than a taxi (by around $10) and the Escalade we got was VERY foul smelling, and the driver kept taking phone calls during the ride. He also quoted us $50 when we got in the car but two minutes from LGA he told us it was $55. He also had me sign the tip screen (he used the Square app on his phone), and it was all in Spanish so I was unsure what I was signing or tipping.

I called down to the front desk and they said they were very sorry and would take this very seriously and send someone up with a machine to check the door lock. I called them back the next day to see what they found out and they told us that it showed we were the last ones there and we had left it open. I told them that was impossible because the mini fridge was in our room and we didn't get back until that night. She said they would have someone look at footage and get back to us. So the next day I called again and they told me they had footage of someone coming out of our room and leaving the door open. Which really freaked me out because I knew it wasn't us! I asked to see the video and they said someone would be there the next day and they could show us. So our whole trip from Sunday to when we checked out on Wednesday I had to deal with the situation and then them telling me it was our fault. Finally Wednesday I talked to someone who said again that we left our door open and that they would try to find the footage for us to see. When we went down to check out and look at the footage the woman came up and said ok the person leaving the room was blurry and it might of been one of our maintenance workers. Still not taking responsibility for it! She said we are very sorry what can we do? We got one night comped but it wasn't even worth it. My whole trip I was arguing with these people.

Right above subway station and close to restaurants and Soho shopping. Staff are overall very friendly, seem genuinely welcoming.Negatives - The rooms on each floor are mostly spread across one side of a hallway with elevator banks and utility rooms on the other side. Unless you have a room at either end of the hallway, you have noisy elevators, dinging and doors opening and closing all day and night. Service is spotty. Rooms are not assigned as promised, things don't work - TV, heater, window, etc. I was promised an upgrade on my next trip after a variety of service failures and returned a week later to have one of the smallest rooms in the hotel. Keys don't work, the bar service is spotty and often you can't get a bartender to serve a drink. I made a car service reservation through the bellman for a trip to Newark Airport in the morning and the car was not there.

It's right slap between supercool Soho, Tribeca and not far from the Village, but in itself is not a supercool designer led hotel - more on that later. It is also quite frankly if you want to use the subway, one of the best located hotels in all of Manhattan since virtually all lines to the East or West sides converge within a few blocks of one another on Canal St. Navigation between them is fast on Canal St compared to the midtown sidewalk scrum.Within 50 odd metres of the door you can take the A subway straight to Howard Beach for the JFK Airtrain or vice-versa. Takes about an hour airport to hotel. If you're travelling alone this is far cheaper than a cab of course.Some have mentioned the immediate area as being depressing and feeling somewhat unsafe. Sorry, don't get this. There are probably about 5-10 trinket/T-Shirt shops to the East of the hotel on Canal St that are pretty downmarket, and sure you can have a few guys hanging round outside. This is New York, not Beverly Hills. 100m to the West on Canal you have a Maserati dealer. Yep, real downmarket.....Canal St itself is of course a very busy thoroughfare, and so the property fronting it is not the ritziest or nicest looking. Step left or right and you are immediately in a different world - Soho or Tribeca quiet and atmospheric streets, with amazing independent restaurants and Cafe's, and all the types of shops with character you could possibly need. This area is great for just wandering and seeing what you find for dinner, lunch or gifts etc. Battery Park is probably 30mins by foot, Washington Square 20mins, Broadway Shops 10mins, and Midtown is 20min by Subway. If staying on Times Square is not your main concern, this is a great area.Now to the hotel itself. It's surrounded by the type of characterful districts I love in New York, but itself is somewhat more middle-of-the-road. Sure there are local landmark pictures adorning the walls and the decor is certainly not ""bad"" - but if you're looking for Boutique hotel ambiance, style or character this isn't your place. It's not quirky, but if that's not what you're looking for that's just fine. Sometimes a writing desk or bathroom not comprising a glass bubble in the middle of the room is what you want. The facilities tick the boxes but probably no more: The gym is fine for a 20 minute workout but no more, the bar and restaurant are clean and presentable, but not exactly characterful. The club Lounge has a great view and we were lucky with the weather - being on the terrace to admire the view was fine. But the Club Lounge itself is overwhelmed with numbers especially in the morning, and this means the cleanliness and standards slip. If the facilities can't cope with the numbers, don't offer it to so many - simple. Having said that the breakfast selection was fine and better than expected, and the evening drinks/snacks were useful for those wanting to stay in (certainly saves the pennies)I had a Suite, so other than the Presidential room these were the biggest and nicest in the place. No problems - clean, well presented, a touch dated in some parts but perfectly nice and well appointed with settee, chairs/table etc. Great for a longer stay. Other rooms are obviously smaller but I can't comment on them.The staff were, without question super friendly. I checked in several hours later than the rest of my family, and I was immediately welcomed by name - ""welcome, you must be XXXX"" - nice touch. This standard continued with us being welcomed back each time, and the front desk staff also helping with some gift wrapping needs which goes above and beyond expectations. Front of House is an asset to this hotel, and probably adds another notch to the grade for many people.So, a balanced review I think. If you go understanding what the hotel style is and where it is, you'll be just fine - I was for my needs this time on a family vacation, and I've stayed all over New York.

Pro/First impression: the staff was EXTREMELY friendly & super cool. I still think this, but it is unfortunate that we don't think as highly of the facilities themselves.They also left a welcome bottle of wine in our room since it was our anniversary. Again, super friendly folks. The area itself is both a pro & con. The actual street and aesthetic of where the hotel is is super depressing. It's very very run down. However, it is a convenient area in that it is only a block or two from the NICE & visually pleasing areas of Soho & Tribeca. But the cons...- Aesthetic: the rooms are tiny (ok whatever) but they do not look nice. Sounds like some may be remodeled? but I assumed ours was not as it was an all yellow & brown room. Looked extremely out dated, bare, and stale.- View: the view from our 14th floor room was very depressing and bleak. It overlooked super dilapidated buildings and graffiti. - Shower: the shower smelled like sour mold (dirty washcloth smell) from the moment we arrived. I honestly always wanted the door shut bc of that smell. I couldn't find out what was causing it bc it didn't LOOK dirty, but there was just that dirty washcloth smell, must be mold somewhere. Even every time it would be cleaned by services, it would still have that smell. Not awful - but not pleasant.- The flush button on the toilet was visibly broken & partially missing.- The room trash cans were two blue commercial recycling bins. Both the same. Looked like a work office - not very 4-star chic if you know what I mean. I love that they had recycling but the fact that both the bins (next to each other) were the same, you had to decide yourself which to use as recycling and which to use as a waste bin - I doubt that the people picking up the trash know to make this assessment. Worry that it's all just grouped together as trash in the end.- No amenities, no mini fridge.- Towels were the very rough, thin, cheap kind. - TV was fuzzy.- Elevators always took forever with often lines to wait for them (not really their fault though). Towards the end, one of the elevators was broken, though.The cleaning lady who serviced our room was very sweet & nice, once left a cute happy new year note on our desk - again, staff was wonderful, facilities not so much. We were really baffled why this was considered a 4 star - most 3 star we stay in are significantly ""nicer"" than this was.","Austin, Texas",0,3.0

Unfortunately, very rude fellow working as the attendant in the SPG Club Lounge. A real lout, actually. Didn't see anyone on duty in the fairly full and lively lounge when I entered with my companion at about 8:45pm, so reached into one of the mini-coolers at the back for a bottle of tonic water. This was apparently a no-no. A thin African-American man wearing glasses, probably in his late twenties came up behind us shouting, ""What do you think you're doing!"" and saying that things close at 8:30 and if we wanted anything we had to come through him so he could get it, etc., etc. So loud, obnoxious and rude, we didn't even realize that he was an employee at first. Then he brusquely asked, ""What do you want?"" I replied calmly that I was trying to get a tonic water. His next question was, ""One or two?"" I said that ""two would be nice,"" which apparently wasn't the right way to answer, because now he raised his voice again, ""ONE OR TWO?"" in a very belligerent way. His final act of insolence was to hand me the two small bottles of tonic water over his shoulder without looking at me or acknowledging us further. Another couple at the cooler on the other side were just cringing for us and just as bewildered by his attitude and behavior. We walked over to look out onto the terrace, but we left after a couple of minutes. It really was an unnecessarily tense atmosphere and we didn't feel comfortable there. Sad that we couldn't enjoy what is a really nice lounge and it left a bad taste after what had been a fantastic day. The kicker is that on the way out, I noticed a giant handwritten sign marked ""TIPS"" taped to an ice bucket on the counter near the coolers!Reported the incident immediately to the front desk supervisor (Mairovi) and indicated how strongly we felt about it. She took our information, confirmed it in the system and said she would let the management know about what occurred. Was disappointed we didn't hear anything the next day, and still haven't been contacted 48 hours later. I can only guess that she wanted the info in order to suppress the automatic emailing of the Guest Experience Index survey Starwood sends after every stay, because a bad rating really hurts them. Sure enough, haven't received one for this stay. Funny how that happens. Shady.All a great pity, because the rooms are nice and other staff members were great. Especially front desk agents Mia, Leslie, and the entire bell staff who helped us safely store some unique items. Leslie in particular, worked with my Starwood ambassador to provide a welcome gift surprise for my sister, who was also staying at the hotel.

There is a Post Office next door which allowed us to mail souvenirs that we would have mailed from home anyway so we didn't have to travel with them. There are many subway stops very close by so getting where we wanted to go was no trouble at all. We got an unlimited 7-day metro card and rode the subway wherever we wanted to go.

The staff here make an obvious effort to greet and connect with the guests during their stay. I noticed staff greeting everyone who walked through the door and each employee observed gave excellent, informed service. I stayed here with my two small dogs. There was no extra fee. (Great!) Moreover, the staff seemed happy to see my dogs each time we entered the hotel. Some hotels, while pet-friendly, give you some very dirty looks when traveling with pets but these people were absolutely great and most important, welcoming. Room service selection ok, could be more options. Everything ordered came fresh, on time and accurate.

I was here with my partner for my birthday - the hotel had agreed in advanced to put on some 'extras' to make it a special occasion - the extras turned up late and the concierge who was meant to organise flowers had been 'unavailable' all week so this hadn't been seen too - no apology was made for this lapse in service. If my partner hadn't been in contact regularly with the hotel staff to try and organise this I would have accepted these little slip ups - but he and I were both let down by laziness and poor communication within their team. In addition to this - Housekeeping failed to replenish teas and coffee/towels every day and had to be chased up, hotel management didn't seemed too concerned about this low level of service when we raised it several times. All we were looking for was recognition that this wasn't great and some reassurances that it wouldn't happen again, which we didn't get. The substandard customer service continues. On checking out - further frustrations as the receptionist attempted to charge us again for the room (pre-paid several months ago) and when she finally conceded we had already paid - proceeded to charge us for the water in the room. We confirmed with her that we had not used the over priced water bottles and she agreed that this was correct and she would not charge us. Surprise surprise - on our return to the UK we find we had been charged. This underhanded behaviour is despicable and undermines the trust between hotel and customer.

We landed at the Sheraton TriBeCa as it was affordable. Some of the TripAdvisor reviews made me a bit nervous, but truthfully, mostly were unfounded. It is in a hopping area (Canal and Broadway) and as safe as any other location but is really central to so many great spots. Couple of pointers.

It seems impossible that I am in the same hotel that the other reviewers described.When I got to my room, I looked around trying to find the closet. No closet, but there was a space to hang clothes in a little armoire. There were NO drawers in the rest of the room (not even in the nightstand). Where do they expect one to store their underwear?!?!? I'm staying here for eight days - but it looks like I don't have anywhere to unpack! I checked out the bathroom- visible dust layer where the wallpaper meets the tile and just a shower - no bathtub. Bed had feather pillows - even though I specified that I was allergic.I unpacked and went downstairs to head out for dinner. I figured that I should let the front desk know that I am beyond disappointed with the room. I had opted for the lowest priced room (still $365 per night) so I wasn't mad - I just thought maybe this is what you get for the lower price and I maybe had the worst room in the hotel. The front desk was lovely- she told me that none of the hotel rooms had drawers (what?!?) but she would try to find me another room that at least had a tub and was on a higher floor. I was really appreciative that they were so accommodating. But then.....I arrived in the new room. It is about a third smaller than the other tiny room. It has a bathtub but still no drawers- just a tiny two shelf bookcase. The bed has a feather blanket and all feather pillows (I thought we've established that I am allergic?!?) There are weird dirty handprints on the doors. I would have preferred the original room but I have already packed up all my stuff and moved it at this point and it's almost midnight.I would have gladly paid a higher nightly rate to move to a better room (but she told me she was moving me to a better room...) I don't understand how the front desk could think that this was a better room. So I'm sitting here in shock. My eyes are watering (not because I'm crying about sleeping in a dirty closet disguised as a hotel room) but because there are feathers in my bed.

However when staying at this hotel this was not part of either my two experiences there - the first when staying one night by myself having travelled from Australia (with two large suitcases and hand luggage) and being dropped at the hotel by limousine as I had travelled business class with Emirates (wonderful airline) and then secondly when returning some 4-5 weeks later with my 39 year old daughter to stay for 4 nights (on an SPG floor level) before once again returning to Australia (trip to airport in limo to fly out with Emirates) No one offered to assist me on either occasion with my luggage or anything else. When staying with my daughter we had to ask for sufficient toiletries for two people (even though the room was booked for 2 people) We also asked for some additional creamer satchels and teabags as the ""long life"" milk had gone off and we had to throw our tea out. Upon both requests a staff member begrudgingly turned up with the items and almost threw them at me.

Basically the opposite of what I needed at that moment. He clearly does not understand the requirements of his position, which are to be hospitable and welcoming, the basic essence of what some good old fashioned basic customer service is. I had had an excellent two night stay at the Sheraton Tribeca, (for which I used up all my points to book!). Unfortunately, upon checkout, I had had such a smooth, flawless, perfect magical 72 hours in NYCand I was so happy, that I forgot my driver's license as well as my phone charger in the room. Oops. My bad. Completely. I did not realize that I had forgotten those items until it was 2 am at the Newark Airport, trying to get my Hertz rental, because I was going to drive to the Sheraton in Edison that night(BECAUSE I BASICALLY LIVE AT SPG HOTELS BECAUSE OF WORK). By this time, my phone was also dead, so I was stranded with no phone and no driver license and no store was open for me to buy a charger. So the nice Hertz lady understood my situation and did her best to help me. She got me the number for the Sheraton Tribeca and I called to ask if the staff had found my forgotten items. The overnight manager that I spoke to was defensive, rude, and made me feel bad. I was in a tough situation and needed reassurance that if I had left items in the room, my items were safe and they wouldve been found, and that as soon as housekeeping came in the morning, we would be able to verify if the items HAD INDEED been found. Instead, he was trying to argue with me when he asked for my number to call me back and I told him I could not give him my cell phone number because it was dead and I couldnt charge it because the SHERATON TRIBECA HAD MY PHONE CHARGER! But, he wasn't listening to me and I was so frustrated at the whole situation that I just wanted to cry. It is just appauling that a manager in the hospitality industry would not listen and understand when a guest needs some actual help/friendly reassurance in a difficult/scary situation. The incompetence at this level of management is unacceptable, and I am surprised that this even happened. I've stayed at SPG hotels in California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Massachusetts, Florida, Illinois, even New Jersey, and in Mexico too, and I never once filed a complaint because everywhere I have been treated professionally, courteously, and SPG truly feels like home, but the Sheraton Tribeca simply did not have my back and I am disappointed and bummed at the way I was treated.

Good desk set up and adequate bathroom. Did not dine at the hotel but it looked inviting. Grabbed our breakfast on the run next door at the bagel shop/market. Clean rooms and lobby; friendly front desk and doorman. Location is not as charming as some of the neighborhoods very nearby but it worked well for us.,"Boston, Massachusetts",204,4.0

How can I tell? Because (a) the wall opposite the air vent was caked up with dark dustbunnies. I actually pulled the desk away from the wall, used a tissue to wipe off all of the dustbunnies, and pushed the furniture back. Gross.(b) the top of the room's windows - also in direct receipt of the air force - were blackened with soot and dust. I did not bother to climb up and clean the windows. I'm only 1/2 crazy, I guess.Aside from this, other glaring maintenance issues were present in the room: a broken switchplate covering a prominent electrical outlet. Grime on the shower door threshold. Mildew on just about every inch of grout in the shower. A slow drain in the sink. A broken hinge on the armoir door. The towels are all very thin, worn down, and thread-bare with little holes or fraying edges in some places. The towels also had some dark marks on them - permanent stains that should take the towels out of circulation. The comforter had stains on it. The wallpaper was scuffed and stained in a multitude of places, the walls just had black marks all over them. Also behind the desk, on the carpet, was a mountain of longterm dust. And on the ceiling - also by the air vent - orange stains from what looks like (very old) water damage, which of course should have been repainted and wasn't.This place is just not cleaned adequately. I stayed here on Starpoints because it is a good value in terms of point redemptions in the Starwood brand, but like everything on earth, you get what you pay for. It is far below the standard for a Sheraton property. I called the front desk to report these items and also reported these notes in the SPG follow-up survey and never got a reply from either channel.I'd have to say, as a 50-night/year Starwood guest, this particular property is far below par, just on simple cleanliness.There are additional minor problems with the hotel - that is, a very crowded Club Lounge (are they over-selling club lounge access?) and too few elevators, resulting in a very very long wait at peak times - when you are most in a hurry. But these could be forgiven if the rooms were clean.","Los Angeles, California",36,2.0

There's a Japanese place called Tataki on Lispenard street (right next to the cool looking Dive bar.) Dine in or take away, it's VERY reasonable, for New York, heck it's just reasonable.The hotel is bijoux, it's a gem, but small, that's New York. I loved my room on the Club Level, it was tucked away in a corner and had the best king bed I've ever slept in, other than my own. I will say that it is small. Very small. Interior cabin on a cruise ship small. So what? It was VERY functional and comfortable. No one comes to New York to hang out in the room.I will also say that I'll be staying here for the next couple of months for work, and I'm going to enjoy the very large shower, the shelving in the bathroom and the comfort height commode. The little wardrobe is perfect for my 4 days of clothing, The TV with the nearly 100 awesome cable channels is a great way to unwind when I get back to the room after a long day on site with my customer. I cannot say enough about the staff. Nelson at check-in took care of me, asked me how my day was, and made sure that everything was perfect with my stay.The folks at Antica helped me get some Pasta to eat late at night after a VERY long day. The room is impeccably clean and even in New York, in my little room in the corner of the hotel, it was very quiet, although close to the elevators and ice machine. There's a Planet Fitness right in the hotel. The Club level has a fantastic river view and breakfast is a varied assortment of carbs. Bagels, with all sorts of spreads. Fruit, yogurt, pastries, cereal and those wanting protein, hard boiled eggs for breakfast. Starbucks coffee, and an espresso machine for hot milk an depth charges. In the evenings there are cheeses, veggies, assorted nuts, pasta and hors d'oeurves. That carb thing...more protein!The Canal street subway station is right around the corner, and should get you everywhere you need to go. The SoHo pharmacy is an odd little corner of the world, with strange cosmetics and snacks, so check that out. The Black Burger is a very cheap place to get a nom. If you must, Dunkin Donuts is across the street. Imagine it gets weird, but in a good way after dark. TriBeCa bagels is right next door and open 24 hours, except for Jewish holidays. In all, I liked this hotel and I'm happy that I'll be staying there.","Atlanta, Georgia",139,5.0

This was the only positive thing I can say about the hotel, besides a very helpful guy outside the hotel, who will find you a taxi in no time.First of all the room isn't at all spacious as the picture's indicating. They are very small, and with two normal sized luggage it really was a challenge to fit in the room.Secondly, the cleaning of the room was under average of what you would expect from a four star hotel. We found a belt under the curtains... A bit of an embarrassment for the cleaning service I'd say. Thirdly, and the worst thing, the indoor climate causes you red eyes and we experienced, that the ventilation system are not capable to cool down the room in the summer time, without you having a hard time with your eyes and your respiratory system. Therefore we only used the hotel room for sleeping. When confronting the hotel's service at the final day, when asking whether we enjoyed our stay, we were met with an arrogant attitude. Basically he said, that when we didn't complain from the beginning, it was our problem, not Sheraton's. On top he wasn't at all apologetic. I found that very rude. Who wants to use the vacation time to discuss with the hotel personnel about standards for a Sheraton hotel? Our advice to you - pick another hotel than this one.","Vancouver, Canada",9,1.0

We wanted his honest opinion, not a canned answer. The same goes for the staff in the bar and the cafe. They seemed as if they were there to do their job and didn't want to go above and beyond.

In the evening they say they have cocktails during a certain time.

I had soft drinks though and they didn't charge for that. Important Note- ask the hotel the international call rates before taking a call from the room phone. We had to make an urgent overseas call that just lasted 57 seconds and were told the charge was $200 for that 57 seconds..

To begin, the place told me check-in is 3 P.M., so when I arrived at 8 P.M. that evening I was quite surprised to hear that all three of the rooms my friends and I had booked were not yet ready. Once an hour (no more or less) I would check on the status of our rooms. The people at the front desk, as well as the manager, were unhelpful and outright rude. As the hours ticked by there was no discount or form of compensation offered to make up for this waiting period... not even a free bottle of water (which cost $8.00 a bottle). It was almost midnight when the rooms were ready... but two of the rooms were not adjoining as they were supposed to be. To the contrary, two rooms were on opposite sides of the floor, and one of them was on a different floor entirely. But I'm taking too long now. So let me give you a list of the other benefits of staying at this amazingly terrible establishment: the toilet in my room was broken, and the manager said my only option was to use the pubic restroom on the second floor. Another major dilemma for us was the fact that two of the pull-out beds in the couches did not work. Live insects feasted on dead insects underneath one of these couches in my friends room. Management didn't even offer an apology. You know what? There are at least four other things I could complain about, but I don't want to waste any more of my time dwelling on this nightmare.

On the one hand, their staff did eventually fix a couple problems. But the fact that they caused the biggest of the problems AND the absurd lengths I had to go to get solutions just leaves me feeling like a 1 star is deserved.First, our travel agent definitely informed the hotel we would be arriving late on our first night. No one took note of that. In fact, the hotel gave away our room! So, after 30 hours of flying, we arrive smelly, worn out, just wanting a shower, and ""Sorry sir, we have nothing for you."" We waited 5 hours for a room to open up.Then (get this) a few weeks later I open our credit card statement to find the hotel had gone ahead and charged us for the first night! Full rack rate: more than $500! No one had informed us of this at the time we checked in. Eventually, our travel agent was able to show the hotel that they had made a mistake and they refunded it more than a month later.The third problem we had was our fault to begin. We left an item of clothing in the room. The staff said they could arrange to have it sent back, which eventually happened. So we're thankful for that. But we had to chase and chase and chase to get any action. Over more than a week we made 5 phone calls and sent several emails, being handed off to other people several times. In the end, the $12 shipping cost was much less of a cost than the hair pulled out of my scalp as I tried to find the right person who could help us. Basically, the stay was a major source of frustration. The staff there could have made it all work fine if they'd been slightly attentive to detail. Instead, we were put out in a big way.

Our rooms were clean, beds super comfortable, plenty of pillows and a relaxing shower head with plenty of hot water. There were 4 people in our group (2 rooms). Some of us get up early and some of us sleep in so having access to the Club Lounge with a free breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, Danish rolls, bagels, juice, fruit, coffee, tea) made it easy for the earlier risers. Plus the outside terrace has terrific views of the city. Then there are the appetizers and cash bar in the late afternoon. One of our group members has some knee issues and came back early to relax in the lounge area on 2 occasions. We really appreciated the umbrellas when it rained. Coming back to the Sheraton Tribeca after a day of sight seeing and being greeted with a smile was a plus.

Not because of the food they offer (quite basic at breakfast - and the dely downstairs is very good) but the terrace is really nice with unobstructred views toward the north (so all major landmarks like Empire State Building, Chrystler building, the river, etc.). Make sure you don't get a room near the elevators (for some reason the engine is rather noisy) and not on the 20th floor (because you are right below the lounge and you hear people walking, moving chars, etc.). Overall, not the best hotel of this chain, though rather decent for NYC type of service. Other remarks to consider : strangely their keys stopped working several times (hopefully not because they assigned our room to other guests, it happened to me in other hotels!) and their common areas are super cold (so bring something heavy to survive the artic temperatures of the corridors and of the lounge - it was a continuous battle even to set our room temperature, we left it at 75 and every day housekeeping set it to 65!).","Milan, Italy",115,3.0

Hotel itself is small as are the rooms but ok if you are not seeking a 'luxury' weekend away.. more practical traveller or business person.If you book the Executive Club (floors 21/22) you get access to the private club which means small lounge for breakfast and hors d'oeuvres on occasional evening.

For getting around the City, the location is unbeatable - right near the Canal Street subway stop, so an easy ride up to the Village, Fifth Avenue, Times Square/Broadway, and Central Park. For first-time visitors to the City (which I am not), it's close enough to Times Square, etc. to be convenient, but far enough from the crazy crush of crowds. The hotel is tastefully decorated with old photos of the City, but our room was extremely small, which is to be expected in NYC. For some, the price point at over $220 per night (a wedding rate) may not justify the small room (i.e., the bathroom had narrow, french-style doors that opened inward, leaving little space between the shower, toilet, and vanity; most storage space was in the closest at the end of a small hallway opening up onto the bed and the desk area). That being said, we requested a room with a City view (and got a one!) and so the architecture of the building may have required a smaller room. The hotel staff was kind and accommodating, and the open-area business center and Starbucks in the lobby are convenient. With the great service and location, we'd definitely stay at the Sheraton Tribeca again.","Boulder, Colorado",17,4.0

I requested a room change and they took me to a room that that was exactly what I had specifically asked NOT to get- a room between a vending machine and the elevators. The desk staff were pleasant and a manager said all their rooms with King and vouch we're in the same location, so I noted that they need to train their staff better so this mistake isn't made again.

For this, the location was fantastic.We stayed on the club floor, level 22, and had a large (by NYC standards) room with a big window that looked out onto East Manhattan.

The Sheraton Tribeca is convenient for my travels so I thought I would give it a shot. The hotel appears to be relatively new, my first impression is it is quite tight on space, how they squeezed it in I don't know, you'll likely miss the front door (look for the Tribeca Bagel sign which is huge, and next door!). Inside however the reception, lobby, bar and casual computer area is very well done with high ceilings etc and it is very comfortable. The bar has good beers, cocktails etc and fun and friendly staff - to be honest all the staff were amazing, it's nice to have some banter and fun with them rather than they are just polite. There is also a starbucks on site, awesome :) There is a restaurant which I think is only open for breakfast so I didn't use it. All rooms you have to use a lift/elevator, there are 3 so you can have a little wait. The corridors to the rooms are tight, not a big deal but gives you a sense that they squeezed this in. The room itself was as expected, very new and clean which is always a good start, the bed/linen was great. There is a desk for working, but with cases etc space was a bit of a premium. I had room service, must say the food was very good, but again tight space on where to sit/eat. The room overlooked the road, and traffic noise was an issue (I was on floor 9), just a warning, this is New York, it is a big city and the hotel is on a main street. The internet was also wanting, ""speed"" was an issue and drop outs using WiFi, however when I used the ethernet cable things were fine (I'm a technology guy, it wasn't a ""user"" issue!). The Sheraton also have this Green initiative going, where you don't get new towels/linen everyday, which is a good thing but be warned this means you're off the housekeeping list, so you need to call down for bins and they don't tidy the room/make the bed etc.Overall the room was a little tight, but well kept, the traffic noise and internet was an issue (but the Lenovo's in the lobby were great). I'd really like to give this 3.5 stars, I think 3 is probably a little too low but not quite 4 stars either. The bar, staff etc are all brilliant and the location is great too. There are plenty of other options in the area in the same price range, I'm sure they have their pro's and con's too (I've stayed in many!). It's not a bad choice by any stretch, but has a lot of competition that you could consider in the same price range.","Boca Raton, Florida",48,3.0

But it's not the main point. The main point is the quality (and the price) of food in the area. In the Upper East Side etc., the food is lousy and/or very expensive. But in Tribeca one has an excellent choice of all kinds of excellent restaurants at very reasonable prices. In fact, right around the corner from that Sheraton there is a superb Japanese restaurant (I'll review it... in Italian... :))) that would've been prohibitively expensive only 6 miles up north.

Morning coffee maybe but I don't recommend purchasing a breakfast package. There are a million options just outside the door, don't waste time and money here. The only other challenge is timing of the elevators. Be sure and give yourself plenty of time when you are leaving the hotel. The wait for the elevators can be really long in particular in the morning. There just aren't enough of them to cover the demand. Plan and it won't be a problem.

Bought tickets from front desk for trip to outlets to do shopping thinking this was quicker only to find when got to station to get coach had to queue to get that changed to another ticket to get onto the coach so there is no benefit to getting ticket at hotel and it same price.

The two ladies serving the front desk was pleasant and nice, whilst the gentlemen serving the frontdesk (night to morning duty) was condescending and curt* Was offered a low floor room despite paying for club due to ""overbooked"" room - though I managed to get that changed after 2 nights* Drastic difference between the lower floors and higher / club floors - from basic thing such as lack of shower gel (only bar soaps) for the lower floors to an older bath vs newer bath / vanity area* Patchy laundry and housekeeping service - laundry took more than a day (despite my punctual ""submission"" before the deadline), and the housekeeping or laundry service didn't bother to replace the laundry bags every day despite my usage of the laundry service (I can understand if the hotel chooses not to replace laundry plastic bags for guests who ""took"" the bags without using the laundry service, but not replacing the bags for guests that consistently uses the laundry service is unbecoming for a starwood hotel)* Getting charged hundreds of dollars for making local calls (which I noted to be a couple of cents per minute, not couple of dollars per minute). Bill was sent electronically to be after checkout and hence no chance to dispute; I guess I can get some additional starwood points for the extra hundred of dollars paid for the local calls* ""Green"" effort for starwood points not honored - despite the instruction to leave the card for no housekeeping for 2 days (to save the environment and to earn some starwood points or vouchers, none was offered)Overall a mixed and patchy stay.

Some weeks, I'm in an well-maintained room, other times, the age of the hotel is showing. Not all king guest rooms have an armchair, some rooms are slightly roomier, broken coffee maker, scuff marks on the wall, etc. Rooms are smaller than your typical king guest room, which is what you will get in New York. I didn't particularly like that there are no pull out drawers, just open shelves. Starbucks coffee for the in-room coffee machine is much appreciated.Overall, I am pleased with housekeeping, but did experience some inconsistency. Once or twice, in-room amenities were not replenished ex. disposable cups were not replaced.The bathrooms are designed for the small space - walk-in showers instead of tubs, a descent sized sink with a small amount of counter space. It's good enough for a short stay, but definitely not impressive. The lobby was great, and the business center was very modern and well-designed. It had lots of Win 8 desktops and multiple printers/scanners are available. Very convenient, and was a lifesaver when I needed to scan and send a document urgently.

We had room 1703 which had a window but it looked right out at another old building, no view. It was perpendicular to another room which meant that whenever they left or came in it sounded in our room that someone was opening or closing our door.

We had booked a superior king room with SPG points (no status) and requested an early check-in of 1pm on Friday. No problems with the reservation, but not only was early check-in not possible (certainly understandable) we had to wait over an hour past check-in time (and long past my daughter's nap time) to get into our room. They claimed this was to honor late check-out requests (presumably by those with SPG status) which is believable and the front desk staff was very apologetic and provided us water, snacks, and free wi-fi use throughout our 2 night stay for the inconvenience. Though annoying, I felt this was handled appropriately. The superior room was decent sized for NYC, with room for the king bed, an open pull-out sofa, and a small dining table. The bathroom is small, but not as tiny as some as I've had in cities. Note that the superior rooms (I believe on all floors) are right next to the elevators, so though we weren't bothered by mechanical noise, you will hear everyone on and off the elevator. Otherwise, we were on the 14th floor, and didn't have any significant noise issues - even considering the Halloween parade and revelry on Canal St. just below us. If street noise is an issue for you, go with the higher floors. Location is excellent, as others have noted, both in terms of neighborhood and proximity to the A,C,E Canal St. subway. There is a small deli/convenience store on the corner a half-block west of the hotel for drinks and snacks. Otherwise, nothing stands out about this property for me. The other frustrating service aspect came when our room hadn't been serviced on the second day by 2pm when we returned after lunch. When we went back out around 4pm, we specifically stopped at the front desk to request that the room be made-up as we were now going out for the evening - nobody ever came to service the room. Although the staff seemed to all work hard and were consistently pleasant, my impression was simply that they were overtaxed in the number of people/jobs they had to manage.

I recommend this room it was great. they say they have great views and a rooftop deck but every time I had a view of a brick wall. the rooftop patio is also only for certain guests and I wasn't allowed up. it's 2 blocks from the train but canal street itself is pretty dirty and if you aren't used to the nyc lifestyle it's a lot to handle. ,"New York City, New York",20,4.0

The hotel has a nice reception area. Our 'deluxe double king' room was basic and dated and the bathroom disappointing. The bath is not really a bath as it is very shallow and uncomfortable.

Amazingly all the smoke detectors are battery operated so if you are unlucky enough to be in the room when the battery runs out you will be kept awake all night. I find it incredible that it is even legal for a hotel to use a battery operated alarm. The staff didn't seem concerned about our complaint.

The genuinely apologetic managment at the Sheraton Tribeca reached out to me and invited me back for a second stay. I was hesitant at first, but I had a friend visiting me from Vancouver and Columbus day weekend presented a great opportunity for a long weekend in the city. Everything was smooth sailing from check in, check out, and especially our room which had a great Empire State Building view. The room was clean, had a working phone, and the friendly housekeepers left a nice note for us the next day. The wifi was spotty in our room--but worked well in other parts of the hotel (lobby, club room), so I don't know if it was just our room's proximity to the routers--for that reason I certainly would not pay $10 a day for it, and thankfully we didn't have to. The club room was a great perk--it's accessible 24 hours a day, so if you're not quite ready to call it a night, it was a great place to unwind--wine and spirits are extra, but at $7 or $8 a glass it is not cost prohibitive. The area is easy to access from the A,C,E--which if you came in through Penn station like us, it's a straight shot without changing trains. It's walking distance to great neighborhoods, we had lunch and dinner in the west village, went out dancing in meat packing, and strolled the high line--all on foot. Sheraton Tribeca has won me back over, which is good because I've enjoyed staying at Starwood properties.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",47,4.0

The bonus, do whatever it takes to get access to the Club Lounge--the deck is the best view of the city. It is a great place to start your day, finish your day, or as happened once when I was there and a bit disabled, I stayed the (virtually) entire weekend on the deck and really enjoyed it. I probably visit NYC 10x/year and stay at the Sheraton Tribeca 7-8 of those times. Every time I am unfaithful I regret it...I miss the deck, the location and the cheerful people.One note, although the rooms on Canal are considered an upgrade, (great windows), I find them noisy--I am not out late so the late night noise is disruptive.

The area is very convenient to lower Manhattan, close to numerous subway lines and many restaurants and shops.

The woman at the desk told us it would be $85 in total, including tolls for an SUV to take us. Perfect! We booked it. When we went down at our reserved time, the driver of the vehicle immedietely started complaining, saying that the amount of luggage we had was going to cost more. He was blatantly rude and then at the airport, after reluctantly taking us, he tried to tell us the tolls were not included! He started yelling at us at the drop off at the airport, trying to get more money. There was obviously a misscommunication somewhere, but it did not lie with us. After arriving at the airport, I phoned the hotel and spoke to the same woman that told us the price initially and she confirmed once again that it was $85 for a large SUV including tolls. The driver should have taken this up with the hotel and NOT the guests.We are also still waiting to here back from the general manager about an item we left in the room. We are trying to arrange it to be sent to us and the manager has been very flakey with his replies and everytime we call he is 'not available'. Very strange.

There was also a tv, and sitting area by it, a computer and best of all, an outdoor terrace with patio furniture where you could have a drink and enjoy the view towards either the Hudson or uptown city view. The hotel was conveniently located near Canal St subway access, a short walk to a small Chinatown and little Italy (so beautiful at night), about a 40 min walk to Wall St area and Battery Park area.It was right beside a great deli where you could get a fresh, reasonably priced sandwich ($6-8 for a big sandwich), juice, soda, salad bar, pizza...and a block from the hotel, a convenience store that sold beer, coolers etc; beside that, a pizza place where you could get a basic cheese pizza slice for $1! Other slices were $3-4 - was good pizza.It was a safe area to walk around - us 2 females never felt concerned walking back there at night.

How bad could one night be.....pretty bad!!!!! The physical plant and location are a problem. The hotel is poorly laid out with small rooms and very narrow halls. The halls become echo chambers and sound carries throughout the floor. The hotel is also right next to a USPS station with the sound of trucks arriving and leaving all night and banging mail skids makes sleep impossible. Add to that the street noise on one of Manhattan's busiest streets and you can forget any thought of a good night's sleep. In a 10 minute span at midnight I heard a police car siren, 3 mail trucks beeping as they backed up, mail skids banging - metal on metal and a drunk guest laughing in the echo chamber as he tried to open his door.Arrival was sterile and cold and I received a warmer welcome from my DI in Marine Corps OCS. The clerk did not bother to direct me to the elevators which are hidden in the rear corner of the main floor. I was sorry that I disturbed her afternoon.The hall carpet on my floor was badly stained and the hall was blocked by a pile of dirty sheets and maid's cart. The rooms are about 150 square feet and are clean and attractive. No place can be all bad!I tried 5 times to schedule a wake up call since the clock radio was broken. I finally got a real person who told me the wake up call was scheduled but the call never came in the morning. It was a good thing that sleep was impossible or I would have missed my flight.

So then I call them from my cell phone, and explain the situation and they tell me they will send an engineer to fix my phone and security to take down a report about my phone. Engineer shows up, fixes phone, security does not show. It's 6pm at this point and I am flabbergasted that they haven't sent anyone up. So i call down again, the front desk is not apologetic and just tells me flat out they've been busy. As if because I am on vacation and I have all the time in the world to sit in the hotel room waiting for them! I tell them I have dinner plans and they need to send someone up ASAP. So the security guy shows up, Luis, he is actually very nice and takes down the report. Says he will investigate and get back to me. I do not hear a single thing. The next day as I am leaving for dinner and after I paid $65 to have my screen fixed, i stop by the front desk. They manager Aldo is very confrontational, almost accusatory, as if I am trying to scam the hotel out of paying for my phone repair. Do they think that someone who is paying over $200 a night, and is on vacation, in some crazy scheme to have my phone fixed would come up with this story? He was unapologetic, completely rude, and said that they offered me free club level access and that's all they could do. Free breakfast and sodas a $75 value. 1. they never communicated to me that i had this club level access offered to me to appease my terrible experience at this hotel. he claimed they did not have my number or email--to which i pointed out i gave my cell phone number at check in, and they emailed me the confirmation so that is a flat out lie, 2. i tried to go to the club level access the next morning as I was leaving, and my key didn't work!! So he either lied to me, or the club level access was for a day that I didn't even know about because they never communicated it to me. ABSOLUTELY insane experience. Will never stay here again. My friend who has a block of rooms reserved for her wedding is now reconsidering. I have never been treated so poorly and rudely by a manager ever. Maybe it's because i wasn't with my Starwood Platinum companion, but I am a starwood member and now I will think twice about getting status with Starwood as opposed to Hilton or Marriott. Their loss as I travel frequently for work and vacation!","Washington DC, District of Columbia",47,1.0

If you are a light sleeper you should stay elsewhere.As a SPG Gold Member, we were given no perks and was not given an enhanced room, even when the hotel was obviously not at full capacity, which was extremely disappointing.We also had an Wifi connection problem, the operators on the phone could not help and suggests that ""YOU can call the toll-free number for technical support"" and not proactively help us with the problem. We spent literally hours talking to the person on the toll-free number. It ended up to be because of an administrative error at the hotel's end, this was only because we met one very helpful staff at the reception who was willing to spend time looking through our record.It's a shame, this property can do so much better.

I have stayed in many NYC area Starwood properties and my biggest complain with this hotel is the room service and the limited 'quick healthy food' options in walking distance. The room service menu is very limited, and as a business traveler that worked long hours, I was normally too tired to go out. I am also not a huge fan of the area as it seemed kind of sketchy at night, and it was really tough to get a cab (nothing against the bellmen- they were very nice! just not a lot of cabs that come down the street that are empty).

After a long day, I was ready to rest but couldn't because the sheets were DIRTY. It took almost an hour (and two phone calls) for someone from housekeeping to come change them. I should have learned my lesson from room service the prior day but received cold food with no condiments (dry toast, no ketchup for the potatoes, etc.).Two stars are for the front desk who was very nice at check in and for the happy hour on the club lounge.

The room was cheerful, had a great view, a very nice contemporary bath, had the usual amenities and was very clean. My complaint would be, as it is in most NYC hotels, that the room was small. There are computers in the lobby, a bar, a restaurant which serves breakfast and a coffee bar. Unfortunately, when I went down to the coffee bar at 9 in the morning, they were closed, even though someone was behind the counter. That was crazy to be closed at that time.

We travelled from the UK for my friends 40th birthday and to be honest I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews here on TA however we have all come home with NO complaints at all. We were allocated rooms on the 18th floor away from Canal Street which if you're a light sleeper is definitely the best request. The rooms were small (this is NYC) however clean and the beds were super comfy. The SPG lounge was fabulous and the breakfasts excellent, a special mention for the young man in there who tended to our every need with a smile on his face. The front desk staff, especially Jaquie were friendly and super helpful. We did have to wait a while for our rooms to be ready however we sat and had Starbucks in the lovely reception area and as an apology we were given free wifi for the duration of our stay. Although the location on Canal Street may give some cause for concern it was so easy to get everywhere. Greenwich & Soho were within 10 minutes walk and at no point did we feel unsafe or get bothered by the street vendors of which we saw very few. Granted it isn't the prettiest part of town however it's super convenient and great value for money, especially when you'd rather save your pennies for shopping! Also worth a mention is the AWESOME bagel shop next door, the bagels were to die for and it's open all hours so very handy when you're on another time zone and feeling hungry at silly oclock :) Overall our experience was brilliant & I would really reccommend this hotel to anyone looking for a convenient, comfortable good value place to stay in NYC.

Unlike some guests, we left our bikes in our parked vehicle rather than cart them into the hotel.Issue 1 - Front desk. We arrived before check-in time so we gave our luggage to the valet to store it. He was doing great work hustling around and dealing with a dozen people at a time. If only the hotel could clone him and put him to work at the front desk. When we arrived back later, there were two lineups of people checking in - one at the SPG desk and one at the regular. The lineups moved infuriatingly slowly. It was taking 5 to 10 minutes per person, and then there would be extra holdups with guests going right to the front asking where their laundry is or some other pointless question, which the front desk people would then deal with while the lineups grew. Anyway, even though it was 4 or 4:30pm, we heard the front desk people telling people their room is not ready, so we heard this conversation multiple times: ""But it's after 3pm! I'm sorry sir. I've waited in this line for 40 minutes! Sorry sir, the room should be ready shortly."" A third line near the SPG side opened up briefly and he seemed to be giving out rooms while the other two were telling people their rooms were not ready. When we got to the front of the line we were told our room wasn't ready, and I pointed to the clerk giving out rooms and asked how he is able to do it, and without hesitation we got a room. It was just weird and annoying, and we spent nearly an hour in the cramped lobby.Issue 2 - Elevators. The issue is that there are not enough of them, or not enough working ones, or something else that involves waiting and waiting and eventually it shows up and it's full. You know something is wrong with the elevators when people are carting suitcases and bicycles down 7 flights in the morning thinking that's a preferable solution to waiting. We were the ones carting the suitcases, two men behind us were each carrying bikes (nice workout before the tour!), and a father and young child were behind them - and we were all from the 7th floor.Issue 3 - The little things. We were offered a free breakfast as part of our BikeNY deal. That's nice! Breakfast starts at 7am. Hmm, ok, well we need to be on our bikes, with helmets on, ready to go at 7:30 in the Financial District. How does that work if breakfast starts being served at 7am? Try 6am and we'd be happy.Our room was great! Nice king bed, clean, modern design, obviously recently renovated. Nice bathroom. The shower was really nice (no tub though). The location is pretty good. Canal Street is a little busy, but the subway is right around the corner and there is lots of stuff nearby.If they had elevators you could use in a reasonable time and efficient front desk staff, this would be a 4 star review. I was going to rate them a 2 but that seems a little punishing because we did like the room. This Sheraton seriously needs to rework their front desk processes and training. It should not take 5 to 10 minutes to check someone in - that is unacceptable. I joke about cloning the valet, but someone with his temperament, customer-handling abilities, and willingness to get the job done quickly would be a better face to the customer at the front desk. Then they need to do something about the elevators.","New Milford, Connecticut",84,3.0

I informed him that I will be checking out and go to the W New York, understanding I would be responsible for payment. Suddenly, the front desk manager pulls out a room map and suddenly reveals 6 available rooms on the club floor. I reviewed the room and returned to reception to find the manager with his coat on ready to leave(really made me feel like he cared about his position?!?). I did stay but even the club staff were unprofessional. I did receive an email from the asst.GM asking for additional details after I completed an unfavorable platinum survey but no follow up.

Overall we really enjoyed our time at the hotel and in comparison to the Soho Grand, across the road and which we stayed in the previous year we decided this hotel was less cool and chic but better overall.

They had the usual comfortable beds that all Starwood hotels have. It ends there.First started out that they did not have our reservation. I booked using airmile points, I printed and had with me my confirmation but it was not in their system. They found us a room on the second floor, pretty lousy. They also took a copy of my reservation to keep for their records. I gave them my credit card for incidentals but explicitly stated that I wanted to pay for anything in cash, not to charge the card on check out. He said no problem. I also asked about wifi and although not free he agreed to provide it to me for free, I was happy about that as I knew I would have work todo while I was there. Throughout the stay the hotel was busy and very corporate, no personal service. That didnt really bother me but it wasnt appealing either. The lineups for the elevator everyday were ridiculous! And the stairs were locked so we couldnt even walk up to our room. On our second of three nights, my husband went out to grab a nightcap but forgot his key. I was fast asleep and was not opening the door. He tried explaining to the front desk staff that he was my husband and all he wanted to do was go to bed so he could enjoy the rest of the weekend with me and his in-laws. When the front desk heard that for some reason he thought it made sense to call and wake up my father at midnight and have him go to my room to wake me up. How does this make any sense??? Why didnt he just look to see that both our names were on the reservation?? They took a copy after all, what was the point of that. To finish it off they ended up calling the police on my husband and embarassed him in front of my father! The next day I called the manger to complain of how the incident was handled. I left a message as he was not in yet and asked to have him call me. No phone call.Finally on check out, I went to the front desk to check any incidentals. I also asked them to make sure to check that I wasnt charged for the wifi as the gentleman on check in granted it to me free of charge. They checked and saw that there were no incidentals and I was happily on my way. Well low and behold today I get a charge for $107 USD on my credit card from the Sheraton Tribeca! I called to check what it was and they could give me no answers other than transfer me to accounting. I cant wait to see how long this takes. This is one hotel I won't be back to.","Toronto, Canada",6,2.0

My wife is a Platinum member of Starwoods and we knew this location wasn't a 5 star property, we still did expect 5 star hospitality. We checked in on a rainy Friday evening and were checked in by the night manager. Though, he was a very nice man; he barely acknowledged that we are Platinum SPG (I apologize if that comes across wrong; we are no better than anyone else but we are definately brand loyal and we that typically comes some benefits). He did not explain any of the hotel amneties, did not inform us of the Private Lounge and what the benefits of that lounge included. Again, we decided to stay at this property due to it's location and how it accomodated our needs for the weekend. After checking in and going to our room, which was nice and clean; we decided to go out for the evening. Again, only person on staffed was night manager, asked for directions and seemed as if he could care less to give us detailed directions. Instead, we had to brave the rain and navigate directions via smartphone directions. Also, seemed as if many times the staff during the days were working with skeleton crew; if/when concierge was on lunch/break there was nobody available for that particular hour to accomodate guests. I do want to give some kudos to the bellman and the doorman that were there on Monday night, they were the most professional people we encountered. Very helpful with bags and also secured private taxi for trip back to the airport.Again, I will conclude that this hotel is in a great location, clean and very good for a weeeknd getaway or business trip.

I really loved all the dark wood tones. It felt modern without trying too hard. But the lobby had only 2 reception desks (one with an SPG sign) right at the front entrance with little space to wait, and also blocking traffic in and out of the hotel. It could have been better placed. The rest of the lobby was a huge and very happening bar, plus a business area with computers and maybe printers?The room looked great, and had floor-to-ceiling windows that had a totally unobstructed view to the east.

In fact, it was kind of useless, since it was already stuffed with a ironing board and luggage rack. Hangers barely fit in the doors. The room could have definitely accommodated a larger closet, so I'm confused why it was so small. The bed was super comfortable, and there were a choice of feather and alternative pillows, which is great, since I'm allergic, and so I did not need to ask for housekeeping. There was no street noise from the 20th floor, but you could hear people going in and out of adjacent rooms. Bathroom was probably my favorite part. Although small, it was totally functional, with enough vanity space for 1, and a large glass walk-in shower. Shower pressure was fantastic. However, there were some odd maintenance issues that took away from the experience. The key cards worked sometimes in some elevators but not others. It was like musical chairs seeing people get in and out, riding up and down without getting where they need to go. A minor inconvenience when this happens once, but troublesome when it's unpredictable and multiple times.Then on the last night, 2 of 3 bathroom lights did not work. These were all CFLs, and only 1 strip was working. I could not be bothered to call housekeeping for a fix, as there was minimally enough light, but 2 of 3 out at the same time seemed totally bizarre. Finally, the a/c unit was also kind of wonky. I don't know if it was the temperature I set (68), but some nights, the fan ran through the night. Other nights, it didn't. It was not disturbingly loud, but the air definitely hits the head of the bed pretty strong. I just could not figure out why auto fan was so inconsistent. Outside temps were about the same every day.I would probably stay here again if I had to, hopefully in another room, but I wouldn't go out of my way to request it. In conclusion, it was fine.","Boston, Massachusetts",69,3.0

Depending on what room you're in, there can be some street noise, but this is Manhattan! You'd be hard pressed to find a hotel anywhere without street noise.The only potential drawback for some people is that it's right on Canal Street, which in my opinion, is one of the busiest/dirtiest streets in Manhattan (still a safe area though).

The room was clean and tidy, and the bed was comfortable.The only two gripes that I had were 1) When I opened my window, I was staring straight into the bedrooms of those who lived in the apartment building next door. Window to window, less than 100 feet would be my guess. --- Yes, I know it's NYC and things are practically on top of each other but the fact that one of the guys next door looked up and waved at me really made me feel uncomfortable. I kept my curtains closed for the duration of my stay. 2) The double doors to the bathroom (small but clean with a sizeable shower) were a pain in the butt - it wasn't very easy to open (got stuck) and I got tired of struggling so I just left one door open and slid in/out of that half.One of the positives that impressed me was the attention of the doormen. I was making my way to the front desk to check out and one of doormen greeted me ""Good morning, checking out?

I was upgraded to a junior suite, which isn't a room type listed on their website, but it was big enough to overcome some of my reservations about the size of the rooms at the hotel.

There is a 24-hour bodega next to the hotel that I did use a bunch, but outside of that, the front of the hotel faces what appears to be a row of derelict factories, which is strange for downtown NYC.Given the plethora of Starwood properties in NYC, I wouldn't stay here again.","Boston, MA",137,2.0

The bathroom was equally small with zero counter space.The day after I checked in, I got an email from one of the managers asking how I like my room. I replied that it was barely usable and that my desire to ever stay again was minimal. More than a day later he replied that he was sorry but they were totally booked (they weren't) and that maybe they could help on my next stay.After I checked out, the valet offered to get me 'one of our cars' as opposed to a taxi for only a few dollars more. What they forgot to mention that it's even more expensive if you care to use a card. I found that out at the airport when it cam time to pay If the bait and switch wasn't enough, then the driver ended up writing himself an additional $10 tip after he dropped me off. I called to let the hotel know ""their"" driver ripped me off but all I got was voice mail and I never got a return call to acknowledge it.Then there was the billing. The original credit card charge came through for only 1 night.

I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was though. The hotel is on Canal street, just outside China town, right on the Soho edge of Tribeca, a short wall from a lot of different metro stops which means that you have easy access to all of New York. There are loads of nice restaurants and good shops less than a 5 minute walk away. So really, location is amazing even though we were not expecting this. The room was fine. Nothing amazing but clean and functional. If you chose to not get housekeeping in every day, they give you a 5USD voucher per night that you can spend in the Starbucks downstairs. Just make sure you have the card in your door before 2am ! We thought that was actually a good incentive to encourage people to be more environmentally friendly. We were street side so it was a little noisy but not too bad. The gym is pretty good : you have everything you need to keep in shape. Wifi is free in the lobby which is, I'm afraid, pretty standard for NYC but works pretty well. The staff was friendly and organized a car to take us to the airport which worked perfectly.

So much wasn't available in the buffet, and what WAS available really was sub-par. We were trapped, though, as it was Christmas day and everything close by was closed. Housekeeping was bizarre. One day our room wasn't cleaned at all so I had to call for our next morning's coffee. One day we were given a lot of cups and another time only two. Sometimes tea was left, sometimes not. We ran out of toilet paper. We just didn't know what to expect when we returned to our room each evening!

My previous one was a disappointment, and sadly, despite hoping my last visit was a fluke, this one wasn't much better.First, I'd have to say this place if definitely overpriced. Sure, its Manhattan, but the return on investment just isn't there. With middling quality, service and amenities all around, its hard to justify the luxury price tag. Front desk/office staff really disappointed me. I needed to charge my stay to a new company card, which I didn't have in my possession yet, so I faxed in a credit card authorization form with the explicit request they contact me and let me know it was received and everything was in order. Having not had to do this before, I simply wanted assurance my trip fine and I wouldn't show up at midnight on a Thursday and find out there were issues with my booking/billing. It took the initial fax request, 3 emails, and 2 phone calls (over the course of several days) to finally get someone to reply and let me know that everything was in order.On checkin, the clerk was polite and efficient, but failed to notice my SPG status, and it took specifically asking for the check-in amenity (all I wanted was the points...) to get it.Room itself is very small, though generally well appointed. The bathroom is modern and, arguably, the highlight of the room. Also worth noting that the Sheraton beds are freaking awesome, and I slept like a baby tucked into it.There's a 32"" HDTV mounted to the wall but, oddly, its at the far left side of the room, and doesn't have a tilt/swivel. So, the only place in the room where you have a direct view of the TV is if you're standing next to the window. From the desk, you have a near impossible angle, and from the bed its certainly watchable, but is still at an odd angle and less than ideal.In short, an all around average hotel that charges far beyond average prices... next time I'll definitely be looking for alternatives in the area.","Atlanta, Georgia",75,3.0

On checkout, we discovered the hotel had triple charged the CC for the deposit - on arrival, on the second day, and on the day of checkout. The desk clerk was unable to find the charges on our folio, unable resolve it, and then loudly announced two separate times that we should take it up with Priceline - an excellent suggestion had we booked through Priceline and if Priceline had charged the three deposits but, alas, they had not. The antics were unprofessional. We patiently and courteously explained each time that we'd booked and paid in advance through Hotwire.com and showed the account charges for each of the three days made by Sheraton, but to no avail.

We were there for my boyfriend's birthday, and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, helping us book reservations at restaurants and guiding us around the area. Shoutouts to the bellhop Fany (sorry if I butchered the spelling) and front desk guru Steve Lamour for being genuinely awesome.Our room was north facing on the 19th floor, so we had a phenomenal view. It was mostly taken up by the king sized bed (super comfy), but there was a little seating area and a desk. The best best best part was that we had access to the club floor, which means free breakfast and a free hors d'oeuvres thing from 5 - 8 pm, both of which were pretty awesome. The lounge led to a patio that was super nice, and we ordered a bottle of wine from room service (only 30 bucks, which is great for room service prices) and sat up there and enjoyed the massive city in front of us. The hotel is close to many subway lines (1,2,3 and A,C,E are less than a block away), and lots of good late night pizza shops, and walking distance to the New Museum and Soho shopping on Broadway. Sitting in the Tribeca park around the corner we saw Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts with their kids. Also, Nancy's Whisky pub was just around the corner, and was a great little hole in the wall.My only quibble is that Wi-Fi is 9.99 per day in the rooms, although it's free in the lobby, so we didn't really mind, as we at least had the option of hanging out in the lobby to download maps and such before heading out. We could hear street noise up on the 19th floor at night, so I can only imagine what it's like on the 5th floor or so. Request a room up top, get the club floor, it's so worth it!","Toronto, Canada",62,4.0

It is in a great location with easy access to all subway lines, walking distance to Little Italy, Chinatown, Tribeca and the Village. There are plenty of awesome restaurant options all around the area.The hotel is very nice with a great staff. They are always greeting you and making sure they are taking care of any need you have.The rooms are very nice. We stayed on the 22nd floor, so there was no worry for street noise or anything of that sort. Good size rooms as well for most hotels in NYC.I would say the elevators can take a little bit, but I have yet to stay in a hotel in NYC where that is not of some concern. Given the volume of visitors to NYC at any time of the year, I would believe this is always going to be off minor concern.We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this property and out of the hussle and bussle of midtown or Times Square. The streets are alot less crowded(unless you get further down Canal in the shopping) and the amount of traffic noise is less.I would recommend this property as a great value and a great location with easy access to anywhere in the city you want to venture.","Charlotte, North Carolina",49,5.0

I would definitely stay there again. Because it's Tribeca, it's a little bit away from much of the Manhattan action, but the subway entrance is only steps away from the main entrance -- and cabs are easy to find. The room was comfortable, and for New York, not as miniscule as I would have expected. Staff was extremely warm and professional. Overall, I was very pleased. The room was clean and very comfortable and when I called to get extra bath towels, they arrived in about 5 minutes. (I am amazed, at other hotels of equal or higher quality, how interminably long such a request can take.) Bed was delicious. Minor issues are that the three elevators are tiny and slow. Be prepared to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with other guests any time you step in the elevator, but it tends to be a friendly crowd. More than once I discovered folks in conversation with others, only to separate when the elevator door opened -- indicating that they didn't know each other upon entrance.My only complaint is the restaurant. Skip it for breakfast, please. It was utterly chaotic; took way to long to get seated; the buffet is $16 but so are the handful of entrees on the menu, and honestly the breakfast buffet was equivalent to what you'd find at a Holiday Inn Express. In particular: the serving utensils didn't have an appropriate place to sit; the hot entrees are left to stand in unheated (albeit covered) casserole dishes so they are likely lukewarm by the time you get them -- and they are not replaced often enough so we were scavenging the bottom of the scrambled eggs and sausage plates even though it was 9am on a Saturday. Bagels appear Costco-bought, and the wait staff seems far more interested in stealing your plate the moment you sit down, and not at all interested in refilling your coffee. (When I went up to grab the newly warm eggs that had just been brought out, I returned to find our table cleared and my still-unread newspaper taken away. I had to go in search of the waiter to get my paper returned.)So other than breakfast, it's a great hotel, made all the better due to a very professional and helpful staff (breakfast staff not included in this compliment, sorry).","Washington DC, District of Columbia",27,4.0

Aside from that the hotel was adequate-- room was comfortable though not luxurious, and the location of hotel easy to get around from. All in all I only recommend this hotel if you need a hotel in this area and don't want to go full luxury rate at a better hotel, or want the SPG points.

I love it when hotels take time to do this for their guests. At the hotel, the staff was nice and efficient, no problems here. The club lounge had nice offerings, the terrace on the rooftop was spectacular! My room was small (but efficient), it was indeed the smallest room I've ever stayed in, this is NYC so it's not unexpected. It was very quiet for Manhattan and we were facing Canal Street. The area is well served by subway lines, you can be anywhere in Manhattan very quickly. You can also walk and bike around the area. As others have mentioned, some areas on Canal Street are a little seedy & dirty. I'm comfortable with any urban setting, but someone who is expecting the upper west side, might not...The only 2 minor negative aspects were: the hotel does get alot of volume & traffic, and it shows because there was alot of dents, scuffs, and scratches everywhere in the hotel, especially in my guestroom.

I wanted a 4 star hotel near the TriBeCa area. So I was pleasantly surprise when I found out I was given the Sheraton TriBeCa. I knew that the Sheraton hotel chain has a good reputation. But it turned out to be a total disappointment. First of all, when i called for direction to the hotel, i was told by the hotel receptionist that they were located on Canal Street and by the Hudson River. Wrong! It took me, what should had been a 15 minutes walk from the NY Municipal Building to the hotel, over 50 minutes on a hot humid day to find the hotel. Please be aware that the big traffic circle leading to the Holland Tunnel breaks up Canal Street from different directions, and the hotel is not by the Hudson River as I was told, but is by Wooster Street. Finally when I arrived with a friend, I was told by a not so friendly receptionist that all rooms were fully booked so my prior request (which I've made weeks ago) for twin beds was not available. Okay, as long as it was a non smoking room, I could live with that, after all, what choice do I have since it was Labor Day weekend, and I did get the discounted room through Hotwire. It was not my intention to spend all my time in the hotel anyway. That evening after a long day of sightseeing, I was looking forward to a nice hot shower and a comfortable bed. I have to admit the room although small, was clean as was expected for a 4 star hotel. But I was surprise to find that there was only one bath towel in the bathroom. ONE BATH TOWEL for a room with double occupancy! I called the receptionist to ask for more bath towel. And was blown away when they said they were short in bath towels and that one will be sent up as soon as they can get hold of extra towels. Can you believe this happening in a 4 star hotel! So I got to use the one towel left in the room while my friend waited patiently for more towels to be delivered. After half an hour of waiting, my friend called the receptionist again and was told the same situation. Another hour passed and again the same excuse. Finally around 11 pm my friend called a third time and asked that if they could at least deliver some hand towels to the room so that she could use them as bath towels. They readily agreed to do so. But none came. So my friend, tired of waiting, had to use the hand and face towels that were in the bathroom. No wait, they did keep their promise, because around 12:30 a.m. While we were fast asleep, there came a knock on our door waking us up, and behold, service presented us with hand towels. But wait, that was not the worse. The worse was the incessant noise outside in the hallway throughout the night. We did not find out until the next day that it wasn't even hotel guests that were making the noises, but the hotel staff. It turned out there was a service staff room right across from our room, and the staff were in and out of that room talking loudly with total disregard for the guests sleeping behind closed doors. As if that wasn't bad enough, Aound 3:30 a.m. the room message phone rang for no apparent reason. The next morning when I complained to the receptionist, all she said was ""oh, that can happen to signify the phone is running out of battery."" Can you believe this???when I told the receptionist all the problems we had the night before, all she said was "" Oh I'm so sorry to hear that you had such a bad experience."" And that was the end of that! What I want to know is did all this happen because we booked through Hot Wire and that the hotel felt they had no need to be accommodating because our rate was discounted? This was the first time I booked through Hot Wire and the first time I stayed at a Sheraton Hotel. In any case, I will not use either for my future bookings.","Shanghai, China",3,1.0

However, when we asked for more towels or maintenance they were very prompt in their resolutions of the problems.The elevators were incredibly slow, and I think one was actually broken during our time there.

Subways are just a block or so away which makes getting around the city a beeeze. If your unfamiliar withe the subways just use Hop Stop or a similar program to let you know when and where to get on and off.

We stayed at the Sheraton Tribeca for a work function. As a Starwoods member I was happy to stay at a Sheraton. I learned quickly that not all Sheratons are alike. My room key was demagnetized and I had to go back to the front desk after waiting forever for the elevator to go up in the first place. One I got into my room, it wasn't a double as I requested. they blamed it on my company and said I could move the next day. After a full day in a NYC heat wave I was able to switch rooms but before I could, I had to get my stuff packed up and go back to the front desk for the new keys. After waiting for the elevator for over 15 minutes(two were out) I decided to walk with my luggage up 8 flights to my new room. I was also told that I would have to switch rooms again due to my extended stay. The next day when I went to speak to the manager about staying in the same room for my final night I was met with sarcasm and rudeness. I was told that if I was to stay in the same room that I would be putting another guest out and that ""it would be on me"". It almost seemed like they hired a guy off the street to be a manager. OHHHHH...and then the room itself....I know it's NYC and unless you are staying at the Dream or the Ritz you aren't getting much, however, I would expect the water to drain from the shower and when you turn on the light there not to be an insane buzzing. The ONLY positive I can give this hotel is the bartender behind the bar. Would I stay here again....only if it's paid for and my company is making me.","San Diego, California",33,2.0

This last stay was better then ever. We had 6 or 7 rooms coming and going at different times and this hotel handled everyone perfectly...Their customer service from reservations to housekeeping to the ever helpful doorman was more like a 5 star hotel. Kudos to them all. We felt like we were welcomed ""home"" every day. The location of this hotel is right on Canal street. This is a strange street as it separates Soho from Tribeca. It is a major entry point to both ChinaTown and Little Italy as well. So from this hotel you are able to Easily walk to 4 major neighborhoods in NYC. This is impressive. Yes, Canal street is a little seedy, however this is easy to overlook as one block in any direction and you are standing in some of the most desirable real estate in Manhattan. This location is Flawless. You can connect to trains that take you Everywhere in Manhattan within a 5 minute walk. Location location location. Our rooms were smallish however had every amenity we could ask for. The Sheraton beds were divine and the pillows (all types) were plentiful. Toiletries were standard Sheraton issue Shine products. Shower was hot when needed and cold when not. Our room was always very clean and our housekeeper even left us a welcome note and a goodbye note. Nice touch. our view was towards the Brooklyn bridge and waking to the NYC panorama was fantastic. We had a connecting room and never heard anything through the door.We had Club level rooms. Please note that this club does not serve ""free alcohol"" but charges for this. They do however have an excellent breakfast spread with hot eggs and bacon as well as fresh raspberries and blueberries melons etc. For dinner time they had cheese, veggies two hot canapes of varying types and sodas and water complimentary. The draw to the lounge is the view. The lounge has a spectacular terrace looking north over NYC....unobstructed views to the empire state building and midtown....Wow. Couches and loungers and just sitting outside and taking it all in was an experience in itself. Someone was very smart in setting this gorgeous space aside. I normally stay at a higher end hotel....W's or Westins etc. This time around I was Very pleasantly surprised by this property. If it has one drawback, it is the smallish rooms. However the positives so outweigh the negative that for us, that was a non issue. This hotel was a great value hotel with a perfect location and friendly responsive service. We could not have asked for more. Is it the W Union Square? No, but it was 1/2 the price and was impressive in it's own right.

It is a flat rate of $50, including tip, whereas a cab can cost upwards of $60 with traffic (which there is quite a lot of).The location is quite central, and had TONS of awesome little unknown places to eat and shop (which was perfect for us because we wanted to do things that native New Yorkers do), but if you don't want to do lots of walking and don't mind paying more, stay at the Sheraton in Times Square.

My one complaint was that the wi-fi in the room was poor. Upon check-in, they offered to waive the $9.99/night fee which was understandable since: (1) in my opinion, in 2013, hotels should not charge for wi-fi; and, (2) the weak signal in the room was constantly dropping.

Rooms are typical 'travelling businessman' fare. There is a bar (with a very friendly barman), but it is large, open, uninviting. The staff were very friendly, and if you want to be able to walk into SoHo, this is a good spot. However, getting taxis is a nightmare (despite the valiant efforts of the door staff), although the Metro is only 5 minutes walk. The big plus is that if you are flying from Newark (particularly in the morning), this is a great place to stay, as it is very close to the tunnel - New York traffic can be brutal at that time of the morning, and getting from Times Square area, for example can be hell!).

This is going to be a long review so I apologize in advance. My husband and I are Gold Starwood members. We choose to stay at only Starwood properties all over the world because we love Starwood's member services and have always had great experiences at every Starwood property we've stayed at... until now. Please keep that in mind as you are reading my review. My husband is in the sports business. We had planned a media tour with some of our athletes and had most of our appointments in the TriBeCa area. We usually stay at the Sheraton Time Square but because of our back to back appointments near SoHo, we went online and booked 5 rooms at the TriBeCa Sheraton. In full disclosure, we booked rooms that were non-cancellable - Big mistake, I get that.Four days before our scheduled trip, our itinerary did a full 180. Due to this drastic change, 2 of our players were no longer scheduled to come and 90% our meetings were rescheduled in Midtown. The second we found out, we contacted this hotel immediately and asked if there was anything we could do to transfer to a different property or to even receive credit for future travel.One of our staff members called and spoke to a manager named Cornelio, who said they would have to get back to us. This was on a Thursday. (We were arriving late Sunday evening). After a couple of emails, there was no real response, so I decided to call myself on Friday to see if I could expedite our process of getting answers. Spoke to the night supervisor Maria (whom I have to say was the only person during this whole ordeal who took our concerns seriously) and told her about our situation. She told me that Cornelio was off for the weekend and would have to get back to me. Mind you, we were arriving Sunday night and didn't know which hotel we would have to stay at. As someone who came from management in the service industry, you don't take a day off. You may not physically be at work, but you should always be a phone call away for any emergency situations that arises. STRIKE 1.After several phone calls with Maria, she was finally able to get ahold of Cornelio and told me that a decision couldn't be made until Monday when that hotel manager was in. At this point, we had no choice but to stay in TriBeCa and commute back and forth from Midtown to attend our meetings. I asked Maria about canceling just the two rooms then and getting credit to future travel, but she told me again that it was up to manager. When I expressed my frustration in the lack of follow up, she understood and wished that she could help me more. I told her that this was a very special circumstance and I wasn't asking for money back if it couldn't be done, I just wanted credit. STRIKE 2When we arrived at the hotel, the hotel staff informed us that we had been upgraded to one of the nicest rooms in the hotel. It was a pleasant surprise. Thankful, we went up to our room and was blown away by how small it was and how run down it looked. I was so surprised by how a Starwood hotel could look like this. You could literally walk maybe 10 steps from one side of the room to the door. The bathroom (which reeked of mildew, mind you) wasn't even big enough to fit two people standing side by side at the same time and in order to use the restroom, you had to step aside to close the door. It was awful. I can not even imagine how terrible the room our Olympian stayed in was. I was utterly embarrassed. STRIKE 3On Monday, after a full day of meetings, I finally got back to the hotel and asked to speak to Cornelio, who I thought was going to have an answer for me on the credit. He basically told me that he couldn't get back to me because the hotel manager had to give the approval. SERIOUSLY?! To me, when someone says they need to get approval, that means under special circumstances, it's possible. Don't you? When I told Cornelio that we would have checking out the next day to fly to our next destination and wanted to speak directly to the hotel manager, he mysteriously was in 'meetings' all day and said he would have to ""call me back"". Needless to say, I didn't receive a phone call that day and didn't hear back until we were mid air to our next stop. He left a message basically saying he was out of the office that afternoon and was unwilling to issue any credit but when (yeah, sure) we stayed there again, he would try to ""assist in offsetting some of the cost"". STRIKE 4.To top this all off, we requested late checkout (2pm) because we had more meetings in midtown in the AM and wouldn't be able to get back in time. At first they told us they would have to CHARGE us for late check out. As if they didn't already charge us enough! After talking with yet another manager and finding out we were gold members, they finally allowed us to late check out 2 or our 3 rooms. STRIKE 5We will never stay there again. Not only because of the lack of attention received by management, but also because the rooms were small and unkept and the bathrooms smelled like mildew. In all fairness, they are located in a good location, but I would rather stay farther away than ever go back to this property. $1300 lesson learned.","Newport Beach, CA",1,1.0

Four Points is a step lower on the Starwood portfolio (simpler but ""high value"") but checking into this Sheraton I really saw little difference between the two brands. This is a relatively new property but with little character - cookie cutter, out of the box, bland hotel. I have no idea what the Sheraton brand is all about in the US. They are premium in Asia but so hit and miss average in the US. Shocking. They also charge for internet here where Four Points doesn't. Ya, ya, so what about this hotel .... what can I say? It's pretty average. It's a clean room in a rather ratty location but the staff is nice and it's decent. So, if you get a good price, why not?Despite checking in with my gold card, I still got the worst room located just outside the elevator. In fact, I could reach the elevator button standing in the room. Good luck to try to get some sleep. Room was small and simple. No umbrella in the closet, basic amenities. Take a look at my uploaded picture - what's missing? What kind of maintenance do we have here?!I used the fitness room twice and it's a bit of a joke but not the worst that I have seen. Some lonely dumb bells but limited room to use them. Some pretty soak sweat cardio machines. Towels ran out, I called for more, after a one hour work out, they still didn't arrive.

I paid $136 for the room including tax on Priceline. We arrived at the hotel at 7am and parked on the street right across from the hotel. Free parking was great! Our plan was to park and then catch the subway to Time Square so we could take a tour, but we decided to stop by the hotel and just see if they would let us check in. I never expected they would actually say yes because it was 7am but they did which I thought was GREAT! I had emailed the hotel ahead of time to let them know it was our anniversary and they upgraded our room to a room higher up at no charge which was nice and not at all asked for since I was planning on paying the extra fee. We stayed in room 1216, which did not have the best view. The room was small but that’s New York people I’ve seen smaller. We toured around much of the day and returned to the hotel. When we got back there was a cheese and cracker plate waiting for us to thank us for staying. We got a great recommendation for a place to eat from the front desk. When we returned we realized one of our keys wasn't working so we stopped by the front desk to have it remade, they then offered us club access due to it being our anniversary, which included free breakfast. This to me was above and beyond! We planned to go the club lounge to sit but we ended up staying at the hotel bar. The only complaint I had about that was that the man behind the bar had his friends visiting him while he worked and when he poured me the wrong drink he then gave it to a women sitting down the bar and said ""drink this"". He was clearly in a hurry to get out of there because he did a last call early and began shutting everything down and cleaning around us. We asked him if he was in a hurry and he said he wanted to go out for his friend’s birthday, and pointed to a guy at the end of the bar, and said he could leave even if we were still sitting there. I found this to be rude, I understood it was a Sunday night, but it was definitely not consistent with the service in the rest of the hotel. We went up to the club level to see the view that night and WOW! The Empire State Building was all lit up it was beautiful. Cut to the next morning. I was woken up in the morning by loud people in the hallways, and they didn’t stop. You can clearly hear people in the hallway in the rooms. Again this did not ruin my stay, the rooms are close together and it’s not the hotels fault other guests are inconsiderate. We went to breakfast on the Club Level, and it was great, warm and cold options, bacon, potatoes, eggs, cereal, juices, fresh fruit, and the list went on. Check out was a breeze. I would recommend staying at this hotel to anyone the location, price, and service were better than I expected! My only complaints were the bartender and the hallway noise. So bring earplugs and go to a bar elsewhere. If you are staying for a special event let them know they will make your stay memorable.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",33,4.0

But the rooms are well-designed so you don't feel (too) cramped.- Some rooms have water views. - There's a small lobby with a Starbucks and some lounge spaces.- You can hear traffic noise very slightly. With its double-paned windows, the honking below is muffled.Resources close-by:- Soho Pharmacy is around the corner.- Deli next door stocks beer, wine, ice cream, etc.- A couple of coffee houses within a block.","San Francisco, California",16,4.0

Location is close to SoHo and Chinatown. We arrived by car late Friday night and was lucky to find street parking that's good for the entire weekend. Since it is close to Holland Tunnel, traffic can be quite congested at times. The hotel itself is quite nice as you would expect a Sheraton to be. Front desk receptions were all very pleasant. Check-in was quick and we were offered $5 credit if we don't use maid service the next day. We took the offer and put the $5 to good use the next day at the lobby's convenient store for Starbucks coffee and muffin. Our room on the second floor (room 212) is a bit small and the bathroom is extremely small but everything is nice and functioning well. We had a view of the building airconditioning system. Luckily it was a mild weekend; I wonder if it gets noisy in the summer. Not sure if the room size is the norm since we got quite a deal from priceline. Perhaps, rooms with regular rates would be larger. We would stay here again if we get another good deal from priceline.","West New York, New Jersey",90,4.0

They even acknowledged the special occasion for our visit..my brother's graduation from NYU with his PH. D. (had to add that because I am so proud).They didn't explain clearly the use of the room card in the elevator for every trip and there was sometimes an inordinate wait for the elevators. Appreciated the security system though. Front desk and concierge were phenomenal. They acknowledged us, wished us a good day and were generally engaged. How refreshing to not be treated like an intruder. The lounge on the 21st floor had a breathtaking view of the Hudson River, as did our room (1812) and well within walking distance. Breakfast was the usual eggs, bacon/sausages, hash brown potatoes, bagels, croissants, cereals, yogurt, juice and coffee. The happy hour treats (from 5-8 p.m.) were exceptional.The room was average (really the first time I have stayed in a hotel in NYC) but I understand it was roomy by New York standards.Loved the location. Close to the NQR and 123 lines... close to Chinatown and 1 or 2 blocks from Broadway and Canal. Lots of good shopping and people watch.Close by was a decent burger joint (Black Burger) and of course all the great places in Chinatown.Highly recommend booking a shuttle from the airport (LGA) as the cab fare was a bit more than we anticipated due to traffic conditions. Our driver was very concerned about the fare and suggested we get out and walk (3 blocks) instead of sitting in rush hour traffic and racking up an even higher fare.Also recommend a visit to the African Burial Ground operated by the National Parks Service. The Ranger on site (Chris) happy to share his knowledge and the history of the site. Didn't quite make it to the actual museum but be prepared for security checks as its located in a Federal Government building.A visit to the 911 memorial is also suggested. Get passes beforehand at 20 Vesey which gives a time to enter and be prepared to walk around in circles, go through security and finally see the grounds. Can also reserve online with a $2 fee. The infinity pool is a wonder. Can't wait until the museum opens. Always love going to New York, it is a world within a city.","Toronto, Canada",54,4.0

They charged me around US$1307 from my bank account and initially denied that they had done so.

I am appalled at some of the choices they've made here given that it is marketed and priced like a ""full service"" Sheraton (versus a stripped down ""value"" choice). We like the Canal St location -- it works for us as close to transportation, Soho and the financial district. The lobby is a bit nicer and more comfortable than most of the value-line hotel lobbies. My biggest gripes are the super-thin plastic cups (exactly 2 are supplied), only two paper coffee cups and only two bath towels provided and the loudest bathroom fan ever (that comes on with the light). Not a single real glass provided in the room, and they can't even give 3 or 4 of the thin plastic cups (eg. 2 in the bathroom & 2 with the ice bucket)? Just 2 small bath towels? The rooms are typical small NY rooms but instead of maximizing surface space with rectangular desk and a square night table, they put in an oval desk and round night table. The bathroom has a nice stall shower (albeit with super boring and cheap looking matte beige tile) but the vanity surface again could have been a bit larger & rectangular to compensate for smallness. Sheraton is a brand that I think of as about on par with Hilton, in some cities abroad they are a very deluxe choice. I normally stay at one of three Hilton's near Herald Square/Chelsea when in Manhattan, two of which are Hilton Garden Inns. The HGI's are so much better than the set up here, not only can they see fit to provide real glasses but you also get a minifridge and microwave, and real cable channels including NY1. The Hilton on W.26th St is more upmarket so you get a mini-vending-bar rather than a fridge, but you also get real glasses, great bed linens, plenty of towels and good prices.","Washington, DC",96,3.0

This was a very enjoyable experience, and I can definitely say that I hope to return to this hotel on future visits to NYC.

My rate was very competitive with similar properties in this part of Manhattan, south of Houston St. It included in-room internet at no extra charge, plus the daily breakfast buffet at their restaurant off the lobby. I requested and was assigned a guest room with a clear (big-window) view to the north of the Midtown skyline.Both check-in and check-out were a breeze, and I arrived a few hours early on my first day (a Saturday morning), and they were able to check me into a room right away. My guest room was clean, modern, well-appointed and nicely decorated. Everything worked very well, including the climate control. The room was actually slightly larger than I am accustomed to for NYC, and that included the bathroom, which was modern and plenty large enough for me. The king-size bed was super comfortable, and the desk was set up perfectly for internet access and my laptop. I could have used a couple of more electrical outlets in the room to plug in all my gadgets, but I did what I needed to do by just not plugging all things in simultaneously.There was plenty of hot water for my showers, and I took them at different times of the day. My room was quiet for sleeping; I was on the 14th floor, overlooking Canal St. The floors each have ice machines and beverage vending machines. The breakfast buffet was good, although not outstanding. I got plenty to eat each morning and was satisfied with the variety. The restaurant is not large, so a big group traveling together might be a little cramped in there, but as a solo traveler, I was comfortable. They have a nice sitting area in the lobby, with a bar and a grab-and-go snack venue, which is open throughout the day. The fitness center is one floor up.I found the hotel staff to be friendly and professional. Most are young; all seem very hardworking. The bell staff can give you directions to anywhere in the city, and a front-desk team member helped me choose a nice restaurant within a close walking distance in Tribeca for my final evening there. She made the reservation for me. Wi-fi is available in the hotel lobby and sitting area.This part of NYC abounds with restaurants, bars and shopping, and the Sheraton Tribeca is situated at a good access point for the exciting surrounding neighborhoods. A short walk, and you have easy access to a great variety of eating, drinking and shopping venues. It is a short walk to Chinatown and Little Italy to the east, and Soho is directly north of the hotel. Greenwich Village is only a few blocks' walk, and Tribeca is immediately to your south.The subway system's Canal Street station entrance is literally just around the corner from the hotel. I bought a refillable Metro card at the beginning of my stay and never needed a taxi. That includes from JFK airport into the city. I traveled by train from JFK to the hotel and back on this trip. Take the JFK Sky Train to the Howard Beach station, where you can get your Metro card and then access the A line train for a ride that had me at Canal Street station in less than 45 minutes.The city has done a lot to remove old obstacles in the stations to bringing along reasonably sized luggage. Old narrow turnstiles have been replaced by wider pedestrian gates through which you can pull your luggage, assuming it is not over sized and you keep moving. However, you still have to go up stairs to get back to ground level at many of the stations, so keep this in mind when deciding whether to go into the city by taxi or train. Anyway, the train is a viable option to consider if you want to save taxi fare to the Sheraton Tribeca, and if you have compact luggage, and are reasonably fit. This hotel does also have Canal Street curb front taxi access, and the bell staff can assist you, of course.Overall, I enjoyed the modern, progressive, well-located and well-connected feeling I had during my stay in this hotel. I hope to return to the Sheraton Tribeca the next time I am in or near lower Manhattan.","Singapore, Singapore",131,4.0

Not much to it. There was a small corner window with a modest view of the city. My biggest complaint with the room was the bathroom.

One hint: If you are traveling uptown via cab from the hotel during the day, cross the street to catch a cab. There is a nasty intersection to the east of the hotel, traffic moves slowly and it is hard to make a left hand turn to go uptown so you will burn meter time just sitting.

This hotel is more like a Westin: modern design and features and a very comfortable bed! The location is great on the edge of Soho - easy to get a cab anywhere and within walking distance to some of the best shopping on the planet. The hotel lobby is compact but functional with a bar, work areas and thankfully, a Starbucks. My studio room was well appointed with a table for four and king bed and large desk. Met my key other criteria as well: lots of electrical outlets conveniently located, good shower as well as a large amount of counter space in the bathroom. I was on the club level - the breakfast in the club room was excellent - looks like there is a rooftop patio to enjoy in the warmer months. Very clean and well maintained property - I will be back!

So they get 5 stars! However, for the value, the hotel cannot completely deliver. The Club Room is not always perfectly clean and the furniture is worn and outdated. The rooms are fine, but for example when the bathroom fanlight is on the noise is deafening. The halls are super, super bright so it can be tough to sleep at night without eye shades. And the lobby is very low end Sheraton. If you drop the price by about $75 bucks a night then you have an amazing value and I would rate it higher.

Typically I stay at the Trump but this was for a special work function. The location is actually not bad, it's just not on a picturesque street. Chinatown is a few blocks east and Soho is right across the street. This is sort of a dead zone between neighborhoods.Rooms are small with no mini fridge or additional amenities beyond soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The lifts are very slow; there are only three. Lobby is light and spacious and the staff is very nice and helpful.Now, here's the part that I think is very important. I became seriously ill the first night that I stayed at the Sheraton. I later learned that I had contracted Norovirus before my trip. I was so desperate that I called the front desk at 3 AM and asked if they could connect me with a doctor in the morning. They found a doctor to speak with me immediately and he advised me on what I could do in the meantime. I mean, it was literally the middle of the night and my only option at that point was to go to the emergency room. The doctor suggested I get the Sheraton staff to help - I called downstairs and James, who had connected me with the doctor, went out and fetched me a couple of items from the deli that the doctor recommended. He also asked if I wanted to be taken to the hospital. I declined and he came up and dropped off my things which did help get me through the night. In the morning, I visited a walk-in doctor who the front desk also recommended. I ended up cutting my trip short and flying home. My point is - they took care of me, specifically James. I was in serious pain and agony and I know the Sheraton staff would have brought me to the hospital if that's what I had decided. Huge props to James - consider Sheraton Tribeca your home away from home.","New York, NY",56,4.0

The lobby was amazing, definitely one of the standout amenities of the hotel since the room left much to be desired. In the lobby, there's a free internet lounge and a restaurant (we used neither service).The room itself can be described best in one word: SMALL. For the price, this was one of the tiniest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. I've stayed in several hotels in NYC and particularly the SOHO area, and the room size undoubtedly failed to measure up to others. I would say that the room was really clean, had a large tv, and large windows, which let lots of sunlight in. Also, this room had a rather large, ""chic/hip"" bathroom, although, I would give a few square feet of the bathroom to in order to allow me to walk freely in the main sleeping quarters. I had a large king-sized bed, and it nearly took up the entire room.As others have noted, there is $10 fee to use the hotel's internet service inside the room...this struck me as very odd considering the price.Overall, this was a nice hotel, although, I probably would not stay here again considering that I've had bigger, better and cheaper hotel stays in the same area.

The Room: so tiny. Facilities are all of pretentious timber and shoddy quality. Bed linens are hard. Shampoos and bath gel are among the worst supplies of their kinds. Shower area is spacious for 1 medium-sized adult only. The commode is so tiny and uncomfortable. Before turning you back in the bathroom, exercise caution so that you do not knock your elbow onto the wall. The View: stayed in a higher-view room. The promised view was offered, but not so impressive at all. New York, as a city, does not live up to its reputation at all when observed in reality. This city only appears beautiful on pictures. Forget the SOHO area (which is just opposite this hotel. Oooh, you will understand what a shabby neighborhood the real SOHO is. Don’t buy the hypes about it on travel magazines. Pretentious, hollow, themeless are the very adjectives for the real SOHO). The Services: almost non-existent. Made a phone call for some fork, but waited almost an hour to receive nothing but a rhetorical question “Did you ever request that?” on my following-up call for enquiry. Sheraton: train you staff twice, please. The Staff: 75% of them are impolite. Talking to each other all the time. Giggling foolishly in front of checking-in guests for no reason. Making exaggerated gestures by hand in the air during nightly shifts (some brown-skinned lady in an ill-fitting suit). The Lobby: just crammed and disagreeable. The Internet Surfing Area suffers heavy draughts all the time from the door, which is opened from time to time because of the human traffic flowing in and out. At a winter night, it is a suffering to be sitting over there to check emails online.

We wanted to stay somewhere different in the city so we choose tribeca/soho area. We love this part of town being walking distance from the trade center, soho shopping and restaurants it was great. The A,C,E trains were a block away, the 1 train was maybe 2 blocks. That made it easy to head midtown to Penn Station and go to MSG. The only problem I had was the first night we were there we had gone to the hotel bar late after the Georgetown game on Friday. The bartender was the worst. We asked him if they were serving food still, he turned and told us the kitchen was closed and walked away. A few minutes later he's putting pretzels and peanuts in front of some other people. Where the hell was our pretzels, I wasn't asking if the kitchen was open because I was curious. I had to pretty much throw my empty glass at him for him to get the clue that I'd like another. Needless to say, no tip for the amateur.Besides the bartender, the rest of the hotel was nice. The rooms were small but the bathrooms were really nice, great showers. Cleanliness was great and the beds were pretty good too. Kitchen closes at 11 p so if you want something to eat, you need to go elsewhere. Price was typical of a clean modern New York hotel. Parking is an issue, there is none. We took the Metro North train in so we didn't have to bring the car. There is paid parking everywhere and the hotel does offer valet for $50 a day but if you show up during the day on a weekday forget trying to park the thing. Canal street is a little busy.

Was generally disappointed with the stay... nothing bad about the place, per se... just nothing special, either. It's decidedly ""eh"" in just about every aspect.Price we paid was quite high, though its NYC. For $300+/night I'd expect better.Check in was fast and painless. Desk staff, though not overly friendly, were helpful enough by NY standards. Doormen were helpful in finding taxis, though I thought it was interesting that they were always quite quick to push us towards using a private car, which was almost always parked nearby... I'd have to think they have a ""relationship"" with the drivers of the private cars.Room's tiny. Only hotel room I've ever stayed in that was smaller was in Hong Kong. It was pretty much walk in, trip into bed. Barely room for much else. I barely spent any ""down time"" in the room, because it was so tiny it was either lay in bed, or don't be there, realistically.Club lounge is a joke. Not sure if it's domestic and/or Sheraton, as I've spent lots of time in Marriott lounges, but it was tiny, and the appetizer offerings were essentially a small plate of cheese and some crackers. Beer, wine, cocktails were all charged for, not complimentary, as in other lounges I've been to. It does have a nice view, though.Downstairs lounge is okay - a ""business center"" (more like a internet cafe in the lobby). Have to be a registered guest to use internet at $9.99/day. Lounge itself is kinda open and jammed right off of the lobby, meaning its bright, loud, and not great for unwinding with friends or colleagues at the end of the day. Bar staff are effective, though not remotely friendly or engaging.Hotel doesn't have 24 hour room service. When returning late one night from meetings and asking for a menu, I was told I could walk down the street and get something on W. Broadway.But its the little things that make or break a hotel. Over a 4 day, 3 night stay, the hotel didn't once replenish my bathroom amenities. A little bar of soap only goes so far, and so by the morning of my last day, I was squeaking by on a tiny sliver of soap, wondering what I'd done to make the cleaning staff mad at me.In short, I'll be staying elsewhere next trip, and will probably reconsider staying at Sheratons again...","Atlanta, Georgia",75,3.0

In fact the Four Points properties in the city ( the Chelsea property comes to mind) have far more character: better bar, more engaged staff and a bit less of a suburban industrial park vibe.If you stay at the Tribeca, you'll get decent value for NYC but not much more than a functional place to put your head down.My stay is already vanishing from memory.","London, United Kingdom",33,3.0

I was assured that I was getting the best room on hand...that basic (!) room just happened to be on the 9th floor, no view and exactly across from the elevators!

I enquired about a room away from the elevators and was made to to wait another 30 mins. (!) ,without as much as a complimentary drink or apology. I got another basic room, no. 1514. I checked on the net and saw that at least the patio rooms were available, but not offered! At that point I was upset enough to decide that this property would be added to my NYC-SPG blacklist! There was absolutely no reason for me to reconsider this hotel, save Corey the concierge and the lady that checked me out yesterday morning and seemed to care whether I had a good stay or not! To add on to this my wife realised that she had left her flat iron in the room, that had still not been given to lost and found.

James reported there being no rooms available, refused to let us use the bathroom until we begged, offered a room at a ridiculously inflated rate 20 minutes later as we pondered our misfortune, rescinded that offer when we refused that rate, and then instructed his staff to stop looking on the computer for alternative lodging options.

Greenwich Village, China Town, Little Italy and all the SoHo boutiques all within walking distance. Perfect access to subways right on Canal with an easy ride to the Flatiron District.

Canal Tube Street is only one block away.They also provided a comparative group hotel deal for my Class that provided us with a convenient location, discounted restaurant, free wifi and gym access throughout our stay. Late bookings and transfers were kindly provided by Nicole and her team for fellow classmates. Quiet Rooms were provided away from noisy elevators and close to our class colleagues for late night study sessions. Their security service is excellent and the team received a number of international packages for my work and provided safe delivery to my room. A convenient location for client meetings against an intensive study schedule and a friendly and warm front desk and concierge service greeting you throughout the day and providing necessary directions and recommendations for local restaurants, entertainment and shopping districts. Grub hub provides secure delivery of a wide variety of local restaurants to your hotel room. The in room dining experience is average but Starbucks certainly makes up for that in terms of quick bites and decent coffee from 6.30 am-8pm.The only downsides are that late night services can be very slow.

The location is perfect as it is away from the noise of the big city. To get into the middle of the lights & noise is only a $10 cab or a train trip with the subway just around the corner from the hotel.Customer service was very good in all areas. Upon check in we were provided a complimentary upgrade to a club room on the top floor of the hotel. The front of house staff were very accommodating in looking after the needs of their guests. I will put this down to the ""tipping factor"". We did tip when we believed we were looked after very well. In turn the service was exceptional and the front of house staff were happy to stop and say g'day to us when we went in and out.I'm sorry, if people review rooms and say it is spacious. We had a club room and to have room for the luggage and to walk around the bed, we had to leave clothes in suitcases to get by. Hate to think what size their standard rooms are. I won't call it a negative, but just bear in mind it is just a room to sleep in and to get you out and visit the city, which we did.Ask for an upgrade to a club room but you work out if it will be value for money. The views from the top floor were awesome early morning and late at night. You have access to the club lounge which provides complimentary coffee, light snacks and non alcoholic drinks. You will be paying for your alcoholic drinks. I'm no alcoholic, but I believe that if you are paying for club privileges, you should be provided the courtesy of a complimentary alcoholic beverage or two seeing as you are going to pay a higher room rate. Room size is also not great for a club room. I will say the complimentary in room wifi and complimentary breakfast went a long way in making our stay in New York awesome.For a city like New York, the price we paid for our stay during maybe the busiest time of the year, we did get value for money.

During my walk from the Canal Street subway station to the hotel (approx 5 minutes dragging a large suitcase) I lost count of the number of times I was approached with the word ""Rolex?""

I was quite disappointed with the toiletry haul - only shampoo, conditioner, moisturiser and soap. No sewing kit or bonnet de douche as Del Boy might say. After all, a girl can never have too many shoe sponges.The room I was in (210) was fairly noisy, being positioned next to the lift, and from the sounds of it, directly above the set of Jumanji. The jungle drum noises I heard between 8 and 9pm were either over enthusiastic workmen, or a couple with a lot of stamina - if that's the case then sir, I salute you. Between 9pm and 2am I was treated to the sound of the lift doors opening and closing sporadically and several conversations held in loud American voices. A special thanks to the man who thought 1.30am was an appropriate time to have a chat with his mates directly outside my door. His review may mention the wild haired harridan who threw open the door demanding he keep his voice down. Quick note to new couples on a romantic getaway - the double door to the bathroom has a large gap in it which could let unwanted smells and sounds filter through - not ideal on a first minibreak together. Also there was no bath in my room which was slightly disappointing, having been washed onto some coral the week before in the Caribbean I was hoping to soak my wounds. However, overall the hotel was nice, the staff were helpful, room service was good although I made the mistake in my post US Immigration shell shock of tipping twice on room service as I didn't check whether tip was already included.","Blakesley, United Kingdom",100,3.0

The back story: We checked in on Friday night, Dec. 21st about 10pm coming in from Chicago. We are Starwood people and are here to see some family in Manhattan (See the tree and the windows, etc) and then we head upstate to see the rest of the family. We had a 2 night stay.We decided what we would do was get a regular room on points and the next night, upgrade to a Jr. Suite at our expense. James saw us coming in with 3 pieces of luggage (full of gifts!) and all I can say was he was very pleasant. He noticed that we had a smaller room 1 night and a little larger the second. He said 'Let me see what I can do about not having to move you guys at all.'He informed us that there was a Jr Suite available but on the 3rd floor...that just means no view. We gladly took it because he was honest and said 'you guys, with all your luggage, will find the regular room to be too small so lets get you in the suite'. I'm not in touch with this small room thing or what the difference with floor levels but he explained that you start to get a view of the skyline past floor 14. He said to go check it out and if we liked the third floor room, we can stay both nights but if we wanted a view, he would do whatever he could to get us higher than the 14th floor. We went in the room, unpacked a few things and then headed back down. For me, the room was fine, no view of anything but good enough. We were having a glass of wine at the bar and James came and asked what we thought. My wife, being the New Yorker wanted to try to move the next day and go for the view. James said he would see what he could do. The next morning we went for a walk and came back and talked to the front desk. Here is where it pays off to be as polite and respectful to the staff (TIP: lack of manners gets you a big fat ZERO in the hotel business!) He had ALREADY blocked us a room on the 19th floor that he knew a Starwood Platinum member was in and leaving that day. Already had our name on the room and notes in the computer. The guy was off work but had gone to the trouble to make sure we were taken care of with notes for his fellow coworkers at the front desk so they could follow his wishes. We had a great room with a great view and that makes for the start of a great trip.What I can tell you about the staff, the hotel, the location and the neighborhood.....Staff: Covered most of it but from the bellmen, doormen, bartenders and even the guy who came to our room and removed a bottle of wine that was in our new room (wasn't for us and boy did he feel bad for taking it back!) they were all EXCELENT!!! Hotel: Lovely, newer, clean, comfortable. Rooms a little on the small side but if you stay in NY hotels, you know what you're getting. But the BED....fugetaboutit! It is the best bed I've been in for a long time. Location: Tribeca is tough with the Holland Tunnel right there, Canal street isn't the prettiest part of town but you are just a short walk to the best I think NY has to offer, SOHO. And you try to stay in the dump hotels in SOHO!! Stay here and make the walk or take the cab. You wont be sorry if you stay here.In conclusion, all I really wanted to do was recognize James Wong. He probably doesn't even realize that he went above and beyond, it's probably second nature to him. He deserves to be looked at by management, if not so already, as a leader and mentor to others.

The staff are really good and helpful. The situation is really convenient for access to everywhere and is much more interesting than uptown NY. I chose the hotel in particular because of the ease of access from Manhattan to The Prudential Centre in New Jersey, some nine miles and the need for a very early return to JFK the following morning. The purpose of the visit was to see the Rolling Stones in USA after having seen them twice in London. The plan, to make everything run like clockwork. It depended on my collection from The Prudential Centre and return to the hotel before leaving at 5.00 p.m. to get to JFK. Thus I rented a town car with driver to take me to the venue. Pick up agreed 5.30 p.m. The car did not show. Despite continual checking throughout the day all was on schedule. The company had no drivers, the concierge could not get a replacement and it was all beginning to go pear shaped. I had travelled over 3,000 miles booked an expensive hotel, car and driver. The only piece left in the puzzle is the last nine miles.. Eventually some cab drive that was illiterate took me, no idea where the venue is just arrived. Shabby car and a driving license he must have got form a Christmas cracker. I reluctantly got in the car after express confirmation from the concierge the driver would get me there and he did. He got lost, took over one hour to cover 9 miles did more u turns than any living or dead politician.The Rolling Stones were great, best ever show, I been to a few and I took a call for my return driver who had been dispatched by the hotel to pick me up and I arrived back safely. I spoke with the duty manager Mr. James Wong, a most courteous and polite gentleman. He was horrified, immediately agreed to pay me back the $100.00 for the outward-bound trip and pay the return on the house.It went from very bad to better all because one man got his act together and sorted it our and I am most grateful to him. He then bought me a beer on the house. Travellers note the concierge service in these hotels is often out sourced and the doormen run the management of matters like cars etc. Be aware as they are all on kickbacks and totally unreliable when something goes wrong.My few hours’ sleep was excellent, albeit asked for an alarm call it did not happen thankfully my iPhone did the job well.","Windsor, United Kingdom",36,4.0

Once you walk outside, to the left is Broadway and the Meat Packing district, to the immediate north is a better shopping district than 5th ave, and to the right is China Town with its top notch, albeit underrated restaurants. The rooms are fairly average hotel rooms and the lobby is cute but sparse except for the over priced and out of place snack stand that is only open during prime hours. The downside, for me, were the smaller things that probably wont affect most vacationers but for me were an absolute deal-breaker. having to carry my room key with me everywhere i went in order to access the elevators, the gym, and even the doors at night is a little bit like having to carry a 'hall-way pass' in middle school. Even in middle of the afternoon you cannot access the elevators without your room key. Its juvenile. The staff is helpful, but a little too helpful for my taste. I dont like insinuating questions like ""can i help you?"" when i am milling about the lobby waiting on friends. My thinking is that if I needed help I would've asked for it.

The room was clean and neat with a modern bathroom. The king size bed was comfortable and we even had a very nice view (of Canal St) out of our 11th floor window. I did't get to use the fitness room, however, I was impressed with the number of machines. The staff was very friendly and attentive in the lobby, giving the feeling of a neighborhood hotel. The only complaint I have is the the shower door tended to leak water on the floor. Overall, this hotel is a good stay in the Tribeca area of NYC>","Evanston, Illinois",52,4.0

I stayed here for 7 nights, for a business (and a some pleasure) trip at the end of November 2012. Where the hotel is situated is ideal for great walks, bus rides or subway journeys to all that New York has to offer. It is ideal for Chinatown, Soho, Little Italy and the Financial district. It's very close to Broadway, which is perfect for shopping, and central for most of the major routes on the subway (although I am still trying to figure out the subway system)!The hotel itself is clean and very presentable. Upon arrival the foyer is bright and warm, and check-in was quick and easy. There is a bar, Starbucks, restaurant and media centre all located on this entry level, as well as bell service and information. There were maps and leaflets available in the entrance-way to give some great ideas of where to visit.The elevators to the floors were a bit of a pain, I normally use elevator journeys as time to try to find my room key in the midst of my bottomless bag, however you need to have your key to use in the elevator to actually get to your floor... and sometimes the keys were temperamental to say the least! Often having to ask strangers to use their key to press your floor button!The rooms were small but perfectly formed. Absolutely nothing wrong with them at all, and if you have ever stayed in a Yotel (there is one on 10th Ave) then you will know that these rooms are huge in comparison to some others that are out there!The bed was comfy, there were plenty of lights, the furniture wasn't battered and beaten, a nice comfy chair and a desk chair (but this tended to be used as a clothes holder!) It had a safe, a hairdryer, flat screen TV and a coffee maker (with Starbucks coffee).The bathroom was ideal, with a lovely walk in shower, and plenty of light to do your hair and make-up. The only drawback with my bathroom was that the fan was very noisy, however it worked wonderfully well and even after a hot shower the bathroom was not misted up at all! So I lived with the noise of the fan - it's not like it is on constantly.The view from my room (14th floor) was pretty boring overlooking the brick building opposite and looking down onto W Broadway junction, and I don't think you would ever really stay here for the views. The street noise can be loud at times, and of course this is New York - there are police and fire sirens all day and night! By the way - the same can be said of your hotel room neighbours, they too can be noisy...and it is easy to hear what is going on in the corridors, and the doors do tend to slam pretty easily. I found that hotel to be ideal for my purposes, I found staff to be very friendly an accommodating, the rooms were spotlessly clean, the bed was comfy and it had what I needed (OK so I had to pay $9.99 per day for wifi - bit of a pet peeve of mine) and all in all I found it to be a pleasant stay and I would return here again.","Durham, United Kingdom",144,4.0

There are bellhops at the front door who can assist you with baggage and flagging down taxis. The front desk clerk gave us an enhanced room with a view on the 15th floor because they were out of double beds that I requested.

The HD Flat screen television had real HD programming to watch. Multiple outlets throughout the room for phones, laptops etc. And a grand window view of Canal Street and Chinatown!! It all made for a super night in Manhattan. I have to say again that Sheraton has the best beds in the industry for deep sleeps.We walked east of the Hotel to Chinatown for some late night Asian food. And we strolled through Little Italy on Mulberry to see all the white linen tables waiting for customers. The entire area was flooded by Hurricane Sandy but we could see no sign of the disaster during our stay.Before retiring for the night I used the free business center downstairs to print my flight itinerary.

If you have been here before, then you will have some ideas on what to do and where to stay. The most important thing to ask yourself would be, what do I want to do?, where do I want to eat?, etc. I live on Long Island and come into NYC all the time. The Sheraton Tribeca is in an ideal location. if you are driving in, the hotel staff will park your car overnight for you. All you have to do is pull up in front of hotel. Yes they charge a fee, but what parking garage in New York doesn't? You will be so close to the subway (across the street) you can go anywhere. To top it off Little Italy and China Town are within a hop, skip and jump away. I love to eat at DaNico and DeGennaro and go shopping at Step Up Boutique on Mulberry Street. The hotel staff is great and the place is immaculate. They have a nice sit down area for free WiFi, bar, cafe and a small deli like stop for coffee and take out breakfast etc. And if your an AMERICAN EXPRESS STARWOOD member then check it out for cash & points. There is no better time to come to NYC then during the holiday season. Everything is in full swing with lights and decorations. Plan ahead and you will have a great time. There is also the Discount Ticket Booth at Times Square. Don't let the long lines fool you as they move quickly. 50% to 60% off some broadway show is not a bad deal. Yes. you have to see a show. How could you come to NYC and not see a BROADWAY OR OFF BROADWAY show? This is NYC after all.

I was very comfortable and for a reasonable price (despite paying for a studio suite).I didn't try breakfast in the hotel or use room service. There is a 24 hour deli next door which was extremely convenient. Bottled water was replenished each day.I was not looking for the typical Midtown tourist experience and the Sheraton Tribeca was perfect for seeing a different side of New York (having lived in Hell's Kitchen years ago, I wanted to stay downtown for a change of pace).

The bathroom was also small, but suitable, although it had an extremely loud bathroom fan. This hotel is located to some cool shops in Soho, and we had fun shopping there. A couple of things to keep in mind: if you want to go uptown or to Times Square, it is hard getting a cab. We asked a staff member to help us get a cab and he said it would be better if we walked up a block and tried to get one ourselves. We did try and no one would pull over, and when someone finally did pull over he said it was ""too far"" for him to go and pulled away. We had to walk back to the Sheraton and flag our own cab because the doorman didn't have much interest in helping us. It was an overall pleasant experience. Since there is always something to do in NYC you aren't spending much time in your room, which is a good thing here.","Woodbury, New Jersey",27,3.0

Looking to spend more time in Lower Manhattan this visit, we selected the Sheraton in Tribeca. The location, even for a first-time NYC visitor can’t be beat. A five minute walk to the north and you’re in Soho, five to the South and you’re in the heart of Tribeca, five east and it’s Chinatown and one a couple minutes more to Little Italy. Add to that, the A, C and E lines are 2 minutes from the lobby and the N and R are just a few minutes away and you can ride the subway to anywhere, including a quick trip to Brooklyn and Chelsea (visit the High Line!). Best of all, you’re in the middle of non-stop action, superb restaurants and fantastic, shoppable shops and less pretension than Midtown. The hotel itself is very nice. Even if you hesitate staying at a Sheraton, as we did, this will exceed your expectations. It’s on par with more upscale large hotel chains. The room is comfortable, understated and adequate and normally-sized for NYC. The staff is excellent and quick to assist with any need. We were on the 16th floor and it was remarkably quiet for NYC. Possibly the quietest room I've ever stayed in here. I would happily recommend this hotel to friends and family and I suspect we’ll stay here again.",Dallas,6,4.0

Two different subway lines are easily available.

Stayed on the 18th floor (a very friendly front desk person upgraded me for being a Starwood member) and had great views of the NY skyline. If you can, upgrade to the Club Level: the terrace facing north has simply spectacular views (and there's free breakfast, evening reception, and wi-fi).The room itself was small -- it is NYC, after all-- but it was modern and clean. At least the bedroom was very good-sized and outfitted with modern appliances. Very comfortable bed and pillows.

The hotel is located in a not-so-great area but is close to many areas of interest in terms of shopping and restaurants.The room was spacious enough for a NYC hotel room. Room amenities were standard. The bathroom was clean and roomy though I found the carpet to be dirty and by the end of our 1 week stay my slippers were sticking to the carpet as I walked. We dined in the restaurant only once for breakfast. It was average. The server was not detailed enough to bring utensils, cream. We had to ask for many things as he simply forgot to bring them. The bright spot was another server in the room - I think her name may have been Jessica - she picked up where her forgetful colleague left off and provided us with what he missed. As we were waiting for our meal, I was looking around the room. The side of the room where the buffet is located has floor to ceiling mirror. What struck me is that the top half of the mirror was filthy dirty. The lower half was however clean. It was as if the person cleaning just did not care enough to finish the job correctly. I wondered what else the restaurant did not bother to care about since the could not perform the simple task of cleaning. It bugged me enough to speak to the restaurant manager about this. When I spoke of the filthy mirrors, I was met with a defensive tone of ""I am surprised at this because I had the staff clean the mirrors last night"". I indicated that if she was doubting me I recommended that she step inside the restaurant to take a look for herself. She apologized to me in effort to just shut the conversation down and get rid of me. I was not looking for an apology. I was just pointing something out that maybe she should look into. Perhaps she was taking it personally as the filthy mirrors would be a direct result of her lack of managerial ability to follow up with her staff to check their work the following morning if in fact they did work on them the night before. If the restaurant manager is not going to care about cleanliness than most assuredly her staff will not care either.Our stay was fine overall but given the sheer amount of choice in NYC in terms of accommodation, we would probably stay elsewhere for our next visit.",Toronto,24,3.0

I realize that hotels can make mistakes, but so long as they act with integrity and fix their mistakes I just overlook them. In the case of the Sheraton Tribecca they made a mistake, but it went downhill from there.I booked my hotel room over 2 weeks in advance and paid the full amount for a room that was non-refundable. When I got my Visa statement I saw that the hotel had reversed the charges, and recharged my Visa after checkout resulting in an additional charge of $80.I contacted Sheraton which resulted in a response from a manager at the hotel. His first response was that this was normal practice and had to do with incidentals. This did not make sense, and I told him so. He then wanted to see copies of my Visa statement which I sent to him. Despite assurance that this would be dealt with in a matter of days, a week went by with no word. I then called several times, e-mailed, but got no answer. After a couple of weeks I contacted Sheraton customer service again, and found that my file had been closed by the hotel manager. No refund, no response, nothing from the hotel!Sheraton customer service explained they could not help me as their protocol required simply re-opening the file and waiting for the hotel to respond. I called the hotel again, and again the manager was not available, so I left a message that if I did not have a response from him within 24 hours I would escalate this matter with Sheraton corporate.I have to say that closing the file without a refund, without notifying me, and without even responding to my calls/e-mails after 2 weeks is deplorable. I have spent far too much time on long distance phone calls, e-mails, and just generally being frustrated with this hotel's management.If you stay at the Sheraton Tribecca you are taking a chance.

It is one of the newer SPG Sheraton and therefore, the hotel lobby and rooms do look somewhat new. The service is good and better than the nearby W downtown, which I stayed the previous week. Keep in mind, Canal St is busy almost all day with crosstown traffic congestion due to the holland tunnel access. So it may not be for everyone! In addition, Canal street isn't one of the pretties street in NYC. On Sunday early mornings, it can be quiet but that is when you see all the litter. Otherwise, the hotel is perfectly located minutes from centre of soho and within walking distance to WTC and 9/11 memorial. We walked to brooklyn bridge from here in 15 min. If you wish to avoid the crowd and Chinatown activities, exit the hotel and cross Canal Street into Wooster or West Broadway for a more pleasant walk. Avoid walking along Canal St. We had to request for a room change due to noise from the traffic on a lower floor. The upper floors do have a remarkable view of midtown depending on which side the room faces. The wifi Internet is good in some rooms but can be spotty on the corner room away from the routers. Bring your own router to connect to the Ethernet cable and off you go at blazing speed. We didn't dine at the restaurant but the breakfast buffet option for $14.95 seem reasonable. The beds are comfortable. The rooms size are reasonable for NYC. Some reviews complained on the size and noise. This is NYC and not the adirondacks. I wouldn't eat anywhere along Canal St. Walk a few blocks into soho on Prince St. or Elizabeth St. for better options. I would stay again if the rates are reasonable and if there are deals.","Toronto, Canada",24,4.0

I would only book this hotel if you received a special rate, it is not worth the rack rate or any other premium price.

Subsequently found a better deal through Kayak, which normally should be honored by Starwood's best rate guarantee.Starwood didn't want to honor the lower rate, as the hotel had meanwhile also adapted their rate to the lower price. And the fine print is: the rates have to be available at the same time -- not the time the customer is checking, but the time SPG is checking. This makes a lot of sense, if rates at competitor websites disappear, but it's a clear breach of trust, if it's actually the Starwood hotel that adapts the rate to the lower one. SPG recoginzed that and made two (interesting) recommendations: 1) Never make an actual reservation, before a BRG claim is approved... well, does that make business sense for them? I'll let you decide.2) Contact the hotel directly, as they are (still) offering the lower rate even to walk in customers. They should typically match it. Well they didn't: The assitant FO manager was insulting me, because I was making ""illicit"" claims and the General manager, even confronted with the threat that I would take my following 3 nights elsewhere wasn't smart enough to see, what kind of havoc he caused, by insisting on his lousy 40$ (which he wasn't getting from any other walk-in customer, but insisted on collecting from a loyal SPG Platinum...)

Modern lobby, location next to subway station, the rooms (was Platinum upgraded to what they called a Junior Suite: a 4th floor room with a sofa, next to the lifts and a view through dirty curtains onto a inner courtyard wall about 10 feet away... really not worth it.

(I'm not sure if this was just random chance, or if the hotel actually upsells club lounge access to those staying on non-club level floors; if the latter is true, then the hotel is unfortunately causing the elevator delay.)Second, when I got to my room (late in the evening, around 11:00pm or so), I found there was no room service menu. I decided to call room service and ask them to read me the menu (most hotels have a very limited menu for late night dining, so not a big bother to just read me the options). The person insisted they would just bring up a menu to my room and that it would only take 5 minutes. 5 minutes go by. Then 10; then 15; then 20. About 25 minutes after I first called, I called back and the same person told me ""oh, we think we delivered the menu to the wrong room."" When I asked them to bring up the menu, the person told me that it would take too long because the kitchen would be closing in 15 minutes. To his credit, he then told me he'd read me the menu (why didn't he just do this in the first place?!). I ended up getting a $20 chicken quesadilla (not bad, but $20 for a quesadilla? with no sides? I was hungry after a long day of traveling...). I do give credit to the person for making it all happen (with quick delivery) in the end.Third, I was awakened very early in the morning to the sound of crashing plates/dishes coming through one of the walls. I'm not sure why/how, but this was not a pleasant surprise.Fourth, the front desk, at check-in, did not offer me my Starwood elite amenity choice. I was too tired to realize this until I had already made it to my room.","Los Angeles, California",67,3.0

And our view of Midtown and the Empire State Building was to die for!The hotel is located close to two different subway lines (A/C/E and 1/2/3), making it easy to get Uptown for shopping and shows. While the area outside the hotel on Canal Street seemed a wee bit dodgy at night, we never felt threatened by it or gave it a second thought when returning late into the evening. Just around the corner on Broadway are many great shops, cafes and restaurants, making for a pleasant stroll. They could have better stocked the room with more towels and bottled water, foam pillows, shower gel and a hotel services directory, all of which had to be requested from Guest Services and sometimes more than once or unsuccessfully. The three elevators are small and perhaps inadequate for a hotel spread over 22 floors as it would often take 5 minutes to get up or down to our room on the 20th floor.All and all, I'd stay here again, especially on a great special rate like this time.","Chicago, Illinois",8,4.0

We actually came up a day early, looking forward to our time in NYC. In the four days we were in Manhattan the only rude, discourteous experience we had was with the front desk staff at this hotel- management no less. The rest of the staff was apologetic and accommodating and tried to correct their errors, but couldn't do so without the management's authority. My hotel arrangements were made on my behalf through a 3rd party such as this site. My room was paid for in advance. $128/per night- supposedly a savings off the rack rate of $226/per night for a 4 star in TriBeCa. I will first say that the hotel is clean and neat and what I would expect for a 2 1/2-3 star accommodations, Otherwise, it fell short on amenities and service, especially service (no concierge or club level service that I could see, no refreshments, nothing and I mean nothing complimentary to make you feel welcome). I gave them my credit card at check in for incidentals, only to be charged $621.00 for my stay although I had already pre-paid. I was also given a king room to share with my 20 yr old son, and refused any other accommodations although I offered to pay the difference. The manager on duty was snarky and proceeded to lecture me about going through third party vendors for my accommodations, as they can't guarantee the room type for that price. I reminded the manager, I was only asking for TWO beds, and I was wiling to pay the difference. I was told there were no rooms with two beds, not even a suite (not even a sleeper sofa), and that they were oversold and couldn't accommodate the people coming in. She proceeded to make calls to another Sheraton hotel at my proding to see if they had a room with two beds, but I was have to pay the difference in price I was told. After she started to go through the list of hotels, I dismissed her effort as I reminded her there was a purpose to our trip and we couldn't be delayed any further. There was no empathy for the position we had been put in- in fact, she acted as thought she was doing us a favor to let us stay there. Her behavior was the most HOSTILE I have ever experienced from someone in the hospitality industry.To add insult to injury, we ordered chocolate cake from room service on July 14th of our stay and became very ill. We could hardly leave our 10x10 cell of a room. When we did leave, it took several phone calls and trips to the front desk to get the $621.00 cancelled out of their system, although they ""claimed"" they had contacted my bank the day before to do so. LIE. I spoke to my bank at the front desk, and was instructed that all the hotel needed to do was cancel the charge out of THEIR system, which they had not done. My bank would update the balance in 48 hours. The money was NOT the point, the point was UNAUTHORIZED charges to my card. It's called FRAUD. When we left on Monday the 16th and my car was brought to me, there was a large splat in the center of my hood that was rust in color. It appeared something had dripped on my hood wherever they had parked my car. There were scratches along the driver's side door as if someone had tried to get in the vehicle. My back up camera no longer works and the manual hood latch is disabled. I have tried on several occasions since Monday to contact Lowell Bebe-Center to no avail. I have been told he is ""away from his desk"". I have been told a manager on duty will contact me. We'll see, but I'm not waiting to take action. The only souls on that front desk who showed a pittance of kindness was Andrea and Giselle. BTW- I am a Starwood Preferred Guest, but I've never seen it as an advantage, so I've given up trying to use it. I recommend staying away from the Starwood Brand.

The bed was actually really comfortable and we slept very well. It's a short walk from Soho for shopping and about a 30 minute walk to Meatpacking District. Here were some down sides. 2 of the 3 elevators were broken so there were lines that would form to wait for them. a woman next to me told me that she and her husband just started getting a drink at the bar to wait them out because sometimes it would take 45 mins. that was pretty annoying since our room was on the 16th floor. I think others have mentioned this. valet parking is $65/day, so we did street parking and just left the car parked the whole time we were there and walked and cabbed everywhere.

I am quite particular and I would definitely return to this gem in Tribeca. Great value as well.,"Dallas, Texas",2,5.0

Note parking in the area is free after 6pm but no overnight. The rooms were great. Not too big but comfortable and could not speak more highly of the beds (super comfortable). I loved the area since there was plenty of shopping, bars and dining options. I would definitely return with the girls to go shopping and dining.

I personally had a great experience with the doorman, Michael Valentino. He was so helpful in every way. Starting with the parking, he always conducted service with a big smile.

Hotel lobby is modern and brightly lit, and visitors seemed to make good use of the bar and computer workstations nearby. Room was OK - for the most part clean though I noticed a lot of smudges and scratches on the walls that probably could be addressed in a more thorough cleaning session. The outdoor patio was nice though - I think there are only three rooms that have this feature so request it if you can. These rooms are on the second floor only. Fitness center is just a room converted into a workout room with some various cardio and exercise machines.

This could not be further from what we actually found once we arrived! The hotel itself was very comfortable- one of the best beds I have ever slept in. In true NYC style the room was a bit small but you don't go to NYC to stay in your room. The housekeeping staff were fantastic as were the front of house staff. They were very knowledgable about local restaurants and nothing seemed to much trouble. The location could not have been more diverse and cosmopolitan, right on top of Canal Street and Chinatown but at no point did we ever feel unsafe. My next visit to NYC i will be staying here again.

I usually stay at the Le Parker Meridien or the W Union Square but I wanted something a little cheaper this time and needed to be downtown so I gave the Sheraton Tribeca a shot.I was really impressed with this hotel, I think it gets major points for being new and fresh, that puts it above a lot of hotels in NYC. It isn't a St Regis so you have to compare it to other similar star level properties, but it really excelles in all areas when you do.The staff was really nice, the doormen/valets are friendly, always offer to help, but never insist (I had no problem carrying my own bag, walking to the subway, etc). The check-in process was fast and efficient, it took about 2 minutes at most. The lobby is fairly small and doesn't have a big open feel, it's somewhat narrow, but it's pleasant. The Sheraton Link is a really nice amenity. I was able to get a ticket for MOMA, print it for free, same with my boarding pass. The log-in system they use works really well with your name and room number, it allows a certain number of free B&W prints per day etc, all really easy to use and a very nice little amenity.There is a coffee bar that is Starbucks branded, a bar, and a restaurant. I had the brunch buffet one morning, it was nicely stocked, clean, had lots of options, wasn't anything amazing but was really nicely done, the staff again was friendly.The guestroom was nicely done, I had a standard King room without a view, on the 10th floor. The elevators are key-card locked which is a nice safety touch. The hallways are bright and well air-conditioned. The room is small but smartly designed, the king bed in comfy, there's a chair, dresser, desk, desk chair, TV and clever little shelf by the corner to keep your keys and phone on. The TV is nice, gets HD channels, but there is no in-room movie service (probably cheaper these days). There is also a connection panel for HDMI, iPhones, etc so you can bring your own content. The bathroom is small but has a real shower (so much nicer than a shower tub), shelving by the sink, everything was clean which is the most important!Overall if you want to be in this part of town the Sheraton Tribeca is a great option as long as it's price is lower than the higher end options. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.A note for people not familiar with NYC, the Sheraton Tribeca has a great macro location but not a very good micro location. You are a few short blocks to SOHO and 1-3 blocks from most of the subway lines, but there is literally nothing within a stone's throw of the hotel, you can't go downstairs and find a charming little cafe, you have to hoof it for a couple blocks. I didn't mind that but could see it being a negative for some. A side note, after a 6 hour flight and 1 hour car ride I was really hungry, I went to the sketchy looking $1 pizza place a block over and (unless I was just really hungry) it totally hit the spot and seemed legit, so worth it if you want to save some $ or are just really hungry and need food ASAP.I can't think of anything the hotel needs to improve on, it's really nice for what it is, and certainly meets and likely exceeds the Sheraton brand standards, good job to everyone working there!","Los Angeles, CA",16,4.0

It's a newish building, a very nice and bright lobby, clean rooms that are decently sized for NY, and has friendly and attentive staff. I was on the 15th floor just in front of the elevators facing east and I was nervous that I'd hear the elevators all night long, but I heard nothing. Also, didn't hear any noise from the city below. The bed was very comfortable, the desk was a good size, there was an arm chair also if you wanted to chill and the armoire was a great place to store clothes.Regarding the area, yes Canal Street is not the ideal STREET on which to be situated, but you cross the street and you are in Soho and you walk 100m around the block and you are in Tribeca. Fantastic location almost directly in between the Tribeca Grand and the Soho Grand!The only negative, and this is a stretch to find one, was that the chambermaid knocked on my door 9:30 Sunday morning to ask when I was checking out so she could clean the room. Although she was very pleasant and smiley, I thought that this was a bit 'off' and made me feel a bit like my meter had run out.That said, I would totally stay here again.","Toronto, Canada",6,4.0

I agree with so many others on the following points: 1 - the surrounding area is not the nicest BUT the hotel is close to the subway so it’s very easy to get around. 2- the staff we dealt with were not friendly at all WITH THE EXCEPTION of the cleaning staff who in addition to being very, very friendly, left little notes in our room. 3 – rooms are small, not a problem for my husband and I though because they were well laid out and (most importantly) clean. We could definitely hear street traffic from our room on the 10th floor but it didn't bother us. 4 - $10/24hrs of WIFI in the room and although it says free WIFI in lobby, it looked like they only allotted 45 minutes per use (not sure what happens after the 45 minutes are up bc I was done in 25). Regarding the lobby WIFI – it is RIDICULOUSLY SLOW – think dial-up slow – took me 25 minutes to check in for my flight, something that would have taken less than 5 at home. In addition, as it was my first time in NYC, my husband called ahead to see if it was possible to get an upgrade on our room (hoping to surprise me with an awesome view). NO DICE!!! (see pic) He asked again a few days later and was told there was nothing available but what bummed me out the most was when I was sitting in the lobby later that day, I heard the lady at the front desk give an upgrade to another guy. ***eye roll***Also, after reading what some other people paid I am just disgusted that we were charged almost double per night (over $400) with no access to the club lounge or complimentary breakfast (or as I mentioned above, even a decent view), so I would not stay here again or recommend it to any of my friends.

We booked a club level room and stayed on the top floor (22nd).Location: If you’re not familiar with Canal Street, it’s the road that splits SoHo from Tribeca and Little Italy from Chinatown. It’s busy, crowded and yes, even a little dingy, but it’s very much NYC. If you want an upscale Madison/5th Avenue atmosphere, then this area is probably not for you. If you come from a quaint village and the lead article in your local newspaper is about Mrs. Wiggle’s cat getting stuck in the her tree, this area might not be for you. If you like dive bars, restaurants with whole Peking ducks hanging in restaurant windows, hip art galleries and street vendors selling everything from used copies of Kerouac to tacos al pastor to fake Rolexes, then this neighborhood might be for you. The hotel is walking distance to almost everything in SoHo, Tribeca, Chinatown, Little Italy and the Village. You can catch most subway lines along Canal Street, so other places in the city are easily accessible by public transportation. The area is also a foodie’s dream with lots of great places to eat just a few blocks away. If you’re not up for exploring Chinatown, I would recommend just waking up and down the streets between Canal and Washington Square. You can find Indian street food (kati rolls) and Japanese curry dives, Mario Batali’s low end restaurant (Lupa), high end French pastries (Payard) and on and on. If you are going out to dinner, be sure to make reservations, especially on the weekends. Opentable.com comes in quite handy for that. I’ve read reviews complaining about the dearth of taxis on Canal….well they’re right. And most New Yorkers don’t try to catch taxis on east-west streets like Canal. You have a much better chance of finding a taxi on the north-south avenues. So if you’re headed north, walk over to 6th Ave. and if you’re headed south, walk over to Broadway. Also, you should know that most taxis change shifts between 4 and 5 PM, so no matter where you go in NYC, you will not be able to catch a cab easily. Rooms: I found our room to be on the small side, but the view from the 22nd floor was nice (see picture), even if it was only a view of the roofs above Chinatown and the Lower East Side. The king bed takes up most of the room, but at least it was very comfortable. It’s a fairly new hotel (opened 2010), so you can expect all the latest features – flat panel TV, lots of outlets, ergonomic desk chair, etc. The bathroom has no tub, but the step-in shower was large and water pressure was decent (see picture). The sink counter, however, is very small, which was a real issue for my wife with her small arsenal of toiletries. Also, you should be aware that there is very little closet space (see picture). So, if you bring a large suitcase, you will have to leave it out in the room, which will make the room seem even smaller. Room Location: As you already know, the Sheraton is located right on Canal Street, which is a very busy road, day and night (see picture). From the 22nd floor, we didn’t hear any street noise, but sirens were clearly audible. I’m guessing the noise might be a bigger issue on the lower floors. I walked around some of the floors and it looks like the rooms are arranged in the following way. Rooms ending in -9 and -11 are right in front of the elevators. The lower room numbers (-1 to -4 and -6) are at the back of the hotel overlooking the much quieter Lispenard St. Rooms ending in -19 and -20 face due north and I’m guessing on the 10th floor and higher, probably have some of the nicest Empire State Building views. The downside is that they overlook Canal St. Other than the Presidential Suite, I don’t think any rooms on the club floors face north towards the Empire State Building as that space is occupied by the club lounge. If you do stay on the 22nd floor, you should know that the lounge is on the 21st floor. I would recommend just walking down the stairs to the 21st floor, because it’s much, much, much faster than the elevator. Just remember to take your key as you will need it to get to the 21st floor.Service: In general, service was friendly and professional. The check-in and check-out procedure took only a few minutes for us, but at times, I did see some pretty long lines. The people in the club lounge were especially diligent and worked hard to make the guests happy. The cleaning staff was also very friendly and accommodating with extra towels and stuff.Miscellaneous: The soap and shampoos were standard and nothing special. Internet in the room was $9.95 per day, but was included in our rate. The connection was fast throughout the day though. If you need free access, you can always go to the lobby. Skip the water in your room and grab a complimentary bottle of water from the big cooler by the concierge on your way out.Public Spaces: The lobby area is a relatively small, but comfortable space. With a Starbucks, a computer kiosk and a bar, it’s often crowded though. My only real complaint about the lobby is that the check-in area is very cramped, especially during peak check-out times in the morning. There are 3 elevators that serve the guest floors. We never had to wait too long for an elevator, but they were often packed with people by the time we got to the lobby floor. We didn’t visit the bar, restaurant or gym. Club Lounge: The indoor part of the club lounge was small and a bit sterile, but the outdoor terrace was especially nice with excellent views of Midtown and the Empire State Building (see pictures). The breakfast was typical American fare, but much better than I had expected – assorted bagels and muffins, croissants, yogurt, eggs, sausage, bacon, home fries, assorted fruits, orange juice, coffee, tea, etc. The afternoon hors d’oeuvres consisted of vegetable samosas, deep fried pork wontons and assorted cheese and crackers (see pictures). There’s also Starbucks coffee, sodas and bottled water. Wine and liquor are extra. My only complaint about the lounge was that there were A LOT of freeloaders – people sneaking up from other floors with club floor guests. At times, it felt more like a Days Inn than a club lounge. If you do come back during the middle of the day, the lounge is pretty much empty and the terrace is a very nice place to unwind. One last note, the lounge got pretty crowded during breakfast time and many people were out on the terrace. I imagine that it must be unbearably crowded in the winter or during inclement weather when the terrace is closed.Overall: We were very happy with the Sheraton Tribeca and were pleased with our stay on the club level. For $250 per night (which included all taxes and fees), we thought we got an excellent deal for Manhattan and would return again.",New York,70,4.0

We expect the loyalty programs to matter to the properties at which we stay.After being told that no rooms were available by the front desk clerk Dawn (who also looked at the screen and asked the other woman at the desk Erica) if she could 'do that' to which Erica replied 'no'.I came upstairs to my thimble sized room and looked online. Guess what? The online system showed a reservation available for a suite from 6/1/12-6/3/12. Amazing, huh?So instead of calling the concierge line, which is what I probably should have done, I called the front desk. Another song and dance about how one suite was available Friday night, and then a different one for Saturday night. I said to Dawn, 'no problem, we'd be happy to move from one to another so as not to be in such a small room' to which she replied 'no once you're in there they won't make you move - I'll just leave a note for the morning clerk who blocks off the rooms' - i.e. I don't want to be bothered with you so I'm going to push you off on someone else.We came here because we thought it would be a nice change from mid-town, because guess what else? Apparently the Westin in midtown doesn't want to bother having a club lounge for their platinum members any longer and isn't even open on weekdays for more than a few hours and not at all on weekends.So I think we'll be going back to Hyatts where our status is actually recognized and appreciated.

Lobby and rooms are smartly furnished and look trendy and clean. The lobby has a computer station with about 4 computers you can use. NY Times and WSJ available in the lobby daily. The lobby bar also looks pretty good. Staff at the front desk were helpful and efficient.Skip the expensive and rather blah hotel restaurant and walk 2-3 blocks to Soho for better food. Breakfast was not complimentary so I got some fresh fruit and bagels from the Tribeca Bagel store next door (better sit-down brunch to be had in nearby Soho or the Village). Rooms are snug as is typical for NYC, but with nice decor and nice showers. The fan in the bathroom is noisy so we kept it on at a minimum only for showers. Adjustable heating/AC worked well. There is some street noise as you would expect in NYC from cars, but this dies down during the night. There is free Starbucks-branded coffee which you can make with the machine in your room, along with a small selection of Tazo tea. There's also one free bottle of filtered Nestle water (watch out - the small one is free and replaced daily by the maid, but the slightly larger one on the opposite side of the desk is $5). Location is very close to Soho and you will be very satisfied with it. However, the block surrounding the hotel is Canal Street which is less nice, so you have to walk a block to get anywhere good. But this only takes a minute. There is a LOT of traffic congestion right around the area so don't be surprised if taxi drivers are reluctant to take you directly there (this will get them stuck in traffic for an hour right around the hotel) -- get around this by telling them you're willing to walk a couple blocks and that they don't have to get into the traffic.Nice hotel overall. I would come again. We bid on Priceline so didn't know what hotel we'd be getting until afterward, but were happy with the result.","Cambridge, Massachusetts",18,5.0

The front desk staff is always friendly and helpful as well as the bar staff who always make a good drink and conversation. With that being said the management personnel of this hotel have managed to diminish all this from my loyalty to their hotel. I have stayed at this hotel at least 50 times since they opened a little over a year ago. I stayed one night after they opened and switched hotels from the Sheraton Towers in midtown making it my hotel of choice because of the location and also the staff made me feel at home. Two weeks ago I had an emergency with my daughter and had to cancel my reservation on short notice. The price I booked was higher than normal at a rate of around $850.00. I have become used to this staying in Manhattan for almost 20 years and understand supply and demand and that it was also a very busy time in the city. I called the hotel as soon as I received notice that my daughter was in the hospital to cancel my reservation at 2 AM. To my disbelief I was informed that I would be charged a 1 night cancelation fee of $850. I asked the manager I was speaking to if he could see my history of stays and my Platinum status and he informed me he could. I asked him if this meant anything in helping waive the fee and the response I received was ""We do appreciate your loyalty but unfortunately you are outside of the cancelation time."" I have never on one occasion canceled a reservation with this hotel and even this did not hold any merit with them. I was in a hospital waiting room with my daughter extremly ill and I myself was exhausted and I asked if there was someone else I could speak to and I was told to call back in the morning and speak to someone in the sales department, but with this I was told I could try but would get the same answer. The manager I spoke to had absolutlely no sympathy for the situation. I understand this is a business and there is money to be made but treating your loyal customers like this is not acceptable. After calling the next morning and speaking to an extremely rude gentleman in the sales department I was told once again I would be charged (I guess the blunt manager I spoke to the previous evening was right!) I hope the one night of money they made off my canceled reservation is better than the 50 more nights I would have stayed in the coming year. If you are a Platinum Starwood member I would recommend not staying here. Even though I am not a fan of the hustle and bustle of midtown I would choose a Starwood hotel in that area if you would like to be treated like you have loyalty to a brand or more so to a specific location. You are not recognized when you need it here. Luckily my daughter is out of the hospital and we will be staying in New York on a family vacation next month and I can assure you we will not be staying at this hotel.","Miami Beach, Florida",8,1.0

My last room that I stayed in had some sort of leak such that every time I took a shower a big wet patch appeared on the other side of the room.

It’s a fantastic, modern property in a bit of a dodgy area, but access to transportation is excellent.The Sheraton Tribeca is on Canal Street, between West Broadway and Broadway. You are a block away from the A C E subway lines (the blue line), which heads directly to Penn Station (for Amtrak and Newark services), the Bus Terminal (which is just a couple of blocks away from Times Square), and the Upper West Side (Central Park). You’re also a few blocks away from the N and Q and R (yellow) lines, which heads in the direction of LaGuardia. In short, you’re in a hub of subway options.This compensates for the fact that the immediate area around Canal Street feels fairly dodgy. Most of the nearby shops close after 7 pm, and there isn’t a restaurant or a café scene in the immediate area. I’d say that the area is “safe”, but it’s pretty dingy around the neighbourhood at night. This isn’t a huge deterrent, since you really are only a block away from the A and C subway lines. The hotel itself is perfectly safe, with elevator access with card swipes.And, this is compensated for the fact that the Sheraton Tribeca is sparkly new. Rooms are to the Sheraton new brand standard, with modern furnishing, beds and desks, and a clean bright washroom area (my room had a shower only, not a bath). The fitness centre, while small, had modern equipment (treadmills and ellipticals, 3 each, but no normal bike), and the bar “LINK” computer area downstairs is modern. This is much better than other Starwood properties in New York, particularly those around Times Square (with tiny old rooms in need of renovation, see some of my previous reviews).And, surprise, while Canal Street is busy 24/7, my 5th floor room was fairly good for noise insulation. I still recommend earplugs in any big city, but I have absolutely no complaints about the facilities and the service.The Sheraton Tribeca is a fantastic facility in a fairly sad neighbourhood. You are not far from SoHo, which is nicer, but the immediate vicinity is pretty dismal. But don’t let that discourage you – the neighbourhood means that this will be one of the cheaper quality Starwood options, and I strongly recommend this property.",Cambridge,25,4.0

Most people don""t like walking in the neighborhood during the day let alone at night. It's not far fron Chinatown and Little Italy, but far enough that it's a little uncomfortable. The room itself was nice - I had 1720, which had a view of the Empire State Building. Smallish, but clean and newer carpet etc. There is no bathtub in this room, just a shower. No extras either, dont expect q-tips or a shower cap here. Service was spotty. There was not a door-person to help with cabs, and I had to walk ten minutes to find one at a very busy time of day. I also saw people trying to flag down cabs everytime I came back to the hotel. Food was good through room service. Had a problem getting through one night as they must have been very busy and I kept having to call back after they would put me on hold. Lobby is small, there is a workout room on 2, but I didnt try it. Canal is a very busy street, so if your room is located in the front you will hear early morning trucks driving by. I did come down early at 4:00 am the last morning as I had a 6:00 am flight and they got me a cab at that time and said they could call cars.

The service made our night and weekend. It was mine and my fiance's third anniversary. I had sent Lowell (the manager) an email Friday morning requesting if there was any possible way to make our hotel stay the proverbial icing on the cake. I didn't hear back for a day, so I thought my email had got lost in the clutter (obviously a weekend in NYC in the spring season is a busy time for those in the service industry). After arriving at 3pm to check-in and greeted by Eurasia who with a warm welcome congratulated me on my third anniversary. Fully surprised that the email had gotten through, been read and been informed that the room would have a ""nice view"", I rushed to the room and my jaw dropped as I first set my eyes on the skyline view from the 15th floor.

The computer system in the lobby is free and good, I used my computer on their wireless in the lobby for free, (in room has a charge). The staff greeted us each time we entered and made sure they helped us if we needed anything. The place is new and clean. Maps and travel info was plentiful and the staff again helped us numerous times with the subway and other instructions.

Athough my friend and I are good friends - we aren't * that * close and had no desire to share a bed. However after a couple of minutes the receptionist managed to find a suitable room for us and at no extra charge.The room we were given was on the second floor of the hotel and came with a suprisingly large balcony - alas with it being February it wasn't exactly the sort of weather to sit outside although the weather was nice during the stay.The room itself was fairly small, with limited space for 2 people to hang clothes. The beds themselves were very comfortable and ensured a good nights sleep. Limited amount of complimentary coffee provided but not tea which was a shame. Bathroom was a decent size with a very powerful shower and a deep bath. Left a tip for the chambermaid each day and got a nice note in return each evening when we returned which I thought was a nice touch. Wi-Fi in the hotel is not free except in the lobby and quite expensive compared to what I'm used to in the US.Didn't use any of the hotel facilities other than a couple of drinks in the pleasant bar.All in all, a pleasant enough stay - especially given that there a number of subway stations within a couple of minutes walk.","Sandwich, United Kingdom",196,4.0

I went back to Brooklyn and got him so he could stay with my mom for a night or two (he is small - 7 pounds). When I brought him, I let the hotel know and they provided a bed and bowl. The first night, no incident. The second night, my mom and I went to dinner and when we came back to the hotel room, my dog was GONE. There was a note on the bed saying he was at the front desk. Turns out, someone complained that he barked so they removed him. This was pretty disturbing. Again, the hotel staff was SUPER friendly - my dog seemed fine and in good hands. But to remove my dog from the room without my consent? They said we had signed a waiver allowing them to do so, but we were never given a waiver (of course they had us sign one right then). I had my husband come pick up the dog then as I didn't want our pup to be a nuisance nor to be put in a situation like this again, however people traveling with pets from out of town wouldn't have this luxury.

Customer service does not exist. My husband had a business trip in New York and I tagged along for several days. He left very early Monday morning for work and I was in the hotel room by myself when I realized that the linens on the bed had a stain of poop! Grossed that I had slept on it, I called the front desk. They were neither apologetic nor sensed the grossness of the situation. The front desk notified me that they would be sending someone. They sent one male janitor who came into the room to change the sheets. Again, no apology or anything. About 30 minutes later, still in my PJ's and about to get into the shower, the same male janitor knocked on my door. There had been no call from the front desk so I was wary of opening my door. I opened it and stood at the front door asking what he wanted. He claimed he left his master key inside my room. I told him I had not seen any key but he barged in the room and started searching for it himself. At this point, I was really uncomfortable. Our room was in the corner, I was by myself, and this strange man was basically looking through my stuff. Of course, he didn't find anything and left. I was late for an appointment and didn't stop by the front desk to tell what happened. I came back into the hotel in the late afternoon and asked to see the manager. When I told her of what happened, again, she wasn't very concerned, was condescending, and kept asking me what the big deal the situation was. She referred me to the housekeeping manager who sent me a small box of chocolates to ease the situation. We left the next day. Their valet policy is to call the front desk 30 minutes in advance and they will have the car waiting in the front. (I think the place where they park is actually pretty far and that's how long it takes to walk and drive back). We called it in the next morning at 6am. My flight was leaving at 8:30 so we were cutting it close. We came downstairs after the allotted time to find the wrong car sitting in the front. We informed the front desk that it was the wrong car and they had to call over to the valet deck. Instead of hurrying and trying to get our car back to the hotel, the front desk was more concerned with whose fault they got the number wrong. We didn't care as long as the car got to the hotel ASAP. It took them another 30 minutes to do so. The charge was $49 per night for valet, so my husband wanted to see if they could waiver the last night's valet charge for their mistakes. It has been horrible trying to talk to anyone. No manger has called back. The customer service is non-existent.","Atlanta, Georgia",4,1.0

LOCATIONThe Sheraton's location is just ok - on Canal Street which is on the edge to Chinatown (we thought not so nice unfortunately!) but also quite close to the more ""in"" area of Tribeca and when you walk up Broadway you have nice, though expensive shops to look at and a very nice, clean and safe area when walking further uptown. We walked Broadway (uptown) as well as West Broadway (uptown) even at night and felt safe. However, we did not like walking in the other direction towards Chinatown, as we felt unsafe there - just our impression. But location was the only not so great thing about this hotel. ROOMSWhen we were checked in, we were given two rooms on the executive floor. The rooms were good in size, clean and not too loud - you did hear sirens and a car alarm every now and then but that happens everywhere in NYC!The Sheraton also has wonderful beds! Our rooms had a (for our standards) huge double bed with great clean sheets & more than enough fluffy pillows! This was great for us, since we had to stay in bed more than we had wanted to due to an illness. On our 3rd day I had to contact the front office re a doctor and was told by staff they have a doctor who makes house calls. They contacted him for us and he called us at our room later. He arrived in the early afternoon and was very nice and competent. STARWOOD PREFERRED GUEST LOUNGEWe stayed on the floor where the Starwood Preferred Guest lounge is located and where we got free breakfast, evening snacks and free soft drinks! It was just great! The lounge even has a wonderful terrace - too bad it was winter! There's also a computer in the lounge which you can use for free for a certain period of time each day (I think it was around an hour or less?), but there were also a couple of computers for free use in the lobby.

Always open and available to support. - room: small, somehow NY standard, but not Sheraton standard.

The sky was very clear, blue, no clouds, therefore a great view in the night.- fully agree with one comment regarding the noise of the air stractor on the toillete. Amazing loud, that´s why I also decided to use the other light and illuminate the restroom.- breakfast only average.....no ham or cheese but fruits and juice. Nothing special, but ok.- two days during my stay, I had business meetings which ended very late, came back to the hotel close to 10:00PM and decided to order food to the room/room service, and my god !!!!! HORRIBLE FOOD !!!!!. The first time I ordered one chicken stake, which was overkoocked, and I felt eating a piece of leather. However, I decided to give restaurant of the hotel a second chance, and another day ordered a chicken sandwich. Another dissapointment. The chicken again, like leather.....in a baguette like gum.....,so bottom line, the hotel is very nice, well located, close to the subway lines which take you in 15 mins to the uptown, also close to soho and chinatown, with some interesting restaurants and shops nearby.......so no issues to stay a the hotel, but pls DON´T EAT THERE.

I believe Gold (not sure about Gold since the first time we stayed we were not offered free breakfast) and Platinum members can eat breakfast there for free. Food is good, coffee excellent.On our second visit to the hotel in January, we were promised, as now Platinum members, a Suite upgrade. Excited we went to check our room on the 5th floor and were immediately disappointed. The rooms was not much larger than their standard and the view was terrible. The small windows looked out at a brick wall. We then called the front desk, She told us there were no suites available, however we could have a room on the 17th floor with a better view. Of course we took it and it was a beauitiful view, directly across from the Empire State Bldg., but the room was standard, not an upgrade. Upon departure, we did not convey our displeasure due to the fact that they did change our room. However, when I returned home, I immediately contacted Sheraton. I received an apology from them as well as an email contact from the hotel itself with an apology and a promise to do better next time.I am not saying that I would not stay at this property again. It is convenient to visit the above-,mentioned areas for a short trip. We had reservations at Patricia's in Brooklyn which was a short taxi ride away. Patricia's is a great place for good fun and authentic homemade Italian fare.

It seemed like some of the main details had been overlooked when designing it. I had what I thought booked a 'King Suite', but as the price was very reasonable I didn't really seek to question the oversize double room. Sure it had a small dining table and a pull out couch, but wasn't a suite, nor did it have any storage or hanging for clothes, so I literally spent the entire 4 days living out of my suitcase. Not exactly a major problem, but more of an oversight by the management. The hot water went out one morning. I called guest services and was advised that it was being repaired and would be back on in 20 minutes. sure enough it was on in 20 minutes and again more of an inconvenience than a disaster, but not what I'd expect from a Sheraton. The coffee shop was always empty which meant ordering was quick. The bar area seemed quite adequete for a quick drink and nothing more.

I am a Hilton Diamond member and I could have used points and stayed at a Hilton, but I have stayed at most of them in the city and I chose the Sheraton Tribeca over all of them. I did not want the hustle bustle of midtown and this hotel is a short cab ride or easy subway ride from midtown. I brought my wife and dog on the trip. My wife was so impressed with how well she slept that she asked me to find out what type of mattress they used. They set up a dog bed and dog dishes which was a nice touch. My wife had mentioned that it was my birthday and the staff all signed a card and sent up some drinks and snacks for us. I love the location as it still has the energy of the city without most of the congestion (except at rush hour). There is a parking garage right across the street (on a side street) which is convenient. We ate at a great Italian restaurand a few blocks away and went to the Blue Note Jazz club that evening. A perfect weekend with great service and a great room in a wonderful location.I was shocked to see the review by Vivaladiva 1. Sure, I had to wait five minutes to check in (seemed like 20), I would expect that in a popular hotel with good rates (as she mentioned). To have had a bad experience is possible, but three bad experiences at this hotel is highly unlikely. To give this hotel one star (actually a circle) just blew me away. I would guess that ""La Diva"" never gives more than three circles for any experience. Unfortunately she went over her credit limit on here charge card because other hotels had put holds on her card (come on now, I stay in hotels 70 nights a year and this has never happened to me). She gives them a credit card which is no good and she blames the hotel for not accepting it. She offers to give them cash. If you owned a hotel would you want this person staying there? I think Trip Advisor should remove reviews like this that are obviously someone's way of venting for a bad experience that they caused themselves. I never wrote something bad about a previous review before, but boy it feels good to defend a place that has made me feel so welcomed when I have been away from home. I hope you will not head her review but rather read the other reviews from people like myself who have nothing but positive comments for this special place.","Ellicott City, Maryland",3,5.0

The up side of every Sheraton Hotel is the bed, 'cause it really makes you feel like you're sleeping in the clouds.

The rooms were clean and the beds really comfortable.The concierge was very helpful and the ground floor bar was a great place to people watch and had a great vibe. The only drawback I can think of was the lifts, really really slow.

If you look at my other reviews, I have NEVER given a hotel only 1 star! I have stayed at this hotel 2 times and tried to stay a third time about a month ago because of the price. My first time I stayed at this hotel it was the first week they opened. My room was clean (I was probably the first person to ever stay in it. Check in took over 20 minutes! The bathrooms are cute and my room was a nice size and I had a decent view. The staff was nice, but there were a lot of different little issues. I chalked it up to it being the first week and that the hotel would get better with time. The Platinum lounge is one of the nicest with a rooftop deck and great view. I liked the location because I work downtown often and at that time I was working in Brooklyn a lot which the train to BK was a block away. The second time I stayed was for about 2 months later with friends. They upgraded me to a ""suite"", which isn't a suite. Its a room with a couch and dining table. The room is still small just more furniture. Our check in was again over 20 minutes. The staff seemed confused, but friendly. The weekend was a mess. With keys that weren't working all weekend, construction going on that woke us up at 8am and was making our bed vibrating our bed. We were told there was construction still going on, but I love how that information wasn't told to us before we checked in. I feel like if there is noise going on that loud, maybe you should tell us so we can make a descion of not checking in. After cursing out the manager, he gave me points for the headache, but I swore I would never be returning again. Checking out took us almost 30 minutes. We almost missed our train to go home because of their ""computer"" delay. Around the holidays I had a friend from out of the country in town. I booked this hotel again because the rooms were only $99 per night and were in the area we needed to be in. A year had passed and I was hoping the hotel had got their $h*t together. Well, I was wrong. I am a SPG Platinum member and have been for years, but this hotel doesn't care. My card didn't go through because there was other hotel holds still on it from stays I had from earlier in the week. I told them I would pay cash (which I and my friend had a lot of) and I would leave cash or card deposit. Well, well, well they told me they can't do that. Excuse me? I have cash to give you as a deposit for incidentals. Remind you that I have over 50 stays a year, the rooms have mini bars and the front desk has the power to lock my movie rentals and phone. Still a no go. The manager said we have people who trash the room a lot. Really? I don't walk around thinking I deserve special treatment, but the entire point of being a elite member to something is for the ""special treatment"". I show my loyalty to a brand then I want the same loyalty back. Especially when your standing there with your bags during the holidays and just want to get into your room to relax and enjoy the little time your in town. My friend swiped his European card which it was denied as well and he didn't know why. I asked the hotel if it was their computer and they said no. Well, after an hour of what I like to call a big ol mess we ended up at the Le Meridan (which was only $60 more) and the manager said ""because I'm a platinum member and stayed here before"" he would take a cash deposit. My friend said could you try my card first, and they did.......which of course it went right through!!!! So there was no need for the cash deposit, but its nice to know that we could of used if we needed to. My friend loved the hotel so much that he booked the hotel for his conference in the spring time.This hotel isn't worth the headache. I never thought I would give a hotel one star especially a SPG hotel. I'm done completely.","New York City, New York",25,1.0

After two requests,I gave up.I never heard anything back not even a sorry we have no more.Nada.So I moved a shelf from under the desk to set my luggage on that.The bathroom you have to turn on a light because it's pitch black.Well with the light comes this horrible fan noise.There is another light that is not connected to the fan and it is in the shower.This light however does not give you enough light to put makeup on.So here I go moving furniture and now a lamp from the dark room into the dark bathroom so I can get ready in the morning.Sounds relaxing doesn't it? You can hear the people next to you so if you watch T.V. at night the sound has to be practically mute.Also the T.V. is fixed to the wall and it will not move at all so you cannot turn it in your direction.The thing that really was the most irritating is that you have an elevator key that you have to have each time you get in if you want your floor and if you forget your key well it's back down to the lobby to get a new one.When you check in they ask if you want your family members name on the record ,so,if your family member forgets the key your family member gets another.Well, so much for that. My family member was grilled when they went to get another key and they left the phone in the room and could not call me when I was in the club lounge to explain to me what happened. If there are alot of people in the elevator,each person has to pull out there key for there floor and it was hair-raising to try to get all the keys in and your button pressed before it passed your floor!This shows me that this is a sketchy neighborhood or they would not have this crazy key system.The Club Lounge is quite nice but this is extra $$.They have no heat lamps or anything cheery(even a fake flower would have been an improvement) out on the terrace.If you go outside on the terrace Club Lounge and take in the only reason to really stay here (the view of the Empire State building)You have to stand literally because the way they designed it if you sit down you stare at the wall.Not relaxing.At least there is a good pizza place around the corner Saluggi(sp?) I think.I suppose if you are on a higher floor and have a view of the Empire State Building and they did not make you pay for wi-fi per day, I might have enjoyed my two nights here.At least you could open your drapes and see your clothes to get dressed without having anyone look at you in your birthday suit from the building next door.On a positive note,great bedding one more negative beds are like xtra large twins.they do not seem to be even full/dble beds.The housecleaning lady left me a welcoming note in hopes of a gratuity I guess? When I went to check out I found that there was a charge of 2 five dollar waters.I think housecleaning must be responsible for telling the front desk this?I would have gladly given her the price of water before I would have drunk a bottle of water that was 5 bucks!The water was sitting there the whole time with the 5 dollar price on it.Then I had to spend time on reversing the charges.This was the nail in the coffin to a disappointing stay",Beverly Hills,17,3.0

However, it’s conveniently located close to China Town, SOHO, and Little Italy within walking distance. 2 blocks from subway station.  The service is outstanding. You can feel the staffs are well trained at the second when you walk in. We were greeting immediately from bell desk, front desk and room service staffs. Although the room is a bit small, but it has everything you’ll need including safety box in the closet. The surprise chocolate on our bed and a hand write note to wish us happy New Year totally melt our hearts. Hubby said he will definite stay here again if we are visiting New York. P.S.

Squabbling street vendors haggle over fake handbags and watches while the real thing is being sold only feet away in the uber-chic boutiques that characterize current day Tribeca. But this is the fun thing about Manhattan - all the contrasts that make the city full of such surprises. And right in the middle of all this sits the Sheraton Tribeca which was a very pleasant surprise. It's definitely a struggle to find a NY hotel with a rate that's even close to sensible, so cost often trumps quality. I took a deep breath and crossed my fingers when I found a great rate at this hotel. And what I found was a wonderful surprise. The hotel is completely up to date, and while the rooms are small (but which rooms aren't small in NY?) they have the usual features that one expects. My room even had the added bonus of a wonderful view looking north towards midtown with the Empire State and other landmark buildings brilliantly lit up at night.OK, so walking out onto Canal St can jolt anyone out of even the worst jet lag but all the fun streets like Mercer and Green St's in Tribeca and local cafe's, restaurants, wine bars, boutiques and people watching more than compensate for being hustled to buy some cheesy T Shirt on Canal St.Definitely worth checking out.","New York City, New York",93,4.0

The room was a decent size with 2 doublebeds. The room looked much better than the pics. We were all pleasantly surprised. Bathroom seemed new and modern. It's a good location if you like Chinatown/Little Italy. I can't imagin staying here for a week as a first time nyc tourist.

The really wonderful, and unexpected, part of this hotel is the incredible views of midtown to the north and over to the Hudson to the west. The lounge on the club floor is terrific, excellent breakfast offerings, with a large outdoor terrace that allows unobstructed panoramic views of the city. Front desk and club lounge staff are friendly and cheerful.The location on Canal Street is not your typical tourist location, but it is great for exploring Soho (just cross Canal St and head north on West Broadway and go two blocks -- you're in the Soho shopping area) and Tribeca (again just turn south on West Broadway from the hotel and you're there) on foot. Lots of great bistros and little bars within 4-5 blocks. You can also get anywhere from here fast. Don't bother with a cab -- you're within two blocks of the subway stops for the A,C,E (turn left out the front door, then left on West Broadway), the 1,2 (turn left out the front door, cross Canal and walk west two blocks), and the N,R (turn right out the front door and walk east two blocks on Canal). Canal Street is not especially glamorous, but even with all the street vendors it is still less crowded and easier to walk through than Times Square. If it bothers you, turn off and walk along the side streets -- you'll see even more of the city!","Fort Worth, Texas",13,4.0

I booked through hotels.com for a refundable rate in January-not a busy month, right? I cancelled the reservation 8 days before arrival, plenty of time! But the Sheraton has a 'small print' cancellation policy of charging one night for cancellations, no matter how far ahead. Then I looked at the reservation and they were charging $239 for the first night and $175 for the second night. That way, in the event of cancellation, they could keep the higher rate. Clever. In any case, I called Five Star services at hotels.com and they called the Sheraton. Sheraton held fast-no refunds, sorry. So Five Star actually credited me the difference for a nearly full refund because I stay in hotels 5 nights each month and am a good customer. I WILL NEVER BOOK A ROOM AT A SHERATON.

The concierge was helpful however now on reflection and after reading some reviews post event, I think the concierge actually over charges, eg my ticket to warhorse $139 + the same again as a 'brokers fee'. If you are travelling at a quiet time of day take the subway or a normal NYC cab to the airport the hotel cab is a rip off at + $100.

In addition to its address on Canal Street, one of the city's main arteries, within a couple of blocks of several different subway lines, this hotel is a very easy walk from all sorts of cool and interesting neighborhoods. If you should happen to decide that the restaurant in the hotel is too crowded or expensive (as I did), you are only a few minutes away from the much more interesting restaurants of SoHo, Chinatown, or TriBeCa. The hotel itself is pretty nice too - the lobby tends to be too crowded, but that's because it hosts the hotel's free WiFi, the Sheraton Link computers, a nice bar, AND a Starbucks. The desk staff is helpful and cosmopolitan, and there is also an on-site concierge.The rooms are fairly basic and a bit small, but clean and well appointed. If you can get a room on a higher floor, the views are great. The club lounge, although only available to club level guests or Platinum rewards guests, is clean and pleasant, and while the free breakfast for club guests isn't gourmet or particularly exciting, it is a) free and b) plentiful. It's also a lot better than the free continental breakfast many places offer (i.e. a packaged muffin or bagel and weird coffee). The club lounge also includes a rather spacious roof deck with completely amazing views - it faces north, but you can also look out over either the East River or the Hudson River.","Baltimore, Maryland",13,4.0

The bill the Sheraton slipped under my door already had the internet charges removed (as they are for SPG platinums like me). Also, the breakfast is the best club room breakfast I've ever had. Lovely fresh fruit, scrambled eggs not dried out, sausage, bacon, tasty looking pastries, many different kinds of bagels and cereal, Starbucks coffee, Tazo tea, readily available skim milk, etc. The hostess (Zakira? She had a unique name) even procured ketchup for me when I asked, and apologized it wasn't already out (""I knew there was something I forgot,"" she said).Cons: In the boondocks, tacky room decor (does brick red ever look good used so liberally?), no views from most rooms, groaning bathroom fan.But the downsides are negligible, and I will be back!","New York City, New York",37,5.0

A room still wasn’t available, but the front desk clerk quickly made some calls and found a room that would be ready in 10-15 minutes. Enough time to grab a beer at the hotel bar!

I thought it was a great location to be stationed and we never felt unsafe – you have to use your room key to operate the (sometimes slow) elevators.I don’t know if I’d pay the full going rate for the Sheraton Tribeca – I’m pretty sure it would be out of our budget.

Irene, the hurricane, was not invited but she came anyway.We drove our car to the hotel and were a little surprised that there wasn't a better entrance for guests arriving. You're lucky to get a spot on Canal Street to unload your car. Valet parking was $60/day. Upon arrival, I thought we'd be bombarded by bellmen who'd help us get unloaded, etc. but not so much. My husband ended up taking our car to a local garage that was INDOORS and ABOVE GROUND to make sure we'd be okay if the hurricane hit. It ended up taking him about 20 minutes to go around the block and I attribute this to the mad rush of commuters getting out of the city before the storm him. Still, kind of a pain to deal with.Otherwise, check in was smooth. We were in the club level as our reservation was booked with my Starwood points. The bellman who took us our to our room, was extremely knowledgable, full of information, and eager to give us a great experience. We were taken to our room on the 17th floor. Our room was beautiful and roomy for NYC standards. One wall was all windows looking right towards the the Empire State building. Fantastic views and the rooms are brand new and well designed.Because of the impending hurricane, many of the guests were basically stuck at the hotel since all of Tribeca shut down. So the bars was full, the computers were being used and there was a lot of activity in the lobby and restaurant. I have to give the staff a ton of credit. No one seemed annoyed by the questions, the stress or the influx of guests. They kept a bulletin board with storm updates in the lobby and a flyer on each floor. Overall, the hotel was fantastic at providing news on the storm, what roads were open, what their plan was, and what we could expect if we got hit hard.Fortunately, we only lost cable for a an hour or two. Power never went out. And I have to mention how comfortable the beds were. We slept so well during the height of the storm and the linens kept us warm and cozy.Upon checkout, right after the storm, we decided to hit the breakfast buffet to get some food in us before our drive home. If we could actually drive anywhere. The buffet left a lot to be desired. The eggs were old and cold, there was no more toast left and none of the staff seemed concerned that they were busier than usual and guests were in line waiting to eat.However, I have to say that the Sheraton staff managed the storm and its inconveniences really well. I loved that there was a Starbucks in the lobby to get some morning coffee. And the lobby was bustling with travelers who made it a communal meeting space. The staff accomodated. The rooms are extremely comfortable, the views are amazing and the location is central to everything in lower Manhattan. Would definitely stay again.","Hanover, Massachusetts",35,4.0

As a devoted Starwood Preferred Guest, I'm pretty picky about my hotels. And this one definitely hit the mark. First off, it's just around the corner from the subway station that serves the A, C and E lines. That means if you flew into JFK, it drops you off almost at the front door for a whopping $7.25 with both the Air Train and Subway fares. Other subway lines are within a few blocks, so you can literally get anywhere in Manhattan very easily and for $2.25 a ride. Add to that, you're right across the street from SoHo, which has shopping and restaurants a-plenty - all very walkable. This is a busy hotel with a fairly small lobby area that made it feel even busier. But that was never an issue for me. I was still able to get an elevator rather easily. The lobby is modern and clean with lots of amenities - a grab-and-go food/drink counter, a small bar with seating area, a restaurant, and an area with several computers .I was lucky to get into a room on an upper floor, so the view was great. Furnishings are comfortable, including the bed. The bathroom isn't huge, but it's well-equipped with a nice stand-up shower and well-lit mirror. The one thing I thought was odd was there were no drawers for unpacking my suitcase. The closet had hangers, but nowhere to really put things that don't hang. Not a huge inconvenience. Staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful. The rooftop deck (which I believe is only accessible to Club floors - Splurge! It's worth it!) has INCREDIBLE 180 degree views of the city, as well as breakfast and evening snacks. This is highly unique for a New York hotel.Yes, so this hotel is directly on Canal Street, which is totally nasty and crowded. But as you walk out the front door, just head left and go around the corner to the parallel street behind Canal. It's quiet, safe, and no one is going to try to sell you a fake Rolex. That's what I did to get to the N, Q, R subway stop. And once you get off of Canal in any direction, your'e right back to charming, movie set-like, downtown New York.Comparing to what NYC hotels are charging these days for a nice, modern, new-ish room, I thought this hotel was a bargain - and I compare all Starwood properties before I make my decision (always check AAA rates and ""hotel offers"" on the SPG site before you book). This one has often had the lowest price. Request or book an upper floor, or at least one that faces uptown. You won't be disappointed!","Chicago, Illinois",49,4.0

This is a very nice property but if the hotel can get away with charging you for something, they will.I stayed here in April for a college visit to NYU with my daughter and booked another reservation on August 29 for her move in at NYU. Unfortunately, I had to cancel the reservation because NYU shifted move-in schedules due to Hurricane Irene and it would no longer be feasible for me to check in to the hotel on the same day as the rescheduled move-in day. I called the hotel directly to cancel the reservation. For some reason, the hotel staff member did not provide a cancellation number--perhaps distracted due to--I don't know--maybe a myriad of guest cancellations due to the hurricane? Moreover, for some very strange reason--perhaps with so much on my mind between rearranging all of my travel schedules, being emotional over my first-born going away to college, and feverishly shopping for dorm items online while the city was shut down--I did not ask for a cancellation number for the first time in my life. Not only did the hotel charge me for the room and not retain a record of the room cancellation (don't they record conversations in the event of disputes like this?), they also insist that if I did not receive a cancellation number, then 1) the responsibility is mine to ask for one, and 2) if they don't have a record of it, it did not happen. Really?! Is it not possible that perhaps one of the hotel staff members got distracted and neglected to give me a cancellation number and record this important information? I have the phone record to prove that I called the hotel in advance of my stay and–believe me, it was to cancel the room, not a request to fluff up my pillows! I had four phone conversations with the hotel to try to resolve this--first with Steven at the front desk, who promised I would receive a phone call from the general manager--a phone call I never received. When I called back, I spoke with Priscilla, she insisted she was ""the manager"" and insisted on resolving my problem, and then when I asked for the general manager, she instead referred me to Cornelio Encarnacio, the reservations manager. Fast-forward several days later, and a conversation with Cornelio that went nowhere. When I again asked to speak with the general manager, I was referred instead to the revenue manager. Um – me thinks the revenue manager would not be inclined to reverse charges if he is responsible for increasing revenue. Just a guess. Why were guarding the GM? It was not until I looked up the general manager's name online and asked for him by name that I finally spoke with GM Lowell Beebe-Center. Apparently, he had been spoon-feeding his staff the responses to me because he held the same position -- no record at the hotel means it did not happen. He refused to reverse the charge and assume any responsibility for the mistake his staff made. Lessons learned: 1) always ask for and record a cancellation number and, 2) apparently, the customer never wins at the Sheraton Tribeca. I have never encountered such unfriendly and unbending management and staff—especially in light of the circumstances. We were both affected by Hurricane Irene and the hotel took advantage of that. I guess they really, really needed the revenue. Unbelievable.","Newport Beach, California",1,1.0

It is close by, but not walkable. It is about an $8.00 taxi ride. It may be possible to take the subway, but since I was not familiar with the subway we did not bother. The check in was quick with no problems. The hotel is modern, clean, and the lobby cheerful. There is one restaurant and a coffee bar/cafe (which is not a sit down restaurant). The restaurant is okay, but there are no windows in it. Prices are typical of a hotel. There are complimentary computers in the lobby with free wifi. However, it is $10 per day for wifi in your room. There is also a bar in the lobby, although I did not order anything from it. The block that the hotel is on is not the best. It is deserted at night with few businesses. It is not scenic. Security in the hotel is good and you need a key card to operate the elevator. I found the room to be very small with not much room to walk around. The bathroom was tiny as well, with just enough room for one person to stand in it. It's possible though that other rooms were bigger. The room was just big enough for a king size bed, two small night table and a small desk. TAhe bed however, was very, very comfortable and the room was clean. It was also very quiet. All in all, I would say that it was adequate, but not worth the $325.00 per night charge (with taxes) that I paid.

I was greeted by this very nice lady at the front desk (she was pregnant) and she was immediately aware of my condition. She checked her computer and gave me a room. The check-in process was very fast, probably 5 minutes (or less), which I was so grateful for since all I needed at that time was sleep. We only stayed there for 2 nights but during that time all the Staff we encountered were very friendly, informative & helpful. From the Concierge, the Bell Man, the Barista (at the coffee shop at the Lobby), to the Housekeeper. The hotel looks new & have modern ammenities. Room and bathroom were both very clean; I did not notice any stains on the carpet, the wall, and more importantly the bed spread. Everything was immaculate. It's on the small side, but what do you expect, it's NYC. And there is only 2 of us. 3 would be a crowd. The AC is a little on the loud side but it didn't bother us. Bed was very comfortable.The hotel is located on Canal Street which was always jammed packed. We avoid hailing cabs on that street and just took the subway which was only about 1 minute walk from the hotel. There wasn't much going on at nite on the Canal Street. It was around 11pm and we were looking for a bite to eat and so we walked a few blocks away (towards the Tribecca Grand Hotel) and found a few restaurants there and a night club. The restaurants did not serve food at that hour (I think we had just missed the last call) but the host was nice enough to send us over to the Lobby of the Tribecca Grand Hotel...they served great midnight snacks and we were very satisfied with the quality of the food. I should probably write a separate review of the Lobby @ Tribecca Grand Hotel :)Overall, I think Sheraton Tribecca is on the average side. But the Staff and Cleanliness were definitely above average.

Due to the threat of Hurricane Irene, the Saturday show was postponed, so we tried to cancel the Saturday night reservation. When I called the hotel, I kept getting patched through to their national customer service call center. Every time I spoke to the customer service reps, they said if I cancelled the second night, I wouldn’t be able to keep the discounted rate and it would result in a rate change of $100 more since it was less than 24 hours from the first check-in day. They weren’t very sympathetic to the upcoming hurricane threat and weren’t even willing to match the current online rate, which was about halfway between the 2 rates. We decided not to cancel the 2nd night and take it up with the hotel when we arrived. Upon arrival, we asked to cancel the 2nd night so we could evacuate due to the hurricane. The friendly and helpful gentleman at the front desk said that wouldn’t be a problem and promptly cancelled the 2nd night without any rate change. We were very pleased that the employees at the actual hotel were more sympathetic to this unusual circumstance and made everything very simple and quick for us. They also let us check in 45 minutes early, so we were thrilled about that as well.The King bed room we had was very small and the bed and a chair took up most of it, but that’s pretty typical for NYC hotels. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept in, so I was pretty mad when I had to wake up at 6 AM to catch a train the next morning. Everything in the room and bathroom was very clean and modern-looking, especially the flat screen TV, phone and shower. There was also a pretty cool electronics hub in the room that could accommodate all sorts of different input and output cables for various electronics, although I didn’t have time to play around with it.I can’t really speak for the Tribeca neighborhood since I’ve never stayed in this part of Manhattan before, but everything for many blocks was closed at 1 AM so there wasn’t much nightlife around. The hotel bar closed at about 1:30 AM, so that didn’t really help our cause. I had to walk about 10 blocks just to find a convenience store that was open. The subway entrances for the 1 and A/C/E lines were both a couple minutes away, so that made it cheap and easy to navigate to various parts of the city.A final note about the Hurricane - The hotel had flyers at the front desk and elevator areas providing guests with an update of the hurricane on Friday. Even though the hotel wasn’t in the mandatory evacuation zone, they took the time to give another update to every room late Friday night asking people to leave for their safety early Saturday morning if possible, but that they’d remain open with limited services if they had nowhere else to go. This is evidence of the hotel’s genuine care for their guests and quality management during an event that’s very unusual for NYC.","Albany, New York",43,4.0

Canal street gets very empty and walking from 2 of the train lines doesn't feel safe. The location is more like Chinatown/Tribeca/Soho. Canal street is a mess. However, Tribeca and Soho can be fun for shopping and restaurants. For site seeing (museums, UN, Theater, Rockefeller Center, Central Park etc) we spent a lot of time on trains and taxis. The hotel itself is just okay. The staff vary from the bellhops which were wonderful to the front desk which was rude and hopeless. We booked a suite and asked that they have the queen sofa bed made when we arrived. When we arrived I double checked and was told it was fine. It wasn't. On the 3rd night it was finally made.

Don't get fooled by the fact that you are staying on Canal St. because as soon as you cross the street, literally you are amidst the nicest restaurants and galleries of Soho. We were able to get around the entire city by train and for the most part, we walked to all of the neighbouring areas because they were so close. Soho has great resto options across the street. Walk 15 min. you are in Chinatown, and then add another 5 minutes and you will end up in Little Italy. The rooms are spacious for NY standards. The hotel concierge and staff are very friendly and give great directions and suggestions for the area. I don't let small things like the size of the bar or the lobby get to me because I don't intend to spend time there! The amenities were great and we even got an upgrade in our room even though it was an online purchase. We got in at 11am and although check-in was for 3pm, we had a room by 11:30 - super service.I would recommend this hotel to friends and would consider staying here again because of how conveniently located it is to pricey areas for less money!Shopping on Broadway is less than a 5 min. walk!","Toronto, Canada",2,4.0

The entire reason we wanted to stay there was because of this and they wouldn't budge. What a waste! Rooms weren't impressive at all, bathrooms were so-so, would not stay there again.

The rooms have everything you would need and most (if not all) of what you would want, and are a decent size for Manhattan.The only negative I had about this hotel was the elevators. There were three available serving all 22 floors. I stayed on 18, so on the way up, it often stopped 5-6 times. And on the way down, it would be full after the first couple stops and would continue stopping every couple floors with no more room. It's minor, but something that became kind of annoying, yet expected.The location was pretty convenient to many cool areas/places....SoHo, Little Italy, Financial District, Brooklyn Bridge, Battery Park, Ground Zero, etc. In my opinion, the immediate area (China Town) is a dump.

We were in NYC to search for an apartment and so were pretty busy and stressed out. We wanted a place that was central to lower Manhattan while also an oasis from the city stress. As longtime SPG members we decided to try this new hotel.I reserved a club level king via SPG and was able to easily contact the hotel. We were having a few items shipped to us at the hotel and needed to coordinate with the desk. Everything arrived and was held for us!Check In:Check in could have been better. This property has been slammed with business since its opening with a host of difficulties that I hoped would have been smoothed out by the time we arrived. But when I walked in at 6pm to be told ""hang on while we find a room for you"" when I had a reservation booked for several weeks did not make me feel secure. It all worked out quickly and we were on our way up. Please note that the bellman didn't even offer to help us take our bags upstairs.Room:The room was small but quite well appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable, and even though we were near the elevators I had no problems with hallway noise or sleeping. Immediately upon check in engineering came up with our refrigerator (free, you just have to ask) and a ""Gym in a Bag"", which was a fabulous idea - mat, foam roller, exercise tubing, and a massager. The only thing we really missed in the room was a safe. There is only a safe at the front desk, not in the rooms.Club Lounge:The Club Lounge is lovely and the view from the deck is stunning. The concierges on duty were always pleasant and attentive. The Food & Beverage service, however, was lacking. Every afternoon we had the same food - samosas, some kind of sausage in pastry, fried artichokes, and various crudite. Breakfast was a bit better. The printer and fax didn't work in the Club Lounge, so anytime I needed to print or fax it was a trip down to the lobby.Room Service:We ordered room service on 3 nights, and it was consistently good food and service. Portions were HUGE!WIFI:Wifi sucked for the first day or two, but them smoothed out. Be aware that even if you have a ""Free Wifi"" Club Room you will need to check your bill for wifi charges.Checkout:Check out was pretty smooth, except for the previously mentioned wifi charges. We have 2 laptops, 2 blackberries, 2 kindles, and an ipad. Every single day we were charged for each device connected at $9.95 per device - that's $70 a day! Plus we had been charged for a phone call we didn't make (I never use hotel room phones; it's cheaper to pay roaming!).In the end our stay was great and the hotel served as a nice refuge from the city while giving us the space and support to get work done. We love the location - near Chinatown, Little Italy, Soho, Tribeca. Just a few blocks to Excellent Dumpling House!","New York City, New York",1,4.0

What i don't understand is that most Sheraton hotels on this trip don't display or tell Valet prices anywhere. We paid $ 100,00 for two nights of valet, this is a rate which certainly should be mentioned when checking in.In the direct area no big shopping possibilities.

I notified the front desk and was told that they will research the matter, and email me the correct bill within a couple of hours. I didn't hear back from them during the day. So, I came by the hotel at 5PM and was told that their accountant had left for the day and that the matter will be resolved on Monday. I told them that they knew about this problem at 8AM in the morning, so there's no excuse... I was asked who I spoke with, etc etc... After a few minutes, they printed the corrected bill for me, and said that they will refund my credit card for the incorrect charge. While the matter is resolved, it left a bad taste.

We declined and received a fourth floor room facing opposite wall. When we were going to bed few hours later we noted sheets weren't changed after the previous guest; there was a used tissue paper and black hairs in the bed. We went to complain in the front desk. The clerk apologized, but could only offer us similar room in fourth floor; she told there was only one room available? So we ended up changing room at 12.30 am. I wasn't very happy, but it was late, I was tired and didn't feel like arguing.To be fair, this was one time incident, otherwise our room and hotel were clean and ok. The only faults were lack of safety box and drawers in room.

The lobby is small but nice and they have the standard Link setup for computer and internet usage. There's a Starbucks in the hotel which is cool. The fitness center is basically just a couple pieces of cardio equipment and a mat. No free weights at all. But I am a 24 hour member and there's an Ultra club right up the street in SoHo.The rooms are OK. Mine was clean but small (but this is pretty common in NYC).

The first time we got such a small room, that there was no space to move, unpack, or anything. Literally, this was the smallest room I have ever had in NY, including Four Point by Sheraton Chelsea... The reason we got such a small room as Starwood Platinum was that we checked in early, requested a quiet room and there were no better rooms, and to do room change in the afternoon the front desk made it soo complicated, that it did not work out. So if you do need to check in early, make sure you are getting the room you like, rather that bother with the room change later. It is better to drop your bags, and check in later when usually better selection of rooms is available. To be fair the agent who checked us in, did try to arrange to move us to a better room, but the new shift was less than forthcoming with the move. The following morning the agent confided she could not sleep for putting us in such a small room.Two subsequent times we were allocated a much larger room, and the experience was much much better. Those rooms had Canal St orientation, and window insulation was good, the noise did not bother the sleep, and a bonus was a fabulous view of midtown as well as over Soho.The hotel gives a complimentary access to Club lounge for Starwood Platinums. They do have some cheeses, appetizers in the evening and some not very impressive breakfast spread. Please see a picture of available drinks in the lounge. I find it strange that having invested in the lounge, nicely furnished it, hotel does not bother to take drinks out of their cartons before stocking the fridge... It is also worth mentioning that the lounge is connected to an open-air terrace with amazing views as well.The location of the hotel makes it a good option for someone needing to be in financial district or Soho, Tribeca areas.

And I purportedly received a ""Deluxe"" room. Unclear as to whether that was a Platinum upgrade. I hope not. Appears that this is a very old property so Sheraton was probably quite limited in what it could do with the place. It is absolutely not a Category 5 so don't be fooled. This is really a tourist hotel. A low 4 because of the great location (directly adjacent to Soho though Canal Street is not a nice street as everyone knows) and well maintained common areas. The Club Lounge and rooftop deck are very attractive. And the staff quite professional and friendly.

Our room was a standard size for NYC, which are almost always on the smaller size which is just fine. We had a floor to ceiling view of Canal Street which was great as we saw all the hustle and bustle of this very lively area. As always the beds at Sheraton are the most comfortable you will ever sleep in at a hotel - seriously. The air conditioner worked perfect and was ultra-quiet. The shower pressure was just right in a big walk-in shower so lots of room. The room was very clean and ""fresh"" with cool white sheets, pillows and soft fluffy comforter. The lounge bar was very nice and they have a vast selection of beers - even a seasoned beer connoisseur would be impressed and the barkeep, Tomas, was very helpful and pleasant! You are close to SOHO and China Town, and of course in the heart of TriBeca. We saw a concert at City Winery, which was within walking distance. We ate at Aqua Grill (FAB!!), also within walking distance. Had brunch at Landmarc, so good and within walking distance. We also took in the shady park on W. Broadway, literally around the corner from the hotel. We took a cab to Battery Park ($6 fare), to walk along the Hudson - so nice! You have it all here.

We could barely fit our two suitcases in the room, so a bit more space to mover around would have been nice. But as said they do have slightly larger rooms from the view of the floor map. Furthermore the room was just fine. Clean with a good bed. And as we were out most of the time that was all we needed. Bathroom was relatively spacious and modern so no complaints there. Internet in the lobby is complimentary, unfortunately you'll pay usd 10 per day in your room which felt a bit outdated. We didn't took the breakfast as there are enough possibilites closeby and nobody seems to take the breakfast. Then, location. Well Canal Street isn't much fun.

It's in a fun location right next to China town and walking distance to some great restaurants...TriBeCa Grill, Locanda Verde, and Bubbys to name a few. The rooms are TINY but we didn't mind as we don't spend much time in them. Everything was great until check-out. We checked our bags with the bellman because our flight didn't leave until 5:30. We told him we needed a cab later and he talked us into taking one of the town cars out front. I'm a frequent visitor to NYC and know that these can be a rip off so we declined at first but he insisted that they were trustworthy drivers and it would be $60 tip and tax included. We asked several times if he was SURE there wouldn't be any other charges. Once again we were reassured there were no hidden costs. We decided to go with it as it seemed the Sheraton was endorsing it. We also made sure the driver knew ahead of time we were going to two different terminals. When we arrived at the first terminal and my friend was getting her baggage out the driver told us we owed him $65 for the ride to the airport and another $15 to go to another terminal. We told him we weren't paying him anything extra as we had already negotiated the price with the bellman. He told us he didn't care what the bellman said, we owed him more. I got on the phone and called the Sheraton and explained our situation to the woman who answered. I asked if this was some kind of scam they were running on their guests. She assured me no it wasn't, their drivers are very trustworthy. She then connected me to the front desk where I explained again what was happening and this woman got the bellman on the phone who requested to speak to the driver. I handed my cell phone to the driver and after a few minutes the driver hands me my phone back and tells me fine, I'll drive you to the next terminal and he was not happy about it. I didn't feel comfortable getting in his car so I said no thank you and took the airbus to my terminal. Again, I wouldn't NEVER have taken the car if the bellman hadn't reassured me over and over that it was a trustworthy service. If I didn't have the nerve to call the hotel or had been in a big hurry I would have had to pay the driver more.

She jump onto the problem and corrected it right away with a smile. She gave us one room early and told us the other one wasn't ready yet which was fine with us. We took our bags up to one room and went on with our day.When we came back we got our room keys for the room that wasn't ready. We were upgraded and didn't know it yet. I have pictures of the room that I will post very soon but we were given a room with a porch that was as big as our room. It had a table and four chairs with it and it was a great place for the four guys to hang out and have a couple drinks and wind down from the hustle and bustle of the busy New York streets!!

The club level observation deck has a beautiful view and the continental breakfast exceeded our expectations. The room was clean, and while not exceptionally big, it was modern and had a great view. The shower was great and the water pressure was perfect.The Sheraton Tribeca is located on the border of Tribeca and Soho. There is lots of shopping to be had on Broadway, which is only 4 or so blocks away. Walking distance to Chinatown and Little Italy make for a nice visit as well. If you are a vegetarian, there is a place called 'Dojo' at 14 W 4th St(Btwn Bway & Mercer St). They have an excellent Soy Burger dinner with a soy burger patty, salad and brown rice for 5.25.. Thats right, only 5 bucks, unheard of for a dinner/lunch in Manhatten. Its a casual sit down place that also serves beer/ liquor.If you are looking to save money on your stay at the Sheraton Tribeca, there are some great options. If you need a quick snack, there is a cheap deli next door with everything from pizza, to sandwiches, subs and more. On the corner of W. Broadway and Canal there is a Bodega where you can buy beer to bring to your room if you dont want to spend crazy money on booze at the bars or club. If you have club-level access you can bring your drinks up to the 21st floor observation deck and enjoy the sights and sound of the city in style. If I had one complaint, it would be this. I booked my trip on Priceline.com and was supposed to get a Deluxe King room, with Club Level access. On check in there was no mention of the club access and when I tried to access the 21st floor for the club lounge I was denied entry and had to call down and explain to them my situation. They were happy to help, and looked up my reservation, and confirmed that I was indeed supposed to have that access, so Im not sure why it was missed in the first place. It caused some embarrassment, as I booked the room as a surprise for my girlfriends birthday and when the key card didnt work to the club lounge, the surprise was cut short and spoiled as we had to back to the room to call the front desk.Thats a small thing I guess overall, and my suggestion would be to make sure inadvance that they know you have club level access if you book through an outside source. It will save yourself some time/ embarrassment/ hassle.I travel to NYC frequently and would most likely stay there again.","Boston, Massachusetts",0,5.0

The beds are so comfortable that I get a beetter night sleep here then at home. I think I need a new bed at home. The staff is extremely helpful without that New York edge that many hotels have. The location can't be beat. a $6 cab ride lands you in midtown and the subway is just around the corner if you want to save a couple of dollars. One tip is that some cab drivers do not know where the hotel is. Just tell them that it is next to the post office on canal street.

On the website, you see only floor to ceiling windows, so I called after a few claustrophobic moments, and they gave me a smaller room, but I got the floor to ceiling windows. Room service during the royal wedding was a joke. They did not deliver what was on the menu, had multiple omissions, and the breakfast was late and cool. Oh, and 1 pot of water for tea with one tea bag (no selection of Tazo teas). This seems trite, but here is the big thing. I budget! I keep what I can charge in my account (bank credit/debit). I go out to a show and dinner, and my credit card is rejected (with plenty available). They keep my license and tell me to go to the show...straighten it out later. Well, couldn't enjoy the show, went back to the restaurant and still the card is not good. Couldn't use debit as we took out the limit...but there's plenty available. Call my parents to get a card number to pay the bill after the show...embarrassing! Of course the night was a disaster. Called my credit union the next AM, and they tell me the Sheraton charged...CHARGED my card an extra $400.00 IN CASE I ordered anything else. Now, if there are any attorneys out there, isn't charging my account without my authorization (and without telling me) a felony or at least fraud. I could have been arrested the night before, lost my job and reputation....everything, and were they Rabda or Steven (the manager) reactive or understanding....NOPE! Too bad, so sad! This is how we do it. Well, I've stayed all over the world. The hotels have the credit card info...if you left with a towel, they'd charge you. I believe this is the worse hotel experience I've had, save Costa Rica, where a friend died because of no medical supplies on premises (AED). So, what to do?

I had booked this hotel via our local travel agent (requesting a treble room, all endored on travel documents). On arrival we found that we had been booked a double! (Not the hotels fault, but Gold Medal). Rather than engage in the usual shoulder shrugging and 'it aint our fault' attitude that you get in some places, the duty staff, Zakiya McFayden and the day manager Steve Lamour made every effort to get us accomodated. Although they dont do trebles, Steve took us to several rooms that he felt may be suitable, eventually sorting us a very pleasant room that included a comfortable fold out couch. Not satisfied that we were getting the best from our accomodation and expectations Steve also gave us complimentary access to facilites that we hadnt booked. The hotel itself is set on Canal Street, a busy road near the Holland Tunnel which on occasion can get hectic with commuter traffic. We didnt find any issue with the traffic noise. After all, you ARE in one of the busiest cities in the World. You just have to turn on the air con if its too hot, and close the window!Our room was comfortable, well maintained, and had that clean smell you'd expect with daily visits by the cleaning staff. The usual room facilties (TV/tea & coffee, etc) were availble. The fold out couch was more than enough for me, and the hotel arranged extra bed linen/quilt. The hotel itself is well decorated and maintained. The staff are pleasant, accomodating, and refreshingly knowledgable about both Tribeca and New York in general.The food and drink prices are on a par with what you would get at any tourist city hotel anywhere in the world so I dont have any issues.Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Tribeca. As a base for exploring NYC we found it completely suitable for our needs. Set in quieter surrounds than any hotel near the mayhem that is Times Square. We had easy access to the subway/buses, or indeed a very pleasant walk up to Midtown along either Avenue of the Americas or 5th Avenue.The staff again need mentioning because they prevented this holiday turning into a disaster. They DIDNT need to provide complimentaries as it wasnt the hotels fault, but the fact that they did can only exemplify the very high standard od customer care & service......Next time we head for New York City I know where to book.....","Formby, United Kingdom",44,5.0

There was only one other person in the restaurant, so I could not have anticipated what was about to occur. I was seated straight away, and the server took my order immediately which was great. He also brought my beverage to me without delay. I ordered an egg white omelet listed on the menu, so no special order. I was then asked if I wanted fruit or potatoes and I opted for the fruit. However, I then sat for over 15 minutes without my food arriving. I did not get told by the server that there was any particular issue or delay in the kitchen. As I was getting increasingly frustrated, given that the restaurant was dead and no one except myself had ordered any food during this entire time (the 1 other person's food arrived a few minutes after I sat down ... I have no idea how long he waited for his!), I got up from my seat and walked over to the host area and asked if he was the manager. He said yes, I told him what had happened, and he then said he would go back to the kitchen to inquire. Meanwhile, a few minutes after I returned to my seat, another server brought my omelette and it had potatoes instead of fruit on the plate. I then asked for an explanation regarding why the order took so long AND why I was being given potatoes when I ordered fruit instead. This server was not the one who had taken my order, so she looked surprised and said she would return with it fixed. I then waited several more minutes, and it arrived. The manager then returned to the table to give me the most lame explanation, he said that the kitchen supports several areas of the hotel (room service, some club, etc.) as if that was supposed to make me feel better. I then said that it was shocking that it took 20 minutes to get an omelette when there was only me and one other person in the restaurant, he then repeated his previous explanation that the kitchen supports more than just the main restaurant. I then suggested that maybe there is not enough staff to which he responded by saying there are 2 chefs and this is the right amount and lack of staff is not the explanation. He then said he would comp the meal (would have been shocked at this point if he had not done so). The further upset was that although the omelette and fruit were ok -- nothing to write home about! -- the toast was burned! As I left the restaurant, I told him that I left the burnt toast and that I would be going to write this up on Tripadvisor. This was very unfortunate because although the hotel is on a very busy street -- Canal -- it is priced relatively well and is new which makes for a reasonably comfortable and good value hotel in New York. However, after the experience with the restaurant, I will not stay here again.","London, United Kingdom",113,3.0

As far as customer service...during my stay I had no major problems with Sheraton Tribeca, but not following through with complete customer service for guests after their stay means no returning clients! After staying almost a week at Sheraton Tribeca I realized I left behind my trench coat in the closet of my hotel room. I called the next day and found out that it was missing, but no other guests were assigned to that room. And no one but the cleaning lady was in it (the other woman that cleaned the room earlier during my stay remembers seeing my trench coat). The only solution they would provide for me was to claim it on MY insurance. After refusing I spoke with the manager of housekeeping who had to report this situation to the front office manager. It has been over a month since my theft and I have yet to hear back from this manager, Steven LaMoore. Whenever I call to speak to him, I only get that he's in a meeting or he's not available and emails and messages are supposedly sent to him to contact me back. I am told that he is busy but not even a courtesy call to let me know that he is aware of my situation or even an email in response would be polite. Maybe if I take legal action and file for litigation I will be taken seriously. I feel disrespected to not even get any sort of response back from the ONLY manager that seems in charge of matters of this nature.

The proximity to the subways was excellent as well - several train lines to choose from close to the hotel.

Massive beverage selection.Loads of craft beers and a liquor selection you wouldn't expect to see at a hotel bar. The bartender, Robert, gave me tons of attention and conversation - making sitting solo at the bar completely comfortable and entertaining.I stayed for 4 nights and I was able to carry on my daily routine without any bumps. Anything I needed was always readily accessible. Between the most comfortable bed and Starbucks coffee in my room and in the lobby I was less stressed than if I'd been waking up at home.Upon arrival to my room I found a hand written letter from the housekeeping mngr, Sophia, thanking me for my stay with them. Even when I had housekeeping service while I was out of my room, the housekeeper, Giselle wrote me another note. She even took notice of the coffee type I had been drinking/ the type of sugar I used and left extra!Every single employee I walked by made eye contact and said hello, or asked how my stay had been so far.  In my time there, I must have met the entire management/supervisory team - which tells me they are closely involved in everything that goes on - and very available.

Lowell (the General Manager) was very accommodating with all of our requests and put in a room with a second to none view of the Empire State Building and the Manhattan skyline. Amazing view. Could not stop looking out the window. The rooms were clean, with a good sized shower and uber comfortable king bed. Modern amenities (chairs, television, desk, etc.). The free bottle of water daily was a nice touch. The only downfall is that there is no in-room safe or fridge, although there is a room to keep your valuables behind reception.The staff was very polite, however, unfortunately, I did not find them as knowledgeable as they could have been.

The room was rather ugly. Our television broke on our second evening, and our request to fix it was untimely, despite the front desk's promise to send someone directly up to look at it. Also, the sconce in the room was broken as well as one of the electrical outlets I attempted to plug the hair dryer into. My biggest complaints were with the bathroom. The shower fixture was designed in such a way as to require one to blast oneself with cold water before arriving at the required temp, and the bath towels were rough and nearly as skimpy as the hand towels. Also, the toiletries provided are sub par. To have your linens replaced you have to have read one of the many in-room memos posted about the room, which state that this is only done upon special request. Finally, as we were leaving we were asked by the bellhop when we wished to depart (we checked out several hours later and were storing our bags at the hotel), and offered car service. Inquiring as to how much this would be, we were told $54, which is ridiculous, considering that we were able to catch our own cab for $20. Also, the way in which we were asked seemed to imply that it was somehow standard procedure. To a visitor unfamiliar with the ease with which one might secure a cab to LGA, I can see where they might prey on their guests.For the price, and considering the amenities offered by comparable hotels (terry cloth robes, newspapers, free wireless) I would look elsewhere for a hotel with more character.

It is my second stay at this Tribeca location. The lobby is in the new ""Aloft"" like style for Sheratons - copy Sheraton Brooklyn but larger space. The small gym was ill conceived. For example, the flat screen tv is on the wall behind all the cardio equipment so your back faces it. Maybe this is just their temporary gym. It definitely needs a redesign.What the hotel lacks in the gym, it surely makes up for in its Platinum lounge. They serve a fairly good breakfast, but the best part is the outside deck. Weather permitting, the rooftop outside patio views are great. Perfect place to reserve for a party.One big issue I encountered on both visits is the desert like dry air in the rooms.

This is unfortunate, since the decor -- a kind of heavy modernist/wood retro thing -- would benefit from a bit softer atmosphere. The current low room rates ($250 is the least expensive rate offered on the hotel's web site) are tempting, but as I discovered, that rate will only get you an extremely small room that's barely big enough to accommodate the king-size bed, too small for two people to do anything other than sleep and jostle to get by each other while en route to the bathroom or the tiny armoire which is the hotel's version of a closet in that size of room. So I opted to upgrade to their ""studio suite"", which was nothing more than a normal sized room -- and for that was forced to pay over $500, a rate that could have gotten us into a dozen other far more comfortable and appealing hotels in Manhattan which don't feel like a chain hotel. Oddly Sheraton has put the ""studio suite"" on each floor not in a corner but in the middle of the main hallway right next to the Coke machine + ice machine, enabling one to hear hallway conversations through the relatively thin door. Once in the ""studio suite"", I discovered that the bathroom fan was so noisy, and triggered by the bathroom light, that it might awaken your companion if you visited the bathroom while he/she was sleeping, and that using the internet cost another $25 per day. The windows were double-glazed, but traffic noise was still noticeable. The overly active HVAC unit was too efficient, streaming out cool air if you wanted only to lower the temperature a degree or two, or hot air if you wanted just to slightly warm it up. But somehow that went along with the clunky room furniture, which was upholstered to look like it was designed to withstand annual conventions of professional wrestlers. This isn't a hotel with any subtlety. Its use of space and choice of decor is tolerable only for short stays by those who don't plan to do anything in their room except sleep. The only saving grace is a faultlessly gracious and helpful staff, from the bellmen to the front desk to the restaurant.","Washington, D.C.",298,3.0

He makes amazing drinks, and has a personality that very hard to come by in New York. Also the front desk manager steven is amazing! He is super friendly, and the General Manager is friendly as well. He approached my wife and I and we spoke briefly for about 3 minutes. So long story short, I will be bringing my family back here for many more years to come. The hotel is not your ordinary hotel in many ways, I am still in awe at how the sheraton found so many great people to work there. Kudos to their human resources department!","Houston, Texas",1,5.0

It is wonderfully located between midtown and downtown with immediate access to all major subway lines. The shopping in nearby SoHo & Tribeca is wonderful. Traffic on Canal is congested because of the Holland Tunnel approaches and avoid the stretch of Canal just east of the hotel to avoid busloads of foreign tourists buying crappy souvenirs (although they're handy if you need a fast umbrella or ear muffs). The rooms are smallish but complete and perfect for a solo businessperson...we were a couple and made do just fine for the entire week. The shower is big and really nice...plenty of amenities too! Closet space is spare. They do have larger rooms available which I would recommend looking into for longer stays than overnite. Corner rooms with two windows look really nice and the ""05"" rooms on each floor are large. Higher floors are nicer because of the views which are stupendous. Try to use your Starwood status to bump up to larger accommodations. You may as well avoid the SPG floors because they provide nothing extra special as far as I could tell. They do a VERY nice job in the Club Lounge on the 21st Floor providing FULL breakfast, snacks, coffee drinks and beverages all day (24 hour access) and very tasty canapes with cash bar service in the evenings.

Go north and you will find so many nice frensh, Italian and spancish restaurants. Go on to Bleekerstreet and you will find Terra Blues for fantastic blues musik and The Red Lion for som Rock N Roll. There is a litte bit of trafik noise but after a glad night in Bleeker street you want notice. Lots of people book there first NY hotel at Time Square. We also did. Ended up taking a taxi down to Bleeker Street every night. There is too many people at Time Square. Go there to see a musical and thats enough.

The staff at this hotel are some of the nicest people, which can be a rarity in NYC. They have the New York energy without the typical New York attitude (I am from NY originally). The beds were unbelievably comfortable and there was very little to no street noise. The room was an average size for NY and it had all the amenities. Nice bathroom with great water pressure in the shower. Free internet was easy to get on and very fast. Good restaurants in the area and easy access to the subway. The doorman was able to get a cab quickly even on a busy day. The hotel is right on Canal Street which I thought would be an issue, but it is actually a positive. All the shops are just a short distance away and I needed to pick up a birthday present for my daughter. There is a Starbucks in the hotel and they had a good selection of food there as well. The views are fantastic (see if you can get a room with a view of Midtown). There are no tall buildings in the way of the view and you can see the empire state building and Midtown skyline. It looks particularly nice at night. The empire state building was lit up in tye dye for a Grateful Dead type concert that night. That was really cool. I usually have some negative comments, but I really can't think of anything. This is a gem of a hotel. I will be bringing the family on my next trip. There is a lot to keep them busy in the area while I visit clients.

I was only in NY for one day and night, and spent 3 hours of it waiting to be allowed into my room. Check-in was at 3pm, and I finallly got into my room around 5:45pm. I even arrived at 2pm to see if I could check in early. The lat the front desk said there were problems with the cleaning staff, and they were still working on my room, and it would only be about a 20 minute wait. One hour later they said they could not reach the maids to see what was going on. I spent 4 hours just sitting and waiting in the hotel lobby with my luggage, while I could have been out doing what I went to NY in the first place for. It was obvious after I was finally let into my room at 5:45pm that is was not a problem caused by the cleaning staff as I was told. This was a blatant lie on the front desk\'s part. There was no cleaning staff in sight- in fact, the shower was not even clean. I will never stay at a Sheraton again. There is no excuse for this, nobody who pays for a room should be made to wait for 3 hours AFTER check-in to get into a room, it is completely unfair, and a total rip-off- even at the discounted rate I was able to get. I did not get what I paid for. By the time I got my luggage into my room, I only had until 7 pm before most of the stores in that area (which was not in the safest spot) closed for the night. This was a big waste of my time and money. The front desk staff was RUDE and snobby. We did, however, eat at the restaurant there. The food was good, our server's name was August, and he was the only pleasant person in the hotel. Location is not the best, either. Neigherborhood is sketchy, but fairly close to good shopping.

Also, the staff was super-friendly, enthusiastic, and helpful. A word about the location, as a former resident of NYC -- if you are familiar with downtown and/or the subway system, this hotel is good because it's easy walking distance to SoHo, Chinatown, and Tribeca, as well as many subway lines (the closest being the A-C-E). If you aren't familiar with the city, the location may feel a little bit like a no-man's land, especially at night. The immediate one-block radius goes dead quiet at night, and because of that and Holland Tunnel traffic, the cabs tend to avoid this area.

The General Manager, Lowell Beebe-Center, was present, engaging and interested in making our stay as comfortable as possible. This feeling was also reflected in all of the staff. The bell staff and front desk were are especially pleasant and helpful. At all hours they were present, willing and able to help, plus they were just plain nice!The hotel is new, very clean and nice. The rooms were small, but I think that's fairly typical for NYC. I don't think they were any smaller than most, but don't expect a spacious room. That said, we were moving and had a dog, four full size suitcases and two carry-ons in our room and we managed just fine. I think for your normal couple of days in NYC, the room size was fine and they were clean and nicely decorated.Our only complaint about the room would be the lack of shelf space in the bathroom. The bathroom and shower area were large, very nicely done, but besides the sink, there was no place to put anything. That makes it a bit more difficult to get ready in the morning. I've seen some other reviews complaining about the location. I guess that all depends on where you think you are in NYC. The hotel is definitely on the north end of Tribeca which extends from Canal St. all the way down to Chambers. But for us that was a plus. We could easily walk through all of Tribeca, but also get to SoHo (lots of shopping), Chinatown and Little Italy. I wouldn't stay here thinking I was in the Financial District or Midtown. While those easy to get to, longer walks or easy subway rides, this is in Tribeca. For us, the location was perfect. Plus, there is a Zipcar location on Wooster, right across the street making it very easy to get a car for an hour or two if you need one.Overall our experience here was A+.

The staff tries really hard and the service and attitude is better than most NYC hotels. Hope it wasn't just because they were new and they don't get jaded after a while. Most of the staff tries really hard and that goes a long way. I will definitely return and hope they have the bugs worked out (and all the elevators running). Hotel smells brand spanking new when you walk in and is gleaming - even the employees are smart and well put together.Rooms are small, but acceptable for NY. Gym is great - BRAND NEW equipment so in excellent condition. Rooms are somewhat quiet for a NYC hotel. The location is ok - convenient if you have business in midtown/tribeca. Cabs do not know the hotel yet, so getting a cab takes a few minutes - they don't like to come down Canal trolling for fares. However, the bellhops were doing a good job telling the cabbies to come by more often, and were very willing to walk and find cabs. Again - excellent service attitudes, and am hoping it is not a case of their newness and not being as busy. I will definitely return to the hotel based just on the attitude of most of the staff (some bad apples), but the best overall service I have had in NYC in 2 years - including properties like the Essex and St Regis and the Peninsula. Being new there were a few bumps along the way with restaurant service etc. - we waited over 30 mins for a lunch order that was basically sandwiches. It didn't arrive and we had to go since we had a meeting, but we got held up by the staff again as they insisted on charging us for the 2 cokes ordered by the table (only items besides water). Not that I quibble with that - we drank the cokes, and can pay for them, but after taking 30 mins and not providing lunch - and then delaying us a further 10 mins while getting the charges run - as they say on SNL 'really?' Similar experience requesting a delayed check out - told ok by front desk, didn't get the warm fuzzies that it was secure and called again in the morning to verify, told nothing of the sort on file, and I could not be accomodated (1 hour extension request and SPG Gold) and would have to pay. Called and had my car service come and get me earlier figuring I could sit at the lounge in the airport, and was then called back by the operator and told I could have the late checkout as a special exception - made me feel it was a HUGE deal. Think more of a staff training issue, but fairly irritating. I give them a little leeway for being new.Bar area was excellent. They have an amazing selection of beers and even premium liquors. Someone knows his stuff here and takes it seriously and it shows. I haven't seen such a discerning beer selection in many hotels at this level anywhere in the world. The bar staff is friendly, and helpful. The service from the kitchen is still lacking, and being new, the staff does not know what the food should look like - a few dishes were served without major ingredients described in the descriptions, and the staff had no idea what they were or that they were missing. Bartender tried to fix the issues, but they were not major. One of the waitresses though merely shrugged to my colleague when he pointed out that the item he ordered was missing a key ingredient. Don't recall, details but imagine a cheeseburger minus the cheese.My colleague had lounge access, and the lounge is small and has really great service and the food is pretty good for a U.S. lounge. It has some strange lighting choices at a bar height table where the lights are exactly where your head would go (for average 5""8 people) - odd design and doesn't allow for using your laptop or sitting up straight. We didn't really get a feel for the lounge since it was a disaster for the first few days we were there and we jut gave up, but I think it will be a great bonus to this property at other times. The roof deck area has an amazing view and is very comfortable for an evening drink. Sheraton corporate was there filming for some promo the week we were there - which was odd that they would schedule that the first full week the place was open before they had their act together, but not a fault of the local property. The poor lounge manager was scurrying around in the evenings trying to accomodate the ad director and the models who were prancing around and re-arranging furniture and playing on their laptops and loudly speculating on what scenes would appeal to their demographic. From the sounds of it their target demographic is a 20 something on daddy's payroll. Poaching W's segment? Overheard the ad director talk about what he thought would be good images, and my colleague and I who both travel over 250k miles a year were chuckling since he had it pretty off in our humble opinions. Maybe in Australia or NZ where he was from (judging by his accent) business travellers have different needs. All I can say is that Sheraton was paying a lot of $$$ for some marketing whiz kids to jazz up their brand, and promote their lounges and I hope they get something good out of flying these guys all over the world to gum up operations in their lounges for a few days. They could start by not jamming up a property in a key market the first week it is open and inconveniencing the majority of the guests.Overall, this is one of the best SPG properties in the city, and the few teething problems aside, was my best hotel stay in NYC in over 3 years. It is still value for money and the attitudes of the friendly staff makes all the difference. The beer selection also does not hurt. I will definitely be back and have and will reccomend this hotel for business travel.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",21,4.0

This will be my hotel for all upcoming NYC travels - i'd also recommend it for personal trips with the family.",Seattle,1,5.0

I've been travelling to NY for the past 11 months, and stayed in nearly every Starwood hotel in Manhattan, and I must say that I haven't encountered such an eager, friendly staff in any of my visits. They were knowledgable and didn't miss a beat while checking me in, helping with my luggage, calling cabs, cleaning the room, or providing food and drinks after work.The hotel shines and gives off a very warm, comfortable ambience. The lobby and bar area is bright and lively and has been a good hang-out at night before I turn in for bed. I have access to the SPG lounge, which has been providing great food and one of the best views of Midtown from the expansive outdoor patio that I have seen yet. My room is cozy and very quiet at night, as I haven't been woken up yet -- slept great so far. I don't have any complaints, but if I had to comment, I'd say that the beds are just a tad stiff, although this is expected as they're brand new, and the room could be bigger, although no smaller than anything else I've experienced in NY, where space is a premium.I've just booked my stays through the end of the year, and look forward to staying at the hotel and experiencing the TriBeCa nightlife.","Chicago, Illinois",0,5.0

Everything is new and very clean. Excellent location with tons of great restaurants around and just off the subway. Spectacular view of the empire state building. Liam and Simone at the front desk were both incredibly accommodating and deserve extra praise and everyone else I’ve delt with has been very helpful. I travel frequently for business and this is my new favorite hotel in the NYC area. Really looking forward to continuing to stay here.,"Chicago, Illinois",2,5.0
