I'll get right to the issue I had: the water in the shower and the sink (both Hot and Cold) became scaldingly Hot. I was taking a shower and everything was fine but then the water became too hot. I tried to adjust it but it didn't become cool or cold. Just very hot. And I mean dangerously hot. Ok. Not great but I was able to sponge off the soap and figured I could wash my hair in the sink. Nope. The water coming out of the faucet was also only Hot. No cold. I called Front Desk from the hotel phone. Got connected to an operator named ""Maria"". She said an engineer would be up shortly. Called at 8AM and by 8:30AM, no one had come. So I dressed and went to check out. Front Desk person really didn't seem to take me seriously. Offered zero compensation. But he did say ""Have a nice day."" Very frustrating.","New York City, New York",4,3.0

The location of the hotel is ideal. 9th Avenue next to it can look pretty run down but the places to eat around there are great! We ate in the Westway and also Hudson's Bar and Grill. Would recommend both of these, especially Hudsons. We also had take away from the Lincoln Deli on the corner and it was amazing. Just disappointed we chose this on our last afternoon. The breakfast is not extensive but is good enough to get you set up for the day. I had bagels with Philadelphia or peanut butter and jam most days. My husband opted for the eggs and sausages. I was really disappointed that there was no bacon available the whole time we were there. The coffee is really nice too and is available all day which is perfect for when you get back from a long day. It is actually nicer than Starbucks!We had issues with our room due to water coming into the bathroom from the room above. Also on check in they asked us if we wanted our room cleaned every day or would we prefer a late checkout instead. We opted for the late check out and just had to ask at Reception to get our bins emptied and towels changed. We had to chase things up with Reception a few times and it looks like they either don't communicate with maintenance and housekeeping or maintenance and housekeeping don't listen. The room we had was absolutely fine and while it was small it was still ideal for what we needed. A bath would have been a bonus after a long day out walking. We had paid for a city view but the view we got was looking at the building across the road. No city view at all. I will take this up separately with hotel.com. Also the noise from outside can be quite bad especially with fire engines and police cars. I asked at reception for ear plugs and they were able to provide me with them. Not the hotels fault at all, just the area it is in.All in all if you are looking for a place to crash while you visit NY and don't want to spend a lot of money I would absolutely recommend this hotel.",United Kingdom,13,4.0

The room we was fine with little noise, which we were grateful for being in times square. AMAZING SHOWER. Comfy beds. Room was a little small for two people, but it's fine as you don't spend much time in your room when you're in NY. The hotel is massive and with only 2 lifts which was a little annoying but being in NY you don't spend too much time at the hotel so wasnt an issue. The big issue for me was after agreeing to the go green policy at check in, (no housekeeping for duration of stay and you get a late check out as a reward, which I thought was great, as I'm all for the environment and late check outs) I was gobsmacked when it was evident that there was no go green policy whatsoever at breakfast. Paper plates which are not reusable, single use plastic knives and folks, single use coffee cups, is it too much to ask when I'm paying for breakfast to have a normal plate, knife and folk so I can cut my waffle? The breakfast itself was poor to say the least, but giving the cost of our stay I honestly cant complain, I simply grabbed a coffee and bagel and left. If you're looking for a cheap stay in NY, if you need somewhere simply to sleep as you will be out all day and night, and don't mind going elsewhere for breakfast, Hampton inn is your hotel. But if you're environmentally conscious, maybe don't stay here. ","Swansea, United Kingdom",25,4.0

When I went to check out I asked the front desk about these charges and she stated they will all be removed and I will only be charged for the night of $126.88. Days later I check my statement and I have been charged $126.88 PLUS $172.12. I called numerous times to the hotel and left voice messages until I finally got ahold of someone. They said that they will check and contact me back. I received an email stating that the safe (which i NEVER used or touched) was “broken” and that is why I am being charged the extra $172.

Stayed here recently for 4 nights. Location is so convenient. On a block with other properties, in fact there are 3 together 1 after another. All 3 are currently under refurbishment with scaffolding in front covering so a little difficult at first to see the correct entrance. Lobby is small(ish) but has a couple sitting areas. Check in desk is split by a large column, so creates a break in line of sight in case. Initial check in was rough, not the warmest welcome and actually a little standoffish. Follow up with all other staff was better. Welcomed back each time upon entering, hello from everyone! Breakfast was traditional HI offerings. Staff worked extra hard to keep it all clean and stocked in this smaller breakfast area and did a good job. As others have stated, seating is at a premium in the breakfast area. King room was fine for 1 but would be tight for 2 people to stash belongs and maneuver around the room. Closet contained ironing board and iron as well as the safe. Bureau had a couple sliding drawers on as well as concealed the fridge. Desk was appreciated. Loads of outlets all over, included wifi was fast and appreciated. Bathroom is small. Small. If the stall shower wasn't narrow enough, there is a grab bar smack in the middle of the wall. There was no way to not touch it constantly when showering. There are 2 elevators for this building. Arrival day, 1 was down and there was an operator working the 2nd. To come down, you had to call the front desk and they would come fetch you as no buttons were working. This was corrected during my stay and both seemed to be working properly. That said, I requested and received a room on a low floor (4th) and took the stairs most of the time to avoid the waits. That worked well until I noticed the handle from the stairwell to the 4th floor was off and laying on the ground. I let them know at the front desk and was told an engineer would be sent to remedy. Returned late that evening after walking the entire city to climb the stairs...to find no handle at all. Trudged back down and got in line for an elevator. Property has an excellent location just need to pay attention to the workings. That said, there was constant sawing and hammering all day everyday (thankfully not at night).

The usual value and quality we expect from Hampton Inn were there. As far as the negative reviews are concerned, remember that this is located in the busiest spot in one of the world’s largest cities. There is construction, prices will be higher, there are poor people, hotel rooms in mid-priced hotels are smaller, and you may have to walk half a block to hail a cab. If you’re not a total rube, you’ll be fine. The staff was very friendly and helpful and there were ample vending machines, ice, free coffee/tea/hot chocolate 24/7.

The rooms are clean and have coffee makers, a safe, a closet, a huge tv, free Wifi, an iron and board, outlets near the bed, a desk and chair, a refrigerator and an ice bucket. The bathroom was well-stocked. The rooms are smaller than other Hampton rooms we’ve stayed in, but keep in mind that we’ve stayed at another boutique hotel where the door barely cleared the bed when opened! Again, space is precious in this metropolis. Breakfast is free, but the eating area is small and cramped and the food is standard meh. On a busy day you can just take your food back to your room to eat or visit one of the various diners within walking distance. The only negative about the stay is that the staff could warn customers ahead of time that one of the elevators was out and to plan for an extra wait.

This was definitely not the case with this hotel. I arrived around noon on a Friday. I expected my room to not be ready as check in time was 3pm. As expected my room wasn’t ready however I was met with the rudest employee I have ever dealt with at a hotel (and I travel a lot). Eye rolls, loud sighs when asking to store bags and more really didn’t make me feel welcome. Upon arrival back at the hotel at 4pm my room was still not ready. I had pre-selected my room using the Hilton honours app so the staff switched me to another room within the same category. The room was on a lower floor and there really is no view to speak of so I didn’t object. It did bother me that I was not recognized for my Hilton gold status and that the staff charged the wrong credit card even though I made it clear which card I wanted processed. The elevator waits at the hotel are horrendous. At check in times the line stretches nearly out the building as only two small elevators service 32 floors of rooms. The rooms are small as is expected with NYC but adequate however the room was far from clean upon arrival. Stains on the carpet and mirrors, a dirty bathroom and a filthy air conditioner/heating unit makes one feel uncomfortable with staying in the room. The room has a small fridge and although I was assured it was stocked with water (another Hilton Honors perk) it was not. Upon checking out the room, I found all fixtures (towel racks, toilet paper dispenser etc) were loose and nearly falling off the walls, the TV did not work, nor did the ice machine on our floor. The location of the hotel and proximity to main tourist attractions such as Times Square is decent and is a short walk. I did not partake in the hotel breakfast mainly due to the extremely limited space in the dining area. The area holds about 12 - 15 guests comfortably and the hotel obviously holds far more even when at partial occupancy so it was just easier to walk to nearby offerings. All in all I was very disappointed in this Hilton experience. I spent a good deal of money and substantial honors points for a 2 night stay that did not live up to the Hilton brand. I will consider using another brand the next time I return to NYC. ","Binbrook, Canada",52,2.0

Having stayed at Hilton Hotels in both Dubai and London I’m honestly shocked they let their name be associated with this dump. I understand this is not a Hilton, but if you’re going to charge Hilton prices then you don’t expect student hostel facilities or service. I visited here as part of a group and don’t remember any one of my travel companions having anything positive to say about this place. Upon arrival the check in process was long and unnecessarily difficult. How can it take 30 minutes to check into a room? What they call a twin room here most people would call it a large wardrobe. To say the rooms are small is doing them an injustice. A toddler would find the room claustrophobic. The service staff were rude, but then I guess that was my fault for taking the only working elevator in the building to the 17th floor and interrupting there chat. That is when I could use it! Most of the time it seemed as if it was being used as a service elevator for god knows what. But I guess I owe them thanks as I walked up and down the stairs from the 17th floor I now have the legs of a rugby player. Just to clarify the other elevator was constantly out of order during our stay. Breakfast was a joke! I walked in on the first morning and picked up what I thought was a plastic decoration. To my amazement I was told it was an egg. It didn’t get any better when I was told the warm brown tasteless water was actually coffee.

He told me he didn't like my tone, and that I could always leave and find another hotel. I would have left but I was part of a large group and this would have caused further issues. To be fair to David he did apologise to me the next day and admitted it hadn't been his best day. The breakfast is a joke. Complete chaos for food which is very basic all in paper cups and plates and no space. I therefore had breakfast in nearby cafe.

I again asked to speak to the manager and David spoke to me. Again no service recovery offered and a request from me for a reduction for all of these issues was firmly refused. He then however gave me his business card and assured me he would look after me next time I was in New York. I somehow dont expect I will be returning to this hotel.In summary very poor quality, no customer service ethos and not a nice location even if it is close to Times Square. There is nothing going for this hotel and it not even good value. There are plenty more hotels in New York and I would urge people to avoid this.The manager did little to resolve customers genuine grievances, however to be fair to him and his team you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear.As for Hilton, if this is a reflection of your standards I wont be staying in your hotels again.",,4,1.0

The rooms were on the small side but it is a three star so not unexpected. There were issues with reception at both ends of our stay and what ought to have been simple issues proved difficult to resolve. I am unsure whether this a because of a general malaise in the management of the hotel or inexperience of the particular staff involved.These were however minor irritants compared to the absolutely abysmal breakfast experience. Coffee from machines in paper cups, paper plates and plastic cutlery which I admittedly didn’t have to use much due to the spectacularly unpalatable food. I have never experienced worse breakfast anywhere in the world!We ended up one floor up in this multi story hotel despite having requested a high room and that having been acknowledged by the hotel in the booking receipts. In the event, when the room key was issued we walked into the room to find it already occupied. After a lot of heated negotiations with reception staff we eventually managed to secure a twin room as booked despite being repeatedly told they only had doubles left when we repeatedly explained the unsuitability of that for two straight male friends. The low floor transpired to be a blessing in disguise as there were continual lift problems during our stay resulting in some of our colleagues having to walk up and down over 20 floors.My conclusion will probably mean little to Americans but Basil Fawlty running this hotel would be a vast improvement!","London, United Kingdom",0,1.0

The check in time was 3:00 pm, Saturday, September 28. We had dinner reservations and were looking forward to using the facilities in the rooms, and changing prior to dinner. 3 p.m came and went...so did 4...at around 4:40 I received a text that the rooms were now ready. Unfortunately this would entail us rushing back to the hotel and even had we done so we would not have made a 5:30 reservation on time. I complained to the front desk. They did the right thing for our friends by refunding half the room rate. I paid in points. The front desk personnel assured me that they would be returning half the 70000 points, or 35000 to my Hilton Honors card. I asked for a receipt and they gave me one for the cash but said they could not give me anything for the points. 24 hours later I received an email from the hotel advising me that they would not be crediting the points to my account and the refund for our friend's room was all they would do. I complained to Hilton Honors and was told they would circumvent the hotel and credit the points back to the card themselves. I have another 24 hours to go to see if that was done. Well, let me tell you a few more things about Hampton Inn Times Square South: The breakfast was lame. The eggs were powdered, the fruit ran out and was never replenished, the only breakfast ""meat"" was a sausage gravy to go with the biscuits...no bacon, no sausage, nothing else.And there were not enough tables to accommodate the throngs of guests who showed up to eat. After a very dissatisfying breakfast, we went to our rooms, packed up, and stood in front of the elevator (one of only two) for at least 20 minutes, during which time the elevator stopped on our floor (19th) twice. The first time the cab was packed and there was no room. The 2nd time, it was just slightly less packed so we sent our wives down and my friend and I walked the 19 floors down to the lobby. I would suggest staying at any other Hilton property except Hampton Inn, Times Square South, 337 39th St. The area is a little seedy too, as it is located near the Port Authority Bus Terminal.","Port Jefferson, New York",3,2.0

We had waits of 30-40 minutes to use the elevators in the morning. This is unacceptable when you are trying to get somewhere on time. * The kids like the breakfasts.

The room was small but of a good standard. The double bed was comfortable and very big, the flat screen TV was decent, the bathroom was a good standard. There was air conditioning in the room. A huge bonus was the fridge inside the room, which we used to store fruit, sparkling water and other drinks. There was also an iron and an ironing board, which we used and a hair dryer. The location of the hotel is good. It is located on a back street, which meant there was little street noise. So we were able to sleep well. The hotel is also located near the metro (42nd Street Times Square), about a 5-10 minute walk away. We were able to get from the JFK airport to the hotel easily, using the Air Train followed by the metro.The hotel has about 30 floors, and only has two lifts for the whole hotel which is not enough. This means you can be waiting some time for a lift to become available, especially if you are on the ground floor and the lifts are on the top floors. Our room was on the 4th floor, so we were able to use the stairs no problem if a lift wasn’t readily available. But if our room was much higher than that, we obviously would not be able to do that. TOP TIP: Ask for a room on as low a floor as possible.The breakfast room is not very big, and it gets very crowded. We stayed at the hotel for one week. We had trouble finding seats on the Sunday, but had no problem on the other days. The breakfast selection was ok, and included scrambled eggs or an omelette (there is one option each day), sausages or Canadian ham (one option each day), bagels, breads rolls, toast, sweet muffins, bananas, yoghurts, cereal, boiled eggs. There is tea, coffee, hot chocolate, orange juice, apple juice. There is also a waffle machine, where guests can easily make fresh waffles together with syrup, chocolate and cream. What really shocked us, was that the breakfast only provides paper plates and plastic cutlery. This is a Hilton hotel, so we couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t a big problem, but we thought it was strange.Guests can help themselves to free hot drinks 24 hours a day. This can be found next to the breakfast area on the same floor of the reception. We had a few hours to use on our last day, so after checking out, the hotel kept our bags for us at the hotel which was appreciated. Another tip is the Upside Pizza takeaway near the hotel, which served really excellent pizza. When exiting the hotel, turn left and you will find it at the next crossroads.All in all, a pleasant stay. But be sure to ask for a room on as low a floor as possible because of the lift problem.",Scotland,35,4.0

The next morning after a very uncomfortable sleep and just wanted to enjoy our holiday, we complained again and somehow it got fixed that day. The room was still cold but more bearable and we just got on with it as we were in New York and Just wanted to enjoy it!! The room wasn’t brilliant and in the pictures provided you can see that. It felt rather dirty and not well kept. The bed was comfortable and clean thankfully. Our toilet was also really noisy and meant we couldn’t flush it during the night without waking each other up ‍♀️ Breakfast was good, and I couldn’t get over how small the dining area was, and bins were constantly full and overflowing. For the size of the hotel there was always queues just to sit down. We often took our breakfast back to our rooms. It was a buffet style and there was loads on offer including cereal, hot food, a waffle machine, a toaster and selection of fruit. It was paper cups and paper plates so did feel a little like a school canteen lol. But overall the food was yummy and it was enough to set you up for the day. Overall I wouldn’t stay here again, but the hotel is a short walk from the Empire State Building, madison square gardens and Times Square so it is very central. Also the daily fresh cookies was a lovely extra and they were yummy, and on Valentine’s Day they gave out free chocolates. The reception staff were brilliant and always greeted you each day with a smile no matter how busy and hectic reception was. Which was nice :) just a shame some things let the place down.

The room was small but clean and bed was comfy. Shower pressure was good despite the high floor room.Each floor only has 6 rooms so noise from lifts and other guests was minimal. The issue however is the windows offer poor sound proofing and the noise of vehicle horns, trucks all night and construction going on until at least 2am was very intrusive. Ear plugs did help but not ideal for a $250 per night stay. A room on the opposite side of the hotel may be better than those on the street side. The hotel only has 2 lifts servicing over 30 floors so at busy times you could be waiting a while or annoyingly stopping on what seems like every floor on the way up / down. Due the type of building there is not a lot can be done about this but worth bearing in mind.

Our initial choice (the Element Times Square West) was a complete and utter disaster, as on the night we arrived, we discovered that despite a confirmation e-mail from them a few days before arrival, they had no room for us (which they attributed to ""a computer glitch."") The end result was us being sent to a hotel in Queens, which we didn't get into until almost 2 AM.We had NO confidence whatsoever in that hotel following this incident & did not want to return there for the remaining nights we were in town.Thankfully, after checking my Hilton Honors app, I discovered this hotel was available at a good AAA rate for the rest of our visit to the city. So after telling Element we would not be returning, we made a reservation here--and I'm SO glad we did! When we arrived the next morning between 11 and 12, we were greeted by GM David & his awesome staff, who, after sympathizing with us about our unfortunate events of the previous night said, ""We have a room ready for you; you can go on up and get settled."" Totally unexpected and most definitely appreciated!We had a very nice, clean King room (1806) which was next to the elevator & offered a view of West 39th Street. Our bed was very comfortable! (I don't always sleep well when traveling, but definitely enjoyed some zzz's here.) Room size wasn't an issue for us & we didn't feel cramped in by it at all. While we missed having a microwave to warm up leftovers, it was great to have a mini-fridge for storing soft drinks, bottled water (and slices of Junior's cheesecake). Water pressure was good, although we did have to wait just a little bit for the warm/hot water in the shower. No issues with the complimentary wi-fi, either. We did experience some street noise due to construction on West 39th (Really? Who thinks it's a bright idea to fire up a jackhammer at 8AM on a Saturday?), but if you bring some earplugs/earbuds, you shouldn't have any problems. Most of all, it was wonderful to encounter such friendly staff members! Every time we went out and came back in, we received a genuinely warm & friendly greeting from those on duty.

The room was a good size for us, a couple and a 7 year old. Returned from dinner after travelling 12 hours we just wanted to sleep but that window was soooo noisy it was louder than being on the 747! I put ear plugs in, no better. I thought maybe this is the way it is as it's very busy outside so I just got on with it. By day 2 I was sleep deprived. The constant low hum was driving me crazy. I reported it at 6am, nothing. Again at 8am, then a nice maintenance guy arrived and said he'd fix it when we were out if that was OK. If he couldn't fix he'd request a move for the next 3 nights. Perfect. Come back later on and there is a ridiculous effort of some grey insulation tape around the window which did nothing! I rang down again, they will send someone up... Nothing. I got fed up in the end and blocked the bottom with towels. How ridiculous but I didnt want it to spoil our stay so I just got on with it. At check out they didn't even ask about our stay just took keys! Positives-Geraldine the breakfast ambassador is fantastic. Lovely, friendly, helpful with tips and looked after us-thank you! Breakfast was really good, fresh, varied, and well stocked. Around 8am it gets crazy but we were awake early so had lovely breakfasts. Took fruit out with us and also little lunch bags in foyer with water, snack etc in. Elevators were OK for us longest wait was 5 mins. The complimentary tea and coffee were fine and a nice touch. The bell boy was very helpful too.

There is nowhere to store your clothes - fine we can live out of the suitcase, great when there’s somewhere to actually put them! Currently they live by the door when we are in the room - god forbid we need to get out in an emergency! As soon as we wake we move them onto the bed so we can try and get ready. Nowhere to hang coats - basically no storage at all! I spoke to reception and they advised that all the rooms are the same size except floor 9 which has slightly larger rooms. They said they would hold a room on there for us to come back to tonight to move - got back and they had put someone else in there! I know NYC rooms are notoriously small but this is ridiculous Reception looks tired. The breakfast room and food are ok but it’s a free for all.

The sheets the first night were stained. My fiancé and I we’re extremely surprised in the condition of things. When we told the staff member in the hall way, he said “it is New York”, they are in every hotel. I call BS! I have been in New York 4 times and have stayed in hotels that don’t have these issues. I have stayed in about 85-90 hotel stays combined between Hilton, Marriott, and hotels.com bookings, and haven’t had a response like this when expressing a concern. I am a gold member of the Hilton program, and have never had service like this. I think if he would have handled it better, i would have been a bit less frustrated with Hilton. When we asked to change rooms the staff members told us it was New Years and everything was sold out, unless I we agreed to pay the new rate then they could see if there was another room. Our friends booked a hotel in the marriott, and invited us to stay with them after we told them about how gross our rooms were. The hotel would not refund us our stay so we can go book at another hotel. I have 6 documented emails to Benedicta the manager, and several documented phone calls, but they will never respond to me, and will not get me to the right people to talk to.

Plus, they offer breakfast and that's hard to find hotels that offer breakfast these days. When we first arrived, we were unable to get into our room because it wasn't ready. We left our luggage and explored the city. It is just about 10 minutes walking from Times Square which was nice. After 5 pm, we came back and our room was ready. The room is small which is expected in New York. We took a nap and went back out. Returned to the hotel about 10 pm. The shower head was broke. Water was spraying everywhere. It took 3 phone calls and over 2 hours for someone to come and fix it. It's late, we were rained on and had traveled that day so just wanted a hot shower. That was annoying. Then the shower itself is super small. There was a huge handicap bar that you can hold onto in the middle of the shower on the wall so you couldn't move around good. The water pressure was almost non-existent. The next day, we went to breakfast and the room was just so small. They need a bigger area for people to enjoy their meals. We went out for the day, came back and asked concierge for some decent pizza places to order from. She was useless. A concierge should have a good idea of some decent take out. She had no clue. She just looked on her computer and did what I could have done, I would have done it better. So we ended up going out. Got back to the room and NO toilet paper! Sooooo, an hour later, we had toilet paper. Shouldn't housekeeping have checked that?Overall, the experience was fine. I was irritated because simple things like a shower working and having toilet paper shouldn't be an issue when staying at a hotel. Those are the main necessities.The location was good. The front desk help was good. Concierge is worthless. If you want a cab, walk down to the main streets because you won't get one in front of the hotel and there is no one there to help get one for you. Overall, it's decent for a place to sleep.

It was barely a problem at all. Sure, there were only 2 elevators but it's not really a big hotel. The longest we ever waited was a few minutes, maybe 5 at the most and that didn't occur often. Sometimes we waited only seconds. Don't let this feature turn you off staying at this hotel. All of the staff were very friendly and accommodating. When we first checked in I could smell vomit on the carpet in our room near the aircon so the smell was being blown around the room. I mentioned it the next morning and that night we were moved into a new room and given a Macy's gift voucher for the trouble. We had free use of the laundry facilities in the hotel next door which was extremely handy. The rooms were a bit cramped but that's common in New York apparently and we got a good price as we booked 10 months in advance. The price of our room 1-2 months was almost double what we paid. The location was great, just a five minute walk to 42nd St subway and to Times Square. The staff would make fresh cookies each evening to grab on the way back through the lobby and they'd always say hello. The only disappointing thing I would say was the breakfast but I found this at a lot of the hotels we stayed at on our trip around America. It may have just been the budget we were sticking to also. There wasn't a lot of variety in the breakfast and it wasn't all that healthy. Maybe it's just the difference in cuisine. At least it was something to fill our bellies with before setting out each day. Depending on the time you went to breakfast, it could be busy but we never had nowhere to sit.

I'd read mainly good reviews with the odd negative review. Yes, the rooms are a tad on the smaller side but if you're from the UK or Europe they are equivalent to a London, Paris or Rome hotel on a similar budget. I personally thought the rooms were very good. If you're in New York staying here then the room is a base. It's a really good base. The lifts can take a few minutes but just have some patience. I emailed prior with a couple of minor concerns and got prompt and very reassuring replies. We arrived at midnight local time and the staff are brilliant. The reception was busy but we felt like we were the only guests. I got up at 5am the next morning, got hot coffee from reception and wandered into Times Square at 530 on a Sunday Morning. Safer than walking in Central London at a similar time. If you complain about breakfast at this hotel then you aren't on the right budget. The food is fresh, loads of it, and the staff are really friendly. You may have to wait a few minutes for a table but so what. It's New York and won't take long. My wife emailed ahead saying out visit was for my 50th. I want to say a belated thank you to all the team at Hampton Inn for your fantastic gift it meant a great deal. I'd you want a good hotel, friendly staff, great food, Times Square about 7 minutes walk, subway 4 minutes and have a budget then this hotel fits the bill.

The hotel is a few blocks from Times Square on a quiet side street close to the Cruise Port and about a 35 minute cab ride from LaGuardia in normal traffic. Make sure you have the exact address as there are several Hampton Inns in NY. Staff are friendly and very helpful. The lady at the Concierge was pretty useless and not nice. Considering that as a traveler new to the area they would staff the Concierge with a better person. Rooms are small, typical for New York, a very compressed area, however comfortable. The beds firm with lots of pillows. Storage is in a small cabinet with little space. This is a tall thin high rise building and unless you request a top floor room there is little to no view of the city. The bathroom was adequate for our needs and the room very clean with plenty of towels. Due to the size of the building the rooms are very close to the elevators and are noisy at times. Elevators are a joke. We were on a higher floor and sometimes it took 15 minutes to go up or down with the foyer space being a tight squeeze to wait. Breakfast is included and offers a good selection of hot and cold foods. Suggest getting there before peak times as seating is limited although tables turn over frequently. Considering the price and location The Hampton Inn Times Square is an excellent value. We would stay there again.","Brights Grove, Ontario",158,4.0

It said one rate, but I was charged a higher rate. I called and they tried to tell me it was taxes and fees. It wasn't. I only added up room rates and came up over charged over $100 more. When I called again, I was told that they would look into it and i would receive a refund on my card. When that didn't happen within the expected 5 business days, I called again. They didn't even have the refund recorded.I will say I had an extremely pleasant stay here. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room, while expectedly small since it's NYC, had plenty of outlets and amenities. I even used their business center while there and was pleasantly impressed. The breakfast was varied enough that I didn't get bored with the food. The 24/7 coffee bar had tea, hot cocoa, and a microwave, which I was able to use for my delicious Italian leftovers. The hotel itself does not have room service on site, but there is an outside room service available (be prepared for about an hour wait) which was convenient and reasonably priced.If it wasn't for being overcharged and then being given the run around about refunding, it would have gotten 5 stars for me, but I feel as if I've been cheated.","Smyrna, Tennessee",1,2.0

It's not really even in Times Square, but it is only half a mile away, so that's not the main problem. The problem is that 39th street, between 8th Ave and this hotel, is really sketchy. 39th is your walking route to get to the subway or Times Square. Once you get to 8th, it's less sketchy, but you first have to walk past homeless people sleeping on the street at all hours of the day, others openly smoking pot, and various other R-rated situations. Not our first trip to NYC and we know what to expect, but this area was definitely worse than expected. The closest subway stop is 2/10 mile away, the 42 St - Port Authority Bus Terminal and subway station. Unfortunately, this station only serves the A-C-E trains, which are not the main trains for tourists. We found ourselves mostly walking 1/2 mile to the Times Sq - 42 St station, which services the N-Q-R-S-W-1-2-3-7 trains, which will take you virtually anywhere, and this station is actually linked underground by a VERY LONG passageway to the Port Authority station, which can be extremely HOT, but can be very convenient, especially if it is raining -- duck underground at the nearby Port Authority station and walk to this station. The subway is expansive and you can purchase a 7-day unlimited pass for $33, which is a bargain. Regarding the hotel ... there's only 6 rooms on each floor, but it is 30+ floors tall. Our 2-double bed room was extremely small, even by NYC standards, based on our experience. The staff were very nice and accommodating, especially the staff serving breakfast. Breakfast was nice each day. One day Housekeeping did not service our room at all and another day had not serviced it by 5 pm, but the front desk sent towels when requested. In retrospect, I wish we would have stayed elsewhere -- location of the Hampton Inn Times Square Central appears MUCH better and worth a few $ more.","Nashville, TN",70,3.0

In my opinion this hotel does not meet Hilton Standards. I was a late check in on Friday evening, I called the hotel at 9pm to let them know I would be arriving late. Upon my arrival the front door was locked, and the front desk refused to let me in without a room key, so tell me, how was I supposed to check in? I had to actually CALL the front desk from the door to have her let me in. I utilized my E-Check in service from my application to speed up my check in time, NOPE. I spent 35 minutes standing in the lobby waiting for the person on the desk to HAND ME KEYS. That is all they needed to, my credit card had already been authorized, and I had already verified my information. The point of E-Check in is to expedite the check in process, and this certainly did not happen. The person on the front desk did NOT follow E-check in protocol at all. The hotel advertises itself as recently renovated, while this may be true for some the furniture, the carpet in my room was stained, and looked dirty, and the bathroom mirror was chipped and scratched. The hotel is also crammed into a very tight building, elevators are hard to access, they are in a weird spot, and they move extremely slow, if I was not on the 23rd floor, I would've used the stairs.

I wanted a nice, modern hotel at a reasonable price that was centrally located and included breakfast. I got the room at a price that was better than any of the 3rd party websites by going to Hilton.com and requesting the AAA rate. Also, Unlike many of the larger hotels in the area, there is NO Resort Fee, which would have been a dealbreaker! This place was just what we wanted and it was topped off by the most amazing staff! We were welcomed by Jim when we arrived. Jim’s humor and smiles were refreshing after our long trip. Next morning at breakfast we were greeted by a pair of magicians, Junior and Amanda. I call them magicians because a swarm of guests would wipe out the food and in a few minutes the buffet would be restored ! The always smiling Leticia would help out at times while still supporting the front as well! After things calmed down, supervisor Mabel stopped by our table as she helped the other staff to recover from the breakfast crowd. Because this guests at this hotel were mostly tourists, most of us would sleep in a bit later than the business guests, there would always be a swarm of guests between 8 and 10 am that would overwhelm the elevators and breakfast area. The staff handled this amazingly well! I would also like to thank the management for continued breakfast service after the 10 am posted closing time. So many other properties that I have visited will start dismantling the buffet 30 minutes before closing time so that everything is gone at closing. Not at the Hampton Inn! And this is one of the many reasons that I will stay here the next time I visit NYC! I almost forgot a few other things. The hotel has a fairly small footprint with only 6 rooms on each of the 32 floors and the rooms are smaller than I have experienced at Hampton Inns elsewhere, but the rooms are great! It had at least 9 USB charging ports and a dozen 110v outlets all within easy reach. There is storage behind the mirror in the bathroom AND the cabinet has a mirror on both sides of the door!

Nice welcome at check in and was given a room on the 26th floor. Room cost almost $2000 for total stay. A $50 a night charge was held on my credit card. The room itself was average size with 2 double beds squeezed in to it. There was only 1 single wardrobe which was ok for us 2 but if 4 people shared this room they would struggle to put their clothes away and there wasn't much floor space either, but as I understand it, it is common for New York hotels to be not so big. Room had a fridge, safe and a good air conditioning unit. View out of window was the back of another hotel. The one thing that hankered our stay was there was a smell in the room that we couldn't fathom where it was coming from. The smell would hit you as you walked in the room but after blasting the air-con for 10 minutes it would go away. I can only describe the smell as being like smelly feet but we packed all our footwear away one day and the smell would still be there when we got back from being out. Breakfast was on the ground floor at the back of the hotel. It wasn't a very big breakfast area and was busiest between 9-10am. There was hot and cold options as well as a crepe and waffle maker. I was disappointed to see that there was paper plates and plastic knife, fork and spoons. I didn't expect that for a Hilton branded hotel. The most annoying thing about our stay here was the lifts. There are only 2 lifts in this hotel for 32 floors which are also used by housekeeping. Some mornings when everyone is going down for breakfast we would wait in excess of 10 minutes for the lift to arrive on our floor.Despite our frustrations the hotel was in a good location just off 8th Avenue and a 10-15 minute walk from Times Square and Penn Station.Hotel also provided tea and coffee at eh back 24/7.Its difficult to judge whether this hotel is value for money as this was my first time in New York and don't know what else to compare it with but I would probably try another hotel if I ever return to New York.","Enfield, United Kingdom",8,3.0

How a hotel with 32 floors and 6 rooms per floor can only have 2 elevators. Be prepared to wait A LOT for an elevator, I was on the 27th floor, I recommend a lower floor.

They told us another family had just shown up and paid for 3 nights and wanted our specific room. Instead of inconveniencing the second family (many hours before their check-in) they made us go back to our room and pack up our stuff.

The compensation we got for this inconvenience - three $1 ponchos and three bottles of water. The only advantage we got to moving to the much smaller room was that the flying gray gnats, stained carpet, and bad smell of the first room were not present in the second room and we were more comfortable in a king bed than the two doubles. Both rooms had comforters that were pilling (showing you how old they were).

The rooms are comfortable and clean and up to the normal standard. However, please be aware that the entire time we were there, only one elevator was working. We were on the 30th floor and had to wait up to 10 minutes for an elevator. It was also really frustrating when people staying on the 2nd floor would use the elevator. Everyone else would give them dirty looks when they got on or off. There were large groups of kids staying there and the line to get on the elevator went out the front door at one point! As for the digital key, I used it once and then it stopped working so we had to wait 10 minutes to go back down, get a regular key, and then wait 10 minutes to go back up. The front desk was very nice and asked if I was 3-5 feet away from the door when I tried to use the key. Um yeah, there are only 5 rooms on each floor so as soon as you get off the elevator, you are 3-5 away. Also, all the rooms will hear the elevator all night long. It is LOUD!

The staff was always very friendly and always asking if we needed anything. There was a concierge to give us suggestions on places to visit and restaurants. You could buy snacks and drinks at the hotel, but so many street vendors and restaurants were within two blocks of the hotel so that you had a variety of food available.

The staff at this hotel are so sweet and friendly. They are working with what they’ve got. They are the only reason I’m not giving it a lower rating because I don’t want to bring them down. Also, the breakfast was really great so that compensated a bit also for my disappointment in the room. The staff at breakfast, Jessica and company, and the front desk, Clarence (who was always working, every shift it seemed!) really made this stay more enjoyable than it would otherwise have been. Also on the plus side, there was a microwave and refrigerator in the room. Instead of drawers, there are nice wire baskets. Nice touch. The problem is That this building was not meant to hold this many rooms! The rooms are the smallest I have ever stayed at in my life. Even smaller than some European cities. You can’t even move in the bathroom. No counter. Your items go on a shelf over the toilet and you hope they don’t fall in. It was clean, though. The beds are full, not queen. Too small for a couple to share. As a Hilton gold member, I used many points (I think 70k) for this two night stay. I just don’t think it was worth all those points since I saw online they were only charging something like $92 per night on travel websites. Also, as a gold member, I was pretty disappointed that we had a view of a wall. I asked the woman when I checked in if it was at least a nice room and she said it would be. I knew it would be small, I just didn’t know how small. Location was good, but one last thing I wish I heeded...I read all the reviews about the elevator and for some reason I thought they were exaggerated. Well, they weren’t. You can wait up to 10 minutes, then when it comes it’s full so you have to wait for the next one. God forbid you forget something in your room like my son did....he ran back up 25 flights to get his convention tag because we waited 12min for the elevator. If you get a good price and you just need somewhere to sleep and have breakfast, this is fine. I know I spelled out a lot here, but the basic problem was the size of the room and slow elevator.

Here's everything I found unacceptable here: When you get into your room, there is a heater with knobs ripped off, leaving you to think your heater doesn't work. My boyfriend was immediately stressed and I called the front desk. I was told there are buttons for the heater on the other wall! Cool thanks! Hard for a new guest to spot though. ""There's supposed to be signs"" I was told on the phone. Huh ok. I could tell I wasn't the first person to call and ask about this.There is NO MICROWAVE to use whatsoever. I even looked in the breakfast room. Nada. How hard is it to get a microwave? We are in NYC and I would like to heat up my leftovers. I ended up eating a lot of stuff cold in my room. Ugh. Never again. My boyfriend and I even walked past a microwave on the street and we joked about bringing it back to our room.I also noticed there was only 1 front desk agent around the desk a lot of the time, during busy check in and check out times? Long lines whenever I wanted to ask a quick question? What a drag.This is where things started to go downhill fast. The hot water in the lobby was empty 2 nights in a row when I attempted to make hot chocolate. Really guys??? Thanks for the tease. I guess I'll just go up to my room. I was excited to see there was oatmeal at breakfast, but then I put it in my bowl and it was so runny and watery and gross! Threw the rest away.There was also a night I asked the front desk for a comb. The lady said something like ""No I'll have to get that sent up to your room."" My boyfriend and I watched hours go by in our room and I never got a comb. The next day I go to the front desk to once again ask for a comb. Jim pulls one out effortlessly. Thanks! I wish the girl did that for me. My boyfriend asked housekeeping for another roll of toilet paper. We never got it. Ended up using napkins on our last day there. The housekeepers do not service rooms until way later in the day. Basically by the time we wanted to go back to the room and relax from walking around all day. A good tip is to ask for earlier service while you're out of the room.The housekeepers also have to share the elevator with the guests :) what a nightmare. You will be waiting for the elevator a very long time. Then get cramped inside with 10 other people and cleaning supplies. The icing on the cake. On check out day I wanted to print my boarding passes in the business center. Everything's going fine until my passes print blank with no ink. Just another problem I wanted. I went up to my room for a minute to wait for the ink to be fixed, then came back down to see maintenance working at the door and they just said ""sorry out of business"". I was boiling at this point to say the least. Pretty unacceptable to put the business center out of business during check out time when I need my passes the most???? You could of at least gave me a warning???? I never got my passes there. Thank god I got them at the airport. At this point I could not wait to leave this place. My boyfriend had to talk me out of it and calm me down on our last day in NYC. It seemed like every small thing was a hassle. We finally checked out and I couldn't even understand the girl helping me because her voice was too soft and quiet. Boyfriend turned and said to me, ""What did she say?"" ""I don't know."" The girls seemed clueless and unhappy. Super monotone with no personality. Seemed like they didn't want to be there. But you gotta fake it til you make it!!! Peter and Jim were way more helpful and friendly though even when I saw them in high stress situations. On the upside! The bed was very comfy and I enjoyed the view! The 19th floor was very quiet and I loved it, despite being close to the elevator.","Seattle, Washington",0,2.0

They booked us in to the Hampton Inn Manhattan Times Square South for the accommodation and we were not disappointed. Front desk staff were super friendly and incredibly helpful. The room (1103) was spacious, had everything we needed, with an incredibly comfortable bed and good shower. We weren’t disturbed at all by street noise or other guests (the room is tucked into a corner at the end of a corridor). We found breakfast a little hectic but that’s to be expected at this time of year (16th to 19th December), so even when we didn’t get a chance to enjoy it, made good use of the 24 hour coffee facilities. The location of the hotel is excellent for Times Square and also Empire State Building, with two very close subway stations (Port Authority and Times Square) within easy distance offering trains to get to virtually anywhere you’d want to go. We honestly couldn’t fault the hotel, they could just do with a bigger breakfast room to accommodate the number of guests. Would definitely return and recommend to friends. ",,28,4.0

Checking in was easy. The front desk employees were very nice and professional throughout our stay. The hotel provides free breakfast and there is always coffee, tea, and hot chocolate available throughout the day. The bagels at breakfast were not the best NY type bagels, but tasted like Panera instead. The breakfast potatoes were amazing! Whole and skim milk with choices of cereal were available as well as yogurt. Juice was available - orange, cranberry, and apple. The hotel was clean and our room was kept clean daily by the maid service with towels replaced daily. Plenty of towels, comfortable bed and pillows! Loved having a refrigerator. Air and heat ran well in our room. Plenty of wall plugs to charge electronics as well as USB port charging areas. The hotel is set in the Garmet District which isn't the nicest area. Lots of homeless and fake homeless around and a run down area, but it's close enough to the subway and central enough to be a good location for travel. It's next to Hell's Kitchen and near many restaurants and several good pizza places to get a slice or two. Things to improve on: The walk way that runs in front of the elevators is much too narrow for the amount of traffic the area sees, especially during breakfast and check in and check out times. 9/10 times at least one of the elevators did not work. The wait for an elevator was always long as there were so many people using the 1 working elevator. (Don't tell me it has been fixed like previous replied to other reviews - it's not fixed and even your staff knows this.) When both elevators were working, they were always full and we had to wait several passes before there was room to get on. The maid service staff uses the same elevators as the guests which is unprofessional and uncomfortable. Dresser Drawers of some sort would benefit guests that stay longer than a weekend. The bathroom shower was quite narrow, the bathroom very small, and no counter space other than the counter that goes immediately around the sink. All of these things an be lived with and worked around. However, the concierge on Monday morning was frazzled and unprofessional. She didn't appear to know what she was doing at all. We were scheduled to take the shuttle to the airport and we had been told the night before to arrive 10 minutes early for the shuttle. We did. We saw no one else waiting for the shuttle, so we asked her what we should be doing. She said our shuttle was around the corner, but we needed to wait on others. We did not want to wait. We wanted to go on to the shuttle to wait there and to get settled. She rudely told us that we must wait for her and that we could not go to the shuttle and we must wait on others. As we walked outside anyway, she continued to insist that we stay inside the hotel and remain with her. We continued to go outside. Another concierge from the next door sister hotel was outside and asked us if he needed help and we told her we were just looking for our shuttle. We walked us down to the shuttle where we found that everyone was already on the shuttle and was ready to go!! Had we wanted for our concierge, we may have missed the shuttle. The shuttle should have picked us up in front of the hotel like the other shuttles were doing, but instead it was practically parked in traffic and we had to maneuver around on coming traffic to get on the shuttle. Other guests on the shuttle commented about the disorganization and unprofessional behavior at the hotel from this shuttle arrangement and the unprofessionalism of the concierge on Monday morning. She seemed stressed and maybe things were out of her control, but more organization for the morning shuttle routine would help. Other than these things, it was a wonderful few days in New York!",,5,3.0

However, a large group of people had checked out (9am) prior to my arrival which I found had the same room types as I. Anyone would assume that a room could have been cleaned prior to the 1pm timeframe which she gave me as being the earliest....ESPECIALLY since I had already told her of my travel issues and illness. I even offered to upgrade if needed. I asked the young lady at the desk to call me when my room was ready....NEVER HAPPENED! EXTREMELY disappointed! We took showers upon check in after walking around town and traveling. The shower did not drain correctly and we stood in our own bathing water. I totally understand that this is not something that might have been known. However, we notified the staff of this issue prior to leaving for the evening and when we took showers the following morning....still the same. After the shower drained the first day, it left a nasty film and I just assumed they did not clean that up after fixing it....I was wrong. It was so disgusting by the time we were done showering that I took a picture. I called the front desk after we arrived back to our room around 11pm about extra towels and the fact that our remote was not working. Maximo came with towels quickly and then maintenance followed shortly after with several remotes to ensure they could correct the problem which was great. The breakfast staff was GREAT and friendly even with so many people in and out! I really appreciated this. All the gentlemen that assisted with storing our bags were great!

Unfortunately, the room had a very bad smell -- something like wet carpet and/or mold and/or sweat. The room appeared clean -- except for something left behind in the safe -- but the smell was just not pleasant and did not go away, even with the window open. WiFi was okay, but not really fast enough for serious work -- complimentary WiFi only got up to about 3 mbps, and didn't work quite as well on the side of the room furthest from the door. The shower's water pressure was OK, but not great. Bed was comfortable and linens were very clean. TV worked fine. Room had tons of outlets and USB ports, which was nice.One REALLY annoying thing was that I was awoken at 5:50 AM in the morning by the room's alarm. It should be on the housekeeping department's check list to turn off the alarm when a room is turned over, so other guests aren't ""treated"" to a former guest's early wake-up time. This was really annoying and I couldn't fall back asleep.Another problem was that, when I arrived, I thought to take advantage of the free coffee/tea service, but when I went to grab a cup off coffee, I saw that fruit flies were all over the coffee containers. I could have still drank the coffee, of course, but it was disgusting and I'm sure the health department wouldn't approve either. In the morning, the hotel was fixing an elevator, so there was only one elevator for the 30-story hotel. The hotel put the elevator on manual operation, though, and staffed it with an assistant, so it wasn't actually that bad. Breakfast was a normal Hampton Inn breakfast -- eggs, pork sausage, bread, yogurt, etc.I specifically chose the hotel for the location close to the Port Authority, but I wouldn't encourage visitors to NYC to choose this location. Times Square is increasingly terrible with the sidewalks full of ""artists"" and the streets full of filth. Tourists would be better suited to choose a hotel in Chelsea or Union Square or the Lower East Side. Times Square is the worst of New York, unless, as in my case, I just needed a hotel between the Port Authority and Penn Station. I suppose I wouldn't be upset about returning to this hotel, but if I did, I would hope that I would receive a pleasant smelling room.",United States,121,2.0

Then I looked at my watch and realised it was, surprisingly past 11pm and I was immediately more understanding. The gentleman who checked me in was lovely and professional and this can be said for all staff I encountered during my short stay. The room was spotlessly clean and had everything I needed. A comfortable shower, clean, soft towels and a lovely large bed. I was very happy with the room and as it was on the 32nd floor even had a nice view, although nothing spectacular. Breakfast in the morning was basic however it was absolutely all I needed. Nice, cute little omelettes, potatoes with pepper and a bakery selection. I believe there were also waffles and pancakes. There were juices and hot drinks on offer also. For me this was a great start to the day and my time in the big apple.

The only bad thing (which I knew when I made the reservation) is that the rooms and hallways are super small and narrow. The elevators are kind of slow especially in the mornings with everyone going down for breakfast. Housekeeping never got it right and they didn't leave the right amount of towels any of the days, not sure why. The a/c in the room was kind of crazy, it was either super cold at 68-69 but if we put it on 70-71, heat started to come out.

Starting January when we noticed that they are too much. Knowing we are at the highest Tier as well for the Groups Rewards Program. One time we were checked in a room that leaks water in the bathroom. Second time we noticed that the carpet(square types) are sticking out. I took a picture and I showed it to them. My concern is we may not notice it and fall because of even it is just a small rift and it is like bulging at the end of the other square tiled to it. So I went down and showed it to the front desk. The head of the House keeping they said was the one who address my issue. I just said its good that we see it so we can avoid stepping or tripping on that particular tile of carpet. As you know this is a very small hotel and not much space for you to walk so it is somewhat un avoidable for you not to hit and fall from it. The worst is you might hit your head on the furnitures around example your head, you will bleed to death there- because the elevator is only 2 and it is so busy for the employees as well. One time I was standing and waiting for one of the elevator to come down from the 30+ floor and the other elevator was utility with hose inside. Now after I arrive there are like 2 more couple arrive waiting for that 1 elevator. And you know how slow it is when the other one is being held by the staff. We (other guest) are already talking about the single elevator we are looking atop for the number floors as it go down slowly. The guy on the other never even offered to take us up. We just shook our heads and said what a ride like a rush hour at the subways of NY.Back to the carpet with the head lady, just said I will send the engineering dept to take a look and see. So here's the engineer. I personally address the guy and told him, Excuse me if you don't mind may i ask how are you gonna fix this problem. HE said he will tape it. My blood just rose to my head and told the guy. I am sorry but are you an engineer ? Because I am. I exclaimed even a common ordinary common sense you don't tape it. There is a glue or paste to use there and not tape. It will be bulging again and give it not even an hour it will budge. My point here is - you don't repair or fix something with a very obviously not applicable for he floor. Who puts a tape on the floor for it not to budge and to have it stick there plainly and smoothly for a while? This is a building. A hotel building for god sake. You are taping it for our temporary stay because if you use the actual material to fix the problem, it will smell in the room and it will take a while. They don't choose to transfer you rot another room and because this room will be stagnant no sale. or they loose one sale. That being said, it doesn't matter if it is accident prone or what. They don't think. We are AARP and Seniors but lucky to have made sure that we do right things for our body and health. That is why we look younger than our age, But when you are old we really do deteriorate. eye site becomes poor which can lead to stepping and tripping to that accident prone piece of carpet because it is in the passage way of us to and from the door. I just let it go since we decided to cancel the next reservation and looked for another hotel. Besides the attitude of the lady that we spoke with. As if she knows what she's doing. They don't take criticism positively. The concern there is safety. We understand that there is a natural way of materials used in a bldg that needs to be maintained and it should be included as normal wear and tear maintenance. They prioritize sales before safety of guest. I am thinking, aren't you thankful for us for letting you know that instead of ignoring it and just leave it the same way anyways the supervisor or manager who inspect the room ( i just don't know what is the methodology of inspection of the rooms after it is cleaned after a guest check- out) this should be on their check list or do they really inspect rooms. I am assuming because New York is the Highest rate for rooms in hotel. To makes you moneys worth, please do your job. hampton Inn is know for family market. Even kids plays around andcan be prone to accident if they don't se it especially.Sorry but as I learned the probability of the other room with this negligence give it like 10 % is a possibility caused by negligence is a low number so meaning around 20-25 rooms has this possibility. Meaning 20 - 25 individual is prone to have an accident in any of the 25 rooms in this particular hotel. I never came back since then. I am always traveling to NY for business. But i avoid them already. It is not worth the save for the prone.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",20,2.0

We stayed at this Hampton Inn because it was near an event we were attending for business. The rate was super reasonable considering it was New York City (under $150/night). This was a very busy hotel, but the front desk clerk was super friendly, welcoming and took the time to give us a map and highlight some great restaurants within walking distance. We felt safe at night walking around to restaurants. The hotel has 20 plus floors but only 6 rooms per floor so each floor was a bit tight and our room shared a wall with the elevator and with 20 plus floors we heard the elevator constantly but we grew accustomed to it and eventually it became just a background hum. Not the hotel's fault, but our first night we experienced a bunch of drunks fighting in our hallway at 3am and we called the front desk to have them send up security. Not sure if security arrived or not and I'm sure other rooms complained because it was so loud, but the hotel gave us that night for free without us asking and luckily the drunks checked out the next morning. The breakfast area was tight but manageable serving the typical Hampton breakfast and the clerk passed out Andy's mints candies which was a thoughtful touch.

When we got to NYC we arrived at the hotel before the normal check in time and so asked at the reception if we could leave our bags with them until later. This was no problem at all. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and as it was still breakfast time they even offered us a free breakfast to start our day with and that was even before we checked in. In such an expensive place this was a very nice gesture. The breakfasts were simple but there was still lots of choice and it was always fresh. You could have cereals, fresh fruit and yoghurts, bagels/toast, eggs/omelettes fresh waffles and juices. Tea and coffee was available 24hrs in the hotel lobby which was a great money saver and nice to come back to after a long day. We stayed in a city view king room on the 27th floor, we could see the Empire State Building from our window! The room was extremely comfortable and clean. Lovely big comfy bed, modern furniture and lovely shower, it had tea/coffee facilities and a hairdryer in the room. The size of the room was moderate but housed us comfortably and was plenty big enough for the amount of time we spent in there. The location of the hotel was pretty central. Just in the garment district on 39th street and 8th avenue so just a few blocks from Times Square. It did feel like a pretty long walk some nights but that was just because we were so tired from exploring. The staff at the Hampton Inn were fantastic, always there to help with a friendly smile. I didn't get the managers name but he was also very friendly and seemed to really enjoy his role, engaging with the staff and customers. I think I overheard that he was newly appointed so I think with him in charge it can only get better.

You can also walk to Madison Square Garden, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Central Park and many other landmarks.The price is very good for the area. We paid $200 per night including all taxes and fees. The staff is friendly and helpful and although the breakfast area is crowded things move quickly.We were on the 29th floor (the hotel has 32), and the view was great looking south across 39th Street. If we craned our necks a little we could see the Empire State.Two drawbacks: The upper floor rooms, at least, are tiny, more like a stateroom on a cruise than a hotel room. The shower in particular was minuscule -- I've seen larger telephone booths. The other (minor) drawback is the noise. We were there on a Saturday night and there was a constant drumbeat of muffled noise from a 24x7 construction site nearby. This didn't bother us at all, but if you're the type who needs absolute silence in order to sleep, this may not be the place for you.

On arriving reception staff were efficient but not over friendly or welcoming despite us being the only ones checking in , our rooms weren't ready as it was only 2pm so we left our bags in the bag check . 1 man doing this while attending to 2 large groups leaving who wanted him to take their bags out to their transport so we waited quite a while to check our bags . When we got into our rooms they seemed ok a bit shabby I would say for a Hampton , spotlessly clean comfortable and equipped with everything we needed . Beds and pillows were excellent . Beds and towels changed every day , not necessary but lovely to come back to . Coffee machine in room with real coffee but awful powdered creamer . Coffee was very weak and bland and we seemed to get nearly all decaf each day , I guess though if I liked it they would of provided more of regular if I asked . Our room was right next to lift and was extremely noisy nearly all day and night with the exception of hours between 1am and 4 am when it was silent . Our daughters room looked out on to 8th avenue and was constant horns and sirens, we have stayed in Times Square before and heard nothing so maybe the windows aren't doing their job ? Breakfast room was a joke most mornings we were there , it's tiny so fills very quickly even at quieter times . 8-10am is extremely busy . 2 waffle machines with constant queues and 2 toasters in the middle of the buffet so created a bottleneck each morning . Standard basic buffet plenty of fruit and yoghurt to give you something in your tummy , decent mini omelettes every morning varied flavours. Free tea coffee hot chocolate and water in lobby 24/7 .

I got on my Hilton App to check prices and was happy to be able to find a hotel for this price. My husband was also glad for a cheaper city hotel price. So off we went. We arrived around 11pm. This hotel is VERY close to Times Square and Macy's 34th St store, however, you do have to go down an alley like street to get to it. It was filled with trash (day after Macy's parade), but there are other hotels around it, and it is totally walkable and gives the typical city feel. We were able to get a good night of rest, rooms are small, but it is set in TS and the hotels are packed in - so the perfect little NYC room size. Breakfast is your standard waffle, cereal, hot food items, and toast selection, like any Hampton.

We were able to check our bags after our flight. Check in & check out were very straightforward. The bill was exactly the amount in my reservation -no surprises. The room was pretty much what we expected. Everything we needed, just in a small space. Beds were comfy. Enough room to unpack our bags into cabinets and closet. Ample storage in bathroom for toiletries, etc. Two elevators. We were on the 30th floor. The longest we had to wait for an elevator was 4 minutes.

On the itinerary were theater, shopping, and Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. We had previously stayed at the Times Square Hilton, but that property did not have rooms with two beds available so we opted for the Hampton.Location: Convenient to the theater district, and I have no problem recommending this location. Very walkable location a couple blocks from the craziness of Times Square, so you don't have the lights and noise of that area. Also, the location on the south side of Times Square makes it a short walk to the shopping area on 34th-36th streets. Therefore this location is quite attractive and positive. Transportation options nearby and only 1-2 blocks to bus or metro.Facility: The entrance to the hotel is unremarkable so easy to walk by. This is a smaller hotel property, only about 4-5 rooms on each floor. Floors were laid out in a U shape, with the two elevators at the bottom of the U and a couple rooms on each leg of the U. Higher rooms will help avoid street noise and provide better views. Our view was facing 39th street. The rooms are small (compared to the Hilton), but the furniture design helps with functionality (e.g. the nightstand between the beds had a pull out table top which was handy for coffee). Bathroom was efficient - shower only (no tub) and very little vanity space. There are shelves holding towels that we used as vanity space, and door hooks on the back of the bathroom door for hanging toiletry bags, so that ended up working fine. Room was clean and tastefully decorated. Coffee maker provided, no minifridge. Compact ironing board and iron available.Staff: Staff was welcoming and pleasant.Breakfast: Typical Hampton breakfast with hot and cold items. Quality of items was good and the area was well-kept and stocked during the busy breakfast rush. The only negative is the seating in the breakfast area is quite limited. Fortunately people did not tend to linger and tables turned over quickly. Both mornings were very crowded in the eating area, but we had no problem getting breakfast.Overall: I would not hesitate to book this hotel again for a quick trip. If I were staying longer in the city I might choose a property with larger rooms. The room was comfortable for 2 people, would be tight for 4 (especially when taking into account luggage storage and bathroom space).","Williamston, Michigan",22,5.0

Up to date property, rooms are decent sized for New York city, and the location provides easy access to just about everything in mid-town Manhattan.

Rooms are clean, housekeeping works late into the afternoon -- we often didn't leave our room until after noon, but it was always cleaned by the time we returned.

I think it might be because the Lincoln Tunnel is right there but it feel more like something you'd find off the highway than an urban city centre hotel. I decided to leave after one night and the staff just assumed I wanted something cheaper. I was able to stay at the Hampton in Times Square Central which was offering a much better rate at the time of my switching. That hotel is much nicer, newer feeling and cleaner.

In the morning the church across the street serves breakfast to the homeless and I am glad they do, but there had to be 300-400 people lined up (very orderly) down 31st and around the corner up 7th.

There are three hotels on the block but even still, there is a dark, unpleasant feel to the location that we really didn't enjoy. Did not need key card to enter building at night. The door to our room (1904) didn't work well - it took 3 or 4 tries to open it and when we looked, the metal strikeplate was damaged - it looked like maybe someone had at one time tried to break in.

The bathroom was small but clean, and the housekeeping people kept us supplied with plenty of extra towels, shampoo, etc. Breakfast downstairs was fine - ordinary fare, but staff kept it supplied with plenty of food.

Since our flight arrived before Noon, we went directly to the hotel assuming our room would not be ready, which it wasn't so we just left our bags and went on to the convention center. When we returned, the check in was quick and painless. We had to wait for our bags and took them to our room ourselves as the bellman will not deliver them.As with many of the NY hotels, the room was incredibly small but it was clean. Our room was at the end of a hallway. With the exception of one evening during our five night stay, a housekeeping cart was parked right outside of our door. Given the narrow hallways, we had to maneuver around it just to leave our room. On one occasion, the cart was replaced by a large bag of trash, which was left all night.We were only given two bath towels and two facecloths. We are sometimes prone to taking a couple of showers a day so we left a note asking for more of each. When we returned around 6pm that evening, the maid was in the room cleaning at it looked like she had just started. Way too late in the day to still be cleaning rooms. It took her about 15 minutes and when she was ready to leave, she asked if there was anything else and I asked if she left additional towels and facecloths. The way she looked at me told me she didn't understand English but she thought for a minute and said yes. No extra towels had been left. We left our note asking for more every day and on the final day when we returned to our room, there was an animal sculpture of towels left on our bed. Well, that's one way to get extra towels... The elevators, of which there were two, were very slow. Between guests and housekeeping, it took forever to get anywhere unless you were using them very early in the morning or very late at night.The A/C in the room was extremely loud and it was either feast or famine with the temperature. It woke us up in the middle of the night almost every night.Breakfast was available but we never took advantage of it. I do know that when we left each morning, the breakfast area was jammed with people. Way too crowded.Overall, I wouldn't stay in this hotel again nor would I recommend it.

In both cases- did not get speedy service or service at all (went and bought tissues out, and after the maid just remade a wet bet and sprayed with febreze - gross - we called until the supervisor came and changed it). We prechecked in- and got a room down 8 floors from where we reserved, and Breakfast could not keep up with the people. Granted- there is a sign that explains how hectic it can get- but the one day there was nothing- warm OJ, no yogurt, no waffles, no bread/muffins, only burnt bacon. The materials to restock were in the back room- no idea why they didn't restock what they could. Again the staff was nice- but sometimes nice doesn't cut it. We complained and they removed parking (thank you- more than compensated for the breakfast we had to purchase). The rooms are tiny which is to be expected for NYC. The elevators are not programmed correctly (stop on the way up for all down calls - so you wait a LONG time for elevators at peak times and they are often full). but the location and value more than make up for the hassles.

Several good restaurants close by and of course the Broadway theatres were also not far away. If you want to see and do those things then it's a good choice.However it really is only a place to sleep as there is no pool, gym, bar or restaurant. If you want a hotel to relax in you will need a bigger (and more expensive hotel). We didn't have time to relax in our base hotel so it didn't matter.

We had a wonderful experience from the time we stepped into the lobby until we left. The front desk was so nice to us. We checked our bags and were able to go off to our appointment with out worry. We arrived at the city early. The hotel is near Penn Station, walking distance. The hotel looks like it just underwent a makeover. The breakfast room is very clean and bright looking and looks brand new. Plenty of seating. The breakfast is served until 10 everyday which was a plus in my book. We did not have to rush to get to breakfast. They had apples out all of the time to grab and go. Also at the front desk was a grab and go package with water and a couple of packaged goods, a granola bar and a little cake. On the day we ate breakfast they offered a cheese omelet that was sort of in the shape of a taco with the egg being the shell and the cheese inside, and they also had a bagel with cheese. I like to eat a little healthier with plain scrambled eggs which they did not have that day but I found the breakfast to be tasty and I love to go off a healthy diet occasionally. They had waffles which I did not try.. The grapefruit mixed fruit salad was the frozen or jarred type. It was good. They had bananas too. They also had Yogurt and muffins and cereal choices, one of the choices was cheerios. I enjoyed the breakfast and could sit down and make plans for the day without feeling rushed. The women in charge always asked if we needed anything and gave out chocolate candy mints. She was sooo nice and did a wonderful job replenishing everything. Thank You, I could have stayed there all day. Our room also looked like it was brand new. Of course it was NY small size. The King bed took up the whole room but it was a great bed and King size. Very comfortable, one of the best beds I have slept in. We did not want to get up in the morning. The room had all of the amenities your would need. Plenty of outlets to charge phones, with two different type plugs. They had a chair and two ottomans that could be used as a desk or what ever you needed them to be. Very efficient room design. Great TV. The bathroom sink area was small but the mirror turned out to be a very large medicine cabinet so I could just put my stuff in there. The shower pressure was good, very small shower only about 2x 3 with a safety bar on the side that made it hard to turn around, so if you are a very wide person it might be a tight fit. It was just right for us. Everything was brand new. The shampoo, soap and skin lotion were of good quality. Glad to see they gave out lotion. Our housekeeper was great, she was outside and I asked for an extra towel and got it with no problem. She was very nice. I could not believe I was in NY city, everyone at the hotel was sooo great and made us feel welcome. We had a room on a lower floor and found that there was no noise problem. There was construction going on across the street and in the morning it did not even bother me it sounded like the ocean and was very soothing. I usually complain about noise but not so with this. I actually liked it. In the middle of the night our niegbors came home but I only heard a little good night and then everyone went to sleep, so no noise from neighbors only maybe an occasional door slamming in the morning. I had ear plugs which do not do much and was exhausted from the day of walking in New York so with the most comfortable bed in the world we had no trouble sleeping. The floors are small, only about 6 rooms per floor, made it easy to walk to. We got a floor with out the vending machines so it was quiet and we only had to walk down a floor if we wanted anything. Elevators ran fine. Yes there was crowding in the hallway if the carts were getting on but we managed. All of NY is crowded, get used to it. Everyone was polite and we took our time. We would definitely go back to this hotel. It felt like our overnight stay was a bigger vacation then it was. Thank you.",New Jersey,55,5.0

She could obviously see I was a bit stressed and reassured me that everything was in order and our room was ready. She handed us two bottles of water and off to the room we went. The room was spotless. Plenty of light and enough plugs for all of your devices. There's not as much counter space in the bathroom as I would have liked, but that's a minor thing. Breakfast is always hit or miss at hotel in my opinion. It was a hit here. All the standards that I expect, milk and cereal, fruit, muffins, eggs, sausage, bacon and the requisite waffle makers. There were plenty of tables so sitting down to eat was not a problem. Very good overall in my book.The location of the hotel is very good as well. You're about 5 blocks from the heart of Times Square. There is an Irish bar a few doors down that offers a 10% discount for hotel patrons, but we didn't take advantage of that.

The corridor in front of the elevators is a little narrow; turning a large power w/c coming out of the elevator may take a try or two. Other than that, no problems noted. If using a walker, consider asking for an ADA room as the walking space in the regular rooms is somewhat tight and may present a challenge for someone with a walker. The breakfast room has amble space to accommodate mobility devices.The hotel is in the Garment District. During the day it is a bustle of men pushing garment racks and flat beds of fabric. Every other storefront is a restaurant, offering everything imaginable (Chinese, Korean, Pizza, bakeries, sandwich shops, coffee shops, you name it it is within a block or two, not to mention all of the restaurants in Times Square). What is not restaurants are stores selling primarily bridal and formal wear material, as well as men's suit and shirt material. The fashion schools are close, so during the day you will see students going from one fabric store to another seeking out the perfect material for their newest creations. Check in was fast and efficient. As requested we were given a room on a higher floor (farther away from the noise of the street when we wanted to sleep. ) We were given the password for the WiFi. Parking: As we drove to the city, we paid the $55 plus tax to valet park our car (there is very little other option.) There is no in-out allowed (or they charge you another $55) but with the subway so close and so many things within walking distance this was not a problem.The room: While small by most cities' standards, this room is about average for NYC hotels. The room was immaculately clean. There is no luggage rack, and the ""closet"" is so tiny (includes a safe, ironing board and iron) that the suitcases must sit on the limited floor space or on one of the pull out hassocks. There is just a little over three feet from the end of the bed to the dresser/TV stand/coffee bar combo so that may be a problem for larger individuals. There is a desk and chair, with 4 outlets and 4 USB ports. There are also outlets and USB ports on each bedside shelf so plenty of places to plug in all of those electronics we all carry these days. WiFi was complimentary with my HHonors membership, as was a bottle of water. Temperature control was accomplished by a panel on the wall. There was a smoke detector, and lighting was average. We did appreciate the black out curtains on the windows. The bathroom: was also immaculately clean. Amenities included hand and bath soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and a hair dryer. There was no tub, just a small shower stall which was fine with us. There were nice hand and bath towels, but only one wash cloth, an oversight I am sure as they knew the room was reserved for two.Breakfast was included in our rate. The breakfast room is neat and clean. In addition to the usual suspects (juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, pastries, toast, yogurt) there is a hot choice (this morning it was scrambled eggs and bacon) as well as a waffle maker for make-your-own waffles which were actually quite good. Bananas, apples, and cut up pineapple, oranges and grapefruit were also offered. In all a very nice breakfast in a pleasant setting. We felt safe walking to and from the theater in the evening, as well as exploring the area during the day (of course taking the usual sensible precautions). Staff are pleasant and polite. We will definitely consider staying here again the next time we are in the City for either business or pleasure.","Albany, NY",202,4.0

This is a fairly new hotel. The front desk staff was friendly and welcoming. My room was on the 23rd floor (I asked for a high floor) with a partial view of Times Square and the city skyline. The only street noise was an occasional horn. This isn't the Ritz, it's a Hampton Inn so the rooms aren't spacious. The size of the room is adequate for 1 or 2 people. There are 3 large, long drawers and 1 small drawer in each of the end tables. The armoire has space enough for a few days for 2 people to a week's worth of clothes for 1 person if you pack light. There's an in-room safe at the bottom of the armoire. You have to bend down to use it, which is not good for someone with knee problems. The bathroom isn't roomy but it's adequate for the room. There's not a lot of counter space. It has a large mirror, lighting around the mirror for applying makeup and a night light. There's plenty of lighting in the room. The desk has 3 outlets and 2 USB ports. There are charging ports on either side of the bed. Unfortunately, there's no radio in the room. The TV remote is VERY SLOW. I had them change the batteries but it didn't help. There's no station ID on the screen so there's no way to tell which channel you're on if you land on a commercial. Only cold air came out of the heater even when set on heat so I had to turn it off. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are available all day in the lobby and delicious cookies in the afternoon and evening. I went down to the breakfast room at around 7:15 and avoided the crowd that starts around 8:00. I would give this hotel 3.5 stars if that rating was available because of the in-room issues; I will give it a 4 but leaning toward 3.5.","Albany, New York",3,4.0

Close to all of the theaters, Times Square, Central Park, Madison Square Garden, Hell's Kitchen and public transportation. Very nice staff. Room we had was very clean, well furnished and a really good size for a building that is very small overall. BTW - This hotel is one of a three building combo built in the space of one, so the layout is very narrow with not much public space. The complimentary breakfast was about the same as most other competitors in this price range, which consisted of a good selection of items in mediocre quality.The only downside about this hotel is that there are only 2 elevators for a building that has 36+ floors, so plan ahead for anything you have scheduled or for checking out on-time. Also; There was a bit of a wining sound that we heard during the day, so don't plan on getting any sleep if you want to take a ""disco nap"" or want to realign your sleeping pattern for international travel during the daytime hours.

It is so loud that no matter what you do they will wake you up. Hotel manager/supervisor - get an ice machine in the kitchen, please! You are going to lose customers due to the noise level.

We were told that while boarding we should let the driver know about it.However when the coach came, 1) he was parked far away from the Hotel and me and my wife had to drag our luggage to the coach which we didn't appreciate and 2) the Driver dropped us at the Aiport and drove off. Later we figured that the Hilton coach does not come at that spot. After some trouble we found out that we need to take the Airtrain and go to a spot from where the Hotel coach picked up.

The 8th Ave line is right there with stops within a few blocks both north and south. And we actually walked the High Line all the way from the Whitney Museum of American Art to W 30th and then to the hotel. There are also many excellent eateries within a short walk as well as Times Square and the theaters. So that part is terrific.The building itself is old and tired. It is vertical (25 floors_ but only has 6 bedrooms on each floor. The icemaker was near 1003 and both worked poorly and chugged loudly. This mean people getting ice in the middle of the night had to keep whacking on the handle. Woke us up a couple of times. The walls are thin and any conversation in the halls is fully audible in the rooms. In our room anyway. Finally the hallways by the elevators are EXTREMELY narrow. People waiting for elevators have no where to stand really--and it gets to be a huge problem around breakfast because the elevators are in the passageway between the lobby and the breakfast room. The fact that several floors are being refurbished exacerbated the problem because the workmen tended to commandeer one elevator.Speaking of breakfast. Now I find the free breakfast a big draw, and clearly so do lots of others. It was a MADHOUSE by 8:00. The breakfast area has nowhere enough seats/tables for the hotel capacity. The buffet/food tables are just a traffic jam of people trying to cook waffles, make toast, and dish out oatmeal.But I think a lot of this comes with the territory: NYC.

I've never experienced the poor service that I did here. I booked this hotel without being aware of the ongoing renovations. That being said, I have stayed at many other hotels undergoing renovations without the poor service I experienced here. There are only two elevators in this hotel, and my room was on the 29th floor. Upon my arrival on Friday afternoon, one elevator was dedicated solely to the contractors moving out old mirrors and furniture. Since only one elevator remained for guests of the hotel, you would think that the contractors and staff would try to steer clear. Not the case. The contractors (with strong body odor after a day of moving) pushed ahead of guests to get on the elevator. Their conversations (in mixed Spanish and English) were vulgar and consisted mostly of their evening plans. When the details became too tawdry, they switched to Spanish. They would also use the one passenger elevator to go up or down one floor instead of taking the stairs. I was hopeful that the weekend would be better as the contractors would be gone. Unfortunately, the staff of the Hampton Inn were not much better. We would often wait 5-7 minutes for an elevator, and the staff would push in front of us. They made us uncomfortable every time we had to wait or ride the elevator. All of their conversations (which were clearly personal) were held in Spanish. It gave the distinct impression that they were talking about the other guests on the elevator. I also find it impossible to believe that there was not another freight or service elevator for the staff. The room was acceptable despite being very small, even by Manhattan standards. I had to go to several floors (by taking the stairs of course as the elevator was tied up) to find an ice machine that worked. I understand the difficulties created by renovations; however, the staff are what made this stay miserable. Despite the location, I would not stay here again.",,0,2.0

At the front desk, I was told the room I'd checked into via the app was not available because they ""sold out the night before"", so I was downgraded without a reduction in rate.

We also found items in the dresser that were left over from the previous room guest. On our way out to lunch, we informed the front desk about the dirty condition of the room and they assured us that they would take care of it. However, when we returned back to the room the blood/ketchup stain we still present. We finally went out and bought our own cleaning liquids and cleaned it up on our own.On our 2nd night, the toilet malfunctioned (overflowed -- not due to any excess solid waste on our part if you know what I mean!) The toilet would not stop running and water quickly filled the bathroom and part of the common living area. We informed the front desk and finally after several minutes a maintenance person arrive and turned off the water. He informed us not to use the toilet as it was broken, he also did not offer to clean up the water on the floor but instead told us he would inform housekeeping to come to clean up the water, Again, after several minutes, someone from housecleaning came to provide us with extra towels -- for us to clean up the mess! When we insisted that he or someone from the hotel needs to clean it, he finally called his supervisor who came and cleaned up the water with towels and a small mop. We requested that they use some type of disinfectant on the floor he claimed he did not have any available. We again went out and had to purchase our own disinfectant.Since we were told to not use the toilet, we requested a new room, but were informed that the hotel was completely full and there were no other rooms available. We were finally able to convince them to get the maintenance staff to repair the broken toilet....which they did.The hotel manger, was sympathetic and helpful, but we were very disappointed in this hotel.

My objection was that I was never informed it was under renovation at the time of my booking. Nor was I told when I checked in. I was notified when I saw the notice posted on the elevator. It wasn't all bad. The people at the hotel are very friendly. The rooms are clean, and, as I said, the location is good.However, the first morning of my stay, I went down for the breakfast (opens at 6am). Doors did not open until 6:20am, the hot food was not ready until 6:35am........juice was empty. No coffee ready. In other words, they were not nearly ready. Not so bad, except I had to be at my convention at 7am, so cold breakfast, no coffee........I bought some at the Javitz Center. Second, only one elevator available to guests during the day. One time I had to wait 20 minutes for an elevator. Unacceptable.Like I said, the employees are great............not their fault at all. And, the room is nice and clean (although on day #2, I came back at 4pm and the room wasn't cleaned yet.

This information was provided by the police that several of your employees saw and gossiped about our large store purchases that were brought into the hotel and into the room. On the day of discovering the money missing from our Locked Safe, it was revealed to me by your Security and Technician personnel (+++ and +++) that the master key that unlocks the room safes was checked out by an employee earlier that day. The police indicated that they were told by Employee +++ that I had requested a room with a safe which was completely untrue. I believed that safes were standard issue in a Hotel Room. Knowing and seeing large purchases brought into the room and believing that I had requested a room with a safe, gave your dishonest employees a reason to target my family by entering my room in search of valuables and opening my locked Safe to Steal my money from my Family and I, thus ruining our Vacation and Christmas for our two small children. My and my Family's trust and privacy were violated to learn that the Hampton Inn employs Thieves for employees. I spoke with Ms. +++ ++++, on site manager, the next day ( December 25) in giving her the opportunity to correct or mitigate the situation. Upon much dissatisfaction, nothing was resolved. She only informed that the investigation will be conducted by a third party and our stay will be charge regardless.

After all, I’ve stayed at some rather impressive Hamptons over the years, including one I reviewed in 2014 based in Wheeling, West Virginia that had a full spa and water slide complex indoors. Of course, New York doesn’t afford the same type of real estate options, so it wouldn’t be fair to compare this Hampton with one in the mid-west. On the other hand, compared to other hotels I’ve visited in New York City, this probably isn’t among those I would put on my return list.Don’t get me wrong. The hotel is perfectly ‘correct’ from the point of view of a clean sleeping quarters with a fully functioning bathroom in a location that isn’t too shady. But as the title says, I'm forced to invoke the awful phrase, ""it is what it is"". This hotel offers very little pizzazz or glamour beyond that. It’s in a so-so location a bit off the beaten path that has a few more homeless people than elsewhere. The building, itself, is about 30 floors high and very narrow, such that on each floor, there are only about three rooms per side of the two elevators which worked without a hitch. I was on the 28th floor, so I didn’t hear any street noise. In contrast, my bathroom ceiling fan rattled so much that engineering had to come upstairs to dismantle it.Size-wise, we’re talking postage stamp, which, I’ve heard (but not experienced in my other NYC hotel stays), is typical for Manhattan. My room was about 10x15, with two rather generic queen beds, a desk and oversized chair, a small armoire to hang up clothes, dresser with obligatory bible, TV, and a encapsulated bathroom with toilet, single sink, and shower stall. Quite frankly, it was too crowded. The chair was too big to fit under the desk, so it blocked the already narrow path to the armoire. The armoire was encumbered with an iron and ironing board which took up half the space and prevented anything long from hanging straight, so I removed them and placed between one of the two beds and the wall. Speaking of which, I couldn't figure out why there were two queen beds in that room. There was no possible way to fit four people in that amount of space, so what would be the rationale for not limiting the choices to either one king or two doubles? As for the view, there wasn't any, unless you consider the facade of an apartment building a view. Complimentary breakfast downstairs was acceptable but barely so. The eggs were industrialized, the sausages felt old and chewy, and the oatmeal was runny BUT the coffee was decent, and there were yogurts, make-your-own waffles, and fruit. Plus, the staff on site truly aimed to please -- (too bad a woman offered little courtesy by phone when I called a few days before arrival). All in all, the Hampton is a good hotel, one that I wouldn’t have minded when I was a lot younger. In fact, I saw a number of college kids who were probably quite pleased to find such “affordable” lodging in the city. But for seasoned travelers and especially those on business, I wouldn’t recommend this Hampton unless price were paramount.",New England,3415,3.0

We often stay in Hamptons, and we've traveled to NYC before, so we knew going in that the hotel would be smaller than a normal Hampton, but we never dreamed the service would be so poor. The last NYC hotel we stayed at (six months ago) was so friendly and the staff was fantastic...we wished we stayed there again, but its location was not ideal for this trip. We intentionally booked a junior suite at this Hampton because we were traveling with our two preteen sons and wanted a decent amount of space. We loved the size of the room. However, service was just terrible. We arrived at 2:15pm and were told we had a guaranteed 3pm check in, so we'd have to wait. That was fine. However, our room wasn't ready until nearly 4pm. One of our kids had gotten car sick on the drive in from JFK, so we didn't want to just check our luggage in and go, we wanted to get settled and cleaned up (from the ""fun""). We had no clue we'd have to wait that long. When we finally got to the room, there were only two bath towels (in a suite, for a family of four). We also realized there were no sheets on the pull out sofa where one of our kids would sleep. And the toilet was clogged from the previous guest (um, gross). We called for all of these items immediately. An hour later, we still hadn't received any and we called again...and the plunger arrived (solo). We unclogged the toilet (nice) and just went on our way. We had asked the man who dropped off the plunger about the sheets and towels and he didn't have a clue. He told us they'd leave them in the room while we were gone. We left. When we returned six hours later, nothing was left for us. We called again. An hour later...nothing.

I even got to select my room. When I arrived, all I had to do was stop by the front desk and pick up my keys.The staff at this hotel are outstanding! They were all so friendly and helpful. A couple of times I requested extra towels in the evening and they were delivered right away. The staff take great care in the appearance of the hotel. A beautiful fall display was put out front on our second day. It was very welcoming.Real estate is at a premium in NYC. This hotel really tries to maximize its space. Our room was smaller than other Hamptons I've stayed in, but it was big enough. Plus, the point of going to NYC is to see NYC! The room was nicely appointed and very clean. We stayed on the 31st floor. We rarely heard street noise and only heard our neighbors when we were in the hall waiting for the elevator. The free breakfast was always great. They serve some items I've not seen at other Hamptons (smoked maple sausage, and I loved the cheese on he scrambled eggs). The staff always made sure things were replenished and went out of their way to help guests. Also, breakfast bags to go were available at the front desk if guests are heading out early or are in a hurry. We took advantage of that one day.I love that the Hampton always has free coffee 24/7. They made sure it was stocked, offered tea and hot cocoa, and a variety of creamers. I enjoyed coffee at night while relaxing in the room.If you have an early flight arriving or a late flight departing, you can valet your luggage.They have a concierge available to assist guests.We walked an average of 6 miles a day. The area was very safe, even at night.

I have Elite HHonors Gold status and I am employed by a major US airline as a Flight Crew member for the last 24 years. I've come across my fare share of horrible customer service and absolute disregard for me as a customer but this Hilton property hit an all time low. The reservation with this property was booked in August 2015 for 3 nights in September. The reservation was booked using AAA discount of $203 a night. We had a family friend who was going to be in New York at the same we were so we decided to add an extra day at a slightly higher AAA rate of $356 for the fourth night. Room rate and NYC hotel taxes the entire bill SHOULD have been no more than $1119.85. Unbeknownst to us when the fourth night was added we ""modified"" our entire room rate for all four nights, negating our AAA discount and changed the room rate for ALL four nights. The hotel modified our room rate increasing the rate per night exponentially increasing to our room rate to a total of $1940.42. At no point did Hilton nor the Hampton Inn make contact with us about the change in the rate change. After complaining ad nauseum about this bait and switch. The front office begrudgingly honored our original AAA room rate for the one night only. We made the decision that we would stay the one night and cancel the remaining reservation. The hotel said that they would allow us to cancel the remaining nights without penalty but would still require a credit card for the 1 night. The Front Desk personnel were provide with a Visa debit card with the EXPLICIT instructions that she was to run the card for the one night plus $150 for incidentals. After the payment was processed we checked our bank account and the Front Desk ran the card for original modified room rate for ALL four nights at a grand total of $1940.42. This ended up overdrawing the checking account and drained everything from our saving account which was used as overdraft protection. The hotel literally bankrupted us. When we spoke to the Front Desk Agent who ran the card authorization she attempted to explain that the hotel was protecting their interest in case we did stay for the original four nights. She assured us that when we checked out the following morning the funds that were on hold would be IMMEDIATELY released which was a bold faced lie. In reality, the hotel would hold all funds for 72hrs. Leaving us with no money for 3 days. We finally contacted Hilton customer service and they were able to get the Hampton to release the hold on the funds upon check out. Throughout this ordeal not once were we allowed to speak with either the General Manager nor the Front Office Manager. All conversation with the hotel was routed through the Front Desk Agent. I hold a status with Hilton's reward program of Elite Gold and not one person on property from the General Manager down to the Front Desk staff bothered to even offer up the simplest of apologies. We were treated with complete contempt and disrespect. I will NEVER recommend this hotel to friends, family or co-workers who are looking for a place to stay in Manhattan.

The rooms are quite compact and have very limited closet space - actually there's no closet at all but a small armoire in a corner of the room.

The concierge was worthless since she didn't seem to understand English very well and didn't know much about NYC. Lucky for us, we knew where we were going.

It was perfect for us. This property though has some real pluses and minuses. On the plus side it is a Hampton Inn. That means clean rooms, clean sheets, competent staff, free internet and a decent if not overly flashy breakfast. On the negative side the best way to describe the atmosphere at this hotel each morning is a complete free for all. The common areas are just overrun with guests. Don't misunderstand, all the guests are polite, but the layout of the downstairs is so tight and small that it forces several dozen people into a tiny space at breakfast. To compound this problem the 2 elevators are embarrassingly slow. We were on the 39th floor and would wait for 10 minutes for an elevator to take us down to breakfast in the morning. Another drawback to be expected in Manhattan is super tiny hotel rooms. The shower is so small that a big man over 6 feet would not easily fit in. I was bumping into the shower on all sides. If you are offered a chance to pay for a room on a higher floor with a view don't waste your money. We were assured a view of the empire state building but laughably could only see it by pressing our cheek to the tiny window pane and craning our necks to the left. As I mentioned Hampton breakfasts are serviceable but good luck with the lineups. Choose to eat earlier in the morning and you will be fine. The coffee is OK and there is real cream but if you like strong coffee there is a starbucks just down the street. The street leading to the hotel on either side is safe if somewhat grungy.Anyway at the height of the season this Hampton was very expensive. Could you do better? Maybe. But you could also do a lot worse. I have fond memories of our New York trip but the hotel does not come up in my thoughts at all. Maybe that is OK.","Bradford West Gwillimbury, Canada",42,4.0

Very small room with 2 double beds, was difficult to move around the room with 4 people in it but we made it work which I guess can be expected in NY. Although the room was very clean. Location was perfect, a few blocks & easy walk to Times Square near several subway stations but just far enough away to get some peace & quiet at night. Would have given this hotel 4 or 5 stars but the breakfast & elevator situations were crazy. Waited long periods of time everyday for an elevator. It became a game for our kids to guess which elevator would open & have enough space for us to get in. Breakfast area was over crowded & unsafe. Never a place to sit & eat unless you got up at the crack of dawn & who wants to do that on vacation. For some reason they felt it necessary to mop the floors in the breakfast area during the rush every day we were there so trying to carry your plate through a crowd of people on wet floors was quite fun. Breakfast food was ok but not great. Better space planning in the breakfast area would have things flowing much better. If they could figure out the elevator & breakfast situation this would be a much better hotel. If you stay request a room on a lower floor so you can take the stairs & avoid the elevators. Front desk staff was friendly and always greeted us on our way in & out. However the concierge was not very helpful with directions & wasn't even familiar with some popular NY attractions. Luckily the provided map was all we needed to find our way.

We asked a young lady with very blonde hair about restaurants in the area and she started looking on Trip Advisor. We can do that ourselves.

When the van didn't show up he got us a cab but told the driver to take us to Laguardia even though we had told him Kennedy. We didn't hear him tell the driver that and so we went to Laguardia.

He was very welcoming to us, Southerners coming to the big city. Right away he offered to hold our baggage since our room was not yet ready. David (I think that was his name) took our bags and assured us that he would take great care of them. Nelson proceeded to whip out a NYC map and showed us where to go, and recommended a few places to eat--all of which were EXCELLENT. He told us how to navigate the subway which was also very helpful. Thank you for the warm welcome and helpful hints.The hotel itself was very clean. The breakfast bar had a large variety of items...more than your average continental breakfast. We, unfortunately, did not have a place to sit since it was a little busy but all was well. The rooms and hallways are quite small and narrow..but that comes with the nature of NYC. The views arent all that spetacular since the hotel is located along a side street, but one cannot be too picky when staying in the middle of a concrete jungle. The location of the hotel is not too bad. Its off the beaten path a little bit, but you can still be in Time Square in a matter of minutes. I, personally, enjoyed being off the beaten path a little bit because A) less people traffic B) less car traffic and C) its much quieter. The hotel is just down the street from the famous Carlos Bakery (for you Cake Boss Fans). It is also about a 10 minute walk to get to the Highline--an elevated park/pathway that leads you right into the Chelsea Market (very cool place to see and visit). Overall we had a great experience at the Hampton Inn Times Square South. If you dont mind being off the beaten path by a block or two, then i would recommend this hotel. I have nothing bad to say about it. The service was great, the concierge was kind enough to arrange a car to take us to La Guardia for our flight out, and even had it there early.

One man at that post was helpful. 2) Breakfast - no meat (others always had have a meat selection), rubbery waffles (what was in the batter?), cold eggs, spicy potatoes; barely mediocre food. 3) Bathroom - dear God. No place to put toiletries except in the bureau drawers and by TV; no shower hats; had to ask for extra towels - only provided two - this is summer - sometimes people take >1 shower or use an extra towel for shampooed hair! The shower was barely 24"" deep! 4) TV - what a disaster. Had to constantly click the remote - the ""listing"" provided in the room did not match the channels that were on the TV! 5) No amenities - no refrigerator or microwave - even a small one. Nothing to get in this hotel, like snacks or anything else except sodas (when machines were working). 6) Ice machine - was broken on our floor (10th) and had to travel to other 9) floors to get ice 7) Business office - could not get email there and was directed to another hotel a few doors away to use theirs! ??? 8) Luggage storage - for $800 we thought the least the hotel could do was to store our luggage and then retrieve it in a timely way. Hmm. It took nearly 15-20 minutes to relocate - we were due to get to our train. 9) Space - cramped halls (2 people could not easily get by each other), room was tiny and cramped as well.

You can hear elevator's beeps and people talking while in and out of the elevators. Last but not least, the breakfast area is so tiny and has very limited choices. Not acceptable compared to other Hampton Inn hotels in the USA. ","Rocky Hill, Connecticut",0,3.0

Each floor has just six rooms - there are, however, 32 floors. I would recommend the higher up the better. The staff are welcoming, friendly and helpful. We suffered a close family bereavement during our stay, which necessitated coming home early and the sympathetic help which we received from the staff was very comforting. Our room was absolutely fine for a big city hotel - compact with a huge, comfortable bed, free WiFi, a coffee maker, desk chair, armchair and bathroom supplies by Neutrogena. Complimentary tea and coffee are also available 24 hours a day to the rear of the ground floor lobby. Breakfast is included within the room tariff. The breakfast room is busy and can best be described as efficient and functional, with disposable plates, cups and cutlery. The range of food on offer provides good value for money: two hot items, porridge, cereals, various breads, pastries, fruit, yoghurt, juices and excellent DIY waffles.

I booked early & paid in advance allowing me a cheaper rate & building up points for future stays. We were on the thirty-first floor & the view was amazing, especially at night!Check in was not until 4:00pm but the staff gladley took our bags allowing us to explore the city. A map of the city was even offered.On Sunday checkout was at 12:00pm & the staff still offered to take our bags until we left for our flight at JFK that night.The location of this hotel was perfect because there are several good eats around the corner, especially the Irish Pub seemed to be our go to for live music & good beer. Hell's Kitchen is a few blocks & easy access to Time Square. I liked being a few blocks away from the loudness of ""touristy"" spots.Every time I entered the hallway or elevator or even exited the building someone on the staff team always said hello or have a good day/night! The Hampton even had complimentary cookies & the man at the front desk even held some for us when we returned at 1:00am from the bar. To me, a person who works in hospitality & understands that not everyone can be super duper happy 24/7 these friendly & hospital manners made my stay even more enjoyable.I would recommend this hotel for several of my friends & family.

When we went to the room it was presented nicely but it was a bit cramped with 3 women and our suitcases, nevertheless the beds were very comfortable and the rooms were clean and tidy. The rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day and fresh towels and linen were provided. Breakfast is included in the price, however the queue for it can be quite long and so we tended to eat out for breakfast. There is always coffee and tea available in the lobby, which we took advantage off. The hotel is in a great location, just a few blocks away from Times Square which took around 5-10 minutes to walk to. The good thing about the location of this hotel was that it was close enough to Times Square to walk to but further enough away to enjoy peace and quiet at night. The hotel is located in the Midtown part of Manhattan and so is a great base to explore both uptown and downtown. There are plenty of bars and restaurants just a minutes walk from the hotel, also. The reception staff here were very helpful and friendly and were more than willing to give you information and recommendations on any restaurants or places to visit. The hotel is a pretty good price for what you get and the location. We picked this hotel purely based on location and so were pleasantly surprised when we arrived.

From then on She & Chris(front desk) greeted us by name when leaving/ returning and offered local info and directions. Jasmine & Amanda (breakfast area) were also very pleasant and tried to assist when items ran short just before 10 am(due to large group). Only negatives were small room size & slightly long wait for elevators (due to older city style hotel (and large group booking). The Concierge staff(not part of the hotel it seemed) was not as helpful/knowledgeable regarding areas outside of their recommendations(contracts ?). eg. Asked them to contact NYC Taxi to airport and was told to hail one in street or walk one block to Taxi line up at transit station.",,2,4.0

One being icon. Living social is offering 24 hr vouchers for $34, but icon tacked on an additional $15.50 equaling $50 to park in garage. There is street parking on w39th in front of hotel, but park in garages if staying Monday-Friday. Street parking becomes loading zones on week days, and the valet guys said they will tow your car. Don't risk it.Hotel Pros:Just as it has been said in previous reviews the Location, especially if you're looking for a place to stay in Time Square/Theatre District, strongly consider this place. There is a lot of foot traffic once you get on 8th ave, but the area is easy to walk around. WEAR COMFY SHOES. And some say this hotel is on an alley, no. It's on w39th street, and you don't have to fight foot traffic to get to your hotel once you turn onto w39th from 8th ave. I was with my cousin at the time, but I would feel safe walking solo around the area and to the hotel.The Port Authority Bus Terminal is on 8th ave and w42nd, 2minute walk from hotel.There is also a subway stop on 42nd and 8th ave.Shake shack is a 5-7min walk up 8th Ave, which is delicious! I know there's a lot of hype about this place, but for good reason. The shack burger is seasoned and delicious after walking around all day. And if the line is out the door, you're so nearby, you'll hopefully get good timing to grab a burger and shake.Check out Wok&Walk for convenient noodles on the go. On w39th btw 8th and 7th ave.And Cupcakes by Melissa is on 7th ave between w39th & w38th.Lastly, grab some ribs and chicken from Dallas BBQ on 42nd between 8th and 7th ave. Not to be confused with BBKings, which is right next door.They do provide a free breakfast, which we picked up around 830am, and ate in our comfortable, clean beds. Breakfast is served 6am-10am. Make yourself waffles, limitless bacon, ""scrambled eggs"", muffins/bagels, yogurt, juice: Apple, cranberry, orange.Now for the room itself: (stayed in 2602)Comfortable clean beds. Fluffy clean comforter.Cozy. Translation: it is a tight fit. I purchased a room with 2 double beds from groupon, and two people could fit in the room comfortably. If you have 4 or more people in your party, get 2 rooms.Comfortable clean beds.We had an issue with the AC/heater unit. At one point in the evening it made this crazy noise, and sounded like a piece dropped to the ground. Called front desk, a technician came up within 5-10mins. He reset the AC/heater, and it worked fine afterwards. AC/heater is digitally controlled. Very impressed how attentive they were.Comfortable clean beds.They do a thorough cleaning job at this hotel. The top sheet does feel overstarched, but just push it to the side, because those beds are COMMMMFORRRTAAABBBLLLE. They're great.Bathroom was clean, well decorated, neutrogena toiletries, and a good amount of space for one person to use at a time. Standing shower only with great pressure, and didn't have to wait long for it to warm up.The space is limited, but the desk chair was comfortable. There is a safe. No fridge. No closet either, but a tall wardrobe cabinet available, which is just enough for 2people staying a few days, or 1person on business for a week. There is drawer space available. No issues with the flat screen tv, and they offer showtime.Had a great stay. The front desk gentlemen are very friendly and personable, especially Nelson who checked us in. Thank you!

However I was told late check out is based on availability and I needed to check out at noon. Since check in time is 3 p.m. it didn't make sense that I was not able to stay.

The staff was friendly and helpful. Since we drove into NYC, we did use the hotel parking garage which is directly behind the hotel on the next block over so you didn't have to go far to park your car.

Not very far is the midtown tunnel and the bus terminal. If you are getting a cab service door to door I am sure you would be fine however I would not want my mother or family walking around this area alone after dark.I found that the staff did not follow the typical Hilton script when I arrived. I was not ""welcomed"" as a Hilton Silver Rewards member nor was I told about the hours of the breakfast or amenities on property. The lobby was empty and the phone wasn't ringing so I am not sure why that attention to detail was missed. The experience reminded me of going to the cash register at one of the big box pharmacies. As I know Hilton is big on that I am sure they would not be pleased, Following my stay we noticed that they did not charge the credit card that I wanted to have charged. The first time I called my call was disconnected after 5 minutes on hold. The second call I incurred another long hold and was told that to get this switched to a new credit card it would require a form be completed. This is a simple process that other hotels have taken care of for me in 1 minute. I requested a supervisor return my call. A supervisor called me back promptly and advised me of the same requirement of the form being completed. She said that I would have the form yesterday emailed to me and confirmed my email.

The hotel is small but friendly with less than 10 rooms per floor over 33 floors. Included in the price was a self service breakfast (rare for New York) which was good with a choice of hot and cold food including a waffle maker. The staff are friendly and helpful. We found very few negatives about this hotel except there are only 2 lifts so it can be a long wait for a lift at breakfast and when maid service are using the same lift.

You are literally a 5 min walk (if that) from all the lights and action.You really need to do your research and take advantage of the restaurants in the Hell's Kitchen area. Stay away from the garbage chain restaurants in Time Square.One thing to remember is this is Manhattan, and hotels in this area are completely different from different cities. Remember you are paying for location not size of the rooms. You will find many many hotels in NYC are small in room size.

The room had a flat screen television, safe, iron, hairdryer, small closet, etc. The placement of the electrical outlets could have been a little more convenient and there could have been more of them. The bathroom also only came with one bar of soap. Usually there is a bar for the sink and a bar for the shower. I could have asked for another one, but it was not a big deal. The wall-unit air conditioner made the room very comfortable. No refrigerator or microwave.Service - The staff I encountered were all great – smiling, patient, helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. I arrived at 12:15pm to a very chaotic lobby. People and luggage were EVERYWHERE. The lobby is quite small, but the staff did a great job keeping everything in order. I was not able to check-in, so I just stored my luggage with the bellman and went on my way. I arrived back to the hotel at 3:30pm and was able to check-in at that time.  I did request a late check-out, but it was not granted.Hotel Information - The hotel has 184 rooms and 32 floors. The lobby is quite small and so is the breakfast area. The hot, complimentary breakfast buffet was fine, but also chaotic….lots of people, long lines, etc. Just be patient. The hallways are very small as well. I noticed a fitness center on the bottom floor, but did not use it.Area near Hotel - Good safe location (39th Street, Between 8th and 9th Avenue). It is located in the Garment District in Midtown West. It is a short walk to Hell’s Kitchen, Times Square, a subway station, the Port Authority Bus Terminal, etc. I like walking, so it was not a bad walk to Grand Central Terminal, Herald Square, Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, Empire State Building, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Saint Patrick’s Cathedral, etc.Overall I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The price, location, and staff were all great. I would stay here again next time I am in New York City!","Orlando, Florida",255,4.0

I've been in different hotels in the last couples of weeks, most of them in NYC area, since my business is in the city and I usually spend 6 months of a year in Manhattan. I'm a transplant New Yorker and since I'm getting my place next year and I needed a place to stay a few days in the city. One of those options was this Hampton Inn. I've stayed several times in the Hampton Inn hotels in the past, and I thought this was going to be a pleasant stayed as always but unfortunately, it wasn't. it's a simple hotel but comfy, good breakfast and good value. Usually trained staff and friendly people. I don't usually write reviews about my stays in hotels, I do read it on tripadvisor.com though, but I'm so pissed off with this situation that I had no choice. I had breakfast at 8AM and everything was perfect as always. Went back to my room to rest a little bit more since I didn't have much of sleep in the last few days, and at 9AM in the room one floor up from mine, they started to hammer badly something that literally felt in head... It was probably a minor repair I thought in that room but it felt inside mine very intense to the point I was on the phone and I couldn't listen to the person I was talking to and had to hang up. I thought it was ok and I patiently waited for 15 minutes but it kept going. After 30 minutes, they started to drill or something that felt like drilling and literally I couldn't speak and listen to myself. They stopped for a few minutes, and I thought they finished. Started another phone call that I had to make, and suddenly they were drilling inside my head again.... had to apologize with the person I was talking, and hang up. It kept going for 1 hour and half (I was very patient...) and I got upset. Called to reception and asked them to please stop that noise ASAP. I couldn't get rest nor make a few phone calls I needed. They told me they were going to handle the situation. After a few minutes, I spoke to Jennifer, and she told me they were going to stop, apologized to me and offer to check-out at 2pm. I was so pissed off and checking out at 8pm wouldn't have done any difference for me since I had meetings in the afternoon. Just needed them to stop whatever thing they were doing.... That was my precious time to relax, rest a bit, organize my day. After a few more minutes, they lower the noise a little bit but NEVER stopped. They probably stopped at 11.30AM. I decided to check-out at 12PM, they apologized again in my way out. I don't really understand how a hotel that belongs to a prestigious chain of hotels, that probably understand how to create a pleasant experience for guests and how to develop long-lasting relationships with customers, can ever even THINK of doing this heavy renovation the way it was being done. I'm not in the hotel industry but believe me I usually stay a lot in different hotels and I'm usually loyal to the ones that provides good value like this one. I would never, ever cross in my mind doing some work like this in a room close of other guests. It's all about creating a nice, relaxing, cozy and accommodating experience for guests... I suppose if have to do this kind of work, you need to clear some rooms that are going be directly affected by the noise, hummer, drilling, etc... Probably it wasn't the case since they didn't want to loose some $$ blocking a few rooms???? Anyway, it is an isolated situation that ruined my whole experience with the brand and not sure if I'm coming back again. Overall the hotel delivers what you expect, and if you are lucky enough (not like me...) you won't find an issue like this. For me, the simple fact that I had to go through all this, completely changed my perception of the hotel and how they handle a situation like this. Also the fact that this eventually may happen again in the future, will make me think twice of coming back. I probably won't.","New York City, New York",1,1.0

The bed was very comfy and the room was a very good size, especially for New York! Staff were friendly and helpful. But then there were some downsides. The rooms were noisy. We were on the front side of the hotel and the traffic and subway noise could be heard in the room. The walls are also thin, which means you hear the neighbours, and if they sit up until 2 in the morning chatting, you hear them! Having so said that, our daughter and boyfriend had a room on the front side, two floors lower down from us and the noise didn't bother them at all.And the free breakfast was a scrum every morning. The eating area is too small and the help-yourself buffet does not have enough room for the numbers of people. But the food was good, albeit limited, but then it was free and in NYC, that's a bonus.So, in summary - a good hotel and I'd stay there again, but ask for a room higher up and on the backside. I'd also set my alarm for an early breakfast before the hordes come down to eat. ","Ayamonte, Spain",73,3.0

And, 42nd street is the nexus of several subway lines as well as the shuttle to Grand Central. Our room, which we assume was of the most common type in the hotel was much smaller than the typical Hampton Inn room, but up to Hampton's standards regarding cleanliness and amenities. If you need space in your room, this hotel is not for you. The biggest drawback (on the weekend before Thanksgiving at least) was the crowding that results from the layout of the hotel: 32 stories with 6 rooms on a floor and only two small elevators. Long waits for an elevator and a very crowded breakfast room result. There was also a long wait at the desk. At both check in and check out the single person on duty was almost overwhelmed with requests for bills, for checking luggage in before room check in and retrieving luggage after a return from time on the town after checking out, as well as having to answer questions. The 3 people we dealt with remained calm, cool and polite, but were clearly stressed. At peak times the management really should double the desk staff. Other tips. No need to have them call a taxi. There is a taxi stand a 5 minute walk away on 8th avenue. And no need to walk to 42nd to get underground to the subway. There are entrances on the corner of 40th and 8th ave.

I believe that is one of the reasons that the street the hotel is on was quite busy at 5pm when I checked in and had quite a backup. The hotel has a curb reserved directly in front of it for dropping off passengers or luggage. The hotel offers valet parking so all you have to do is park your car at the curb, go inside and check in and let them know you want to use the valet. They give you a form to fill out and take your key, give you a ticket and you are good go. They say when you want the car to call down about 1/2 hour and they will have it at the curb for you.The hotel was very quiet which is a good thing for NYC and I did not hear anything from outside the entire night. The breakfast area was quite large with plenty of seating room and was well stocked. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very nice.

To illustrate the location, it is just 3-4 blocks from both the both the broadway, Times Square & Rockefeller Plaza. There is an Avis 5 blocks down & good asian/Arabian restaurants on the other side of hotel. My favourite Pizza Place (John Pizzeria - always touristy) is also very close. Mind You - 1. There is no F&B other than Breakfast in the hotel so please dont think you ll get any options for dinner or even drinks2. Since its a tall building with 6-7 rooms per floor accessed through only 2 lifts, it gets very very busy between 0800-0900 am (breakfast) and 1300-1400 (checkin&out). 3. The rooms are a little tight.

The negative reviews have mentioned how busy the lifts get but that can happen anywhere at peak times, at least they are not slow ones and the free breakfast can be a bit of a scramble during peak times but it is served from 6am til 10am (doors close sharply at 10) so you just have to go really early or wait til later. For a free breakfast we were pleasantly surprised how much choice there was, it is all help yourself and well stocked with a hot/cold buffet, waffle making machines as well as fruit and pastries. The free tea and coffee is constantly available in the lobby which is a nice touch and yes they do bring out free cookies at the front desk about 4pm.

Enough of that. Incredibly pricey week to be in Manhattan (bill was over $1700 total for 4 nights in tiny room)---the UN Climate Summit, Prez there for 2 days, etc., etc.----won't hold that against Hampton, though---still one of the cheapest decent places to stay those 4 nights (and I did a LOT of checking). Really a wonderful hotel in many ways. Our room, though very small, was new, well-taken-care-of, immaculately cleaned each day, as comfortable as a small room can be, very nice flat screen TV, decently-comfortable beds with lots of pillows, a desk with a comfy desk chair (really close to the bed, though---hard to get out of chair without a bit of maneuvering), nice bathroom with excellent shower (no bathtub), decent view (18th floor as I recall) of NYC & a bit of the Hudson River. So better than we expected by some margin. The breakfast was great (a bit crowded, but not more than expected based on reviews), with lots of great choices, all very fresh and nicely presented. And a terrifically friendly & helpful breakfast staff---just great! And the support staff throughout our visit was truly helpful, respectful, and friendly. And a very, very good location, with easy access to all of the wonderful places this area of Manhattan has to offer. Manhattan was pretty much of zoo that week (lots more folks on the streets than the usual ""lots of folks on the street"") and getting around in cabs was quite a chore (lots of blocked-off streets) so this hotel was a haven to come back to at night, especially with the expectation of a great breakfast in the morning---and a cheery staff! So an excellent place to stay overall. Was very disappointed about the price controversy (and the totally misleading email as well as the totally unreadable sign in sheet/contract for the stay), but I have myself to blame for some of this and totally accept that responsibility. Whatever, decent stay, great staff (including the marvelous woman who cleaned our room each day), great breakfast, outlandish price (but reasonable considering the location & the unusual week we were there, I guess?).

The reception area was bright and clean and check in was smooth and efficient. I had emailed the hotel prior to leaving the UK requesting a room on a lower to mid floor. We were given a room on the 8th floor (which out of 32 floors met our request) but was next to the elevator. I did wonder if that would be a problem but I can honestly say we were not disturbed by it at all during our 6 nights. Also we never had to wait for one of the two elevators more than a couple of minutes.The room was compact but had everything we needed for our stay and I was really impressed with the standard of cleanliness (it was spotless every day) and the general decoration of both the bedroom and bathroom which looked like they had been quite recently refurbished. The bed was so comfortable with crisp cotton linens and big fluffy pillows. There were toiletries in the bathroom, always hot water and lots of clean white towels. Again, we weren't expecting much from the breakfast but once more we were impressed with the selection on offer and the cleanliness around the food areas. We were usually at breakfast round about 9am and never had a problem finding a table. The hot beverage machines were available 24 hours so was nice to take a hot drink up to our room after a long tiring day sight seeing.Situated a few minutes from Times Square it is in a great location for exploring, with both the bus terminal and subway station within a short walk.

We were on the 25th floor, away from the elevator. It was probably the quietest hotel room I've stayed in, (you typically hear your neighbors, elevator, etc.). The room was clean, and the bed was comfortable. The hotel toiletries were Neutrogena which was a nice surprise for us, (again, it's typical to get perfume-y soaps/shampoos that I don't personally care for). The hot breakfast was nice. Not fancy but not continental - something for everyone, and more than adequate - eggs, sausage or bacon, waffles, oatmeal, muffins, yogurt, fruit, toast, juice. Coffee station with coffee, tea, hot chocolate.The shower was nice too. NOT a ""low water pressure / water saver"" type of shower that just trickles out and it takes you 15 minutes to rinse out your hair. It wasn't as strong as my shower at home, but fine, no complaints. And really a relief to not get one of those water saver showers.As other reviews have noted the elevator can be an issue. There are 32 floors I think and 2 elevators that hold about 10 people each. Depending on your stay this can be no issue at all or more significant. For us since it was a ""play"" weekend it wasn't a huge inconvenience. Going up was always fine - got right on and went right up. Going down... well, we could get right on because we were near the top, then it would stop about 5-10 times on the way back down, (depending on time of day). For the first few stops not an issue - people got on. But the last few stops there just wasn't room for anyone else so you just kinda waved, shut the door and continued on... I can see how this might be an inconvenience for business travelers. If this is of concern I'd recommend either staying on a lower floor and using the stairs or staying at a higher floor and allowing for just a few more minutes to arrive at ground level.Small lobby - not really someplace to hang out, but we wouldn't have anyway.Staff was fine, friendly - we didn't need any help or have any requests so our interaction was minimal.Location was fabulous! Close to shopping and theatres, (Broadway!), plenty of places to eat. One last thing - I always research bed bug reports when traveling. I don't want to bring them home!!

Late night the area around Port Authority terminal does feel less safe but there are plenty of people walking around so stick to well populated areas. The only downside with the hotel are the lifts. Only one lift was functional and it took almost 10 mts to find my way down from a high floor. I heard from other that even with both the lifts working, it can get very busy during peak hours. This is a hampton inn so don't expect to find a decent gym/pool etc. The hudson river park is a couple of blocks away and a great place to run.The wifi is decent and the breakfast is wholesome and included in the price.","Hyderabad, India",45,3.0

I called the front desk and told them, they offered to bring me up new ones, but I didn't want anyone in my room that day. So, I said I'd get some later, after I returned from work...I even put the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on my door. Well, I returned with the sign removed, room cleaned, and of course new bottles. Now, don't get me wrong, I love that they gave them to me...but what happend with not seeing the sign and still coming in?? That really bothered me and it has never happened in any other hotel. Besides that, one elevator door (there are 2) made a squealing noise every time it opened and shut. I could hear it on my floor and the ones above/below me...all. night. long. It was awful. I tried to drown it out by putting pillows on my head and leaving the bathroom fan on, but it didn't help.

I have never seen a Manhattan hotel room this tiny and cramped. We were told it could comfortably accommodate two adults and a teenager, but the two double beds leave little space in the small room for anything else. We couldn’t even lay more than one suitcase out at a time to open it without completely blocking the door. The room lacked an actual closet; it has instead a small cupboard compartment with hangers. There is little room to pull the desk chair back without hitting the bed. The minuscule bathroom had no sink counter space, and there isn't room to turn in the shower without hitting a grab bar. It didn’t help to find that the room had more than its share of little flying black bugs, nor that the bathroom sink was partly clogged. (See accompanying photos)When we arrived at the small lobby, it was overflowing with luggage apparently stored for incoming or outgoing guests. Only a small path to the front desk and back hallway remained clear. Bags also occupied most of the space behind the front desk, and least impressive of all, the front desk was separated from the office by a cheap shower curtain taped up inside a glass door. The lobby looked more like an airport baggage claim area or rundown hostel than a major hotel chain’s Manhattan outpost. (see photos) And processing all departures and arrivals had plainly overtaxed their resources. We tried to check in twice during the afternoon, were told both times to come back later, and didn’t actually get to check in until we came back in the evening. But nothing topped the response that we received at checkout from the Elizabeth Liriano, who identified herself as Hampton Inn’s Hotel Manager. After hearing our complaints, to our dismay, she told us that we simply should have understood that “all” Manhattan hotel rooms and hotels are this crowded and tiny, have their share of bugs and plumbing issues, and that paying over $400 for such an unpleasant night's stay there was unexceptional. I questioned her about the room’s cramped condition, the hotel’s puzzling assurance that the room was fine for 3 people (Ms. Liriano thought she was consoling us by noting that every one of the hotel’s rooms was exactly the same size), the bugs, the sink, the condition of the lobby, and the excessive cost. I pointed to - and read aloud to her - the Hampton Inn Satisfaction Guarantee that was literally embedded in an engraved plaque on the front counter: “100% Hampton Guarantee: If you’re not 100% satisfied, we don’t expect you to pay. That’s our promise and your guarantee. That’s 100% Hampton.” Mr. Liriano then assured us that the Hampton Guarantee didn’t apply to our complaints, or for that matter to her hotel, or perhaps even within Manhattan at all. These, she assured us, were concerns that lay outside of the Guarantee’s parameters; they were simply part and parcel of staying at any Manhattan hotel, and we should have understood that before booking the room. She did not care to do anything further to address our complaints. Needless to say, the hotel’s cramped and crowded feel (beyond any Manhattan hotel we’d experienced), and Ms. Liriano’s disavowal of Hampton’s Guarantee (which we had not understood to apply only at the discretion of each hotel’s manager), convinced us to avoid Hampton Inn’s Times Sq South hotel – and likely any other Hampton Inn – going forward. Be forewarned about what you can expect from this hotel, and its management. Epilogue: after filling out a “satisfaction” survey, Hampton Inn did contact us a week later and belatedly offered a full refund. We accepted only a partial refund, as we did expect to pay something for our stay. They also promised to follow up with us on Ms. Liriano’s sweeping dismissals of the Hampton Guarantee. We are still waiting to hear back.","Portland, Oregon",13,1.0

And what sights were a distance away, we just hopped on a subway. The bed was VERY comfortable, a huge plus. Being able to grab a quick breakfast (which we thought was good for a continental-type: even with eggs, meat & potato choices daily) in the hotel left us more time for exploring.

Valet parking works best and only option that I can suggest. Yes rooms are smaller than other Hamptons but that is result of scarce real estate which does not bother us. As some of the other reviewers mentioned, we also prefer our room to be away from elevator but hotel building is so small and narrow, therefore all rooms are almost surrounding the elevator so even if you ask you can not really be away from elevator. I am not sure how busy is the hotel during summer, but Christmas time when it was full, you can hardly find space to seat for breakfast, therefore some people were taking the breakfast to their compact rooms( reminded me one of the hotels I stayed in Osaka, Japan).

The coffee bar was nice too with flavored creamer and different types of coffee. Apple juice, cranberry juice and orange juice was also offered.

A better experience than several 5 star hotels at which I've stayed in NYC. Not a large room, but definitely bigger and cleaner than various 5 star hotels I was in, and at least same size as average NYC hotel room. Would feel cramped for more than 2, but again, no different than other NYC hotels. Very clean; room felt newly refurbished; water pressure, shower, toilet - all mechanical items in perfect working order. Quiet except for moderate noise from room AC (unavoidable, window units are rarely quiet). 30+ floors, but each floor only 6 rooms, was in room 1304, the, ""04"" rooms are away from elevator and ice machine. Customer service from EVERY single person (interacted with several) was absolutely outstanding - very warm and efficient. One reviewer said they need block-out curtains - they DO have them, but I for one couldn't figure them out so had to call for help (they're a bit hidden). Excellent location, close to Port Authority (bus and subway) and all transportation, as well as many activities around Times Square. Small gym. Brkfst included, a good value all around. If you want room service, a restaurant, a spa, or to be hanging out in a luxury hotel, this is not it.

I would not recommend anyone stay at this hotel. The front desk staff were a bunch of young kids who did not care about customer service. I arrived at the hotel at 2:30pm (check-in is at 3pm) and as a Gold Hilton Honor's member, I couldn't check in early. The problem was I had to leave immediately for a conference thatI started at 3:30pm. I was hoping to refresh in my room and change clothes. Instead, I had to change in the dingy bathroom downstairs and leave my luggage at the front desk. When I arrived back at the hotel 3 hours later, Chris (at the front desk) made it sounds like he was doing a HUGE favor for me by giving me a room key because the Hilton Honor's number was in my husband's name (even though my husband was staying at the hotel with me). When I commented that he wasn't doing me a HUGE favor because the reservation was in my name, he then started ""loudly"" saying, ""I'm so sorry I offended you"" over and over and then went into this long monologue about the internet service. All I wanted was to get my room key, go the room and cool down, but instead Chris held my room key hostage while he finished his speech.Once I was in my room and preparing to go to bed, I wanted to close the drapes to block out the light from the street. Much to my surprise, their drapes do not close, so if you are sensitive to light when trying to sleep, good luck! You will also find in their king-size rooms, the bed sheet is was too short and only comes up about half-way up your body. In order for you to be fully under the sheet, you have to untuck it front the foot of the bed.There are also only two elevators in this hotel, in the middle of a cramped hallway. I waited almost 10 minutes for an elevator. I don't know if their training is lacking, or if they don't properly screen their prospective employees, but I will never stay at this hotel again!","Florida, United States",3,1.0

The reception staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast staff were efficient and helped with our peanut allergy son to get food that was safe to eat.

While the elevators were busy during breakfast and check out times, you usually only had to wait for one or two elevators for your turn. I recommend packing your family in tightly with the other guests and just ride it out. The hotel stored luggage if your check out time was prior to your next destination. I liked that they still took care of you even after check out. The boys missed the cookies often, but the evening staff had a stash of gummie bears that were quite popular with my kids. The rooms were clean, but small. The double beds were comfortable, but the pillows were on the less supportive side.

Everything was great, until we called to get our van out of the valet. Then it all went down hill. After calling ahead (as I was told to do) to have my van returned, we waited an hour to discover items were taken out of the middle console (obviously who ever drove my van helped themselves to looking through our things as the items were not in site and required some digging to find). When we told the front desk supervisor he said he would have to call the parking company as they were subcontractors working with, not for, the hotel. The manager of the parking company came to the hotel, after another 1/2 hour wait, made us fill out some lengthy paperwork (took 15 minutes) and then proceeded to tell us there wasn't anything he could do about it. Neither the hotel or the parking company (impark on W 42nd St) wanted to take responsibility for hiring thieves. If they stole from us and no one was accountable, the thieves more than likely still have their job and they will steal from you too!

This hotel is perfect for that. The rooms have very little walking space, so they are mostly good for just sleeping, which was fine for this trip since we spent all day being tourists! If you need space, this place isn't for you. The beds were comfortable and we had no trouble sleeping.The breakfast selection was very good and rotating the hot items was a treat! It can get crowded during peak times, but they do have an overflow area. Also, they have coffee, tea and hot chocolate at all times, which is nice to take a break and have a cup at the end of an event filled day.We had a slight problem checking in; apparently the hotel was very full and the cleaning staff could not keep up with cleaning the rooms for the next people coming in (and the lobby was full of us trying to check in). However, we were able to drop off our luggage, grab a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant for lunch, then come back to check in without a problem. It would have been nice to have been offered some kind of compensation for not being able to check into our rooms on time, but that didn't happen.The fitness center was also unavailable for most of my visit. I was in training for a half marathon and needed to log in some miles on the treadmill; they were re-tiling the floor while I was there. One day shutdown turned into two days, turned into three days, and finally I gave up and just walked more miles in the city!In summary, a great place to stay and within walking distance to shopping, Broadway plays, Rockefeller center, etc. However, the rooms are small and not good for those needing a lot of space.","Orlando, Florida",30,4.0

When switched to >20 degrees, there was hot air instead with a stench so there were times we were freezing. -Wifi signal in the room was weak and unstable. - unfriendly staff upon check in.

You can combat this, of course, by arriving at breakfast quite early. Great location, friendly staff. We typically retire to our room mid-afternoon to rest, change clothes, and regroup before our dinner and evening adventures. On all three days our room was the absolute last one on the hall to be serviced -- and so we had to skip it altogether in order to get in our rest period. I'm sure we could have asked for service earlier or later if it was super important to us.","Canton, Massachusetts",24,3.0

It is right off of 8th Avenue and 39th Street. About a block and a half from the 42nd Street Port Authority Subway Stop/Bus Terminal. It is also a short walk to pretty much any Broadway show as well as Times Square. Really there is no better location for sight seeing in New York City. The hotel itself is extremely tall like all the other reviews stated. There are only 6 rooms per floor and it is 32 floors. We had room number 01 on the floor and I could hear the elevator all night. Every time it stopped I could hear it beep. I realized after a couple nights I could hear it stop on the floors below and above us as well. Although the people on our floor were pretty quiet one night they did wake us up. If the people in the room next to us were talking at normal voices I could hear them. The walls are extremely thin. I would hate to have a floor with the Ice Machine on it. Those machines were extremely loud when getting ice. The only other negative was the size of the rooms. They are extremely small for American standards. Not a huge issue but our room had two queen beds (I thought they might have been full) and we didn't have any room for our suit cases except in-between the beds. The staff was helpful. They always seemed busy though so when we did have questions they weren't overly accessible. The one time we needed help from the concierge he was pretty rude though and I was waiting at the stand while he was walking around talking to staff and cleaning up the lobby. He looked at me multiple times and just ignored me. Okayyy. The cookies in the evenings were delicious. Delicious! I wish I could have made sure to be there every evening to get one. Breakfast every morning was standard Hampton Inn breakfast. Usually Sausage or Bacon and Omlettes, eggs or something similar. One morning they had Biscuits, Gravy, Sausage and Scrambled Eggs. Day was made! Also I love the Waffles. Always one of my favorites. They always have Yogurt, Warm Fresh Oatmeal, Toast, Bread, Bagels etc, pastries, and other items. It is a pretty good spread included. Not just a continental breakfast. I would probably stay here again for the simple fact that it is a very clean, nice hotel with decent staff and in a great location. Price is affordable for NYC. I wish the walls were a bit thicker and the staff was a bit more accessible.","Omaha, Nebraska",142,4.0

Comfy bed although sheets and bed covers only OK (a few stains even though you can tell it's clean). No bed-bugs. Two elevators only so can get a bit busy around breakfast time but that's not too much of a trouble really. Breakfast had plenty to offer and quite good. Possibility of printing vouchers or e-tickets in ""business center"" (actually a small room with 2 computers). In room: safe, hair-dryer, ironing board + iron.Ideal location next to Port Authority Bus Terminal (round the corner) and a 10min walk to Times Square so the subway is really close and gives access to whole of Manhattan (lots of different lines available).

By the time I arrived back at the lobby my room was ready. This was amazing!! The staff new me by name by the end of the first night. It's a smaller hotel. 6 rooms per floor which makes it unique. It's a tall building though. I The only downsides of this stay was the lack of mini-fridge in the room. I would have liked to be able to store food. I however bought a small cooler and used ice to keep things cool. Perhaps it's not standard for Hampton Inn to furnish a fridge. also, the housekeeper slammed the doors all day. If you decide to stay out all night and sleep all day, not the best choice. Overall, my experience was amazing. I usually stay at a Hilton but the fact that breakfast is included makes this hotel a definite steal in Time Square! The parking across the street is $45 per night. It's open 24hrs.

How disgusting! Although I sympathize with the thought behind it,I believe a hotel is not a place for these kind of things and of all places never do this in a room where people will eat their breakfast the next morning.After that day I decided to have breakfast somewhere else in New York City.Also long waits for the 2 elevators.32 floors and 2 elevators.No,this is my first and only stay at this hotel.Next time back to Hampton Inn Times Square North.","Almere, The Netherlands",0,2.0

But it lacks a refrigerator.• Breakfast provided is adequate. It is the usual ‘Hampton Inn’ breakfast – sausages, waffle, and the usual bread and croissant, cereals, yoghurt and fruits. This is a nice addition, if you want to eat something before heading out.• There is a small health centre at the basement, but I did not use it.• Complimentary wifi is provided.• Service at the counter and porter is very friendly.

Had initially reserved the Double Tree by Hilton Times Square but they didnt have any room when we got there late friday night. So as expected I was very upset by the time I got to the Hampton Inn and went there expecting the worst. However my fury dissipated when I found this great hotel. Room- We got a room with 2 queen beds. For me the bathroom makes or breaks a hotel's ratings so I checked the bathroom first and it passed muster. It was very clean , great shower, with strong stream and clean commode. The room was tiny as can be expected in the city but it had enough room for 3 grown ups to move around. Our room was right accross from the ice machine 31st floor and very near the elevator and we expected noise from all the traffic but it was very quiet Location: great location, walking distance to Times Square and the shopping areas. near empire state and public transportation.  Breakfast- Loved the breakfast bar, its included in the room rate. They have hot and cold items such as sausage, scrambled eggs, bagels, croissants, yorghurt, fruits, cereal, waffles, juices, tea and coffe. It was awesome, good quality brands - not the cheap big box brands- real great value for your $. Parking- there are different options for fees ranging from 38$-50$ per 24hrs, the hotel has Valet parking and there are several public parking garages around or if you are daring you can park on the street. We arrived friday night and were lucky to find street parking on the right side (same side as hotel ) of the street were we parked for free. Do not park on the left side of the street on friday nights because at 2am the street cleaning crew comes and will tow. The hotel clerk did try so hard to get us to use Valet parking and gave me horror stories about being towed. Im glad I didnt listen to her . Elevator- The elevator is the only reason why I didnt give this property an Excellent rating. They have 2 elevators and 31 floors. During breakfast rush and check out rush its a nightmare. Other ammenities I didnt use but are available- business center with computers, fitness roomOverall, I was quite pleased with this hotel and am glad I didnt stay at the Doubletree as they were more expensive.

This puts it within walking distance of Penn Station, the Port Authority Bus Terminal, subway stops at 42nd St. or 34th street and a lot more. It's near plenty of restaurants as well and the area is safe, though a little dead at night.Hotel: The hotel is in a 32 story high rise that's shared with an Holiday Inn Express and another hotel. The lobby is small and cramped as is the breakfast area (though thankfully there weren't many people there at 6 AM). There's a business center of two computers off the lobby. The worst issue is there are only two elevators and the area in the lobby where you wait for them is tiny. I had no issues getting elevators to go down but I frequently waited to go up.Check In: I arrived at 1:30 and check in time is 3:00. The couple in front of me were told they'd have to wait on a room but mine was ready Nice recognition of HHonors Gold. The agent also confirmed I wanted points instead of snacks, offered to explain to me how the internet worked and told me how North Carolina is dear to his heart. Really good experience.Room: In a word, small. Sitting at the desk was almost impossible because of how close the bed was to the chair. Thankfully, the bed was comfortable, the wifi good and they had four outlets next to the bed. The bathroom and shower were also really small but at least everything was in good shape.Breakfast/Other: I came down at 6 AM when breakfast starts and they were just putting out the hot dishes. I was in a hurry so I just grabbed a banana. I saw them putting out sausage patties to go along with the cereal, breads (the bagels looked good), fruit, yogurt etc. There's also coffee, hot tea and hot chocolate available 24 hours and they had a little table set up with cider and cookies at night.My rate was $119 and I'd gladly stay again, the location and service make this hotel worthwhile.","Durham, North Carolina",247,4.0

He also remembered me by name and made sure there was a leftover cookie for me (they are amazing!!). Nelson then gave me some great recommendations for dinner in the area.

When I arrived at the hotel, Monica was so kind. She called me once I got to my room ""to make sure I made it"". We shared a few laughs and I got a great night sleep. The rooms were spotless! Yes they are on the smaller side, but we are in the middle of Manhattan...what do you expect?! I was on the 28th floor and had some great water pressure, as well as hot water right away. I was impressed for being that far up.Overall, this review is just the tip of the iceberg. I will do everything I can to stay here the next time I am in Manhattan.

Parking a car in Manhattan is usually a major headache and major expense. In this case was neither. For my entire stay I was able to find street parking directly across from the hotel front door, and could see my car from the hotel window. It's not a super busy street, and the hotel has a small valet area where I was able to pull up and float the car just during check-in. Also the front desk people were very nice, helpful and cordial.

I arrived at the hotel and was immediately greeted by a staff person who, all though very polite and attentive, was sick and proceeded to cough all over the envelope containing my room key while she gave me a drawn out description of the hotel's amenities which frankly, I could've done without. That said, I recognize that this is actually something more hotels should do -- explain the available amenities -- because I've often left hotels not realizing that I had never made use of amenities because I was unaware of them. that said, I'm a frequent business traveler and Hampton is my 1st choice (because of changing duvet covers) and it was late and I just wanted to eat and go to bed. Plus, obviously, the sick part was offputing because I cannot afford to get sick and shouldn't be getting sick from the front desk staff! But as for the explanation of amenities, I would have preferred to have been asked if I wanted to hear about it...no biggie though.The hotel seems well cared for, albeit poorly designed. The hotel is tall (32 floors I believe) but narrow (only 6 rooms/floor) and it only has 2 elevators...well 1 died during my stay. So it was slow getting down to the lobby and up to the room. These things happen and I don't fault the hotel for this except that they have 32 floors and only 2 elevators. To that end, the elevators have a slick tile on the floor and I almost fell getting into it because there was water from snow and whatnot on the floor of the elevator. I DO fault the hotel for that. I was pleased with the room and found it to be very comfortable except that the shower (not a tub) is so narrow and with the handicap bar, it's almost impossible to stand comfortably. I am a woman of average size but I can imagine this would be very difficult for a man or larger person. The biggest issue I had - and this is a BIG one to me and will result in me NEVER STAYING HERE AGAIN - is that the water pressure in the bathroom is TOTALLY INADEQUETE.

It's value is its location just south and west of Times Square. There's also a 2 Bros. $1 slice pizza spot just around the corner. Otherwise, I found this hotel just mediocre. It serves a free hot breakfast each morning and gives away copies of the USA Today. But this is NYC. They should give away NYC newspapers. Also, The juice at the breakfast bar is not real juice, just a flavored drink. I only took a couple of small sips before giving up on it. Also, I didn't like the way my toilet refilled. it was slow and noisy to the point I thought it might overflow (it didn't). There are only 2 small elevators to serve this building. Bad if you are wanting to go up or down during a busy period, but O.K. if you're using them after midnight when most customers are in their rooms and you can zoom up and down quite rapidly with no stops (I often came back late so it was no problem for me; but at 5PM there's likely to be a long queue). Ice and soda vending is not on every floor. Candy can be found only in the cellar next to the fitness machines. I was here during a cold period and they locked the front door during the day to keep the inside lobby area warm for the employees. So I had to knock. That was until they borrowed a space heater from the Candlewood next door. Then they opened up the door again for easier access. if you're going to want to print a boarding card for your return flight, make sure the computer program is set at the correct printer default. It often prints to a printer that they no longer have. So nothing comes out until you reset the directive. I don't think I should have to do this. Someone should fix it. So should you stay here?

But they didnt, so after just checking in and going to our room, we waited some 20 minutes for an elevator to go back down. Luckily another guest told us we needed to request an elevator.

The first time I stayed here I was surprised how small the shower was, I could not stand properly. Not that this solely their fault as I am 6'-5"" and 270 lbs but really, another foot would afford me enough room while not impeding into the bathroom. I arrived for my second stay (was there a few weeks prior) on 10/29/13. I was given a room on the 12th floor. This hotel offers free breakfast but due to just two elevators, you have to wait in the mornings going up and down since there is approx. 25 floors. On 10/31/2013, I pressed the button to go down to go to my office. I waited a few minutes and noticed the down light went off. I pressed the button again and it would not come on. Another couple came out of their room with their bags and they said they had a problem earlier when they went down for breakfast. I continued to press the down button but it would not come on. I went back to my room and called the front desk. They said they were having a problem with the elevators and would send the elevator up to us. I left for the day and figured they would have it resolved by the time I returned from work. That night, I saw a ""bear with us"" sign on elevator that did not work earlier in the day. I went up to my room. I decided to go out to dinner and had the same problem as I did in the morning, button light went off and I had to call for service. The next day, 11/1/2013, I had to wait for the elevator and once again I called downstairs. The only elevator worked opened twice, both were full. I had to get to work so I walked down the 12 flights of stairs so I would not be late for an appointment. This time I went to speak with the manager and she said they were hoping to have it fixed nlt 11/2/2013. If you were in the lobby, the wait could be very long due to the amount of people waiting to go up. This was told to me and other guests daily. I would have gone to another hotel but believed the manager's word. What I don't understand is that the staff became more irritated every day I had to call down. I was never given any call or note in my room apologizing about the problem nor told of the timeline to resolve the problem. But they were able to put a letter (11/2/2013) on my bed telling me about the time change and a little poem.....really? I have stayed at Hilton properties over the past 7-8 years for business and personal travel and have never experienced this poor of a performance. In this day and age, especially in NYC I cant believe that you cannot fix an elevator in a day or two.....but 7? (it was still down when I checked out 11/5)I have spent almost $2000 to stay in this sub par facility and I wanted satisfaction. The employee running the elevator on the last day responded to another guest who said he was going to call his credit card company and charge back his stay. He suggested we look up their ""Guarantee"". I read through and contacted Hilton customer service and asked for my money back or a voucher for future stay. I received no confirmation nor did any one contact me after I submitted my request. Two days ago I received an envelope from Hilton that had a voucher for ONE stay....nothing else, no letter, no communication at all.

The biggest problem is the extended wait time just to get to your room. I've stayed here on 5 occasions and I always request a low floor but a few times I was stuck with a high floor and this hotel is notorious for long elevator waits. I typically wait an additional 10 minutes just for the elevator to arrive so if you are pressed for time you need to factor in the elevator wait time every morning and evenings as well.

About as many as need guidance in buckling their seat belt on a plane. Hampton Inns are nearly ubiquitous around the country and even beginning to grow overseas. In Manhattan, alone, there are at least 9 of them and plans for more in the pipeline. i have stayed at 4 others in the city, and while this would not be the favorite, it generally delivers what we were looking for.The reason is obvious: they offer good value, cleanliness, friendly service, most of the amenities built into the price (including a hot breakfast, wifi, broadband, a business center, etc). Even though the layout is fairly predictable, the big city versions are not quite as cookie cutter as those out in the burbs and along the highways.The location of this one is convenient for some things (Penn Station, Port Authority, the Theater District, the Javits Center and most especially the Garment District), and less so for other neighborhoods and attractions. Still, it is surprisingly quiet for a near midtown address, and while 9th Avenue won't inspire many, 8th has a certain vitality and vibe worth exploring.Hampton Inns are usually the Accounting Department's favorite, undercutting many of their competitors by a few bucks, and still being respectable places to stay. The front desk personnel are genuinely welcoming and no doubt can provide some useful information when called upon.I had two annoying problems on this trip, one which just affected our room, the second just about everyone in the hotel. While the bathroom was spotless and made fairly good use of tight quarters, the plastic shower head needed to be replaced or repaired-it spewed water in every direction except where it was wanted. The marble under mounted sink was good quality, but so small it reminded me of those on a Pullman car. No place to put a kit except on the toilet seat. There was barely any clearance from the door. Besides the tad thin white towels, and the tiny generic soaps, everything else worked fine and there was ample lighting.The big problem of the day, and from what we heard from other guests, for the week, was that one of the two elevators was out of commission. In a 33 or 34 story high rise building, with only a handful of rooms on each floor (184 in total), the normally long wait for an elevator could climb to half an hour. As we were leaving, a busload of teenagers arrived. We left before bedlam ensured.New York hotel rates are like the stock market. They go up with supply and demand. When big events, such as the NYC Marathon, trade shows, the general press of holiday shopping are in the mix, the rates can jump a third or more. We paid a tad under $300 a night, and that was at a purportedly Seniors/AAA rate. Normally, this hotel should be closer to $200/night. Of course these rates include a big bite of local taxes.Hampton Inn breakfast are drearily predictable. But if you are just looking for some juice, coffee, a roll and maybe some form of egg and sausage, serving yourself and putting up with the hot tables will save you $20-40 and a half an hour or more over the full service hotel alternative. I have stayed at 50 or 60 hotels in Manhattan. This is not a favorite. But it does offer relatively good value and was in an ideal location for my business objective. Would I stay here again? Yes, but not as a first choice. I prefer a little more character in my hotels. Still, there is a place for consistency and reliability too-once the elevator is fixed! As we were leaving, we learned they have had the part for a day or two-and were waiting for it to be installed. The lobby of this hotel has a few sofas, a check in desk and a concierge desk. There isn't much room to lounge, and the corridor back to the elevators and the breakfast room in nearly claustrophobic. Of course, people don't come to NYC to stay in their hotel rooms. The flat screen televisions, mini desk, coffee service, iron and ironing board and small closet will meet most transients needs. Hampton Inn beds are quite comfortable and they offer a generous selection of pillows.","Westfield, Massachusetts",628,4.0

But back to the main reason to stay here, the staff. I arrived at almost 8pm after a long day at work. I was tired and not feeling all that great. I received a very warm welcome when I arrived and the check in process was super fast. They had ran out of fresh baked cookies, but made some and had them brought up to my room in about 5 minutes. There is a beverage bar off the lobby where you can get complimentary hot chocolate, coffee or hot tea pretty much round the clock. The tea I really needed, since I was loosing my voice due to some allergies. The front desk staff recommended a fantasic ramen noodle place around the corner, which is just what my aching head and throat needed. It was called Tabata, and it's fantastic! When I arrived back from having the BEST noodle soup ever, the staff seemed genuinely concerend and asked how I was feeeling and if I needed anything. They truly made me feel right at home and cared for. The complimentary hot breakfast the next morning, which is served until 10am, is so filling and a great way to start your day. They had eggs, bacon, sausage, hot oatmeal, Belgin waffles, toast, bagels, yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit and three kinds of juices. This saves you on average about $20 a day in food alone, plus all the free hot beverages you want. To be hoest, I won't be staying anywhere else when I come back because the staff is so amazing and friendly and really makes you feel cared for and appreciated.

This even though our room was on the 23d floor.The staff was very welcoming, friendly and helpful at all times--that included front desk, breakfast attendants, maintenance staff and everyone I encountered. We did have a couple of issues with housekeeping; one was solved right away, the other was not, but the staff made good on their 100% satisfaction guarantee for that one, very quickly with no hesitation.The entrance is a bit hard to find, as three hotel entrances are right next to each other. Just look sharp. The doors are closer to 9th Ave.Breakfast time is very busy, it's hard to get (or keep) a table, and the serving area is poorly laid out and crowded--terrible traffic flow for people trying to serve themselves. But for a free hot breakfast in NYC, I can't complain. The coffee is better than average for hotel buffet coffee.I'd stay here again and recommend it to friends. It was a bargain for the location. Our floor was very quiet; we faced away from ""the view"" which was just fine. Although it's convenient to Times Sq, it's not on the Square so you don't get the bustle and glare. The theater district was an easy short walk. If you're walking back from theater, stay on 8th Ave even though it's quite crowded. If you return via 9th Ave; it's more deserted and feels a little sketchy at night.And yes, the rooms are teensy, it's New York.",Texas,44,4.0

On the plus side, the breakfast was very good! The kids loved the choc muffins which they said were better than Starbucks. Unfortunately on the last day, we went down late, and there were no more choc muffins, but there we many other options of bread, bagels, cereal, fruit, yogurt. I don't know if the hotel was full, but while the breakfast area seemed small, we found a table very easily each day. Really, the breakfast was a big positive point for this hotel, as I had a bad experience with an overally small breakfast area in a similar hotel in the area. The desk service was very good as well and our room and bathroom were clean and comfortable.The main negative points are that while the location is convenient, the the area around the Port Authority is not great. That said, it's a quick walk to get to the main streets, metro, Times Square so this wasn't really a problem (just don't be surprised!), and the other negative was that the room was very small. We were 4 in 2 double beds - and while this is clearly what I booked, we could hardly move around the beds, and there is not enough room for luggage and all. Again, it was manageable but I've had larger rooms with 2 bed in other hotels.All in all, a good value, and I would return there again if going there with kids! It's a good option for families or anyone who wants breakfast included.","Roquefort, France",8,4.0

Having stayed in NYC before in the midtown area and as recently as April, I am not new to the NYC hotel scene. However, this is one tiny hotel! There are only four rooms to a floor. The rooms are very small and it is hard not to trip over each other as there is not room to maneuver around the bed or bathroom. Obviously square footage in a hotel room is at a premium in NYC and this is a moderately priced hotel for the area. It is in the Times Square area but still a number of blocks away so don't let the name deceive you.It was a decent basic hotel but it was full and there were waits for the elevator and the breakfast stops on the stroke of the hour.

We booked it for the fair rate and proximity to Times Square. We were pleased with the modern look of the hotel and pleasantly surprised to find it was a 5 minute walk from Times Square. The breakfast buffet quality was a pleasant surprise. It was fresh and hot daily and there was always something I could find to fill my belly. I am a big meat and egg eater but they offered plenty of healthy options like oatmeal and skim milk too. The coffee could have been better, but I am an admitted snob. The service was perhaps the happiest surprise. Every single staff member was friendly and helpful-and we saw someone new every day!Some warnings: this is New York. This hotel is in a skinny building with two elevators. The elevators are slow, but worked. The hallways are small. Our king bed room was small. I was comfortable sharing with my mom, but we had to manuever around each other a couple of times. I heard some people in the hallway early one morning. I am a heavy sleeper and very annoyed at the disruption. It was the only time I heard noise at night, but again- narrow hallways=more noise.Some tips: Explore the neighborhood. There is a $1 a slice pizza place 1 block over, a delicious italian joint on the same street, a tasty Irish pub 3 doors down and hot dog stands at the end of the block. Everything we wanted was so close! The drug store, the theater (we saw Newsies-Great show!), times square. It was even quiet at night, which is more than I can say about my last NY hotel.

When we returned at 9:00 that evening we discovered that we had had no maid service. We notified the front desk to get fresh towels and they were sent up. However when we asked about the lack of maid service we were asked if we had left the DND sign on our door. We had not. We really felt that they did not care about the lack of maid service and that somehow it had been our fault. For the price we were disappointed and would not stay here again.

Convenient location relative to Penn Station, Times Square, Garment District, and easy access to Lincoln Tunnel-- a big plus if you’re flying in/out of Newark Airport; your cab or super shuttle would avoid much traffic not having to go deep into the city. This hotel is really more in the Garment district neighborhood than Times Square. It’s not the prettiest area but seems safe. The hotel itself is very “basic” Hampton Inn, nothing flashy aesthetically. However, it seems like it’s been recently remodeled or built; so it’s very clean, well maintained. It’s a narrow building, so the hallways are pretty tight, rooms are generally small, just what you’d expect in any big city hotel especially NYC. We had a room on the very top floor (32nd Floor) but only had a view of another equally tall building next door. Bathrooms are roomy enough but have a small-ish sink, no counters, no bath tubs, shower stall only. One large closet and a small one. Other amenities: iron/ironing board, basic toiletries, small refrigerator, flat screen TV.Other things to note:Pretty good wi-fi/internet access.Business Center—a cramped space with two old PC’s and a printer.Fitness Center- in the basement, small space.Lobby- small, can get cramped especially when may guests are checking in/out. Dining Room/Free breakfast: room also gets crowded but pretty good quality and selection of food especially for being “free”. Good coffee!Bottom line, this is a good basic hotel in the middle of Manhattan. I can't say it's a great value cost-wise but average for the price point.

We booked a 3 day bus pass but once we had been on it once we were able to walk to the sites as the hotel was so central, if you like walking, like us save yourself some money and don't bother with the bus tours. Central park was only a 15 minute walk one way and Macys a 10 minute walk the other. The tours were ok if you want background information but we had more fun exploring ourselves.The hotel staff were so friendly that not only did they give my daughter an Easter gift but they even gave me one too! Hotel was spotless and this is coming from a clean freak.The breakfast was plentiful, you could eat as healthy or as naughty as you wanted, only downside was the breakfast area was on the small side but we only had to wait one morning for a table to become free. The gym was ample for a workout. Lifts....well lets say we waited and waited and found being on floor 14 a bit of a pain.

Firstly, the hotel is clean, the staf are very welcoming and the place feels modern and unpretentious. The whole building is quite narrow and sits right next to two other hotels on 39th Street (between 8th and 9th Avenues). There are only I think five or six rooms per floor, which makes it relatively quiet and does not have that stuffy feeling with alot of NYC hotels. The elevators were fast, but there was alot of waiting around at some of the busier times.I was traveling alone and had a king room with a view, although the view was a bit crappy really (could only see the top ten feet of the Empire State Building and a glimse of the Hudson River in the distance - I was on the 20th floor.). Although the room was much smaller than Hampton Inns found in many other areas of the country, they did make great use of the space available and I did not feel cramped in any way. The room was spotless, the water pressure was great (FYI no bath, just a nice shower). I have stayed in many hotels in NYC and this compares favourably to most. The majority of NYC hotels have small rooms, even at the top end, but this is no different in London, Paris etc. where space is at a huge premium. This hotel had a reasonably sized room whihc was perfect for one, would be OK for two, but not so sure for a larger family. The breakfast area in the morning was very busy, but I found a place to sit each time, no problem. The food was standard Hampton Inn, with a relatively good selection and was kept topped up throughout the service. The hotel was well located for me, being only a ten to fifteen minute walk to the Javits Center. It is also the same to Times Square proper and Penn Station. Overall a good location in the area of Hell's Kitchen.There is an excellent Irish pub one minute from the hotel (Tir Na Nog) which has great staff and good food.The staff were friendly throughout my stay and helped to arrange a private car to the airport for a reasonable rate and they also store luggage downstairs.Finally, and I cannot stress this enough, the free WiFi internet was excellent. This is a major problem across many hotels that offer the service for free with horrible connection speeds, but this hotel came up trumps - thank you!!!Overall, a very good stay and I would definately stay here again.","Toronto, Canada",91,4.0

This was on 24th floor and considering the views would prefer a quicker journey in lift or easy walk down the stairs and should I return would request lower level. Overall experience is pleasant one and would return to hotel.First thing first is need to know that blocks are not very big and only take couple of minutes. The hotel is located a block from Port Authority (where take bus to Woodbury Commons so not far to carry purchases) with a subway next to it and water taxi piers to the back. It is also a couple of blocks from Time Square and also all the shows. My husband and I walked to the overhead garden park A few blocks away, then made our way to downtown through Greenwich, Little Italy, Chinatown..tired at the end but worth it.The hotel is compact with 32 floors but only 5 or 6 rooms per floor. Rooms are not overly large mostly when trying to squeeze an ironing board in there But are clean and fresh. There are only 2 lifts used by guests and staff so depending on the time it can be long wait. There is complimentary breakfast which was plentiful for us but may not be if you are the type of person who expects buffet hot food variety as usually 1 egg dish (omelets or funny looking scrambled), bacon, sausages, oatmeal. There is juices, yoghurts, cereals, plenty varieties of bagels, bread, Croissants, Cup cakes, English muffins and you can make your own waffles. Once again breakfast area Is compact so gets cramped in serving area if people don't move out of the way whilst waiting for toaster or waffles and same goes for tables, Can be hard to find one if there at wrong time so some guests take tray back to room.There is 24 hour free coffee, Tea and hot chocolate with cookies in afternoon if you get there at right time. Staff are all friendly and accommodating HOWEVER I wish we had been told at start that there is free access to laundry room at hotel next door. Machine and dryers are free just need to buy powder.

The room has a wardrobe in which also resides a room safe, a chest of drawers, a desk and chair but it is a snug fit. The flat screen TV has all the necessary channels. The bed sheets were fine and so were the soft and hard pillows for each person. Nice! The bed is just so but the duvet was welcome on a chilly night in May. The furniture and carpet appeared to be in fine shape and very clean. The bathroom is small with a walk-in shower. The toiletries are standard issue Hampton Inn.

The room was lovely with an amazing view. The location is right near the E and C trains, which was incredibly convenient for getting around the city. We were within walking distance of many fun things. There were many breakfast items available, which was wonderful, and breakfast ran from 6-10 (I believe). This was very important given we had a 7am train to catch on our last day, and we still had time to grab some breakfast before we headed out.My only complaint was that the space for the breakfast (food in particular) was small and challenging to navigate with many people. The hotel posted signs letting you know that breakfast will be ""boisterous"" if you come late. We were not at the boisterous time but it still felt a bit too bustling in part because of the small space in which we were trying to get the food. Overall, this did not dampen our experience, and we would definitely stay here again!",,17,4.0

We loved our stay at Hampton Inn Times Square South! Pros:The STAFF! Everyone who worked there was always pleasant and helpful. Especially Chris and Brittany at the front desk who were honestly one of the highlights of our trip! It was great to come in after a day/evening of touring to see their smiling faces. We had a great time chatting with them and we were very sad to say goodbye to them. We hope we have the chance to run into them again one day!The rooms were great. Very comfortable beds and pillows.The free breakfast was nice. They had a variety of breakfast items each day and they also had hot items such as eggs and sausages which varied from day to day. We took turns going down in the morning and brought our food back up to out rooms. They had trays available to do this.We somehow forgot to bring deodorant with us, and when we asked Chris if there was anywhere near by that we could buy some he gave us a couple of travel sized Lady Speed Sticks they had behind the counter. Apparently they have almost anything you can possibly forget to bring available ""just in case"". Free wireless Internet!Free warm cookies in the early evening!The subway was close and convenient and we had no problems catching a cab out front either.Cons:The elevators of course. We only had a couple long waits though so it wasn't too bad. The rest of the time it was fine. (and we were there when the hotel was sold out)The shower really was tiny. It was the smallest shower stall I've ever been in and that includes cruise ships!The lack of black out curtains as someone else mentioned. I thought it was strange, I don't think I've ever stayed in a hotel that didn't have black out curtains. It wasn't the end of the world, but it is nice to sleep in on vacation. That's all I can think of for cons and none of those would keep me from coming back if/when we ever return to New York.As much as I like to try out different hotels when I return to cities I have already visited, I think I would have a hard time not returning to the Hampton Inn Times Square South!Please say hi to Chris and Brittany from ""The Canadians""!Karen & Carly","Winnipeg, Canada",14,5.0

Too many little concerns kept me from giving it the 4 or 5 stars Hampton usually deserves. The value is pretty good for a midtown location--though probably a bit downtown from where you'd like to be. Very close to the Port Authority station which means you can get almost anywhere you'd like pretty efficiently. Rooms are small--but hey, it's NYC, what do you expect? Beds are Hampton great. Here's what bothered me. Our TV didn't work until the fourth day of our five night stay. Now I honestly don't care that much about TV, and we wouldn't have watched it for more than a combined 30 minutes over the course of our trip, but the fact that I reported it as broken, not once, but twice before it was fixed suggests that this operation isn't really on the ball with customer service. Another thing that baffled me was the absence of blackout curtains in the room. Finally, though I had arranged airport transportation with the bellman on the night before our departure (I watched him dutifully write our reservation in his book) it was clear at 3:30 a.m. when we were to head out that no one had bothered to call for the driver.

Even though I got a great price I felt like my hotel stay could have been better. The staff was friendly and very helpful upon check in and most of the stay...they were definitely the highlight of my hotel stay. My main issue with the hotel was the very slow and busy two elevators. This had to be my worse experience ever when it comes to the amount of time we spent waiting for the elevator to arrive. Oh, and when the elevator finally arrive hopefully there was some space for us to get on it, otherwise we had to start the waiting process all over. A crossword puzzle would have been handy for the time spent waiting. My second issue was the shower. Who designed this? What for and why? If you are under 6 feet, no worries you will be fine. However, if you are taller, you have to duck under the shower doors before entering and exiting the shower. Oh and yes I hit my head on this major safety hazard and design flaw. I should have showered in a hardhat.The hotel was very clean and the room size was pretty standard for a hotel in New York City. The hotel offers an expanded hot breakfast that was good but most days it was so busy and tons of people in a small space we decided to eat out. The Wi-Fi worked very well and was free on multiple devices. The hotel is nice and brand new but I think the two major issues to me will keep me from returning.

It will be expensive and the rooms will be small. On my last visit I chose this hotel because I had business in the Times Square neighborhood (which is easily accessed from this location) and because I like the consistency of the experience I have at Hampton Inns around the country (and, of course, because I like my Hilton points). Also, although the room was, as expected, expensive, for Manhattan it was not overly so (I spent $270 - which, by the way, inflated to $312 by the time NYC and New York State took their tax bites). However, even expecting the room to be small I was surprised at just how small it was. I had a room with 2 double beds on the 11th floor. I could barely turn around in the room - literally! I can not imagine what it would have been like if 4 people had actually tried to fit in that room at one time. The bathroom was equally small with no counter space on which to put toiletries.

But, I was pleasantly surprised and in fact it's probably the nicest ""cheap"" hotel I've stayed in during my dozens of stays in New York. I'd definitely stay again if I'm traveling on a budget!LOCATION: The location is central, and walking distance to Penn Station, Port Authority, and Times Square. It's actually a few blocks from the mania of Times Square, which I prefer. There are plenty of delis and quick bites nearby, and it's easy to walk to your destinations or the subway. Though convenient, the neighborhood directly surrounding the hotel is definitely one of the more dirty, sleazy-looking parts of town I've been in, but I walked around in the evening alone without any problems so I guess it's not too bad!ROOMS: The rooms are no frills but still exceptional for a budget-friendly hotel. The standard room was definitely more spacious than some of the luxury or trendy hotels I've stayed in New York. It had a large, comfortable bed, clean sheets, plenty of closet space, and a desk. The bathroom seemed like it had been recently re-done, with marble and steel finishing and more than enough towels. The room was also exceptionally clean!SERVICE: From the moment I walked in the door, the service was friendly. I was provided with free wifi (because the room was booked by a Hilton HHonors member) and a bottle of water before bed. The housekeeping did a fine job, and I never saw them or heard them during my stay. The front desk staff was helpful with check out and getting me a taxi. The hotel also provides free breakfast, which seemed like a nice spread although I didn't have time to try it.OVERALL: While it wouldn't necessarily be my first-choice hotel, it's a great option if you're traveling for business or on a budget. I'd recommend it to friends who don't want to cram multiple people in a room, too.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",66,4.0

It's not that close to Times Square - adjacent to Hells Kitchen if you look on a map, between 8th/9th on W39th. However it's a reasonable location and some of the higher rooms have city views south and across the Hudson. We were on 31st floor and it was a fantastic view. Rooms small but normal for Manhattan. Accommodation is well equipped and the beds and pillows are comfy. Only the clumpy/lumpy duvet let it down - although they changed it, apparently they were all like that - so they need to get new ones.

I was sticker-shocked when I began researching hotels for our weekend get-away. I knew we wouldn't be spending lots of time in the room on such a quick trip, so I didn't want to put lots of money into a place to stay. I searched for a centrally-located, reasonably-priced hotel and came across this property. I usually find Hamptons to be good values and consistently clean with comfortable beds, hot breakfast, and good customer service. This Hampton was no exception. The rooms are by far the smallest I have ever seen in a Hampton, and if you have lots of luggage, you may have trouble stowing it in such a small space. Still, small is to be expected in Manhattan. The location wasn't quite as convenient to things as I thought it would be, but we still managed to walk to plenty of sights. A few times, we ended up cabbing it back to the hotel just because it was late, dark and freezing-cold. The side street this property is located on is nothing to write home about, but walk a block and you get to other streets that have restaurants, coffee shops, shopping. The bus station is just around the corner, but we took the subway to get to the destinations that were further away (Statue of Liberty; Chinatown). Overall, a decent value for a place to rest your head.","Dallas, Texas",14,4.0

I was very pleased with my stay and would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel room in Midtown New York.There are many pros about the hotel, first of which is the level of service. I found every hotel staff member I encountered to be genuinely warm, friendly, and helpful. Check in time is at 3 p.m. and I arrived a little after 9 am. I went to the hotel on the off-chance that they might have a room available. I have found that early check-in can be hit or miss with the Hampton Inn chain. Some are willing to let you check in if they have a room available and others stay strict to the check in time. There was a room available for me and the Front Desk person graciously let me check in. I was even more surprised and impressed that when I tried to tip the staff member for her kindness, she wouldn't accept it and insisted she was happy to do it. The location is great. You are essentially in the Fashion District and not more than 4 blocks to Times Square and the Theatre District in one direction and Madison Square Garden is about another 8 blocks in the opposite direction. You are one block from Port Authority Bus Terminal and have a plethora of subway options available to you. Additionally, as you are essentially right next to Times Square, there are a plethora of food options nearby.The hotel room itself can feel a little on the small side, but in comparison to most New York Hotels, the room is closer to a standard Hampton Inn room than not... meaning, it actually feels spacious compared to other hotel rooms in the area. The hotel is small and only has what seems to be about 4 - 5 rooms on each floor. This means that each room is near the elevator, which, if you are a light sleeper or sensitive to sound, you may have a difficult time with hearing the elevator running and chiming at all hours. Additionally, as you're in a pretty busy area, you can also hear street noise and while I was there, it sounded like construction was going on close by which seemed to provide constant noise at all hours. If you are sensitive to noise, I might also offer the following tip, request a room that is not on a floor with an ice machine. As I mentioned, the floors are small and the ice machines are loud. I was not on a floor with one, but I can't imagine it being very quiet. Also, I was in a room without a view, facing the back of the hotel. If you face street, I imagine that you'll get even more traffic noise. One other con about the hotel is the elevator. They only have two which seem to run very slowly. If possible, you might want to request a room on one of the lower floors so that you cam walk up to your room if necessary. With the number of guests and the number of floors, coupled with the fact that the staff and cleaning service also use those elevators, you might be waiting up to 10 minutes for one to even arrive to you. Breakfast is standard Hampton Inn fare. Breakfast is served between 6 - 10 am, but if you do not arrive before 830, it gets very crowded with limited seating and food running out quickly. The staff handling the food did their best, but often seemed slow to replenish the hot items (or more accurately, did not seem to be anticipating when food would run out and therefore it seemed did not prepare new trays of hot items until everything ran out). On a couple of days, I found empty trays and had to wait 10 minutes for it to be replaced. Overall, though this is a great hotel with a great staff in a very convenient location. The rates seem pretty fair and I think most people would be pleased with a stay here.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",5,4.0

What a great choice! Rooms were small but had everything: remodeled showers, super-comfy beds, ironing board, dryers, coffee pot, free wi-fi. The heating unit was very quiet, not like at some other, pricier hotels. Buffet breakfast was free and available until 10 a.m., and since there were four of us in two rooms, all with different wake-up hours, it really helped. We were able to stagger the breakfast without inconveniencing anyone. The business center (free) enabled me to leave my laptop at home (Amen). Free hot tea/coffee and warm cookies is great after a blustery day. The staff was helpful and friendly, the maids did not try to enter the rooms at 9 am, as has happened to us elsewhere in Manhattan. Floor very quiet and no noise from the street. And check-out time was 12 , not 11 am, so we were able to go out and shop much more leisurely before hitting the road the last day.

By that I mean working store fronts. Look like warehouses turned into stores. I guess it's a New York thing. If you are OK with that, no reason I would hesitate to stay here if you want to be near TS. One previous commenter said its rough after dark. I did not get the feeling it was dangerous, just people working. But then I'm not a late night person. For tourists, there are LOTS of tour buses, including the hop-on hop-off kind, loading up near by- just go to Broadway and head north for a block or two. If you can do subway, it's interesting for a short trip, like to Wall Street. Take the 2/3 train. ($2.50 per trip.) That's ""two three"". If not, a cab ride cost me $20 to go from 42nd & 7th to Wall Street & Broadway. For a great black car ride (more luxury than yellow cab, Lincoln Town Car or GMC Denali) call Julio's Limo Service.

Travelling on my own was not without its challenges as I have a disability that renders me 'no longer built for distance'. (I have a back problem & use a funky scooter to get me where I'm going.)Before I arrived, the staff at this hotel was already acquainted with me because of several phone calls & already extremely helpful in assisting me with questions about what I might encounter upon arrival. In particular, Sue Ellen was tremendous! I wanted to be certain it was wise to travel so soon post-Sandy. And, I'd read some reviews about the elevators & some past service troubles. I prefer a higher floor, but can't imagine anyone would wanna piggyback me up the stairs in case of an outage! We arranged for me to be on the 2nd floor. *Be prepared, that low down, on the side closest to 8th, your view is down into the happy, sunshiny faces of folks in the breakfast room!No worries, there are blackout curtains if you don't wanna spoil the surprise about what's for brekkie! Also, the hotel is skinny. All the rooms are 'near the elevator', you don't have to specially request one as I usually do. There are only 6 rooms on each floor. It's a newer hotel build in New York & the setup and rooms are much the same as others I've encountered. Rooms are small - if you are comparing them to a regular, suburban hotel room. But compared to similar, skinny, newer New York hotels, I actually found my room quite spacious. (I didn't need to fold up & put away my scooter as I did in my last NY hotel.) Yes, the shower IS small. But I'm a big girl & I figured out a way to shave my legs, so you've got nothing to complain about! And I'd already read about the elevators & the showers here before I booked the hotel. I didn't go in blind, so it makes no sense to me to mark the hotel down for something I was aware of. The breakfast room is pleasant & well lit. When I made it in for more than a rushed glass of orange juice, the food was really good! And afternoon cookies! I loved that this hotel had both breakfast and wi-fi included. That saved a lot. And when the plug for my iPad gave out, it was terrific to discover a port beside the TV, so I didn't need to get gouged on 8th st. buying a new one!Kelvin checked me into the hotel & he was terrific as my first friendly face. It was evening & I had a super early morning of fun planned, so he gave a great suggestion for dinner delivery & I had soup and a sandwich delivered from a local place for dinner. They had terrific shakes - real egg creams, black & whites, etc. Yum!My first calamity struck the next morning, when the belt on my scooter snapped in half! It's not a run-of-the mill part, but luckily it was Thursday & I was able to have something overnighted to the hotel. The front desk staff were amazing & all so concerned that I might not be able to have the holiday I'd imagined. Luckily, the next morning, Hatanachi was eager to give me the good news that the part had arrived & I could get back on my way. At some point while 'scooting' through, Sue Ellen put the voice & the scooter to the face and came over to introduce herself. This. Tiny things like this make all the difference in the world!Later on day 2 came the 'Super Calamity'. Evidently my belt breaking was only an appetizer! I was on my was to my evening activity & someone ahead of me was texting & walking. (Why is that a thing now?) She zigged in front of me & I couldn't zag fast enough to keep up with her change, so my front wheel hit a rut in the pavement & I literally flipped over my handlebars & smashed onto the pavement. Sitting stunned for a moment, I looked at my scooter & saw that the whole front wheel frame was twisted & bent. I figured my vacation was over at that point. Some awesome New Yorkers got me into a cab & sent me back to the hotel where Brito, the Bellman, was waiting. I don't know if he just saw my face getting out of the cab or if he saw the scooter when he lifted it out of the trunk, but the next thing I knew I was sitting in the lobby and he was working on it with all his might. He managed to use brute force (Brito force?) to twist it back into proper position and once I'd rested a bit, I was able to carry on that night. He literally saved my vacation! I don't know how to thank him. Those are but a few of the positive experiences I encountered with the staff at the hotel. Louis took my picture for me when I was all dressed up for the theatre. (Not being in the picture is the only bummer of solo travel!) I'd love to say personal things about the amazing housekeeping staff, but the truth is they were so unobtrusive, I never saw them! I've been fortunate enough in my life to have stayed at some very fine hotels, as well as my share of no-tell motels & everything in-between. But the level of service with this team was unmatched. There is a chemistry with this group that should be bottled & sold, for it is a very rare thing. Thank you so much for taking such good care of me! I hope to return in the New Year.I would highly recommend this hotel for the service.

Not really “Times Square, SOUTH” as they call it but about a 10-15min walk to “Times Square”. The location could get a little rough at night, as it’s surrounded by one or two strip clubs/peep shows. Overall the location isn’t too bad and didn’t form any part of our poor overall rating of this Hotel Rooms:Small! Even being in NY these rooms are small. Couldn’t even place two “check-in” bags on the floor. The shower/toilet combination is the smallest i have ever seen. That said, the shower size isn’t a problem unless you want to turn around at any point.We had requested a view as we were told they had rooms available with decent views of the city. We received a view of a brick wall/lane way.In our room there we no real curtains. The only window coverings were white lace and see through that in no way blocked out lights or sun. We did inquire with reception if there were any rooms in the Hotel that had block out curtains etc but were told no and then advised to hang up towels and use clothes hangers to try and block out the morning sun or night lights.On more than one occasion after a long day exploring the city (by the way is everything you imagine and more) my wife and i return to a room that has yet to be made up/cleaned. In fact, two days in a row we left the room at 8am and returned around 5pm with the room still been unattended to. We were then the ones who had to contact reception to request housekeeping service. Unacceptable! Twice!!Out side of the rooms you will find the Hotel lift. Take the stairs unless you are happy to wait... and wait... It’s 2012 how can these lifts be this slow.Once your lift arrives, take it down to the complementary breakfast area. Overall the breakfast isn’t too bad but the day we went for breakfast they had no bacon. Now not the end of the world but one would have thought that bacon is somewhat of a fundamental. Finally, the most disappointing element was that not one staff member took any responsibility for our experience. I’m sure the Hotel will most likely reply with some generic customer service response but i’m really not sure what they could say or do to right these wrongs. Not happy!!!",Perth,1,2.0

We had 100 high school students running around New York, and the hotel's staff played a pivotal role in making the trip such a resounding success. They had room keys at the ready when we arrived, were ready for the swarm, and never once seemed overwhelmed or annoyed. Every morning the staff treated us like we were truly a special group. I recall everyone, from the desk attendants to the bell desk, to the concierge, to the maids...all with a smile on their faces and truly interested in how our stay in New York was. If you are a large group, I recommend speaking with Julie Brach in the sales office, she is always so understanding and accommodating. Their unbelievable service and willingness to cooperate with large groups is the reason I absolutely insist on using their hotel for all of my trips. The rooms are pristine, with some of the most comfortable bedding you'll ever rest on. The showers are hot and run like a dream after a long day of corralling 100 high school students! The breakfast is ridiculous and such a great start to your day, and a welcome break (free) on the old wallet for a city that can be expensive at times. The wi-fi is a tremendous asset for someone who is working while there and a god send for the age group I work with! It's reliable and fast. The bottom line is that this hotel is incredibly affordable for it's location (skip the subway passes, odds are you won't need it) and the quality of the rooms, the little extras (cookies, wi-fi, breakfast), and most importantly...the wonderful smiles, gratitude, and genuine care you'll receive from their staff at both ends of your booking.

Location wise this hotel is great. Within a walking distance from all the major attractions in mid town Manhattan.

But...It might be ok if you are in a single bed room. We ordered and got a double queen room. I guess the room size is similar to the single bed room which makes it tiny for a double bed. This is just too small for 4 people (and at this point I must say I don't really care about NY room sizes. I want to get a decent that I can comfortably stay in). I understand Hampton's need to sell double bed rooms to families, but this room is just too small by any standard. One of the beds was 5-6 inches from the wall and the other bed was located 2 inches from the A/C. This poses an issue where the person that sleeps on that side of the bed can't get out of the bed in a normal way, there is just not enough room and when the A/C is working it is 2 inches away which makes you freeze. It is time to go to a central A/C system in these rooms if you want to maximize the space.The entire size of the room should be a bit bigger and we also didn't have the refrigerator and microwave which is standard at every other Hampton.The shower is also not that great. The water flow is just too weak.On the flip side the view from the 32nd street of the Empire State Building is great.Bottom line, with a few minor adjustments to rooms such as ours, this could be a great hotel.

I have to say I was disappointed with the size of the rooms but then if you want a good location in the heart of Manhattan then you would have to pay over the odds.The breakfast was included and it was very good, great choice of food, hot and cold. Tea and coffee available all day. The only thing is you do have to get down to breakfast early otherwise it gets very very busy and you end up having to wait for a table.Location - perfect. Only a 5 mins walk to Tims Square where you have access to all the other transport systems available to you. Port Authority Bus Terminal is only 5 minutes from the hotel, this is where we caught the bus to go to Woodbury Common - premium outlet store (1.5 hours away).

The hotel was faultless and the level of customer service was excellent. The location was perfect as it was around a 5 minute walk to Times Square. We had a king room on the 4th floor which was perfect as I had informed the hotel about my fear of heights. We had booked the king sized room as we wanted to make sure that we have enough room to unpack and for our shopping. The room was a perfect size for us to relax in after a busy day sightseeing. The breakfast was very good and there was a very good choice of food, cereal, fruit. yoghurts, omlettes, waffles, croissants, muffins, bagels etc. The hotel will also give you bottled water if you ask for this. My favourite touch must have been the warm cookies that the hotel have on their front desk once you've been out all day. You can also help yourselves to tea and coffee at all times. The concierge service was excellent and arranged our transfer to the airport as we were unsure what time were being collected. The hotel also arranged for our cases to be stored securely all day on our last day.In terms of sightseeing the Empire State building is a must. We only queued for about 5 minutes so dont be fooled by the tour guides outside who will try to sell you a ticket to queue jump. If you are going to Central Park then it's worth considering whether you do want to hire bikes as you are not allowed to cycle around most of the park and there are some hills. The boat hire for the lake is great fun and only costs 12 dollars for an hour with 20 dollar refundable deposit. We ate at L'Ecole (see separate review) pne evening which is the french culinary institute. We had the 3 course meal with matching wine which was only 66 dollars each. The food was incredible and we had a lovely evening. You would need to book a table beforehand. I would recommend the tour buses as they are good value for money and can be used as a means of transport. We paid 50 dollars for a 48 hour pass which included tours of the north and south, a night tour and a boat tour passed Statue of Liberty, The company also put on a free transfer back to Times Square.We would come back to this hotel without a shadow of a doubt.",Bristol,43,5.0

Bathroom was updated/modern, but had some problems with the shower fixture (the different shower head options didn't work, and when I tried adjusting the dial, the shower head fell off and had to be screwed back on). Continental breakfast had a nice selection of fruits, breads, hot food, yogurts, and cereals. Front desk staff were exceptional, and Jose was incredibly helpful with all our transportation needs! He arranged for transportation for our entire wedding party (which included some family/friends staying at neighboring hotels) from our hotel to Central Park for the ceremony. That was one less thing we had to worry about on our wedding day, and it made a world of difference (especially since we were ""out-of-towners"" and traveling with aging parents, one of whom had a physical disability).

Now I'll preface this review by saying I travel a lot ad stay at Hampton inn quite frequently and normally I'm very happy with the service and quality. Cleanliness - twice our room was not cleaned when we returned at 4 pm. Pnce they came back later and did it, the second time, even tho we aske them to return in an hr, we were my so lucky. Rooms - Don't get me started on room size!!! Perhaps my standards are not calibrated for NYC but this room was tiny even by London standards!!!!! There wasn't room for two people plus luggage in this room and the halls, corridors, elevators were no better!!!Maintenance - First thing we did upon checkin was try to take showers. Well after one the bathroom almost flooded because he shower wouldn't drain!!! Got that fixed, only to return the next day to the same problem!!! We also had he smoke alarm go off on our room, while I was showering!!! It took almost 30 mons to get someone to rescue or poor ears from the deafening alarm!!! Ad the elevators....all two of them, we're almost always running on just one due to maintenance, using them for cleaning, whatever!Location - if you eat times square, this is not quite it, but it's close, about 3 blocks away. And just one block from the subway and port authority, which is both very convenient, and annoying as rush hot subway traffic is awful going to the port authority! However, the alley this hotel is on is also shared w street vendor cart storage, so be prepared for the stench! And I also noted there was a police officer standing on guard on the corner every night....made me wonder why! Service - Finally, the front desk staff was great but beware f he concierge! One guy sent us to a subway to get to our football game, only to find out the subway didn't even go there!!! And another lady quoted us $50 over internet rates for off broadway theatre tickets!!!To summarize, this was an average Hampton Inn in a poor location.

Our immaculate and blissfully quiet room included all the superb amenities that Hampton Inns are known for including fabulously comfortable beds, wifi, use of an exercise room, and a high quality, abundant, and varied complimentary hot breakfast in the morning. Our concierge was attentive, informative, and hospitable--he took plenty of time with us to make sure we understood directions to sights, was eager to store our luggage when the need arose, and handed out freshly-baked cookies when he felt we needed a pick-me-up after a long day of trekking about the town. I can't say enough about the location--the hotel is located on W. 39th Street between 8th and 9th, is two blocks from Penn Station, and four blocks from Time Square and the main subway line 1. From our hotel, we could walk to our Broadway show in the evening and return to our room afterwards on a fully lit and seemingly safe street.

It was literally less than 5 minutes by the time we unloaded our bags and were standing by the elevator with our room keys. The hotel is typical for a NYC renovated studio apartment building gone hotel with only 2 elevators, very small rooms and small lobby, but we chose to stay at this hotel again because of the staff and the cleanliness of the the rooms. I can't say enough about the staff. They are very friendly and always hard working. I asked about the ingredients in one of the breakfast foods (due to a food allergy) and am usually greeted with the ""it's fine or I don't know"", but was pleasantly surprised when a staff member on her own initiative went online to locate the ingredient list from the distributor and handed me a printed sheet. Location was very good, traveled with young kids and the walk to Times Square and Rockefeller Ctr wasn't too bad, anything beyond that we cabbed it.

WRONG. My check in was over 30 minutes since one check in clerk was not at the desk. The line was to the door. The elevator situation, if both are working is an issue. When one was out of service (per the front desk clerk), it can take more than 20 minutes to get to/from your room. And I was lucky - my floor was a high one, so I could sqeeze in to get down to the lobby. The elevator stopped at almost every floor, and many unlucky guests couldnt fit on.

There are no chairs, benches or anything to sit on while you wait. And it is a looooong wait.

The entire room was clean and no dirt or signs of wear were showing.The breakfast was fully stocked, even during the rush periods. It is a little cramped, but there was a table always available.The only downside of this hotel was the elevators. The lobby is small (again expected in NYC in hotels like this) and often during rush periods (check-in, check-out), you would wait for the elevator for a while. Upon checking in, we waited about 8 minutes to get in the elevators. The elevators are not terribly slow, but there are only two and lots of people and thus there can easily be a wait. The hotel seemed to only have 6 rooms per floor with about 32 floors. (It's tall but narrow). This seemed to contribute to the elevator problems (had to stop at many floors).

At 4pm no room service yet. At 5 we asked for towels and finally at 530 had to go downstairs to get them ourselves.

There are pros and cons, but overall, I enjoyed my stay here, and would stay here again.Pros:- Convenient to a lot of subway stations, and you can walk to the Javits Center in under 10 minutes. I thought this was a great benefit as you know you can arrive there on time without having to deal with traffic. The Javits shuttle also stops right outside of the door, and it's the last stop before getting to the center (so you may have to stand, but it's nonstop from here to the Javits). This came in handy one day when it was pouring rain.- Decently sized room. I had a king bed room. Only crowded part was working at the desk, as the chair was wedged in between the bed and the desk. Bathroom is smaller than normal, with not a lot of space to put things around the sink, but I put up the ironing board as extra ""shelf"" space.- Breakfast is very plentiful, with a rotating cast of hot menu items (eggs, ham/sausage, etc.) along with some standards like hot oatmeal (not instant), really good muffins, fresh fruit- Friendly staff- Quiet - I was on the side facing away from street, and couldn't really hear any major noise, just maybe white noise from other air conditioning units.- Complimentary wi-fi and wired internet access that was of good speed, plus business center with printer in the lobby.- Coffee always available. I thought there would be fruit available outside of breakfast, but there wasn't. Also I only saw fresh baked cookies one day - chocolate chocolate chip Otis Spunkmeyer, even though it was mentioned in the letter I got as Gold (see below).- No upgrade as HHonors Gold because the hotel was fully booked, but got a water bottle and package of cookies plus a letter in a gift bag, even though I selected 250 points as my amenity.- Really comfortable bed - a Hampton Inn standard.Cons:- The wait for elevators can be really bad sometimes. The reviews here are true - there are 32 floors but only 6 rooms per floor, and only 2 elevators. I found wait times were worst in the afternoon after check-in time. In this case, having a lower floor might be better since you don't have to stop as many times go get to your floor.- The hot water in the shower seemed a bit lukewarm sometimes at night, but would turn up to full temp after 5 minutes or so.- No in-room safe- Natural light not so great when facing away from street (the building across the way, a virtually identical 4-pack hotel building like the 3-pack that the Hampton is in, is a good distance away, but there just isn't enough space for good natural light).",Cincinnati OH,32,4.0

There was a huge cup cake and a card relaying a Birthday wish for him so that was a lovely start to our holiday here. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the Hotel nice and clean and the rooms very comfortable. I think we could have slept 4 in our bed it was so big!! Breakfast is pretty good with quite a nice selection of hot & cold foods and drinks etc. As said in another review it is best to get to breakfast early, to avoid the crowds and get back in the lifts with no hold up. The paper cups and plates etc are not really a problem, although plastic knives & forks aren't so good but generally you just accept this. A glass each in the room would have been nice though as we do tend to have a drink before and after going out in the evenings. The location of the Hotel is brilliant. Between 8th and 9th it was central for everywhere. 9th Ave is good for finding restaurants etc, Times square and Broadway, beyond for Central Park, Grand Central, Rockerfellas, and Empire State were all within 20 mins or less to walk. We walked down to the river, and it wasn't too much longer. (The aircraft carrier museum is good to see there, much more than it looks from outside including a submarine visit and concorde too (at an extra cost)) It is very easy to take the underground downtown to the ferries and boats. Pier 17 is a good place to catch the hop on hop off tour which takes you up the river and back and you get a good look at the Statue of Liberty etc. Remember to ask for tickets to see the 9/11 memorial, you can get off and view the pools put up in memory of all that died. A very nice way to remember them. We didn't see any options for getting tickets at the site.Talking of ease. From the Airport, we took the air train from JFK terminal 8 (the train stops at all terminals) just 2 stops, and then took the long island train which took us to block 33/34. (Depending on where you come out!) We were staying at block 42 so just 10 - 15 mins, if that, easy walk and you are at your Hotel. We had thought about a transport bus, although reviews were not good with them, or getting the Hotel to arrange transport, but as it was SO easy and less expensive, we opted for the same going back. Considering it was rush hour when we did so, it was still remarkably good. There are helpful staff at the stations too if you come unstuck. If buying you tickets for the air train on your return from a machine, beware some of them only give a max $6 change. We needed 2 $5 dollar tickets and only had a $20 so it would have effectively cost us $14!! If there is a staff member there selling what appear to be tout tickets, as long as he has the official jacket on he is official. We got out tickets from him no problem. It only takes 25/30 mins to do the whole train journeys, the courtesy bus can take up to 1 1/2 hrs in traffic.Back to the Hotel, we would stay here again and recommend it to anyone. Don't forget to grab a cookie of the desk when you are checking in, they are cool.","Pulborough, United Kingdom",150,4.0

It's also very close to a subway to reach all areas of New York. It provides a good (free) breakfast, and the only reason I've given it 4 stars is because it uses awful paper cups, plates and plastic cutlery for breakfast.

It was a small room as expected in New York - really designed for one double or Queen bed but had 2 doubles crammed in however it makes a stay affordable for a family and we really only slept and rested there, The bathroom was a good size and had a spacious and good strong shower. The room was clean and the air con was good and not quiet. Towels were refreshed daily and beds made etc There were only 2 lifts in a 30 story building so at times there was a long wait and you had to make an effort to go down to breakfast early to have a more comfortable / calm meal.The location is great with Time Square itself a 5 minute walk and Rockefeller , Empire State, Grand Central Station all 15 to 20 mins walk. The area felt pretty safe although there was a homeless person on a nearby street shouting on our way there and one who had to be removed from hotel reception one day which the children saw whilst waiting in the lobby for us and found a bit upsetting. I guess that's the big city for you!Breakfast was complementary and there was a good selection of bread, muffins, bagels, croissants, cereals and hot food,. They also had 2 waffle makers which was fun (and one reason we booked!) The hot food changed daily though I don't rate the hot food in hotels generally as the egg is usually not fresh and being English we don't understand the biscuits and gravy thing! One day there was french toast which was quite nice and my son praised the cheese omelettes. The reception staff and bell boy were great - helpful and friendly. We were able to leave our passports in the safe and deposit our computer with the reception during the day. On our last day we had a while to wait before leaving for our flight and left our luggage with them while we had our last morning out. On our return they helped us get a taxi to our airport transport. We used the liberty airport express which you catch on 41st and would have walked (10 mins only) if all our bags had had wheels but one didn't and my husband had a knee injury so the bellboy got us a taxi.Overall a great stay - I would return and recommend to others.","Northampton, United Kingdom",18,4.0

The breakfast at Hampton Inn is better and has more variety than the one at Element. We did not have a problem finding seating as we had at the Element.

Do not stay at this hotel if you ever leave anything behind- it will be gone forever and they will tell you that there is no proof and that they are not responsible- I guess there is no honor code towards their customers and just like the street you might have a better chance recovering your items if left in a McDonalds than in their hotel...needless to say I will never stay there again.I recommend staying somewhere where they won't snatch up your things with impunity after you have spent hundreds/thousands of dollars staying there.","Boston, Massachusetts, United States",3,1.0

We weren't sure what to expect on our first trip to NYC, but we were pleasantly surprised with the Hampton Inn/South!! The lobby smelled SO CLEAN everytime we walked in, and the staff was VERY helpful. Everything in NYC is small, so that wasn't an issue. The rooms are small, but I think larger than a lot of NYC hotel rooms, and it wasn't a problem for us. Our room was clean, well-stocked, and the continental breakfast was perfect each morning.

We were given two double or queen beds. Room wasn't overly small by NY standards. We had room to walk around -- unless someone was sitting at the desk with the chair in the walkway -- then had to either move the chair or climb over the bed. Bathroom was very clean (and I'm fairly picky). Two teenage girls used the business center to watch a TV show, as well as to print out boarding pass. Front desk VERY sweet and accommodating. Front lobby staff / door men gave wonderful directions to subway for trip to Chelsea. We were a little concerned walking to the hotel late at night, but overall - no issues whatsoever. Very convenient little store either next door or within a door or two. The breakfast was great. It does get crowded, but we were able to find a table and we arrived close to closing time. One lady even commented to the staff that her little girls didn't really like what was left (since it was closing in 5 minutes), and within minutes the staff returned with donuts for the girls. VERY NICE since they weren't asked to accommodate the family - the lady did it on her own. We missed the cookies - so disappointed, as we could still smell them when we arrived later that evening. We brought back Pizza from John's Pizza nearby (great pizza!) and sat in their breakfast area to eat vs. taking to the room. Free tea, coffee, and hot chocolate available 24/7 in the breakfast area. We would definitely stay again - was a little far from the main area of Times Square, but fast walk and convenient to buses and subways. (We bought the week pass for the subway even though we were only there 4-5 days - pays for itself quickly with transfers.)","Houston, Texas",4,5.0

The hotel staff were very friendly and really helpful. I could not have asked for any more. Yes, the room was smaller than most rooms found elsewhere in the country, but it was kind of what I expected for NYC. No more than we stayed in the room, it worked for three of us. Six rooms per floor and ours was neat and clean. Breakfast was great, with lots of choices. The hotel is not in a high pedestrian area, but I never felt unsafe. Just a short walk to Broadway and Times Square. Not a bad walk to the Emipre State Building and Macy's either. There was some construction along the street outside, but there seemed no shortage of that anywhere in the city. I would stay there again if I ever get the chance to go back.","Burlington, North Carolina",10,5.0

My daugher and I were given a room on the 25h floor facing the wall of Candlewood Suites next door, but when I asked to change rooms to something with a city view, Ha ta nachi (sorry I massacred your name) and Jennifer at the front desk went out of their way to find us the room we wanted for the next night. The staff is exceptional, from the breakfast ladies, to the front desk folks, to the bellmen. Everyone went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Good breakfast, but come before 8 if you can, as the small space gets crowded quickly when the hotel is full. Rooms are cruise ship size, so be prepared or upgrade to a junior suite. You shouldn't be in your room too often, so it shouldn't be a problem. WIth more than 3 people in a room, however, it will be uncomfortably tight as there is no place to really sit other than the beds. Free internet worked quickly and flawlessly and was much appreciated. The business center was convenient and had a good working printer and two computers. This is a unique property in that it is 32 floors, very skinny, and positioned next to a Holiday Inn Express and a Candlewood Inn. You can use the laundry facilities at the Candlewood per management arrangements, and that was very convenient since we were staying a full 7 nights and could do a little laundry mid stay. The hotel is well-located within a short walk to Times Square, Macys, Empire State Building, the Circle Line pier and Intrepid Air and Sea Museum and a great neighborhood of cool ethnic restaurants, a weekend flea market, and other local haunts. Very clean and impeccably managed. We will stay here again.","Salem, Oregon",60,5.0

The hotel attendants were very kind, and made small talk with me when we met, on the elevator or in the lobby. The complementary breakfast also had really good quality, although the juice seemed to be a combination of water and juice, and was diluted, but the actual food and drink were diverse and tasty.

On the way out, the desk stopped us to ask where our car key was. This was very alarming, since we had given the key to the valet at check-in! My wife went a little crazy, but they assured us they would find it and we left for our evening out. Within 20 minutes they had called me and confirmed they did find the keys and all was okay. They also 100%'d us the room (no charge) since we were not happy with the valet and bell staff. It was nice to see the staff take action immediately.Overall the hotel was very good. Staff was very friendly and worked quickly to fix the small problems we had. The room was just right for our one night rest. Breakfast in the morning was good for a free meal and we had no problems with check-out. If I was back in that part of town for a couple or business trip, I would consider them again. But not for a family trip...On the walk back to the hotel that night, down 39th street from 8th, we passed the line for Hunkamania. It is an adult male dance show. While the club did not disturb our rest in any way, I did not like walking my 8yr old past it that night. So for family trips, I will likely go back to the hotels that are within Times Square.","Parsippany, New Jersey",54,3.0

I was first given a room with a cigarette or mildew odor. For fear that they might charge me a fine in case they suspected I smoked in the room, I left my bag on the bed and went to the front desk right away. The staff at the front desk told me they can move me, but then she whispered to me and asked me if I can do her a favor. My immediate response was of course. She then proceeded to ask me if I can ""tidy up"" the original room before moving to another room since she will be putting another guest in it!!!!!At first I thought okay, she did change my room after all. But now thinking about, I am disgusted and angry. First of all there were two staff members at the front desk, I am sure one of them could have gone to the room and ""tidy up"" themselves. Second and most important, I cannot believe that they gave it to someone else without checking cleansiness and other things (in the bathroom and around the bed area). I am now disgusted to think that at any time, because of laziness, any of these rooms were not checked and cleaned properly but rather left to the guests themselves to clean them. Additionally, I repeatedly asked for a room with a view. When I checked at around 1 pm, the front desk staff ( a different one) told me there will be one available 3 pm. I decided to leave and come back in order to get the desired room. Once I came back, I was told the room promised was not available. Around midnight, out of curiosity, I called the front desk to ask if there was one available and I was told there are a couple available and they have been available all day. Why the lies???

A duvet with the same stain in the same spot appeared two days in a row.3) The breakfast room was extremely cold, especially when staff kept opening the doors to go outside while guests were eating.4) We were over charged by nearly $400, but the staff fixed it after we showed them our online reservation printout.5) The rooms were tiny.6) The motel needs another elevator or some kind of express button.

Great location, close to Times Square. Pretty much close to everything. Hotel and room were clean. Stayed on the like 27th floor and got the ""City View"" room. View from the room was amazing. Only problem was the room was so small that you literally couldn't get to the window to see the view because the bed was right up against the window. I expected the room to be small because of the location and I was fine with that but I had to open the window and stick my head out to actually be able to view the skyline and Empire State building. Typical Hampton Inn breakfast. They did a good job keeping the dining area clean. Wasn't overcrowded like I thought it would be which was nice. My issue with this Hampton Inn was the service when I went to check in. There were two people at the desk waiting on one gentleman. I waited at the desk not knowing what the situation with this other gentleman was. Had no problem with that. Stood around a bit longer. Was never even acknowledged as being there or told they would be right with me. The guy at the desk kept talking to the other girl even after the gentleman they were helping left. I was the only one there left to check in. They both started doing other things and still didn't acknowledge I was standing there, they just kept talking and laughing with each other. Finally after standing there a while the guy asked for my name and told the girl to print my paperwork up. Good thing I checked the price because I guess they were so distracted that they gave me someone elses paperwork to sign with a room costing over $100 more than I was supposed to pay. When I made him aware he didn't really seem to care, just kind of nonchalantly told her it wasn't my paperwork , to which she didn't really seem to care either. No apologies for the wait or mistake and not very welcoming. I would have fully understood if it was chaotic and busy but I was the only one there! I am pretty big on customer service and this was the only thing I really found wrong with this Hampton Inn. It is unfortunate, since this is really unlike Hampton Inn.

In fact, I didn't encounter an unpleasant employee during my entire stay. The staff appears to work very well together and takes great pride in the property. My daughter was in the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade and we stopped in the lobby for coffee. The women who were working invited us in to the dining area to get a little breakfast before we left. They even went in the back to get the unopened boxes of muffins for us. It may sound like a little thing but it was 5:30 a.m., half an hour before they had to be ready to greet guests and they were cheerful and excited for us. The location of this hotel is fabulous. I was able to meet a few out-of-town visitors traveling into Port Authority (one block away), shop at Hell's Kitchen Flea Market (across one Ave), eat at a wonderful Italian Restaurant - Mercato- literally across the street.

The hotel staff was fantastic, especially Mimi Cooke. Even during this incredibly busy time, she was able to find us a double (I had misbooked a king) and put us in the room right next to my parents. She truly went above and beyond. We also loved the 4PM fresh baked cookies, the vast array of breakfast options, cleanliness of the hotel, and the great location in the city. I would have given a 5 for a value hotel had the rooms been bigger and had the elevators not been a nightmare. People were waiting 30 minutes at times to get the elevator and often ended up walking up or down 20+ flights. Didn't seem like there was a separate service elevator so with only 2 elevators and 150+ rooms, taking one elevator out for service was a killer for the guests.

Hampton is smack up against a Holiday Inn and a Candlewood so there's lots of travellers in the area. Location is great - there's plenty of restaurants in walking distance and you can walk to Javits Center in about 10 minutes. The front desk welcomed us and was very efficient without being impersonal - just what I like. Self-serve breakfast each morning is croweded, but well stocked and makes mornings that much easier. Warm cookies when you get back each day are a very nice touch and much appreciated. Concierge and front desk staff were EXCELLENT in communications on minor engineering jobs that needed attention. Couldn't have asked for more, even at a 5 star property.The one area that brought this back down to 'averge' was the housekeeping routine. Being NYC and how much a premium there is for space, there are only 2 elevators serving the 32 floors. With only 6 rooms per floor, this shouldn't be a problem - and most of the time it wasn't. The breakdown happened each day as the housekeeping staff would monopolize one of the elevators and keep it locked on floors as they did room checks (yes, I watched this happen). There is no reason staff that is only walking around with a clipboard cannot release an elevator when they have to step out (however briefly) to check on their staff. Even more infuriating was the fact that they would stop at multiple floors that are close together instead of taking stairs. And yes this happened while guests waited in the elevator and on various floors to use the elevator for it's intended purpose - getting out. I would wait 5-10 minutes on average while this was happening - very frustrating.","San Diego, California",7,3.0

Like all city bus stations, there are lots of sketchy people around at all hours. Definitely convenient for business trips, and it's super close to Times Square.

We were met with a smile and a second floor room that was probably one of the smallest Hampton Inn rooms I've ever seen. It was a bit cramped and not a lot of surface space to spread out in. However, the room was clean and the beds are very comfortable. The bathroom had very little counterspace was was also very clean. There was a shower stall and no tub.Breakfast was the usual Hampton Inn fare. Nothing special but there is hot food, make your own waffles and a selection of fresh fruit and pastries. As always coffee and tea are available all day and we even got a cookie on Friday afternoon. The breakfast staff are friendly and efficiently clear away garbage and clean the mess that people make.Front desk staff, and there were always a few around the lobby, were friendly and knowledgeable. They welcomed us every time we came in and when I came looking for some cardboard to prevent something I was taking home from bending, the young man behind the desk was very helpful. He emptied out a box and gave it to me. It was the perfect solution.Location was great if you arrived at the Port Authority. We flew in to Newark and took the Newark Airport Express bus to the Port Authority. It lets you off at 42nd and 8th. We walked 2 blocks to 39th and then half a block up 8th to find our hotel. Going back to Newark, the bus picks you up on 41st and 8th. Very convenient. Location for the rest of Times Square is ok but this hotel is on the southern edge of Times Square. Personally, I prefer the Hampton Inn Times Square North location but some will say that's the north fringe of Times Square. All in all, the location was not a problem. There is a LOT of construction occurring across the street but we were there on the weekend so it didn't seem to bother us very much. At night there's a strip club at the corner of 39th and 8th but it didn't feel unsafe. The hotel is next to a bunch of hotels. The Hells Kitchen Flea Market is up half a block at 9th on the weekends so if you enjoy flea markets, it's a nice stroll in morning.We'd stay here again.","Toronto, Ontario",20,4.0

The room was lovely & clean, not massive but big enough for the 2 of us, nice shower & bathroom area and very comfortable bed! Rooms very also inspected by housekeeping each day which we thought showed that staff were making sure standards were being met & each time we were asked if we were happy with the room.Yes, as other reviews will say there is construction work across from the hotel but this does not generally start til 8am and as you are going out and about in New York during the day by the time we got back it was either finished or finishing so it never bothered us and our room was opposite it! Street noise is also at a minimum due to how high up we were.Hotel is in a good location to times sq, port authority bus terminal and times sq subway Stn. Times sq is only 3 blocks & 1ave away and could be walked in just over 5 mins Full breakfast served everyday which is a bonus and saves you $ in terms of food bills....hot and cold options for all and nothing is too much trouble for breakfast girls who were polite and accommodating to our requests.

We took the bus to the city and were easily able to walk to the hotel from where we were dropped off. The hotel is right near Times Square and Hells Kitchen. On Sunday morning we ran to Central Park, which was a little bit over a mile north. There are several underground stops within walking distance. Basically, the hotel is in a great location. We walked everywhere except when we went to Brooklyn to visit friends. Lots of restaurants and fun shops around too.The property itself was average at best. We checked in at 2:30 and were told our room wasn't ready yet. Fine, since check in isn't until 3:00 officially. We left our luggage, and returned at 4:30, needing to shower and get ready for an early dinner before a broadway show. The room was still not ready. I thought this was unacceptable. It was about 10 more minutes until we were given our keys, but the room really should have been ready earlier, especially since we checked in at 2:30. Service was pleasant even though not overly competent.The room is tiny, it's the smallest hotel room I think I've been in! I live in a city so I understand space demands, and it's really not a big deal, but don't expect to fit an extra person in your room or have space to sprawl. There was a child sitting in the hallway for several hours playing video games, and I'm sure it's because there was not enough space for him and his parents in his room!There are only 2 small elevators in the hotel, and there does not appear to be a freight elevator. This is probably why our room wasn't ready; it takes forever to get from one floor to the next. Expect long waits and crowded conditions getting to and from your floor. We budgeted and extra 20 minutes to get our luggage out when we were checking out.Breakfast is standard for a Hampton Inn. The dining room, however, was very crowded, and we had to wait for a free table. Service again was above average, and when things ran out they were usually refilled quickly. Overall it's impressive for the limited space and amount of people passing through, but it's a bit frustrating for a traveller. I used the gym only to fill my water bottle. When I went it all the machines were in use. Again, it's a small space, so nothing fantastic.I might stay here again, there was nothing glaringly wrong with the property, just be preapred to be crowded and herded throughout your stay.

The staff was very friendly and helpful tho and I actually thought that there was plenty of room in the breakfast area. This hotel is in a great area where you can walk to everything and that means a lot to someone like me with walking issues. I would definitely go here again.,Jackson,16,4.0

Yes the room was small (probably not for NY standards) but it was adequate and the breakfasts were a bonus (I finally got around to working out how to make waffles on the second day). The business centre was very handy for catching up on work emails, and the afternoon snacks and 24 hour coffee were much appreciated. The staff were always pleasant and helpful.

The Westway Diner only a short walk away in Hells Kitchen at 614 Ninth Avenue, was really cheap with good food (voted best diner in Manhattan).

Breakfast turned out to be far better than we expected, with a selection of fruit juices, cereals, muffins, bagels, toast (self-service toaster), two different hot items daily, and a self service waffle-maker.

New York hotel rooms are notoriously a) expensive and b) small, however this hotel delivered pretty good value all round. The location is not perhaps the best...It's on the edge of Hells Kitchen and sits between 8th (the ironically named ""fashion ave"") and 9th and W39th is frankly shoddy, especially approaching from 8th (which most guests will do if coming on foot from the subway or Penn Stn)The rooms are decently kitted out and God bless Hampton Inns, there is free wifi!!! Take note other hotel chains! I had just one issue with my room - no closing drapes, which is interesting since I looked straight into another hotel room opposite. Other than that, the rooms are fine and newly decorated. The Fitness Room is perfectly adequate and in my three days I went every day and saw just one other person, more than three people in there and things may get a little too close for comfort. Don't get too excited by the buffet breakfast - it's simple fare but for a family who are budget conscious - it's perfectly fine! The hot selection was frankly, limited, but for the room cost, who cares?I found all staff very helpful and polite - which makes a pleasant change in NYC!My only gripe with this hotel is the elevators. The hotel is tall and (very) narrow - 5 rooms per floor and 32 floors. It's serviced by two small elevators. Luckily I was on the 5th floor and virtually every day I took the walk option after waiting 5 minutes for the lift. Not sure how I would have felt if I was on the 25th floor. On a similar vien, the reception space is very cramped and really no more than one person can wait in the space available for the lifts and for poor staff manouvering luggage etc, it must be a nightmare!All that said - there are many many worse and more expensive hotels in NYC.

Even when crowded, they didn't run out of food.The location was convenient to theater, times square and the mega bus busstop. The concierge was helpful with reservations and provided a nice map. We brought pizza back at the end of the day and ate in the breakfast area. Also, plenty of comfortable seats in the lobby, with newspapers and coffee while waiting for the rest of my family to rise. There are many choices when staying in NYC. I've stayed at Marriott Marquis and Crown Plaza (both much nicer but twice the price). For about the same price, I prefer the Best Western Hospitality Suites - but it's a different location, so really depends on what you are planning to do. The hampton inn is very convenient for theater and close to the mega bus busstop. True that elevator is slow and sheets are noisy. Bedspread is lumpy. I really didn't sleep well- but the rest of the family did. I wouldn't stay for a long trip, but for a convenient overnight at a great price, this was fine.",MD,39,3.0

Also the view is not amazing, unless perhaps if you get a room on the upper floors (32 floors total, ours was on the 12th).Breakfast was a mild shock though. The food itself was OK, but the use of disposable cups, plates and cutlery was totally incomprihensible to me and my wife. Maybe this is the ""American way"", but for a hotel that touts environmental values all over the place (big notice in elevator, ads on the paper cups themselves...) this is pretty ironic.

The picture shown in advertisement is accurate, however, the view directly across the street is total opposite. Upon arrival i was a little leary of the location. We booked the Hampton South because there was no availability for Hampton North. Once inside the hotel I was relieved. It was small, but clean. Staff was friendly. We checked in a little early and this was a big help as we arrived to the city a little early. We reserved a room with 2 double beds. The rooms are very small but clean. The restroom was especially small but again, clean. The hotel is recently renovated and upgraded to more modern flair. I was traveling with my husband and 2 small children and we have stayed in rooms with 2 double beds before but this room was very very small and i felt like we were cramped and on top of each other. The location is close to Times Square. We actually walked to the Minske theatre and I enjoyed the walk and exploring the different stores and being a part of the NY city night life. The best part about the hotel stay was the complimentary breakfast. I enjoyed the large selection of hot foods and muffins and cereals and make your own waffles and juice, etc. The food was good but I have to warn you to go early, before 8am. The breakfast is between 6 - 10am but after 8am it is very crowded. I am an early riser and I visited the food area early and enjoyed my breakfast and the quiet space. However, my husband and the kids slept till 8am and was very disappointed at the crowd when they went down. But overall, the complimentary breakfast was the best part of the stay. Overall, the hotel was okay. The new renovations help to erase the ugly view directly across the street and the one block walk to the main streets. I would stay here again ONLY if it is just myself and my husband. A little too small for the entire family. But a good clean hotel in NY city close to Times Square. Valet parking was more expensive than usual but convenient. Oh, the one thing that bothered my husband the most is the long long wait for the very slow elevators. I am more patient than my husband so it didnt bother me, but the wait is very long and the area to wait for the elevator is just a small small hallway leading to the food area. It was always congested in this area.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",21,3.0

They were an acceptable access point up until about the 15th floor. If I needed to go any higher, it was a long and tedious wait for the elevator. The rooms were alright. We had four people in one of the rooms, and were were somewhat cramped. The beds were alright, but the pillows are extremely soft, so if you need a firm pillow, I suggest bringing your own.

I didn't feel threatened, maybe just uncomfortable. These weren't right in front of hotel but on the corner down the street on the walk from the train station. I would recommend the hotel as the staff, cleanliness and location were great. It was the cheapest room for 2 adults and two children I could find near times square.

It's a tall skinny building, with about 5 rooms per floor. The staff was excellent, check in was quick. I had asked for a high floor, to get away from the street noise, and they gave me the top floor (32). It was indeed quiet, apart from the occasional siren that you'll find in any city. The room was a bit small, but reasonable for NYC standards, and it was clean. When I discovered there were only two elevators which the cleaning staff also needs to use, I was a bit concerned, but though some have noted the slow elevator, the wait was never notably longer than any other high rise hotel. I also had no trouble finding a table at breakfast around 8:30 am either morning. The free breakfast was the same as at any Hampton (self-made waffles, breads and pastries, fruit, cereal, coffee/tea/juice, a few hot items, etc.) I easily walked to Times Square and the Javits Center, so the location was great.There were only a few minor negatives for me. The hallway where the elevators are is narrow, connecting the small lobby to the dining area, which made it hard to get on and off the elevator when people were waiting (which they generally were). It was several blocks to the nearest sit-down restaurant, and the hotel (like all Hampton Inns) doesn't offer room service and only had snack machines on a few floors. The air conditioner, controlled by thermostat, blew a strong current of cold air clear across the room--though Hampton Inn beds are always comfortable, they only provide a sheet and duvet, which meant a choice from being too hot, or sleeping in a cold draft. Finally, there was no bottled water provided in the room (again, not unusual for a Hampton Inn), but they offered complimentary water at the front desk on request. I think this is a great hotel for business travellers or anyone in town for an event at the Javits. However, the rooms would probably prove a bit cramped for a family with kids.",Tennessee,159,4.0

Even the negative comments did not seem that bad and the follow-up posts from the hotel management seemed like they really cared about your stay. The hotel boosts a 100% satisfaction guarantee. While reading my post keep in mind that the customer is not always right.Go ahead and pull up any travel site and you can see that there are hundreds of hotels in the Times Square area to choose from. Hopefully you will find another hotel that cares about your stay and about there hotel reputation. The Manhattan/ Times Square South Hotel WAS NOT a pleasant experience for us. The staff had no clue how to treat guests or to find solutions to problems. Strive to provide exemplary pleasant service? Not during our stay. I made our reservation six weeks prior to our arrival with the Hilton 800 number reservation center. The next day I opened our confirmation email and found that our request for a room with two queen beds was not correct. The confirmation had us for a king bed. After noticing this error, I called back the Hilton reservation center to make the correction. Hilton sent me a new email confirmation with my request for a room with two queens. You would think that with a correction made you would be all set. Not in our case! During my conversation both times with Hilton, I wrote down all the information including the room type confirmation number and room rate.We arrived for our three night stay and upon check-in we had been given a room with a king bed. I then was told that that the hotel was sold out and there were only king rooms available. I told them that our reservation was for a room with two queens. The clerk said that they only had king rooms left and would I like the room or not. I was taken by this response and told the front desk clerk of the emails with Hilton the parent company of Hampton Inn’s. I went to show him my reservation from my Blackberry and he said that showing him would not matter that THERE system showed us having a king room and that THEY had upgraded us to a king room with a view. I never asked for an upgrade to a city view or a king room. He went on to tell me that I never made the correction to the room type with the hotel directly and that the Hilton 800 number reservation system is different from there system. This still makes no sense to me. The 800 call center must have control over the hotels inventory….With two adults and two kids a king was not going to work. The clerk said that other guests behind me in line are waiting to talk to him. Was I going to take the room? I asked for the manager. Anthony the manager told me the same story that I did not make the change with the hotel and they would not honor my request. My request for a room with a king was made well over six weeks prior to check in. I had the email with me electronically. Anthony the manager did spend over 20 minutes looking at his computer and then told me that the hotel had two other hotels run by them in the area and he was now going to see if they could accommodate us. I mentioned to him that we had two other families that have already checked in that we are traveling with. He asked if either of them would take our kids for the stay or change rooms with us. I’m still appalled with this question. We ended up settling with a king bed with the hotel providing a single blow up air mattress with the promises that we would be switched to a two queen room in the morning. We headed up to our room and started to settle in. A young hotel staff member knocked on the door and handed me a bag that contained an air mattress. I inquired if the bag had sheets and a pillow. He responded by asking if we needed sheets. What was he thinking? I then called the housekeeping and asked them to make up the blow up air mattress. Don’t be surprised during your stay if you call housekeeping and they tell you that it will be at least an hour and a half for them to come to service your room. That all three hotels are sold out and they are busy taking care of other guests. Wait a minute, I’m a guest too!The next morning getting ready to head out of the hotel around 8:00 am for the day, I stopped by the front desk to see if we should bring our bags down or should we leave them in the room. I different clerk checked our file and then stated that the hotel was sold out and nothing could be done to switch us. I made mention that the manager Anthony promised to move us and he even told us to bring our bags down or to leave them packed in our current room before heading out for the day. This clerk continued to tell us that the hotel was sold out and that nothing in our file indicated that we were going to be moved. I again told her that the manager told us that he was going to move us. She stated that if any changes for guests would be noted in the computer. Nothing was noted of our change and nothing was going to be done. I again told her of the promises. She said that she doubted that anything could be down that the hotel was actually overbooked. I told her forget it that we would stay in the current room and I would talk with the manager when we returned around 3pm. I also told her that I did not what to be room less for the entire day hoping that a room would become open for us. I was thinking that what if a room did not open and we would have be a whole day paying for a room that we could not use. Why continue paying for a room that you don’t have access to during the day. Upon are arrival back to the hotel we headed back to our room. The keys did not work. We went downstairs and the clerk from last night was there. I told him that our keys did not work. He told us that the manager changed our room and that our bags and belongings needed to be moved from our old room. I told him what happened this morning and that I told the morning clerk that we would stay and not to move our things. I made mention to him that the clerk this morning could not find any notes in our file of our room change. He said that it must have been in oversight. This clerk said that our unpacked bags had not been moved that the doorman would go up and help me move our things. I went up to the room with the doorman to move our bags. The doorman used his key to open the door. Opening the door on the other side was a women getting changed! Needless to say, the clerk had no clue that our belongings had been packed up by housekeeping and moved to the new room. This clerk just got done telling us that the hotel policy is only to move packed bags and not to move a room when the guest had not packed things up by themselves. Guess what? This same clerk found an email from the manager to the housekeeping staff from 8:30 am that the manager stated that he had called me and got my permission to move my unpacked belongings to a new room. Remember nothing in our file to move us. The manager never called me. And according to this clerk our belongings were still in the old room waiting for us to pack and move are things.The doorman accompanied me to our new room. Our bags had been packed and moved to the new room. We looked around and several $2.00 bottles of NYC bought water had not been packed and moved. The cord to my cell phone and a ¾ bottle of wine was missing. Also, my 12 year old son’s library book that was left on the room desk on top of the day’s newspaper was missing. I went downstairs and asked about the book and the cell phone cord. I was told that housekeeping would look into this for me. Again, an hour and half later there was a knock at the door and it was the housekeeping supervisor asking what was missing. I told her about the book and the electric cord. She said she would check with her staff and get back to me. I asked her who moved our things. She said she did not know that usually it was one member of her staff and that each room is inspected after it is made up by her or another supervisor to ensure quality standards. The items left in the room drawers and the bath room was thrown into plastic bags and moved to our new room. Our suitcase was closed and zippered up. We felt so violated with our things being touch by someone. I DID MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE WOULD STAY IN OUR CURRENT ROOM AND NOT TO MOVE US!We heard nothing at all from the hotel staff. I imagine the book and cord was thrown away when they cleaned the room. Just tell me that the items had been thrown away and we can move on. Telling me that the staff was going to look into this matter for us has us thinking that the hotel staff is out back searching in the garbage for our belongings.We went out and upon our return the clerk asked us how our new room was. This was the same clerk that told us that nothing was in the system in regards to our room change. I asked her if she remembered me telling her that we no longer wanted to be moved. She did remembered and told me that the manager took it upon himself to move us even after she told him that we wished to stay in our room. I asked her how the search was going for the book and cord. She looked puzzled and said that every time a guest is moved the supervisor from housekeeping and a housekeeper moves the guest’s items. This is not what the housekeeper supervisor told me.To end, I asked to speak to the manager on duty. I was told that he would call me when he returned to the front desk. No call ever came in. Upon check out I was asked by the same clerk who checked us in, told us that we have a new room and out stuff was still in the old room for us to move how our stay was. I asked if he could recall the problems we had. He said yes that the manager had left me several voice mails. I did not get one voice mail from him. I did get other voice mails but nothing from the hotel staff. Oh.. There was a note in the hotel computer to comp me one night stay. I would have settled for an apology.","Boston, Massachusetts",14,1.0

Pros: Excellent location. Walking distance to many attractions and public transport. Rooms are clean. Beds are very comfortable. Free breakfast and hot drinks throughout the day. For breakfast, there is always something hot, and they rotate the menu a bit, so that helps. The mainstays are bread, bagels, English muffins, make-your-own waffles, cereals, yogurts, and sometimes fresh fruit. There are freshly baked cookies (if you get there early enough) in the evening. Free wi-fi. Free access to business center with 2 computers and a printer.Cons: Rooms are tiny. It's hard to walk around the beds. We had 2 full beds, but I think the sheets used were twins because the fitted sheet kept popping up. No bath tubs. The elevators, like everyone mentioned, are SLOW, especially in the morning. The free breakfasts are only served from 6 am - 10 am, so there is a mad rush at 9 am. Definitely not enough seating for everyone. And the ""eggs"" are not from chickens, so use your imagination.

Found this Hampton Inn using Hilton points as handy to Madison Sq. Garden, where our bus came in and Times Square area. Located on 39th between 8th and 9th, it is in the middle of the Garment District. Several new, skinny hotels were built by one company and more are being constructed across the street. We were warmly welcomed on a snowy day with warm cookies and pleasant front desk. We dropped off our bags as we were early and headed out. Upon our return, retrieved bags and went to our double bed room on the front of the hotel. Small but nicely appointed room - closet near the window a bit tricky. OK for 2 overnight bags, but it is NYC. The bathroom was also small, but well done for the space and NEW, clean and functional. Not the greatest of towels, but ok. Comfortable beds without 25 pillows, which I appreciated. TV worked, coffeepot available. We were across from the vending machines, but no bother. However, our wakeup call came at the wrong time, several hours early, which was not appreciated. We approved of the 2 room breakfast rooms, with plenty of coffee with to go cups, fruits, juices, bagels, eggs (fabricated) and other foods. Happily, hot coffee and tea was available all day. Several tour groups appeared to be staying at the hotel. The two elevators worked without too much of a wait. Locationwise, it is handy to the Port Authority and Times Square. In hindsight, the other Hampton Inn up on 46th or so might have been handier, but it worked for us.","Glen Echo, Maryland",41,4.0

People that just leave ratings of 1 because of a bad experience don't really help any other travelers out so let me try to explain.The hotel itself is one of the tall skinny ones on w 39th. There are a lot of newer hotels like the Element popping up on this street which used to be nothing but fabric shops. Its close to everything, Penn Station, Times Square, Port Authority etc. The fact that its a Hampton Inn makes it affordable, adds the free Internet and Breakfast etc etc so no problems there. I booked it because at the time because the Hilton's had big conferences at them so the rates were too high.So onto my problem. I checked in and used the bathroom (just #1) and it didn't flush...clearly clogged from the previous guests. I called, they quickly sent someone with a plunger and he plunged, tested it and we moved on. I went out enjoyed NY and came back late at night. Sure enough first time I use the bathroom it clogs again. I call again and ask them to send someone, tell them its the second time that it happened, and ask if they can leave a plunger this time (obviously if it happened a 3rd time that would be a bigger problem, but at least having a plunger helps avoid some embarassment). A guy comes, we explain its the 2nd time and that it might need more than a plunge and he should leave a plunger, but he just plunges it, tests it and leaves. This left me uncomfortable but it was late and I just went to bed. Sure enough, I wake up the next morning, use the toilet and once again it clogs. At this point I figure its the 3rd call and either I'm going to do this the whole weekend or they'll tell me they'll give me a new room which probably won't be ready at 10 a.m. so either way I'm probably going to have to pack my bags, so I decide that if any of the other hotel rates had come down I'd check in. Sure enough the Hilton New York had dropped price so I walked downstairs, explained my story and checked out early. The people at the front desk were apologetic enough and allowed me to check out early with no extra fees or anything.I guess the point of my story is that its a nice hotel, much nicer for the price than most in the area and if I hadn't gotten a room with a clogging toilet it probably would've been great, but the fact that I couldn't get it resolved in 2 calls left me impatient for a 3rd. I also just want readers to be aware that someone had a plumbing issue in case they find themselves in the same situation. It could be a building problems, or it could just be a freak problem caused by whoever stayed in my particular room before me. Either way, its newer and a good location I just had a bad stay that I made a decision to cut short out of fear of it recurring my whole trip. When I come to NYC i'm extra impatient because my schedule is so full and I don't have time to deal with these types of issues multiple times. I probably didn't give the morning staff a chance to resolve the situation fully from what happened the night before, but at the same time I consider them listening and letting me check out early resolution enough, so I'd still say this hotel is something like a 4/5 for NYC assuming my problem wasn't something a lot of people have.","New York City, New York",8,4.0

I didn't try any of the hot options but was happy with the ""continental"" choices.

The location is great. Quick walk to Times Square and all that has to offer. The price is high, but it's New York, after all. $55/night to park. Free internet is nice.The room was tiny, but clean. Same for the bathroom. The food was the classic Hampton Inn food - rubber eggs and cheap sausage, but if you go for the bagels, yogurt, cereal, etc., it's fine.The biggest problem and why I rated this 3 out of 5 is that the hotel only has 2 elevators...and 30-something floors (6 rooms per floor). We were on the 27th floor and when lots of people are coming or going, it takes an inordinate amount of time to catch an elevator. And there is NO service elevator. So the poor working staff have to stand in the hallways with their cleaning equipment and garbage and wait for an empty or mostly empty car. This slows everything down too, as often they don't get on because they don't want to overcrowd the elevator car...so they let the doors close without getting on, push the button again...and stop the car again soon thereafter. You get the picture. And often there are bags of garbage just left in the halls outside the elevators. Ick. Probably not much Hampton can do about this, though.So, we decided to use the stairs (yes, from the 27th floor!). We went down to the first floor in Stairs A and found the stairway BLOCKED on the botoom floor! It was blocked with the cleaning staff's multiple carts. I wonder what would have happened if there had been a fire alarm? It's possible we could have pushed the carts away, but who knows? We climbed back up to the 2nd floor and went to stairs B, which were clear to the first floor. I did report this to management. I assume it was fixed, but again, who knows?So, the lack of enough elevators and the dangerous blocked stairway make me reticent to recommend this place. The staff was very nice. It was clean, but beware. I'll recommend it, but hesitantly.",Connecticut,64,3.0

The most notable thing was the bed. Most comfortable I have ever slept on. Found out Hampton Inn beds are specially made but can be ordered through the hotel. I am now saving up for one. I would stay there again just for the bed! Other comments regarding the slow elevator and cramped housekeeping work areas are true. Also have to go to other floors to get ice; but if you expect these things then you are okay, or can just not stay there if you prefer. Things I did not like: I understand small, but bathroom could use a shelf... bags of trash left in cramped hallways... and the breakfast eggs & the sausage, which both should be eliminated in my opinion. Eggs are powdered and tasteless, sausage is flat and unappetizing. Do it right or not at all. The breakfast coffee is WONDERFUL, however, and there were several selections. The rest of the breakfast is fine, with lots of variety (muffins, cereal, yogurt, fruit, bagels, and waffles.) There is a lot of seating although we seemed to go when everyone else did so had to search for a table.Staff was pleasant and professional and always were busy at work.

We arrived quite early in the day before check-in time so dropped our bags at the hotel so we could wander round the area and staff were more than happy to accomodate this - nothing was a problem for them. When we later got into our room we found it to be spotlessly clean and because the hotel is fairly new all furnishings looked modern and fresh. I also felt that there had been a lot of thought and effort put into the artwork choices as there were some fab pictures which I felt made the room seem a little less generic and bland than the usual chain hotel rooms. The bed was very spacious and comfortable and due to the fact that our room was at the back of the hotel there seemed to be absolutely no traffic noise which we both found to be quite amazing considering the decibel levels of honking horns and various sirens you can hear when you're outside. The hotel itself is on a fairly quiet part of W39th street anyway though so I'm sure even at the front noise level would be low. Room size was small but we were perfectly comfortable and I'm sure you would struggle to find anything bigger in a central NYC location. The free wireless was extremely useful also as it allowed us to check out restaurant reviews, opening times, directions etc on our laptop before heading out for the day. The bathroom was also clean and modern with a spacious shower with fairly decent water pressure and plenty of fresh towels which were replaced daily. The small footprint size of the hotel means that there are only six rooms per floor so there was very little noise from other guests going to and from their rooms and we heard nothing from the neighbouring rooms in terms of voices or TV noise. Breakfast in the morning was a huge bonus as we saved so much money by not having to eat out and there always seemed to be a generous selection with cereals, toast, fruit and a couple of choices of hot food, waffles etc. The complimentary tea/coffee provided in the lobby throughout the day was also a great extra as a quick cup was really appreciated after a busy day of sightseeing before heading out for dinner. The location was good, just a five minute walk to the nearest subway and a few extra minutes onwards to Times Square. W39th is in the heart of the garment district so most buildings along the street are fabric stores so at night it did look a tad rundown although we never felt uneasy. We did find the lift problem mentioned in other reviews a bit of a hassle as there was generally quite a long wait but as we were on the 6th floor, we could easily take the stairs - however if you were much higher I could see this becoming a problem. When we wanted to check out with our heavy bags we had to wait about 20 minutes for a lift empty enough to sqeeze in but there is nothing hotel staff can do about it so this is really a minor niggle. Overall we were extremely satisfyed with our stay in terms of value, cleanliness, service and most of all exceptional sleep quality and would absolutely recommend this hotel to others - hopefully we will be lucky enough to return ourselves!","Dundee, United Kingdom",11,5.0

This was definately it! All four of us were so pleased with everthing. First, absolutely everyone on staff was amazing! It was easily the friendliest bunch of hotel staff that I have ever seen. Various staff members were always asking if everything was Ok with our stay, and seemed to be concerned with our well-being. Second, the complimentary breakfast each morning was a welcome change to all of the takeout that we were eating, and a good alternative for people who want to get a quick start to their day. Third, the complimentary tea/coffee, cookies and lemonade were a wonderful refresher in the afternoon. Finally, the room itself was very modern, and very clean. Of course, it is a Manhattan hotel, so it was small, but this was certainly to be expected! It was a slightly crowded room for four adults, but, if we were staying in pairs, there would be more than enough space! Whenever we needed anything extra in the room, we called the front desk, and there was someone up within a few minutes to help us out with our requests.

Well situated in the Garment District. Convenient walk to Times Square attractions and most of the midtown touristy stuff.I've never stayed in a tri-branded hotel before. What you get here is a 32 story hotel split up into 3 different hotels, the Hampton, a Holiday Inn Express and a Candlewood Suites. Each segment has its own interior design and lobbies, breakfast rooms, etc. Brand new and fresh looking, but I think the building is a few years old. The cramming in of 3 hotels makes for some VERY compact spaces. The hotel room floors have only 6 rooms on each, which was weird as the entire floor felt smaller than my house, but cool in that our room was literally four steps away from the elevators, and going to the ice machine (with a water button!) was like running to the fridge from my living room when I'm home.Now, the room we had up on a mid-20s floor was ultra-compact. I measured it to be approx. 200 sq. ft. It felt quite small, but everything was there and in new-ish condition. Hampton added some nice touches like a bud vase with faux-flower in it on the desk, and TV with HD channels (which made watching the World Cup especially good). The bathroom was tight and useful vanity space was limited. There was only a shower unit in the room (fine by us) and it was decent, except for being quite narrow to the point that an average sized person WILL bang his/her elbow on the wall at least once during your shower.We had a good view of midtown south, featuring the Hudson River, NJ and the Empire State Building. I thought that was very cool. The staff was awesome. Super friendly and playful even...a young bunch of professionals that seem to really enjoy their jobs. It was fun interacting with them.Breakfast was good with a wide selection of quick foods.The title of my review....Not an inch of space is wasted here...can refer to an experience I had on the lower level of the hotel. The level below the lobby features a weight/exercise room, public unisex restroom and a couple of vending machines. That same tiny footprint of the hotel room floors comes into play here as this compact area also is home to the laundry facility, staff rooms and various other hotel functions. Waiting for the elevator to take me back up to the lobby, I shared the tight hallway with two large laundry carts, a housekeeping employee and maintenance worker moving back and forth around the carts, and although I'm not a claustrophobic person, I felt uncomfortable and in the way. The employees were friendly and had a smile, but I couldn't help thinking it is a pain in the butt for them to try to do their jobs literally inches from the general public spaces. Just seemed weirdly intrusive.Oh well, I guess that's life in New York.

That the hotel was pleasant, light and clean was a huge bonus.Breakfast was fairly standard, but a welcome addition nonetheless, and had a ""takeaway"" option. Free internet was handy. There is no business centre for printing stuff out, but you are allowed to pop into the hotel next door for that.We walked everywhere and found the walk to theatres and the zillions of nearby restaurants very easy. We also walked down to Chelsea which is quite nice, although takes a bit longer. Otherwise, the subway awaits to whisk you anywhere you like and is a short walk. No idea about parking, but you'd have to be barking mad to drive in NYC anyway.The room was smallish, but that was fully expected in such a good NYC location. It was very clean, modern and comfortable, no complaints at all in the two week stay.

There is a coffee/tea bar set up all day.However it is the little things that kept me from giving this hotel a very good. The hotel only has two elevators. It is ridiculous that in the morning hours when people are having breakfast/leaving housekeeping is using the elevators. Waits for the elevator could be quite long-I have no patience and chose to take the stairs most mornings. Even during the off hours you needed to wait for the elevator. When my colleague was leaving she waited 30 minutes for an empty elevator and in fear of missing her flight dragged her luggage down the stairs. Having used the stairs I was not impressed that I needed to step over housekeepings garbage bags in the stairwell.One of my biggest peeves with hotels are missing amenities that should be checked on by housekeeping. Do not leave me with 1/4 roll of toilet paper and an almost empty kleenex box-Not impressed to be using the bathroom only to realize there is no more tp. Also, replace my cups daily-there is a reason I am using them. I do not feel like walking downstairs to get more cups. The room had a coffee maker-but no glass container for the water to drip into. Once again, not as important as the tp-but when I wake up and want to make coffee/tea I expect to be able to. These are the little things that housekeeping should be checking on and replacing.My colleague and I extended our trip-she booked part of it and I booked the latter part. I contacted the hotel a month in advance to ensure we could stay in the same room. Likewise I confirmed this when I checked in. Shocking the night before the rsvp changed from hers to mine I was told we would have to move. To pack up a hotel room just to switch is quite annoying and more important time consuming.The concierge service is not that great-they gave me the wrong address for Bloomingdales and could not answer basic questions about popular events in NY.The public restroom is in the basement away from the breakfast nook.

I also give props to the bellmen and engineering staff, as they were super efficient and quick. As for the male desk agents, they were rude and I felt like everytime I asked them for something, they were doing me a favour instead. I did not feel like I was being treated as a guest. They seem to have some kind of attitude problem.There were two incidents where the maids forgot to tidy up our room propery. The first time, we had no bath towels. The second time, they didn't empty our trash! Our friends room across the hall had the same problem, except their trash wasn't emptied for almost 4 days! We literally had to move the trash bin from under the vanity mirror to the door so that they would see it. Be aware, the rooms are tiny. A room with two double beds can probably only accomodate 2 people at most. It's so tiny that the chair in the room can't even do a 360 turn. My friend and I couldn't even get our suitcases to fit inside the room! We had to move some furniture around just to get them to fit! If you are a family of 4 and booking a room with 2 double beds, please don't stay here, there's no room to move around comfortably. Please bring your own towels, as two of my friends broke out in rashes on their faces. We are sure it was something in the brand of detergent the hotel is using. Once we stopped using the towels, the rashes went away. The A/C also needed to be reset, it was on the entire night, we were literally freezing. Please go somewhere else for breakfast, my friend threw up after she ate the scrambled eggs (I believe they were powdered eggs?) and french toast. It's not really a hot breakfast, as the food is already frozen, and they just reheat it up. The french toast tasted like rubber. Ever since then, we have gone out for breakfast. New York has soo many places to eat, please try the endless deli's and cafe's instead, at least they cook their food on a stove.The hotel is also not sound proof, if your neighbour shuts the door, you can hear it slam shut. The elevator also has a ""ding ding"" noise everytime it arrives on your floor, but this sound does not shut off at night! All you hear is ""ding ding"" everytime someone arrives on your floor. I heard it at 1am, 2am 3am etc... bring earplugs! You have been warned! I always travel with the Hilton Brand, and this is by far the worst stay I have ever encountered, I was so glad to be out of there. Don't get me wrong, the Hilton Brand is great, I have stayed at other Hampton Inn's, Hilton's, Embassy Suites, Doubletree, and Homewood Suites, and always had great service, except for this one time.","Vancouver, Canada",4,2.0

When we asked for local restaurants they had a list of restaurants that we can have discounts by saying we're staying at Hamptons Inn. However, when we ordered the taxi back to the airport the concierge staff lied to us. He said that the taxi would be on meter and asked us to order a private car instead.

It, two blocks east of 8th, and is in the Fashion District.

The business center consists of three computer terminals and printers with good high-speed Internet connections. Also, free internet access in the room, though I didn't use it.

First, the rooms are small, though certainly comfortable. Second, while the overall location a few blocks from Times Square is fine and safe, the block the Hampton is on is not the most attractive street in NYC, what with few nice commercial establishments, trash bags stacked out in the streets (including one evening in front of the hotel), etc. Finally, no safes in the rooms.

There is a hotel boom in NYC for a while now, and you will find a better hotel with little effort.","Boston, Massachusetts",96,3.0

The area is not ""bad"" as other posters have stated. It's a city street no different than many other city streets. If you've never been on a street in a city such as New York it might seem daunting. But it's as safe as you make it safe. Be aware of your surroundings and know where you're going. People who look clueless or lost are targets. So even if you don't know where you're going - fake it. Attitude is everything. Remember, any place can be ""dangerous"" from the cleanest suburban neighborhood to the dirtiest city street. The hotel is situated between 8th and 9th Avenues (though is closer to 9th) and both avenues are fairly busy. You're only a few blocks from the theatre district which made the hotel perfect for me. While in town I took in a production of ""Bye Bye Birdie"" at the Henry Miller Theatre (on 43rd Street between Broadway & 6th Avenue). A very quick walk from my hotel. The staff was helpful and courteous and I have no complaints about them. Whenever I stay in a hotel I put the ""do not disturb"" sign on my door to keep out the hotel staff. I don't need my bed made every day and don't accumulate much trash during a short stay. While the Hilton Family of hotels is quite reputable I'm not sure the temptation to go through someone's belongings or swipe something would never occur to one of their employees. Temptation is always around. Especially when there's a laptop and an ipod in the room. So, I just have them stay out of my room. They can clean it once I'm gone. I highly recommend this hotel. Only six blocks up from Penn Station and a few blocks down from the theatre district. Not many taxis come down 39th Street but one can be easily hailed at either 8th or 9th Avenues (though if you're going uptown it's better to hail one on 8th). If you're uncomfortable with the thought of hailing a cab just ask the front desk for help. I never had to do this but I don't see why it would be a problem. The only time I used a cab was when I went to the Lincoln Center (in the 60's). I walked everywhere else. Walking can be a real treat because you never know who you'll see. During my stay I saw four Broadway actors just walking down the street - one of whom was Dustin Hoffman.",Eris0303,1,4.0

There were a couple minor concerns that I took up with management, but they were great in helping with them. All the staff we encountered was very friendly. The business center came in handy since I did not bring along my laptop. Yes, the rooms are smaller compared to a normal hotel, but for NYC I think they were a suitable size. We walked late at night and never felt unsafe in this location. In fact, we saw NYPD officers posted up on many streets, so safety was not a concern. Overall it was a great stay and I would recommend this hotel.","Virginia Beach, VA",10,4.0

The next day, we asked by chance, would they have a little microwave for our room so we could reheat some food that we had purchased? And after a few minutes, housekeeping showed up with one!

I requested a room on a high floor with a city view and upon arrival on 8/8/2009 I received a room on a high floor with no view. I tried to call downstairs and the phone in the room did not work. I went back downstairs to the lobby and requested a room with a view. I then received the room with a view (room 2706). I checked in and went out for the day. Upon my return at 11:30 PM that night I proceeded to take a shower and discovered that there was no hot water. I called downstairs to report the issue and was told to let the water run for 10 minutes. It ran for over 20 minutes and never got hot. I went downstairs to talk to the front desk and the desk clerk gave me another room (room 2606). I then requested a shower cap from the front desk and it took over 30 minutes for one to be brought to my room. I have always had a shower cap ready and waiting for me at all of my Hampton Inn stays no matter what city I’m in. On 8/9/2009 I bought 3 brownies from Chelsea Market in NY and brought them to my room. Two of them were individually wrapped and the other was not. I left my room at 7:30 AM on 8/10/2009 and did not return until 6:30 PM. Upon returning to my room I found that one of my brownies had been eaten by the cleaning staff. I reported the issue to the front desk and was told to talk to the manager the next day on 8/11/2009. So the next morning I tried to reach the manager and was unsuccessful as I was only able to talk to the front desk. The lady at the front desk offered a full free night which was applied to my bill. Although she offered the free night as a consolation to the incident this does not completely solve the issue. I am appalled and upset that I left something in my room only to return and it was not there when I got back. This is extremely unsettling to me. I know that it is just a brownie and may seem unimportant to the hotel staff but it scares and bothers me to know that I left something in my room and it was taken by the time I got back. Principals, morals and trust are very important to me and if I am staying at one of the Hampton Inn hotels then I don't expect to have anything stolen or taken from me. I also don't expect to have to change rooms two different times and I expect hot water and the room I requested ready for me upon arrival. Apparently the Hampton Inn/Manhattan Times Square South is a new hotel and they have already adapted to having thugs on their staff. The location was convenient and close to Times Square. As for space...well, its New York City so space is limited everywhere so no complaints there. As for the area, there are no safe places in NYC so you just have to be careful and watch your surroundings. The elevators were slow and annoying. Overall, the interior of the hotel is nice and 6 out of the 7 days I stayed there the room was clean. I did have one bad cleaning experience where I came back to my room to find the ice bucket had not been cleaned and the bathroom had not been thoroughly cleaned as well. Overall, I would recommend the hotel for convenience, location and a fun time, just don't expect hot water on the 27th floor and don't leave anything sitting out that you want to keep.","Dallas, Texas",39,3.0

It is new and are some things to be worked out. I had made reservations for two couples for three nights, somes nights using Hilton Points. This was very confusing for the desk staff and almost missed our prepaid day tour because of this. The elevators were a problem, because there were only two of them and when one of them was broken, is took a long time to get it. We had tickets for a show one night and decided that the only way that we could be sure of making the performance was to walk down fourteen fights of stairs. At least we were not on the 32nd floor. The rooms were so tight that you could not walk to the closet if someone was sitting at the desk.

Just the breakfast saves us considerable time and money. However, the Times Square South hotel has only been in operation for three weeks and it shows. ie:, there are only two elevators for all 32 floors (six rooms per floor), our shower head had been installed backwards. Further, the location does not lend itself for a family venue. One of our group, a fifteen year old female, was physically accosted by a fellow passer-by just outside the hotel ( and immediately rescued by an equally hostile mother). I'd recommend the Hampton Inn Times Square North location for those with families. We stayed there in April and all went very well.","Pittsford, New York",27,3.0
