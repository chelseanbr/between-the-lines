Michael (the manager) is fantastic. Very nice person and also makes excellent drinks. I would recommend this hotel if you like boutique hotels and somewhere where you won't feel like too much of a tourist.

That morning changed my life as that is where I met my husband, who religiously stayed at that hotel, also his favorite, every time he was in town from CA visiting a friend.I sat next to him and that was the moment my life changed. Fast forward two years later and we are married and continue to go back to the Highline Hotel, a favorite not only because of our story but it truly is a treasure and the best hotel in NY; the rooms are large, comfortable and beautifully decorated all unique with personality and very charming. The beds are so comfortable and the staff is wonderful, friendly and we tell anyone who is visiting NYC to go to that hotel, and if they are not spending the night they must go to experience the magical hidden garden in the back while sipping some intelligensea coffee or tea.We're lucky as we also got to know the manager who is hands down the best hotel manager I've connected with and that place is run so great--he also carries that warmth and kindness that you feel when you enter the front doors.I can['t sing enough praise for this place that is very special to me, and it will make your trip extra special to experience it.",,0,5.0

New York is known for its variety of options and trust me, there are plenty of better options than The High Line Hotel.To start, the hotel is deceiving. Because of its name and location, you are left with the impression that they are going to live up to the price tag they are asking. You would expect, for example, for the hotel to be clean at a minimum. You would also expect the hotel to be well managed and friendly. Unfortunately, they are neither clean nor accommodating. In fact, this is one of the strangest boutique hotel environments I've ever been in where everything just feels off from the smell to the vibe to the entire experience starting with even the check-in process. It was so bad that I ended up checking out of the hotel early even though I was charged a penalty fee.

I didn't feel claustrophobic or penned in the way I have in others. They have beautiful, eclectic furnishings and a gorgeous sense of design. The linens were spectacular, and the bed was crazy-comfortable. The entire place is really dog-friendly: treats in the lobby, a huge garden, and an onsite bar that has a ""yappy hour"" where you can order your dog a bowl of non-alcoholic ale! Plus, the coffee bar is stellar, and I met more ""real"" people and their doggies in one hour reading in the lobby than I ever have in all of my combined visits to The Big Apple.

It has such a wonderful, different feel, like an old friend’s home. The rooms are large, the beds are comfortable, and although there is no room service or food, there is an excellent espresso/coffee bar in the lobby. The service is friendly and warm. The hotel’s charm is in large part due to the shabby chic decor. But of late, the chic has been giving way to shabby, and it does need some work. The frayed stair carpet off the lobby is now in tatters so that you almost trip on it, and the oriental rug in our room was similar. The door to our room stuck so much that a Herculean effort was needed to push it open, and my wife couldn’t do it. A little sanding would easily solve the problem.

It was bizarrely uncomfortable physically and interpersonally. I arrived when a magic show (?) was getting out in the tiny lobby so it was essentially as busy as Times Square at rush hour. No one helped me get my bag inside and I had to wander around getting buttressed by the sea of magic show (??) attendees before someone realized I was trying to check in. At that point the bellman took my bag and had me sit on a couch, where I waited in a chaotic rush of people until someone who worked there finally arrived to check me in. She was distracted and not terribly nice, mainly concerned about telling me what the hotel does not have (food, room service: no; magic show: yes (???)). When I called down later to ask if they would let a delivery guy bring takeout to my room (a fair question, i thought, since the tiny elevator requires key-card access) the front desk snapped at me that they don't have room service. (Which, yes, I know, that is why I am ordering takeout to my hotel room after a 12 hour travel day at 10pm, thanks SO MUCH for your help). Which is a long of saying: frictive, claustrophobic atmosphere, where you are made to feel like a problem. Not a good vibe from a hotel that seems to mainly offer vibe as its primary amenity.During the daytime the lobby turns into an Intelligentsia, and since it is tiny, it is just as rammed as when the magic show (????) is happening, plus full of dogs, one of which I tripped over trying to get up to my room. The front patio was closed for some reason, the back patio is tiny, the bar closes at 1030, there is no restaurant aside from the coffee shop. Our room was fine, deliberately shabby, kind of like if you stayed at the clean, bland guest room in your rich friend's parent's pied-a-terre, except they would at least have a kitchen and their living room would not be filled with dogs and a magic show (?????)If this hotel were not charging $500 a night I would be more tolerant of its ""quirks"" but it is actively unpleasant getting in and out of, there is no lobbyish space to unwind, and they could be a lot more charming or at least less confrontational about offering zero percent of the basics i could get with a smile at the denver airport courtyard marriott. but i hear the magic show (???????) is just great.","Los Angeles, California",37,2.0

Beautifully appointed with things from years ago. Black dial phone, king bed, oriental rugs and a fabulous huge bathroom that had been updated for modern times. We loved the place and were greeted by the friendly Rose who mans the check-in desk.

The hotel is in a repurposed religious seminary, occupying a magnificant old building. Our room was quite large by NYC standards, and featured a view of the quiet courtyard at the rear of the building. Everything is done in dark wood tones, especially the lobby, which is luxurious, warm and welcoming. The hotel lobby, and its espresso bar, appear to be a meeting point for the community (and their dogs!). It helped us feel like we were part of the community and not just tourists passing through. We found the hotel to be well situated near the High Line itself (well, obviously!), as well as Chelsea and the Meat Packing district. We walked down into the West Village quite easily. We are in NYC quite often, and we are always looking for hotels that are away from the traditional tourist areas. This fits the bill.We went in the winter, so we couldn't take advantage of their bicycle rental, but I definitely will take one out on the west side bike trail next time we are there in better weather. One heads up: there are short flights of stairs that join the various wings of the old building, so I would think that you should let them know ahead of time if you need an accessible room.

We treated another couple so we got to experience two rooms. I cannot overstate how delighted we were with every aspect of the hotel. First, the rooms were larger than expected and especially compared to usual boutique NY hotels that are less than $500 a night. Both the king room and queen rooms had a walk in closet and plenty of room to move around. Another amazing thing for an old quirky building: silence. We were on the 4th floor over a semi busy road and never heard traffic or even sirens. Lovely bath with good shower/water pressure. And (see other reviews) we had zero issues with HVAC. Next, the vibe. The coffee shop which turns into a bar at 6pm is happy and a mix of residents and locals and lots of dogs. We were there on a cold winter weekend, so it was a tad chilly, but it was warm in spirit. If you come in the summer (we have been for drinks) there is lovely outdoor space, all ok for dogs. The bartender gave us good ideas of where to go for an early breakfast, and the person doing the check-in/out was just warm and friendly. My husband said this is so not a “corporate” hotel!
